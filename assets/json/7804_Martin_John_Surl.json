  "https_policecommissioner_net_/https_policecommissioner_net_lydney-the-full-story-behind-the-re-opening/content_220.html": "The true story of how Lydney Police Station lived to fight another day – Beware of imitations!\nBack in 2012, when I was still to announce my intention to stand as the Police & Crime Commissioner a friend a called me and said, ‘You won’t believe it, they’re going to close all the police stations in the Forest’. The announcement came from the Police Authority Chair Cllr Rob Garnham.\nControversially he said it was ‘unfair to consult the public because the authority had little choice on the matter’ , which bearing in mind the key purpose of creating Police & Crime Commissioners was to give a voice to the public, this was a bizarre statement to make.\nThe closures were blamed on the Government cuts which had to be managed, but even in a crisis you still have choices and I was firmly of the opinion that Cllr Garnham was making the wrong choices.\nI swiftly wrote to the authority and asked them to defer the decision until after the election, but they refused. I wrote again asking them not to remove the IT connectivity until after the election, but again they refused, even though they were aware I had made it a manifesto commitment to retain Coleford Police Station and create a ‘Forest of Dean Policing Hub’. I assume, because of other pressures, they didn’t manage to deliver the closures before I took office in November 2012 but they did manage to rip out the IT from Cinderford. Perhaps they assumed an Independent wouldn’t win the election.\nLater in 2012, when I did become Commissioner, I duly kept my promise to retain Coleford Police Station. In 2015, I purchased the adjacent disused Magistrates Court and in 2016 the expanded Forest of Dean Police Station was opened by the then High Sherriff of Gloucestershire, Countess Sara Bathurst.\nDisagreement\nA story not previously told was the battle I had had with the previous chief constable about doubling the size of Coleford Police Station to create ‘The Forest of Dean Policing Hub. The then chief was sceptical, but I reminded her it was a manifesto commitment and therefore had to be delivered and we then came to an agreement.\nTough times\nIn 2015, austerity was at its most damaging. Gloucestershire Police had lost 250 officers, 77 staff and 32 PCSOs; funding had been cut by £32 million and we were told by the Home Office to prepare for yet more cuts. It was against that background that Lydney Police Station was finally vacated and a recommendation from the Chief Constable it be sold was received. I supported the Chief Constable, because by then she just didn’t have the officers and staff to operate police stations in Lydney – or for that matter Cinderford – but I refused to sell the building.\nPolice & Crime Commissioners own all police buildings. It is they who have the ultimate say whether a building is sold or kept; conversely it is the Chief Constable who employs the officers and staff and who decides where they are stationed. Therefore, a good professional relationship between the two is important.\nDiffering views\nWhilst it’s unlikely the views of Commissioners and Chief Constables will always fully align (and neither would that be healthy) I’ve always enjoyed a strong professional relationship and respect for successive chiefs on my watch.\nIt was my decision not to sell Lydney because I strongly believed that once sold, the building would never return. As a result, it was mothballed in 2015 and all offers to purchase were declined.\nThe status of the mothballed Lydney Police Station was reviewed regularly and in October, following the announcement by the Home Office setting a recruitment target of 20.000 new officers the Chief Constable and I commissioned a report which lead to an outline and then full business case in March that recommended its reopening.\nWho will be based at Lydney\nThe Chief Constable has indicated he will return up to 20 constables, two sergeants and some investigative resources to Lydney. That’s his choice and I think a very good decision.\nThe truth will prevail\nTo an opponent of mine in the next PCC election who firstly accuses me of electioneering and then claims the credit for the decision to reopen Lydney Police Station, I say nothing, except to remind him its closure, along with Newent, Cinderford and many others, was the decision of the person who in 2020 proposed him to stand against me in the next election. Cllr Rob Garnham, who in 2012 said, “it was unfair to consult the public because the authority had little choice on the matter”.\nThe creation of the Forest of Dean Police Station in 2016 and the re-opening of Lydney in 2020 proves they had a choice – they just made the wrong one.",
  "https_policecommissioner_net_/https_policecommissioner_net_why-i-back-watchdogs-call-for-sharper-focus-on-roads-policing/content_176.html": "Road safety for me remains one of my key priorities as Gloucestershire\\’s Police & Crime Commissioner.\nBut a report out this week by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) has said that roads policing in England and Wales has become less important.\nHM Inspector of Constabulary Matt Parr said:\n“Our inspection suggests that roads policing, despite the number of road deaths plateauing and likely to increase, is seen as less of a priority than it should be.\nThe report was critical of some of my PCC colleagues who don\\’t include road safety in their police and crime plans or make little reference, that is despite the high number of people still killed on the country’s roads each year.\nSafe & Social Driving a priority since 2012\nSince becoming Gloucestershire\\’s first PCC in 2012, I have made ‘Safe and Social Driving’ an integral part of my policing plan.\n“I can understand why cuts in spending may have influenced others but road safety has always been a priority for me. I think I was the first PCC to make it so and may have been the only one for quite a long time because I believe that people should be able to move around our communities in safety and with as much ease and convenience as possible.\nTaking back control\nIn the last few years, one of the biggest things to impact on the forces ability to deliver a better localised roads policing services was the taking back of control of local roads policing by withdrawing from the Tri-Force agreement with neighbouring Wiltshire and Avon and Somerset Police. This has enabled the Chief Constable to focus more on local concerns.\nExamples of this include, the award winning Operation Indemnis which centred on the A417/419, was a big success. It’s resulted in fewer fatal or life changing collisions; it lead to hundreds of motorists being stopped for speeding, using mobile phones while driving tailgating and other motoring offences and many more received help from the police when they broke down – so it wasn’t just about enforcement.\nIts not just about enforcement\nEducation programmes run by my office in partnership with the Fire and Rescue Service are also helping to prepare new and novice drivers and my next Police and Crime Plan will include measures to help those with more experience who might be anxious about returning to the roads after lockdown.\nI’m pleased to say that all of this is in accordance with what the HMICFRS is recommending for other parts of the country”.\nWhat\\’s next\nI welcome the report out this week as it reinforces my belief that road safety should remain a key priority.\nOver the next few months as the county and country looks to recover from the Covid19 pandemic I will continue to champion road safety.\nMy office is currently working to refresh my Police and Crime Plan to take into account the impact of coronavirus and also the issues raised from the events in the United States with the death of George Floyd.\nAs part of that work , plans are being developed to introduce a new range of measures and commitments that will include placing a greater emphasis on local traffic ‘hotspots’ and this be revealed towards the autumn.",
  "https_policecommissioner_net_/https_policecommissioner_net_why-im-voting-for-martin-surl-by-roger-head-former-high-sheriff/content_76.html": "Elections might not be as eagerly awaited as buses but, as the saying goes, you wait for one and several come along at once. It’s not surprising that the EU referendum is dominating the news agenda, and that’s why I want to highlight another election that is very important to Gloucestershire but is in danger of being overshadowed.\nOn May 5, when some of us will be able to vote for our local councillors, we will all be asked to vote for our Police and Crime Commissioner. It’s possible the majority of people still don’t know about the PCC and the significant role he plays in the life of Gloucestershire. I say ‘he’ because Martin Surl became the county’s first elected commissioner in 2012 and he is being challenged by two other male candidates next month.\nDuring my year as High Sheriff, our paths crossed many times when I saw his work first hand and that is why I feel qualified to endorse Mr. Surl as the best candidate. There are many reasons for this.\nBeing ‘the first’ in anything is difficult but he has established the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner as a credible driving force for good within the county. He has successfully integrated local volunteers and communities into an overall strategy for preventing and reducing crime and anti-social behaviour – work, incidentally, that is much admired by many other PCCs – and any parent with a child who is about to learn to drive should be grateful for the huge investment made in safer driving programmes aimed at young people who are statistically the most vulnerable of our road users.\nAll of this has been quite apart from his core responsibilities of managing the police budget, holding the chief constable to account, overseeing the biggest re-organisation of Gloucestershire police in 40 years and re-designing the police estate and saving local taxpayers many millions of pounds into the bargain.\nMaybe I should declare an interest here as I also agree with Mr. Surl that the Police and Crime Commissioner should not be a party politician. As the Prime Minister said when the post was created, politics should not come into it, we want the best man for the job.\nRoger Head OBE",

  "https_policecommissioner_net_/https_policecommissioner_net_we-must-block-crimes-revolving-door/content_164.html": "There is a reason Martin is not just the Police Commissioner but the Police and Crime Commissioner. As well as overseeing the Constabulary, setting the budget and general strategy, which we call the police and crime plan, his role encompasses everything to do with crime and the criminal justice system.\nThe Coalition Government, which created the role, and the now PM made PCCs responsible for reducing crime in their area. A crucial element, and one proving most difficult to reverse, is the rate of reoffending which remains unacceptably high. It’s as if prisons have a revolving door through which the same offenders come and go indulging in past habits, bringing chaos to our communities.\nThat was brought home to me recently in Bourton on the Water where locals told me over a pint that crime in the town was up again because a certain ‘well-known’ local miscreant was out of prison and targeting sheds.\nIn my view, the background to this can be found in 2015 when the Government privatised parts of the probation service. Since then, high level offenders have been dealt with by the National Probation Service; locally, offenders including burglars and car thieves who are defined as medium to low risk became the responsibility of the private sector. As a result, the Gloucestershire Probation Service, which was very successful at re-integrating offenders, was replaced by a company called Working Links.\nWell, the birds well and truly came home to roost recently when a report from HM Inspectorate of Probation not only damned services nationwide but also picked-out Gloucestershire as one of the many areas with serious failings with almost half of those supported by Working Links re-offending.\nAs PCC, Martin has no oversight of Working Links, nor was he involved in commissioning them so how can he be held accountable for crime rates when he has no input into the organisation responsible for some of our most prolific offenders?\nCould a U-turn now be afoot?\nSince it’s widely accepted the 2015 reforms have been an unmitigated disaster, it is no surprise that some companies like Working Links are having their contracts terminated two years earlier than planned.\nAlready, Martin commissions and funds services that work with ex-offenders. It would be nice if what we have learned in Gloucestershire is used to create a service that didn’t need repairing in the first place because it wasn’t broke!\nThankfully Martin’s office is working with the Ministry of Justice to see if we can play a part in any new probation regime.\nFor more on the national context here’s a good article:",

Something that will make drivers think again about using our roads as race tracks.\n“They forget, or perhaps they don’t know, that the roads they know best and take for granted are the most dangerous. Around 60% of fatal and serious collisions happen on rural roads and 34% or urban roads.\n“I see this as a very positive step towards reducing speeds on neighbourhood roads that have fallen through the net up to now and will help to make them safer for all users”.\nInvestment in kit\nTo police the sites, the Constabulary now has four vans fitted with long lens cameras which have an approximate range of 990 metres.\nWhen the first was launched in 2018, it was dubbed ‘the long eye of the law’.\nNow it has a new weapon to go alongside called ‘Trucam 2’, a new generation of handheld camera, which provides similar quality pictures to its long-sighted forerunner.\nThe new generation of handheld camera is a further leap in technology as it can detect what’s going on inside the vehicle.\nThis will enable officers to police the ‘fatal 4’ relating to seatbelts, mobile phone use, tailgating and excessive speed.\nSpeeding traffic is a blight on many of our communities, especially in rural areas where you might come across an unexpected cyclist, walker and horse rider.\nMany of the new locations were raised by parish councils and other local groups and I hope this will encourage others to come forward and tell us the roads they are most concerned about.\nWe will carry out a roadside survey and if the anecdotal evidence stands-up, we can add them to the list.\nDrivers need to know they will no longer be able to speed on our roads with impunity and get away with it.\nSafe & Social Roads\nMaking Gloucestershire’s road more ‘Safe and social’ – encouraging all road users to be more aware and considerate towards one another – has always been one of the PCC’s Police and Crime Plan priorities.\nIn a recent national report it was suggested PCCs & police forces have pulled back from road safety as a priority, can I assure you this has never been the case in Gloucestershire.\nWe have a great priority lead in Nigel Lloyd-Jones who comes from the automative industry, but knows only too well the human cost of dangerous driving.\nA plan for the future\nOver the coming months more will be outlined in terms of our plans for road safety, a survey from our parish and town councils will be published… so stay tuned.",

Speeds of up to 122 mph have been recorded on the Gloucestershire stretch of the M5.\nSpeeding\nSpeeding and antisocial driving is unacceptable at any time, but when the roads are free of traffic, some people seem to think it’s all right to put their foot down. In the last couple of days for example, we have high speeds of 108 & 104 both of which will be appearing at court in due course.\nWhilst the Constabulary is deployed on other aspects of the pandemic, enforcement continues with the aim of catching these idiots. The police would be rightly criticised if they did not provide a level of deterrent, especially at these extremes.\nThe emergency services are concentrating their efforts on managing the spread of Covid-19, so it’s crucial that we don’t add to their workload through careless and reckless driving.\nI urge road users to consider the strain being put on the NHS during these unprecedented times and to drive\nconsiderately.\nRoad Safety does still remain one of my priorities\nSafe and social driving, aims to reduce offending and anti-social driving in Gloucestershire, has always been one of my policing priorities since being elected in 2012.\nBut now I\\’m also backing a new national campaign by Road Safety GB, which stresses the importance of taking extra care when making essential journeys.\nTo reduce the number of road casualties during these unprecedented times, the ‘Take Extra Care’ campaign urges all road users to only travel when absolutely essential.\nFor those who must, the plea is to do everything to avoid collisions and casualties, including:\n- Always drive at an appropriate speed\n- Always wear a seatbelt\n- Never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs\n- Never use a mobile phone behind the wheel\nAlan Kennedy, executive director of Road Safety GB, said: “These are unprecedented times and society as a whole has a responsibility to ease the strain currently being placed on the NHS – and all emergency services, who are already working so hard on our behalf.\n“Whether you are a driver, rider, cyclist or pedestrian – we can all play our part over the coming months by only travelling when necessary, and taking extra care on every journey.\n“Our key message – as is always the case – reduce speeds, wear a seatbelt, drive sober and alert, and stop your vehicle to use a mobile phone.”\nTradition policing continues during this pandemic too\nGloucestershire Constabulary is continuing to monitor road safety as usual, alongside running specialist operations to check motorists’ reasons for travel in line with Government restrictions to help stop the spread of Coronavirus.\nOver the weekend of Saturday 4 and Sunday 5 April 2020, officers stopped 120 vehicles on major routes across the county.",

This will create stronger and clearer local accountability, and reflect that transferable voting systems were rejected by the British people in the 2011 nationwide referendum\n- Making sure PCCs provide the public with clear information on their force’s performance\n- Mandating the appointment of deputy PCCs to ensure continuity in unforeseen circumstances\n- Making changes to ensure more effective and consistent relationships between PCCs and Chief Constables\nThe recommendations will also help all parties (Government, PCCs and forces) establish clearer ways of working and provide Chiefs with more clarity on their operational independence.\nThe review also found strong support for the Government’s ambition to increase the accountability of Fire and Rescue services by having a directly elected official take on governance of the services in order to simplify and strengthen them across England.\nThe review’s findings also confirmed our desire to see more combined authority mayors with PCC and Fire & Rescue authority functions, and the Government will set out its approach to achieving this longer-term aim in the Devolution and Local Recovery White Paper in due course.\nAs a result, we will consult publicly on whether to mandate the transfer of Fire and Rescue authority functions to PCCs in England. This will form part of a Fire Reform White Paper, to launch later this year.\nThe review’s recommendations were outlined to Parliament via a Written Ministerial Statement.\nThe Government has been clear that the review will not consider the 43-force structure, or scrap the role of PCCs.\nThe second part of the Review will take place after the May 2021 elections and the government will communicate more about these plans in due course.\nAs a board member of the APCC, I gave the following statement:\n“The PCC review has provided an important opportunity to build on the learning since the role was created. Our role continues to develop, including our critical work in supporting victims of crime in our areas. PCCs directly commission support services, helping victims to cope and recover from the trauma of crime. This work has proved vital in ensuring victims receive the support they need during the Covid pandemic and beyond.\n“PCCs have also developed greater transparency and openness through our role, directly consulting with the public in setting local policing and crime priorities and publishing performance on our websites. We are directly accountable to the communities that we serve and welcome the focus on transparency that the review brings.”",

CCTV in the centre of both Gloucester Cheltenham is managed in partnership with local authorities, with the council financing the equipment and the police providing the staff to monitor the systems.\nWithin the first year of my second term I will commission a comprehensive review of CCTV in Cheltenham & Gloucester. My intent is to oversee a transformation that will deliver a system that is affordable, technically advanced and supported by the local communities.\nAll of the priorities in my Police and Crime Plan are aimed not only at making Gloucestershire a good place to live, work and visit but also about ensuring a society that is fair, just and compassionate.

Since launching the safer cyber priority in 2014 the Constabulary has made excellent progress, attracting praise form the Home Secretary, local business and local people. It will strive to maintain its reputation as a leading force in the field of cyber policing.\nCybercrime is a fast-growing area of crime. More and more criminals are exploiting the speed, convenience and anonymity of the Internet to commit a diverse range of criminal activities that know no boundaries, either physical or virtual. They cause serious harm and pose very real threats to victims in Gloucestershire and further afield.\nCybercrime is not a victimless crime and I want to see greater emphasis on care and support for people who have fallen victim to such crimes, especially online fraud. All of the priorities in my Police and Crime Plan are aimed at making Gloucestershire a good place to live, work and visit. Everyone should be able to enjoy and use the internet to further enrich their lives and knowledge or business in this digital age.\nIn 2011 GCHQ (UK Government Communications Headquarters) stated that 80% of cybercrimes were easily preventable by implementing simple safety measures. By doing this, everyone can begin to truly enjoy and utilise the amazing technologies and resources available to us all on the Internet.\nI will encourage the police and other agencies and groups to take a ‘prevent, protect, prepare and pursue’ approach to cybercrime and I will hold the police to account against those four areas of activity.\nI do not propose anything I cannot achieve, unlike my opponents who make promises they are powerless to keep because they relate to decisions that rest solely with the Chief Constable.",

Both sound very attractive and very desirable but they are operational matters and are decisions that rest solely with the Chief Constable.\nHowever, if elected, I will require the Chief Constable to set out at least five operational priorities every six months which must be based upon the level of threat, risk and harm to the communities and people of Gloucestershire and on community intelligence. These priorities could relate to knife crime, burglary or cyber frauds against elderly people. The Chief Constable will set the operational priorities for her officers based on history, the intelligence picture, past mistakes, research and best practice and consultation with you, the public.\nProgress will be reported to the Commissioner and local people via public webcasts that will be held at least every other month because the police must be able to demonstrate to the Commissioner and the public that crime reduction and prevention is embedded into everything they do.\nDomestic abuse\nDomestic violence is the abuse of one partner within an intimate or family relationship. It is the repeated, random and habitual use of intimidation to control a partner and can be physical, emotional, psychological, financial or sexual. When a person is forced to alter their behaviour because they are frightened of their partner’s reaction, they are being abused and this cannot be tolerated.\nGloucestershire Constabulary has made considerable progress during my first term of office to improve its understanding of domestic abuse and the service it gives to those who suffer. Training and knowledge from academia provided by organisations such as the University of Gloucestershire and guidance from ‘The Hollie Gazzard Trust’ will continue and the Constabulary will be held to account throughout my next term of office for the service they provide to victims of domestic abuse.\nKnife crime and burglary – operational priorities set by the Chief Constable.\nIt will be for the Chief Constable to set the operational priorities, not the Commissioner who will hold her to account for her judgement and the performance of the Constabulary on a broad spectrum of activity including knife crime and burglary.\nKnives are a youth problem – but they are also a problem for youth often driven by class A drugs and gangs. The vast majority of young people in Britain are law-abiding citizens making important contributions to their communities. They are also the ones most likely to be victims of knife crime and it is to protect these young people that we need to sort out the knife crime problem.\nI hope knife crime will be an operational priority set by the Chief Constable until the current increase seen in Gloucester is brought under control. Equally, in Cheltenham I will encourage her to focus her attention on burglary.\nWorking in partnership\nMy Police and Crime Plan will continue to support police & community projects and programmes that are seeking to break the cycle of harm and offending. 1% of the policing budget – about £1 million – will continue to be set aside for allocation to support projects and programmes that support delivery of Police and Crime Plan priorities.\nWe also hear about the ‘multi-agency’ approach, where various organisations such as the local authorities, health and social care agencies work together, but we have yet to see this implemented in a true working model. I want to establish an in-depth multi-agency solution to ensure that people who need help get the right help at the right time and from the right people. Too often in the past, the police have been the agency of last resort, plugging the gaps when people are in crisis and in desperate need of help\nAll of the priorities in my Police and Crime Plan are aimed not only at making Gloucestershire a good place to live, work and visit but also about ensuring a society that is fair, just and compassionate.",

Now it needs the financial backing and not just warm words.\nTwo years ago my Deputy PCC Chris Brierley brought together a wide cross section of voices from the local criminal justice, health, education, social and political sectors. Their brief was to find a more sustainable approach to tackling youth violence sparked by a spike in deaths and serious injury during the previous twelve months.\nAs a result, Gloucestershire is now bucking the national trend with the main headlines as follows:\n- Over the last three years, incidents defined by the Home Office as ‘knife crime’ accounted for only 0.85% of all crime in the county.\n- Around 20% of those come under the definition of ‘domestic abuse’ and the number of incidents involving young people was in single figures.\n- Research also shows that only once in the last three years, in April 2018, did the figure for recorded knife crime rise above what is considered normal for the county, and then only slightly.\n- Overall, figures for Gloucestershire are well below those for the rest of the country.\n“There is no quick-fix solution.”\nAnd although recent figures also point to an increase in ‘possession of bladed weapons’, this will be due to a number of reasons – the Constabulary’s response to drugs related violence in the city, the effective use of stop search powers and the response to mental health problems. All of these factors will all play a part.\nGloucester and Cheltenham are the most densely populated areas of the county, which would help explain why the figures are higher there than elsewhere.\n“There is no quick-fix solution to this but the current analysis of the data we collect around types of offences or anti-social behaviour clearly tells us that there are very few young people who carry knives in Gloucestershire and that the overwhelming majority of young people in the county do not. Any item with a blade or a point can be classified as a bladed weapon. The age of those caught in possession is also a really important distinction to make as the impression is that its mostly young people carrying knives which is absolutely not the case. During the last three months of 2018, only one young person came through to the service for possession of a knife. Whilst for the small number of young people affected it can have serious consequences, it is important also to recognise that they are often very vulnerable themselves and in need of the support and intervention which many projects provide. In Gloucestershire we are also working hard to ensure that young people are diverted away from the formal criminal justice system as it is nationally recognised that this can have negative long term consequences in terms of their ability to contribute positively to society and become successful adults”. Kate Langley, Strategic Lead for Youth Justice in Gloucestershire\n“…progress is being made and Gloucestershire is still one of the safest places in the country…”\nI welcome what the Home Secretary is saying today as it reflects the action we took two years ago when we were faced with similar issues around county lines and the needless loss of young lives.\nThe knife crime summit, which involved Gloucester’s MP, a crown court judge and a wide cross section of representatives from local criminal justice, health, education and social sectors, influenced ‘Safer Gloucestershire’ who made it a priority to develop a whole county approach to tackling the problem. The result is further evidence that progress is being made and that Gloucestershire is still one of the safest places in the country with fewer offences involving bladed weapons than most other parts of the UK.\nWe know there is still much to do and we’re certainly not complacent, but we endorse the Home Secretary’s views and wish him well.\nInvesting £60,000 to look at the root causes of knife crime and violent crime\n“A great deal of good preventative work has gone into discouraging young people from carrying knives – as well as encouraging anyone with information regarding a young person carrying a knife to get in touch so that appropriate support can be put in place. Initiatives like Children First, Great Expectations, School Beat and the police can take much of the credit. “Through Safer Gloucestershire and the Police and Crime Commissioner’s office we are investing £60,000 this year in a post within public health to look in more depth into the root causes of knife crime/violent crime, assessing what is being done in the county when it comes to early intervention and prevention and also work to promote and communicate better. “Of course, statistics can be made to uphold any argument and we have experienced a number of truly dreadful attacks that will paint a different picture. But a violent attack in the home involving the spontaneous use of a weapon is very different from the sort of pre-meditated attack in the street which attracts a level of publicity and raises its profile disproportionately”.

Even the most blinkered opponent must see that we now have a Police and Fire Minister together with an inspection regime for both services in HMICFRS. Furthermore, there is a statutory duty for police and fire services to work together.\nI think we all know that austerity has gone on long enough, but we\\’re not going back to a time of plenty and services still need to reform, adapt and change.

However, it is essential that those who transgress must be in no doubt that, if found guilty, their crime will attract a sentence at the higher end of the provisions within the law.\nMy experience also leads me to hope, and believe, that many within the criminal fraternity would deplore such crimes and support the view that crimes against the vulnerable are unacceptable.\nA strong message from the Secretary of State to those who would criminally seek to exploit the vulnerable would, in my opinion, be timely and welcomed by the public.",

For me that distinction is important.\nI\\’m chair of the county\\’s Criminal Justice Board, with that comes what I would call soft power, the power to influence and convene people together.\nThat\\’s what we\\’ve done around the state of our courts.\nTalked about for a few years now and dismissed by some in Whitehall as being in decent nick, today a report undertaken by my office has been published.\nIt paint\\’s a depressing picture on the state of our court buildings – words used by some consulted in the report were “demeaning”, “inaccessible” and “substandard”\nA new justice centre ?\nThe report identifies the urgent need for a new criminal justice centre in Gloucestershire.\nThe 14-page report, ‘Court Provision in Gloucestershire’, reveals a number of issues highlighted by notable members of the Gloucestershire criminal justice community including retired resident Judge at Gloucester Crown Court, Judge Jamie Tabor and Nick Gazzard – Father of Hollie Gazzard, who was murdered by her ex-partner.\nSome of the issues include:\n• The steady loss of local magistrates courts\n• Challenges faced by court users getting to the three remaining court buildings, especially from rural locations\n• Extreme difficulties of access for court users with physical disabilities\n• Stress on staff and public who are forced to use outdated facilities that are no longer fit for purpose\nGloucestershire has lost five courthouses since 2010 when Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service (HMCTS) began a national reform programme.\nLocal justice is now administered by a Magistrates’ Court in Cheltenham, a Crown Court in Gloucester and a combined Civil and Family Court also in the city.\nAt risk of justice being dispensed out of county\nThe report, compiled by my office notes that Gloucestershire is one of only six counties in the UK to have just one magistrates’ court*.\nGloucestershire also has one of the lowest number of courts per population compared to most demographically-similar areas*.\nIt also cites the decision of recently-retired resident Judge Jamie Tabor to transfer any case involving a defendant, victim or witness with mobility issues out of the county.\n“No one should commence giving evidence by being carried into a courtroom — it was demeaning and humiliating for those involved”, said Judge Tabor.\nHope?\nDespite being overlooked on numerous occasions when the MoJ has allocated money for building improvements, I hope that with the Government seeming to now be in favour of our courts and police once again now might be the chance to get some money from Whitehall.\nI hope the evidence in this report will encourage the county’s MPs and other local representatives to work together in support for investment.\nI think whilst I am concerned about the state of our courts and judicial system, which is also feeling the pinch due to the decade long austerity, this is no reflection on the many dedicated people who work in our courts.\nWhether staff, victims or witnesses, they all deserve to fulfil their different roles in better working conditions.\nThe court community in Gloucestershire has long been aware of the substandard facilities on offer. As our courthouses have reduced in number over the years, so too has the county’s ability to administer justice locally.\nThe apparent change in the Government’s approach makes me hopeful that if all the parties with a legal interest in this issue can come together and agree on a plan, now could be the time to at last get something done.\nSince first highlighting the issue in 2017*, my office and I have been working with partners to explore options for a new purpose-built justice centre fit for the 21st century.\nMany conversations have already taken place with senior representatives from HMCTS and Gloucestershire County Council.\nWhilst I have offered the site next to the custody complex at Waterwells as a viable option for a new justice centre, I would also support any suitable alternative site.\nWe cannot sit back and allow local justice to be administered from a regional centre like Bristol. We must do all we can to prevent that from happening.",

That compassion extends to animals and their ability to enjoy a life free of cruelty.\nThe sight of the tumblers restored Bob Sawyer to a degree of equanimity which he had not possessed since his interview with his landlady. His face brightened up, and he began to feel quite convivial. The dismal man readily complied; a circle was again formed round the table, and harmony once more prevailed. Some lingering irritability appeared to find a resting-place in Mr. Winkle’s bosom, occasioned possibly by the temporary abstraction of his coat – though it is scarcely reasonable to suppose that so slight a circumstance can have excited even a passing feeling of anger in a Pickwickian’s breast.\nMany studies have demonstrated links between cruelty perpetrated on animals by people who then go on to offend against other people. I will work with partner agencies to ensure enforcement action is taken against those who break laws to protect animals from cruelty or neglect.\nI will continue to work with organisations who seek to educate in this area, such as Cheltenham Animal Shelter and its HALT project. This programme teaches compassion, respect and responsibility towards both animals and people. It works with children from across the county who have been or are in danger of being excluded from mainstream education, or have been found to suffer from low self-esteem.\nI am aware of the upset an animal being stolen can cause to pet owners and will ensure crime prevention advice is made available and that cases reported to the Constabulary are investigated. I will continue to follow the work of the All Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare (APGAW) and ensure any relevant legislation or good practice is acted upon.\nI am proud of the work I have achieved over the past three and a half years but there is much more to be done.

However, the example now being set all too frequently is beyond the pale.\nParents surely teach their children to be respectful and abide by the rules and law, not to find ways around them? The example we set them is important.\nWould a head teacher tolerate such rudeness?

In return, the Chief Constable will establish an efficiency programme to identify annual on-going savings.\nBudget backing continues investment in communities\nThe financial strategy announced will also continue to make 1% of the policing budget available to continue to support community projects and programmes managed through my Commissioner’s Fund.\nIt is an approach to crime reduction – the concept and scale of which is unique to Gloucestershire – that has helped support more than 470 local initiatives countywide and in many cases kept them going through the pandemic.\nThis year there will be a special focus on organisations helping the recovery from Covid-19.\nPublic consultation was close\nA public consultation ran from 6 January to 5 February and produced a statistically valid sample of opinions.\nOn the question of whether householders were ‘willing to pay more towards the police’, 46% said yes; 48% said no and 6% didn’t know.\nOn the question ‘Are you able to pay more considering your current financial circumstances?’ 50% said yes; 50% said no.\nIn due course I will publish the full consultation results to show the breadth of views.\nIt\\’s my job\nProviding sufficient resources for the Constabulary is an important part of my job but under the circumstances, I thought it right to carry out the most extensive consultation possible to find out what was palatable.\nIt is also right that people understand not only why the Constabulary receives a much lower grant than many other forces but also the shift away from central Government funding in favour of local council tax.\n“We have a good story to tell”\nI have to balance the public’s expectations of the Constabulary and their ability to pay with the needs outlined by the Chief Constable to be able to deliver a quality service.\nI am also aware that during the years of austerity, the police did not have the resources they needed to provide the services the public should reasonably expect, and we cannot return to that.\nDespite all that, I think we have a good story to tell.\nThe Constabulary has managed its finances much better than many other forces and is in a better position than most.\nThe budget I have drawn up will enable the Chief Constable to invest in areas the public have told me need improving whilst committing to my police and crime plan policy that every crime matters and every contact counts.\nThe level of council tax that pays for policing is set each year by the PCC, taking into account a referendum limit set by the government.\nOver the last ten years the contribution from local householders has increased from one third of the total funding to nearly half.\nToday’s budget fixing meeting comes after the Home Office announced before Christmas that Gloucestershire Constabulary would receive a maximum £6.6 million cash boost for next year. The Government’s share of £3.2m will go towards recruiting an additional 43 police officers for Gloucestershire to replace some of the 249 that were lost during the period of austerity. The rest of the £6.6m earmarked depended on the remaining £3.4m coming from a 5.8% increase in council tax.\nRated good for financial handling\nIn its most recent assessment, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) rated Gloucestershire Constabulary as good for efficiency, effectiveness and legitimacy and judged the Constabulary good at using resources and good at planning for the future.\nIndependent external auditors Grant Thornton, in their report for the year ended 31st March 2020, stated that “we are satisfied that both the PCC and the Chief Constable have proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in their use of resources”.\nSummary of the headlines from today …\n- Gloucestershire’s Police and Crime Panel today backed my recommendation for a 4.99% increase in council tax to pay for policing\n- The increase will add £12.83 to the annual bill for a Band D taxpayer and will help top up the £3.2m Government grant announced before Christmas\n- The figure is less than the 5.8% increase in council tax earmarked by the Home Office but will enable the Constabulary to balance its books and invest in plans to improve contact with the public\n- A public consultation asking householders if they were willing to pay more for policing, and if so how much, ran from 5 January to 6 February\n- Government grant funding now represents 52% of the total funding for Gloucestershire, compared to 66% in 2010.\n- Over the past ten years, the proportion of funding for policing in Gloucestershire from central Government has fallen from nearly two thirds in 2010 to just over half.\n- The core grant represents most of the grant funding from the Home Office. The core grant received for Gloucestershire represents 0.76% of the total funding provided to police forces in England and Wales. This proportion has remained the same for many years.\n- The core grant per head of population received for Gloucestershire for 2020/21 is £91.58. This represents 68% of the national average and is nearly half the amount received by some forces.\n- The core grant received by Gloucestershire reduced from £67.9m in 2010 to £53.2m in 2017, an actual cash reduction of £14.7m.",

I don\\’t believe in green wash, hopefully if you know me, you know If I say I will do something I will do it (or at least explain why I wasn\\’t able to do it), something I don\\’t think applies to all elected officials.\nLast week I chaired a regional meeting of PCCs along with Chief Constables, where I tabled a discussion around letting police officers from across the south west use any forces electric charging points without any charge (pardon the pun).\nThere was some lively discussion, but it was agreed.\nSo what that means, is that in the future, officers and staff from Gloucestershire travelling to neighbouring counties for court cases, meetings or training can legitimately use one of our Force electric car, rather than using a diesel or petrol car!\nFor me this small change will help to save forces money in fuel costs but more importantly it will help to reduce our carbon footprint by eliminating emissions completely for certain journeys.\nI’m pleased that this agreement has been secured between the five forces in the South West region, I am proud that Gloucestershire Constabulary is a leading the way when it comes to the green agenda.\nIts the only force in the country to hold the ISO 14001 Environmental Standard 2015 certification, for our commitment to reducing waste and pollution.\nToday\\’s announcement is great news because as our electric fleet grows it is important we can support those vehicles to be used on longer journeys.\nThis agreement will save both money and the planet, and is just the latest in my commitment to maintaining ‘A Green and Pleasant County’ in Gloucestershire.\nAll five of the South West forces will start by mapping the location and type of charging points held across their Force areas, and have committed to ensuring that there will be no financial cost to use charging points in other areas for at least two years.\nI\\’m also pleased my PCC colleagues and Chief Constables committed to working together to share good practice in relation to carbon reduction, with a view to develop a regional sustainability strategy for the South West.\nIf I am re-elected in May, I will maintain my commitment to the green agenda.",

  "https_policecommissioner_net_/https_policecommissioner_net_budget-speech/content_32.html": "Below is my Budget Speech as delivered to the Gloucestershire Police & Crime Panel on Monday 8th February 2021.\nFirstly I’d like to set the context to this budget. By any standards this has been an unprecedented year and a year when the public sector has been tested and called upon in ways unimaginable when I presented my budget to you last year.\nI therefore want to record my thanks firstly to the NHS to who we all owe a massive debt of gratitude but also to recognise the professionalism and considerable part played by the other emergency services, Gloucestershire Fire & Rescue and the Gloucestershire Constabulary and publicly thank them. Their job is far from finished and I wish them well. This year I think has demonstrated like no other the importance of our public services and the publics support for them.\nThe panel will be aware that the Gloucestershire Constabulary have always been graded either outstanding or good at managing its finances, understanding its demand and planning for the future. It is because that attention to detail by my office and the force that I can report the constabulary is financially sound and that I can present to you a budget today that not only demonstrates tremendous progress over the last several years; a budget that continues to grow the organisation both numerically and in capability but a budget that invests not just for today but also for future generations.\nBefore I present next year’s budget I’d like to report back to the panel on how the increase agreed last year was invested and the benefits realised.\nFirstly as I indicated the government funded an additional 46 officers as part of the national uplift programme. Gloucestershire met and exceeded the target of 46 and recruited an additional 37 officer. Credit indeed to the Chief Constable and his team.\nWe also invested in and opened the forces new training and leadership centre which is a national exemplar of good practise. The centre was opened ‘virtually’ by the home secretary Priti Patel and visited by the Police Minister who was highly complementary.\nThe Sabrina Centre is a facility that reused obsolete buildings and creates a sustainable asset for current and future generations.\nIn addition to the uplift funding I was permitted to increase the percept by up to 4% but determined an increase of 2.7% was sufficient to meet both the needs of the police and was reasonable and fair to the tax payer.\nI’m pleased to report that as a direct outcome of the precept increases over the last two years an additional 73 officers and 27 police staff have been recruited.\nAt the outset of the pandemic I released 1m from the general reserve to the Chief Constable to support the force to adjust and tackle the many issues. £1.3m\nYou will also recall that last year I created a one million pound capital fund to enable the police to review and improve how they communicate and connect with the public.\nI had also built into my financial plans sufficient capacity to convert that fund into revenue when that work had been completed and a proposal submitted to my finance board.\nMuch of that capital fund was spent on a new CRM (customer relations system) for the force control room and work to move demand online to relieve pressure on the 999 and 101 systems. We are already seeing the benefits of that work.\nIn September last year a fully costed proposal was brought to my finance Board to convert that one million capital in to revenue in future years. (See annex A)\nThis investment has resulted in investments in the contact centre and technology upgraded. The Structure of the force has been changed to increase the emphasis on neighbourhood policing ensuring the command structure is clearly focussed on local issues and priorities.\nLast year you may recall I reported that between 2018 and 2020 we had seen growth of circa 70 officers and 30 staff and that over the following three years I anticipated a combined total increase the region of 300. I can now revise that estimate and report that the investments already made and proposed now will see us reach circa 254 this year and will be in excess of 300 in 2022. A tremendous achievement managed by my office and the constabulary. (see annex B).\nMore resources have been invested in safeguarding children to help protect some of the most vulnerable in our society. The often unseen activities that identify, disrupt and prevent serious and organised crime from gaining a foothold in our area have also been increased.\nI have also seen the constabulary increase its activities to reduce the devastating impact on individuals and families of death and serious injury on our roads by not just enforcement but also education and working with our partners to reduce the root cause of these terrible incidents.\nI am also very conscious of the very difficult job and the high expectations we place on our officers, staff and volunteers and it is vital that we train and equip them to the highest standards to both protect them and enable them to protect the public.\nThe specialist operations centre at Bamfurlong is no longer fit to meet the current demands we place on it and is no longer able to support the highly trained and specialist teams we need within our county to respond to the most challenging and serious incidents. Plans are now in place to significantly upgrade and enhance this facility. When complete this will also provide the right support for both current and future generations.\nI must now move on the proposals for the next financial year but before I do so I would like to share with you the process we adopted for consultation and the outcome of it.\nThe world has changed, the financial damage to our economy is clear but also it appears to me different households have been affected differently.\nI needed to hear from these households and as far as is possible take their views into account. Equally important I felt it was important to give everyone a chance to be heard and to have a voice.\nAt this point in my speech I handed over to the Deputy Chief Executive of the OPCC, Ruth Greenwood to talk through the public consultation.\nI will now move us to the challenge that we face today. Once again we are faced with a 12 month settlement greatly inhibiting our medium term plan. We have another year of our underlying grant frozen, a cut in our capital grant, and increased costs from the home office against the climate of increased demands, expectations and risks. I am pleased and grateful that we continue to be provided with funding to support new officers. This will assist in bringing our (p6 budget paper) establishment up to 1196 over the next two years. However welcome this is it should be seen in the context of a minimum 2 year and increasingly three year training programme before these officers are fully capable of being fully deployed as part of the core establishment.\nI have been given the flexibility to raise more money but this will all fall on the local Council tax payer. I welcome this flexibility. An extra £15.00 a year for a band D property may not seem much to many of us however this rise will be on top of many others and would have to be met be residents who may have seen substantial reductions in their income as a result directly or indirectly of Covid.\nI was disappointed when my flexibility to increase precept by the maximum £15 was deliberately misrepresented by a political group as an already agreed funding outcome. To do so was misleading, disrespectful to the community, the panel and me. We all know the Chancellor has the flexibility to raise a range of taxes in his budget in March I would not seek to announce them before he had undertaken his consultation, taken advice and made his determination.\nAs you have heard my extensive public consultation has shown a strong support for the Police but a great concern on affordability. This has made coming to a decision on next year’s precept more challenging than ever.\nI have, as you would expect, been in close discussion with the Chief Constable who has clearly set out what resources he would like over the next 12 months. My responsibility is to ensure resources are delivered to meet the needs of the county now and ensure that the Constabulary is in the best possible position to continue to meet those challenges in future years.\nThe Chief constable has clearly set out the scale of the financial challenge, the ongoing cost pressures and how has already been delivered in the report previously circulated. I have outlined today how investments have been made in the establishment, Public contact and the estate. These are all helping. The Chief Constable and I are in agreement we must seek to improve the technology we use to support our officers in undertaking their duties. It is critical when responding to a call from the public, sending resources to an incident or investigating criminal activity at all levels that we have both the best and most timely information available. That information comes through technology.\nI now want to see the constabulary move forward on its plans to invest in its intelligence systems, mobile data, resource management and training to ensure it is equipped with and know how to use the best available information. I have no doubt that those that would do harm already have such capability. A transformation programme is in place that sets out the ambition but I have asked for this to be reviewed and focussed to ensure it delivers against a more compressed timescale.\nAs part of this programme I expect to see efficiencies either through improved response and outcomes or reduced cost. I have discussed and agreed this approach with the Chief Constable. The Constabulary has an enviable track record of managing its finances and delivering an efficient and effective service, a position that has been independently assessed and reported on by both HMICFRS and the external auditors over many years. This is something that I expect to continue long into the future.\nI now come to the crux of today’s meeting. My proposal for next year’s precept increase. I ruled out the option of freezing but considered an inflation linked increase .Both regrettably would have created a climate of cuts in service and damaged the delivery to the public at a time when they are being called to deliver more. It may have been received well in some areas but I would be failing in my principal duties and potentially be seen as sacrificing the service for political motives. At the other end of the scale I considered imposing the maximum increase allowed without resort to a referendum, 5.8%. This would see cash increased ranging from £10 for a band B property through to £15 for a band D and £30 for the highest band H properties. Having reflected on this I considered the impact on those most struggling to pay together with the investments already made in previous years.\nSetting this budget has been the most difficult in my 8 years as commissioner as I am acutely aware that whilst many are able and willing to pay more to support policing there are others who though willing will struggle to meet the costs. I’m also aware that often it is these household that have the greatest need of our public services and any budget that diminished the capabilities of our police could disproportionately disadvantage them.\nIt is for that reason I have set the increase at the lowest level I can reasonably can without stalling the tremendous progress that has been made to recover from austerity. I have therefore stressed to the Chief Constable, his officers PCSO’s and staff the importance of meeting the primary challenge of my police and crime plan, ‘Every Crime Matters – every contact counts’\nIt’s also about taking personal responsibly. I personally can afford to pay the increase, but I want to do more, I have therefore decided that as I did during my first term of office next year take a 10% reduction in my salary to support the charitable part of The Commissioners Fund. I appreciate it’s a small personal gesture but one others may wish to consider.\nIn coming to my proposal therefore I have given due cognisance to:\nThe requirements of the Chief Constable,\nThe funding provided by Central Government,\nThe responses to my public consultation,\nThe continued drive to deliver ongoing efficiencies\nThe need to continue to invest to ensure we are fit for both today and future generations\nContinue to restore the damage caused by many years of austerity.\nI am confident that my proposal will achieve all these and continue the journey that will see a continued increase in officer numbers supported by good infrastructure and training regime that will provide the residents, businesses and visitors to Gloucestershire with the service they both deserve and need. At the same time the budget will maintain a requirement for the Constabulary to continually improve and identify efficiencies to ensure we maintain our reputation for providing value for money.\nIt’s also important to look after the wellbeing of our officers and staff and I’m pleased to report the constabulary’s well-being and supportive leadership programme has gone from strength to strength. I have therefore made provision for a budget of £100k for the Chief Constable to make ad hoc improvements to the working environment of his officers and staff.\nThe detail as always is within my written report and this should answer the many questions I am sure you have. However I will now conclude with a clear proposal to increase the Gloucestershire Police Precept by 4.99% for the next financial year.",

His handler, PC Dave Wardell, was also injured during the incident.\nThankfully, both pulled through – though in Finn’s case it was touch and go – and I had the pleasure of meeting them both at an event in Cheltenham earlier in the year.\nThe Bill in their name advocates the introduction of a new offence of attacking any animal in service. This includes police dogs and horses and broadens sentencing powers where a service animal is injured as a result of crime.\nIn harms way\nMost right-thinking people would surely think it not before time. After all,\nour dogs and horses make a significant contribution in areas like neighbourhood policing, crowd control, drug detection and searching for missing people, all of which would be more difficult without them. They risk harm on a regular basis to keep their handlers and the public safe and legislation should be amended to afford them the protection they deserve.\nAnimal welfare is already enshrined in my Police and Crime Plan, the underlying strategy for how Gloucestershire police officers operate on a daily basis. It emphasises an obligation to show compassion to all animals and investigate the theft of domestic animals.\nFinn’s Law would already be one step nearer the statue books had it not been delayed by the intervention of the MP Sir Christopher Chope who recently voiced his objection to the ‘upskirting bill’ in similar fashion. By contrast, many people have written to me on this issue and I have been happy to give them my support.\nAny attempt to attack or kill a police dog or horse on duty is a serious act of violence which should be treated with severity in law.",

Does the number you are promising include those above or is it extra to those above?\n-\nHow will you fund it and what happens to the important police staff? (Government advice is that for every three officers recruited you should recruit one member of police staff)\n-\nWhat will be the impact on my council tax? The annual cost of 150 locally funded officers would be an additional (circa) £13 million, the equivalent to an increase of 21.7% council tax (£55.80 increase on the current Band D). Double it for 300 additional officers.\n(you then need to add in some extra for vehicles, radios and extra trainers…)\nSo, if you see a promise to recruit an additional 150 or 300 officers, you might like to know if these include the 151 already announced by the Government in 2018?\nWe\\’ve already got a fully costed plan\nThe officers currently in the pipeline are planned and budgeted for.\nSo any additional above and beyond the 151 again raises some more questions\n- How will they be funded ?\n- The Sabrina Centre is already at full capacity, so where will they be trained?\nTo make up the number could we recruit more special constables?\nMaybe we could cut costs and recruit specials constables instead some might say?\nWell, best practise suggests that the ratio of regular officers to special constable is 1:10 and Gloucestershire has about that ratio.\nHere\\’s the current position with the Special Constabulary:\n- Currently Gloucestershire has 124 Special Constables.\n- In 2020 they gave 39,107 hours of service.\n- They are highly trained and well equipped.\nWe already have a plan to recruit more Specials anyway…\nFor the year 2021/22 Gloucestershire has two intakes of twelve Special Constables scheduled.\nIn the years 2022 & 24 Gloucestershire each year has three intakes of 20 Special Constables scheduled each year.\nOther possible questions for those people over promising ..\nPSCO numbers, will they be maintained?\nWill the Special Constables be under the direction of the chief constable with regards to duties and postings or will an incoming PCC seek a change in the law and take on this power?\nWill there be redundancies in police staff – if so which posts?\nFunding pressures coming down the track\nIf between £14 and £28 million is to be spent on new recruits how will these mandatory upgrades to police communication systems and IT be funded?\nWithout these the entire planned growth of the Constabulary will falter or catastrophically fail.\nGimmicks to grab headlines\nSo yes whilst headline figures like promising an additional 300 officers to concentrate on local neighbourhood issues might grab attention please be wary of unachievable promises this election.",

It also made it onto some of the foreign media – and it didn’t end there!\nWe trail-blazed\nTelephone calls and emails came in from all over the Country, asking for details of the system as it became clear that this was a nationwide problem and that, just like Rodborough, thousands of families were affected by the speeding curse every day of the year.\nHundreds of hours of time have gone into this project and the support of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC) and seed funding have been instrumental in its success.\nThey have been inspirational in helping us.\nA PCC who wants the best for the county and not himself\nBut what is really important to stress is that Martin Surl has, at every stage of this project, given considerable hands-on enthusiasm and support, which coupled with his deputy Chris Brierley, has led to a very strong and invaluable partnership with the OPCC and the Gloucestershire Constabulary who have also given their support.\nI cannot thank them enough for their enthusiasm and ‘can do’ attitude.\nThe benefits\n10 years on, and in partnership with the police, we are now able to target serial speeders.\nIntelligence can be stored for up to 18 months enabling us to identify repeat offenders, some of them driving at over twice the legal speed limit in built up areas on narrow roads they share with cyclists, pedestrians and school children.\nSadly road casualties are once again on the increase\nFor the last five years fatalities have increased in the United Kingdom.\nOver 27,000 people have been killed or suffered serious injuries in each of those years leaving their families and friends devastated.\nSafer roads has been, and remains, one of the PCC’s policing priorities.\nHelp given to Rodborough Parish Council by the OPCC in Gloucestershire has now encouraged other Councils to start using this equipment and already it is making their communities safer by helping them control the worst offenders.\nHow it works\nWhen a serial speeding driver is flagged by the system and blacklisted, it automatically sends the data controller an email with the number plate, speed, date, time and GPS and if it is serious enough the driver is visited by a Police Officer. Our records show that once a driver is visited and shown the data he or she conforms to the speed limit in approximately 95% of the cases that we have monitored over a two-year period.\nWe consider this a staggering success story and the icing on the cake came in December 2020 when the system received the Surveillance Camera Commissioner’s accreditation for conformity.\nMore national effort needed\nIn his latest report, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), stated: “There is a clear, and pressing, need for government, police and crime commissioners, chief officers, and the College of Policing to recognise the importance of roads policing in reducing death on the roads.\n“A lack of co-ordination hinders effective engagement with the public and partners.\n“In addition, to the tragic loss of lives, the financial cost of all road traffic collisions (including those that go unreported) is estimated to be around £36 billion per year.\nAlong with the tragedy comes the cost\nIn one year alone, the estimated cost of motorway closures was £1 billion. But some forces are failing to recognise their part in making the road network safe and efficient; and how best to work with partner agencies that have a shared responsibility for road safety”.\nWith over five people being killed every day, [27,000 killed or seriously injured every year] it is now time for others to follow the example of our OPCC in taking this subject seriously.\nWe cannot thank both Martin Surl and Chris Brierley enough.\nBy acting proactively, they were supporting this project even before the HMICFRS made it a requirement.\nThe system that was conceived following that first meeting with Mr. Surl is not only reducing serial speeding, it is now also being used to help the Police gather intelligence in the fight against other serious crimes making our communities safer in more ways that one.\nCouncillor Charles Pedrick\nFounder of the ANPR road safety project.",

The unit uses a long range lens with an approximate range of 990 metres which means it can spot an offence before the driver sees the camera.\nTwo camera enforcement officers and specialised equipment are funded by my office (Gloucestershire’s Police and Crime Commissioner)through my priority for safe and social driving. The aim is to reduce speeding, tailgating and the number of drivers using their phones at the wheel and not wearing a seatbelt.\nThank you\nI had a good chat with Mr Knowles , he was very apologetic and contrite when I spoke to him afterwards and fully acknowledged that what he did was dangerous and misguided. He could have used his celebrity status to fight the charges. Instead, he accepted his punishment in the hope that the publicity would stop other drivers from making the same mistakes.\nThanks Nick for your honesty.",

  "https_policecommissioner_net_/https_policecommissioner_net_new-da-laws-planned-but-when-will-it-actually-happen/content_174.html": "Being a former journalist, call me cynical but you do get a little blasé when governments announce new laws or new money for projects. Sometimes, the cynicism is justified as quite often it might not be new money or new ideas it could be just a simple “repackaging” or “re-announcing”.\nBut this week the Government has announced something other than the latest update on the B-word, it announced plans for an overhaul of the domestic abuse laws.\nThe problem being …. it’s a draft bill and it doesn’t look like there will be any parliamentary time put aside to getting it through the House of Commons to become law. Therefore in layman’s terms it’s just a plan at this stage.\nNational Statistics:\n* 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime.\n* Domestic abuse leads to, on average, two women being murdered each week and 30 men per year in England and Wales.\n* Domestic abuse related offences have the most repeat victims than any other type of crime.\n* It is estimated that domestic abuse costs the public £23 Billion per year; including costs to the criminal justice system, health, social care and housing.\n* 1 in 5 women and 1 in 12 men have experienced stalking in their lifetime in the UK.\n* Research suggests that at least one honour killing takes place in the UK every month (this is likely to be underestimated).\n* 15% of cases responded to by the Forced Marriage Unit are for young people under 16 years.\n* Government experts estimate domestic abuse cost society £66 billion in 2016/17 and it’s hoped the changes will improve the response.\nThat’s not to say there’s not some good stuff in the current draft bill, because first time there will be a legal definition of domestic abuse, which includes economic abuse and control. The long-awaited legislation will also ban abusers from cross-examining victims in family courts. The definition of domestic abuse will specifically recognise that it goes beyond crimes of violence and includes victims who are psychologically coerced and manipulated, as well as those who have no control of their finances.\nThe legislation will also clarify the workings of “Clare’s Law” – a measure introduced four years ago to permit police to tell a member of the public of concerns over a partner’s previous violence.\nThe draft bill will also:\n* Create new powers to force perpetrators into behaviour-changing rehabilitation programmes\n* Make victims automatically eligible for special protections when they are giving evidence in criminal trials\n* Set up a national “domestic abuse commissioner” tasked with improving the response and support for victims across public services\n* There are also plans to ensure a breach of an order is a criminal offence.\nWhen it comes to the new plans, we (the PCC and the OPCC) have a number of concerns. Firstly, whilst it’s to be welcomed that the Government is looking to overhaul the law, it has taken too long. That has meant victims and their children have had their lives turned upside down by having to uproot their lives, whilst those responsible have been allowed to remain invisible and often unchallenged by the system ( I’m paraphrasing someone more in the know that me!).\nSecondly, if the law does come into place there may be an additional demand placed on both the Police and current domestic abuse support service in the county – GDASS. This additional demand will probably not be backed up with any additional money and that is a worry.\nAll of the DA provision in the county was last year recommissioned and a sudden increased influx in demand may have a major impact particularly on the support victims are able to access. Especially during the judicial process, that’s because we currently only have one court Independent Domestic Violence Adviser (IDVA) for the whole county.\nAnother consideration would be the demand on trial time as the courts already allocate specific court slots for DA cases and whether they would be able to give any additional time for high priority cases without impacting on the current DA cases is not known.\nThankfully in our county there is lots of partnership work going on across agencies and the voluntary sector. Our focus is on early help and support. It’s estimated in Gloucestershire over 13 thousand women and over 7 thousand men have been victims of domestic abuse (2017 figures), for those victims and their families the sooner politicians in Westminster make time for this issue the better.\nClick here for a list of the support available to victims of crime in Gloucestershire.",

I made it a manifesto pledge in 2016 that I would do what I could to make the police maintain and develop a new approach to neighbourhood policing because for me its the golden thread that runs through policing and without it the police will lose their effectiveness.\nA lot of work was done over the last year by officers and staff within both the Constabulary and OPCC.\nThat is why I am proud that this week Gloucestershire Constabulary relaunched its new approach to neighbourhood policing, working with communities to deliver the needs they identify and provide a more consistent service across the county.\nNeighbourhood policing was in my manifesto pledge in 2016\nThis is in line with the Police and Crime Commissioner\\’s plan to make neighbourhood policing a priority, and in response to public opinion. See page 10 of the Police and Crime Plan\nThe Force is pledging to make local policing accessible again by providing a dedicated, named PCSO in every neighbourhood so that everyone knows who their local bobby is and how to contact them.\nThe 55 dedicated PCSOs will be the first point of contact for local concerns, but they will be working as part of a bigger team protecting the local and wider communities. But I urge you if you have a community concern that you think the local police should be dealing with (not a 999 emergency but a general concern) , please click here and report it.\nRing fenced officers\nAs well as the dedicated PCSOs each neighbourhood team will include police constables and sergeants who will work, sometimes behind the scenes, on a wide range of issues such as Dangerous Drugs Networks, tracking down paedophiles and the organised crime groups which are targeting our rural communities.\nThey in turn will be supported by other specialist teams including those looking after vulnerable children, those investigating major crimes and firearms officers.\nThis new offer comes at a time when many forces are having to make cuts in neighbourhood policing, including PCSOs, but [thanks to prudent spending decisions] Gloucestershire Constabulary has chosen to invest instead.\nLocal policing is at the heart of what we do\nTo quote the Chief Constable – everything begins and ends in a neighbourhood. I am happy the force has reaffirmed its commitment to community policing, but it will be tough and expectations are high. With no extra money coming from central government anytime soon, the Chief and his team will have their work cut out juggling resources, but by working with communities I am sure it can and will succeed.",

  "https_policecommissioner_net_/https_policecommissioner_net_common-sense-prevails/content_196.html": "One of the main roles of being a PCC, or a DPCC for that matter, is dealing with the public. Meeting them, talking with them, representing them and listening to them. We hear moans, complaints, concerns and also compliments, whether it be about the Police or the work of the Commissioner and his team( the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner).\nThe OPCC receives hundreds of letters and email correspondence each year. Some are easily dealt with but others require more thought, research or need Martin or I to set out our position on an issue.\nThe latter is exactly what happened when an email was passed to me by the office in December. The gist of the story is outlined below…\nI recently bought a new house and decided to rip out the old kitchen. I came across 30 or so old knives. I decided to dispose of them. I took them to the tip but it was closed for a few weeks, so I turned up at Police HQ reception. They told me to take it to an operational police station. So I ended up at Bearlands in Gloucester. I told the reception staff at the police station the story of the tip being closed and of me being sent to them. They said there wasn’t a current knife amnesty on and as they were only kitchen knives they wouldn’t take them and i should wait till the tip re-opens. I JUST WANT TO GET RID OF SOME KNIVES AND DONT WANT TO JUST PUT THEM IN THE BIN!!\nSo, in my Inbox was a request from a member of the public for the police to take unwanted knives, especially in an age where violent crime is on the rise.\nBefore I tell you my reply, let me put in some context. It was December, we were waiting for the government to tell us what the financial settlement would be for the police and, nationally, forces are struggling with demand due to reduced resources (i.e. fewer police officers and cuts elsewhere has seen a huge spike in demand on officers’ time). I think you know where this is going.\nI wrote back and thanked the gentlemen for trying to dispose of the knives in a sensible way but said it wasn’t for the police to be a “waste disposal service”. I didn’t quite put it like that but that was the gist of it.\nThe response I received from the gentleman was one of resignation. He wasn’t surprised and you could read his disillusionment between the lines of the email.\nIt was a Friday. I went home for the weekend but his email played on my mind. Was I right or should I have pushed this? After all, violent crime is going up across the country and the fewer knives on our streets the better. I talked over the issue in general terms my wife (let’s be clear, I do not disclose details of any kind) and she sided with the member of the public. I mulled it over all weekend.\nThe following week we had the PCC’s Governance meeting with the Chief Constable and his senior team. This is the forum where the PCC, on behalf of the public, holds the police to account. By this point, I had decided that the gentleman who wrote in had a point. A discussion followed and it was a good debate where the pros and cons were discussed.\nThe outcome – all our police stations will now take in knives. Why wouldn’t they? It doesn’t need lots of time and effort writing a new policy for this. It doesn’t need any new red tape or process being designed. It just needs a common sense approach . Hopefully it shows that, despite the general view that “politicians” or people in power don’t listen, some of us actually hear your thoughts and opinions. What’s more, I hope it demonstrates that Martin, the team and I don’t just listen, we respond and we represent you on issues that matter.",

It sound very attractive and very desirable but it is an operational matter and the final decision rests solely with the Chief Constable.\nMuch has been achieved in my first term but the public tell me they want to see more of their police and more of their PSCOs – and that message is repeated all around the county.\nIf I am re-elected, I will maintain the number of PCSOs, increase the number of officers by at least 40 to 1100, make funding available to double the size of the Special Constabulary and equip all our officers, PSCOs and staff with the tools to do the job we ask of them.\nThe Constabulary has made great efficiencies by harnessing technology but this must lead to more ‘boots on the ground’ and one that by definition is visible, accessible and engaging with our communities. It must deter and prevent crime and anti-social behaviour rather than merely responding to it. I expect our police to be available to residents and offer reassurance and a familiar face they can have confidence and confide in.\nNeighbourhood policing\nI agree with HMIC that due to unprecedented budget cuts there is a risk to neighbourhood policing as the time neighbourhood teams can dedicate to their principal functions in their communities is being eroded. I fully acknowledge and appreciate that the Chief Constable has to make difficult decisions about where resources should be concentrated, but neighbourhood policing is so vital to the overall effectiveness of policing that I will require from the Chief Constable a plan to be developed with my office and local people to maintain and develop neighbourhood policing in your communities.\nRural policing\nGloucestershire’s countryside is a beautiful place in which to live and offers a lifestyle to which many in our county aspire. However, the picture postcard image often hides crime and poverty, which can be on a par with urban areas. Crime has become an increasing concern in rural areas over the past few years and for many people, whether they have fallen victim to crime or not, the simple fear of crime can have a detrimental effect on their quality of life.\n39% of rural people are worried about becoming a victim of crime compared with 19% nationally.\nIt has been suggested that anticipation of crime has the potential to cause greater harm than the actual experience of crime itself due to the effect of long-term stress and other mental health considerations. Crime is a key issue for rural communities therefore tackling rural crime and increasing police visibility will be a key part of neighbourhood policing in Gloucestershire.\nMounted Section\nThere has been much interest and comment on the possibility of the Constabulary acquiring its own mounted section. The two horses we have at the moment comprise the final phase of an extensive trial which has so far been founded on sound academic and physical research. If the trial is successful, there is a high expectation that Gloucestershire will have a mounted section funded through the Social Stock Exchange. This would lead to an additional four officers, horses, training and equipment at very little, if any, cost to the Constabulary.\nAlready, there is strong evidence that a small mounted capability in Gloucestershire would enable the Constabulary to improve public confidence, potentially generate income through mutual aid and enhance its operational capabilities and capacity. Mounted patrols would work alongside other neighbourhood officers and bring a reassuring presence to officers confronting potentially violent situations and when policing our busy night-time economy.\nFunding from the Social Stock Exchange – which connects social impact businesses with investors looking to generate social or environmental change – would be dependent on the horses being available to engage with vulnerable community groups and organisations like the Star College, people with physical disabilities and mental health issues when not needed for operational duties.\nAll of the priorities in my Police and Crime Plan are aimed not only at making Gloucestershire a good place to live, work and visit but also about ensuring a society that is fair, just and compassionate.",

I cannot deny it has taken longer than I would have wanted or expected, but I hope to be able to make an announcement soon that will help reduce the huge backlog of cases waiting to be heard.\nAlso, as you drive through the Highways England roadworks on the A40 between Gloucester and Cheltenham, you will probably be unaware of the parallel plans to develop the Constabulary’s operational base at Bamfurlong for which we are optimistic of getting planning permission very soon.\nAs difficult as this year has been, it is a reminder that a new one is just around the corner.\nA version of this blog appeared in local papers across Gloucestershire",

I’ll leave that for you to decide.\nAs someone who spent his first career covering politics and writing headlines, I get the need to grab people’s attention.\nBut I have always believed in presenting the FULL facts and letting people decide for themselves rather than “spinning” things in a particular way.\n\\”Community Crime Fighter\\”\nThe so-called ‘Community crime fighter’ – that was how he signed himself – who wrote in last week’s SNJ about a 16 % rise in crime in Gloucestershire compared to a decrease nationally of 9 % failed to provide any context, because without context, figures like the above can be misleading.\nIt obviously fitted the writer’s narrative as one of doom and gloom and a picture that Gloucestershire is like the wild west.\nYes, crime is on the increase after a decade or more of low crime, and we shouldn’t be complacent.\nA decade of cuts have had consequences\nBut could this be due to cuts over a decade which saw fewer police on our streets?\nCould this be because of cuts elsewhere in public services which have resulted in youth clubs closed so fewer places for young people to hang out?\nCould this be due to cuts to council services so they’ve not been able to do as much around community safety as they used to?\nThe police alone cannot keep us safe\nCommunity safety is not just the remit of the police, but as lots of national reports have pointed-out the police are now the first port of call for lots of things rather than the last port of call as they used to be.\nThis is something our Police and Crime Commissioner is working with partners to try and address through more funding for local community safety partnerships as well as funding to look at ways of stopping violence before it happens through early intervention and prevention.\nPartnership working does go on in the county\nSo despite the view expressed by ‘Crime fighter’ in last weeks article, as a county we are working together in a partnership involving the police, local councils, the NHS and the voluntary sector with the result that our rate of crime is 5th lowest in the country compared to 12th lowest when Martin Surl was elected.\nAnti-social behaviour is a problem\nFurthermore, anti-social behaviour over that same period has been cut locally by 32 %.\nYes, it is still high and higher than some areas and we must all do more collectively to tackle it.\nThat is why work is going on at a county level to look into the issue and how we can do more. Again, however, it is not solely a police issue.\nIts not just about the police\nThe example given in the article by ‘Crime fighter’ was around fly tipping and again he shows his lack of awareness, because fly tipping, and the ability to fine those who tip, rests with local councils.\nFar too often people call the police, because they are unsure which agency has specific responsibility for dealing with a particular issue.\nAs a county we must do better at making people know where the best place to access help is, because there’s lots of good work going on and is why we are one of the safest places to live.\nBetter crime recording\nThe main reason why the crime rates in our county are higher this year despite them falling elsewhere, is because the force has got better at recording crime – the direct result of criticism the force received last year for not recording enough crimes properly.\nThe Chief Constable gave an account on the challenges around this to a cross party group of councillors who were happy with what he had to say.\nPut simply, the guidance from the government is to call an incident a crime whenever the police are called, even if, after they have investigated and decided a crime has not been committed and no further action is necessary.\nUntil last year’s unfavourable report, the force had allowed officers more discretion, often with good intent, to decide whether a ticking off was better than classifying something a crime.\n‘Crime fighter’ is right to point out the figures are up, but what he again fails to add is that crime in Gloucestershire is still low overall and we live in the 5th safest place in the UK.\nNational review into PCCs\nThe government has recently announced a review into the role of Police & Crime Commissioners.\nOne of its aims is to raise awareness of the role amongst the public, something my boss Martin Surl as Gloucestershire’s Independent PCC supports, because far too often people don’t understand the role including those who aspire to be a PCC.\nThe role is not to BE the police, commanding drones to fly over areas or allocating police officers jobs to do.\nThe PCC is like the chairman of the board setting the overarching aims and holding the Chief Executive, in this case the Chief Constable, to account.\nOperational independence is so important and it is the Chief Constable who is in control of day-to-day operations.\nPolitics of hope not fear\nFor my part, I would rather the politics of hope over the politics of fear any day.\nWhilst, we are still in the midst of tackling a pandemic, instead of opportunistic fear mongering and doing down the police and others, we will carry on with a positive approach to working to keep Gloucestershire a safe place to live and work.\nA version of this article appeared in the Stroud News & Journal on the 10/8/2020",

If so, they should consider some of those I met personally after they made the same mistake of embracing class A drugs. What they have in common is they are all dead.\nThe Roll Call…\n- A boy in his 20’s, found in a ditch in Cirencester several days after overdosing when his companion had fled with the little cash he had.\n- A young woman, abandoned by her boyfriend in a flat in Cheltenham, a needle still in her vein.\n- The call to investigate a young man from Gloucester who died at an international airport when the heroin he had concealed in condoms and swallowed, burst inside him.\nThose are just three; there were many more cases inciting murder, torture, misery and in some cases long prison sentences. Not ‘cool’ at all.\nI truly believe that not all those I recall were bad people, but bad things happened to them and they died; often without sympathy. They offer a very different picture to those of a more privileged class who probably had their ‘best quality’ cocaine delivered to their door. Contrast that with the less well-connected; impelled to score from a back street dealer supplying questionable gear and trying to move them on from cannabis to heroin as quickly as possible.\nSome survived but still suffer the psychosis caused by the misuse of ‘Skunk weed’ and a career-wrecking police caution for what could be considered a relatively minor violation.\nA proper debate\nI do not pretend to have the answer to such a complex issue and there’s no doubt that when the drug debate is laced with cigarettes and alcohol it’s also spiked with a fair amount of hypocrisy.\nIdeally, revelations during the leadership contest will provoke a grown-up discussion, but I fear it will prove to be just a point-scoring exercise.",

Bamfurlong is of critical importance to us as it provides a geographically ideal base for a range of police units and gives our teams quick and easy access to major routes in the county when responding to incidents”. “However, it has been in urgent need of redevelopment for some time and it is very important we support our staff and make sure they have the best possible working environment so they can provide the best service to the public”.",

And that certainly seems to be the case when you consider some of the issues that have dominated the news recently.\nWhilst national headline writers appear to have only recently woken up to the decline in neighbourhood policing, I have been arguing the importance of the link between police and the people they protect for some time. It is a vital relationship which has an influence far beyond our local boundaries and the time has come where we must all think about contributing a bit more to the cost of protecting our communities. Indeed, I would like as many of you as possible to have your say on this and you have until the end of the month to do so by taking part in a short survey on the OPCC website.\nNeighbourhood policing aside, there’s been coverage of Michael Gove’s draft bill to enshrine animal welfare in UK law and impose much tougher jail sentences on those guilty of animal cruelty; measures to protect the environment by inhibiting the use of plastic have been front page news and stricter penalties against manufacturers who set out to deceive car users over emissions have also made headlines recently.\nNot just lip service\nI’m proud to be able to point out that the general thrust of these can all be found in the section of the Police and Crime Plan for Gloucestershire under the heading ‘A green and pleasant county for now and in the future’. We all have a part to play in ensuring we live in a society that is fair, just and compassionate. As the plan states, that extends to animals and their ability to live a life free of cruelty.\nThe Constabulary employs almost 1800 people, owns many buildings and operates more than 400 vehicles and while I am Police and Crime Commissioner, it will operate in as responsible and sustainable a way as possible. Already, Gloucestershire is the only force in the UK to hold ISO 1400 1 accreditation which ensures the Constabulary measures energy consumption and reduces waste. Electrification of the police fleet will continue where operationally viable and emissions will be an increasing element alongside cost and performance when vehicles are purchased.\nElectric cars\nThe current fleet serves the county well but it appears we as consumers have been misled about the environmental credentials of some of these cars. I have made it a policy that in future, I will not allow the Constabulary to purchase or lease any vehicle where the manufacturer has been shown to deceive the public unless remedial measures have been taken.\nAnd if you want to go further back, we were the first county to highlight the seeping menace of cybercrime and make tackling it a police priority.\nGloucestershire is far from being the biggest force in the country but we can lay claim to being among the most innovative.",

That may be one symptom but it’s much more complex and the solution required will need to have many strands to it. Gloucestershire police are often called to incidents where people with mental health issues might be trying to self-harm and have a bladed weapon because the county is known to have a high level of self-harming.\nFinding a more effective way of tackling knife crime will be the first priority for a new body, created to enhance public safety in Gloucestershire.\nRecently Home Office Minister Sarah Newton referred to the growing body of evidence that suggested knife crime and youth violence should be viewed as a public health issue, echoing the approach taken in major American cities.",

As a result, West Mercia, the national police lead on dog theft, has praised Gloucestershire for doing more than other force in this area.\nA recent case\nOne example of this is the charging of a 24 year old man from Durham who was arrested after a van, allegedly containing more than 30 puppies, was stopped on the M6 last August.\nHe was originally arrested after a member of the public reported seeing dogs being loaded into the back of a van in Charlton Kings near Cheltenham.\nAnd, following a similar operation near Gloucester in February, more than a dozen dogs were seized and taken into protective custody before many of them were found news homes.\n“A Compassionate Approach” is embedded in the Constabulary’s corporate strategy.\nIt is the least all animals deserve.",

Those were words as a young detective constable in Gloucester that I remember Detective Inspector Wayne Murdoch saying back in 1993.\nHe was of course referring to the arrest of Bishop Peter Ball who was the subject of the BBC 2 documentary ‘Exposed, The Church’s Darkest Secret’ which was aired last week.\nThat was my only involvement in the case but I’ve led several child abuse inquiries and little shocks me. Yet the extent of Ball’s manipulation of the truth, his abuse of his position and privilege and his total lack of any care for his victims was something else. Every one of us should be saying, ‘Never again’\nI implore you to watch it. It’s not entertainment, but if we’re committed to a more caring future for our children we need to understand and acknowledge the past. What he did may seem unbelievable but it did happen – and in Gloucestershire.\nWe often hear that time and money should not be spent on ‘historic’ child abuse cases. It is a term I have used myself, but never again unless the victim has died. Because what is now clear to me is that for Ball’s victims the abuse they suffered will never be ‘historic; it is with them every day of their lives. The exception was Neil Todd for whom the suffering only ended when he could bear it no longer and he took his own life. Sadly, it’s an outcome I have heard many times from the now adult victims of child abuse.\nI frequently say Gloucestershire is one of the safest places in the country to live, and it is, but we cannot be complacent. Former Bishop Ball’s wickedness was carried out almost in plain sight; Fred West’s crimes went unnoticed for many years.\nIn the summer I gave the police two new areas on which to focus – burglary and the philosophy that ‘Every crime matters’. Every crime matters because every victim matters. The crimes Ball committed must never be denied or forgotten because as sure as night follows day, if they are, they will be repeated.\nThe work I have instigated and is being undertaken by Dame Janet Trotter to make Gloucestershire a ‘Child Friendly County’ is well underway and has received unanimous support from all the authorities including the church and gives us hope for the future.",

Whilst my meetings with the Chief Constable, his officers and staff reinforce that view it has also caused disappointment and anxiety among the workforce as they daily face demand that outstrips the resources they currently have.\n“Ring-fencing £1m will give the Chief Constable scope to address these issues while dealing with his other operational priorities”.\nYou\\’re paying more than ever\nThe cost of policing in Gloucestershire is now split almost 50/50 between the Government and local taxation. Taking into account the Government’s contribution, pay rises to the police already granted by the Home Office, inflation and additional cost increases, the local council tax precept had to go up by at least 2% to balance the books and prevent further cuts.\nA 2.7% increase, which allows for some investment, is less than inflation and also below the maximum 4% permitted by the Government without the need for a local referendum.\nIn contrast to some forces who will be forced to use this year’s central grant settlement to pay off debts, Gloucestershire is in a healthy financial position.

It is a change that both I and the Chief Constable welcome.\nFirstly I want to put this budget into context and to do so we should look back over the past 10 years. Since 2010 Gloucestershire Constabulary has had to manage 32 million pounds of cuts to its budget. It has been a core responsibility of mine to work with successive chief constables to manage those cuts which we all know have had a severe impact and consequences. Central Government cuts to the Constabulary ended in 2016, and were followed by a period of frozen grants from then until 2020.\nTo understand the change of policy in 2016, you would have to remember what happened in 2015. That year, we were told by both told by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and the Home Office that the cuts would continue and we were advised to prepare for a further 20% reduction in police budgets. So we made those preparations.\nI clearly remember the day the policy changed because it was a week after the Battaclan terrorist attack in Paris, where many people died. Police leaders across the UK made it very clear to the government that should further cuts be implemented the police service would not be prepared or able respond sufficiently to protect the public or prevent such attacks happening here in the UK. The only way left to manage further cuts would have to stop neighbourhood policing altogether, traditionally the golden thread running through the public’s relationship with the police.\nEven so, neighbourhood policing in 2015 had diminished to such a level that it was barely recognisable and I was not prepared to allow any further deterioration in Gloucestershire. I wanted to see improvements and so did the public. Indeed, it is my strong belief that neighbourhood policing is core to the model of policing that we enjoy in Gloucestershire.\nNeighbourhood policing was therefore the central plank of my manifesto for re-election in 2016 and remains fundamental to my vision of policing our county and will be core to my next police and crime plan. I commend the Constabulary for the progress it has made to protect and embrace neighbourhood policing to the extent it has now become the foundation upon which we build all other aspects of the policing here in Gloucestershire.\nBut let\\’s also be very clear and honest what we have now is not we had before the cuts and not where we want to be in the future. Austerity may have softened the deficit but I am not prepared to take the blame, nor should the police, for the inevitable consequences.\nIt is my view that the Gloucestershire Constabulary does not have, and for some considerable time has not had, the resources it needs to provide the level of service the people of Gloucestershire reasonably deserve and expect. In light of my last two budgets which saw sizable increases in the local council tax precept the organisation has begun to grow once more – by 70 officers and 30 staff over the last two years – but it is a slow process. These increases were not just desirable they were essential.\nSince I took office, the balance between what central government pays towards Gloucestershire police compared to local council tax payers has shifted considerably.10 years ago the ratio was 36% local 74% government now it’ about 50/50, a change of policy I don’t see changing much in the foreseeable future. But what that means is that if 50% of the funding is local, then the local population deserve an even louder voice and a better service. That is what I have been lobbying for over the last several years, and will continue to do.\nMy deputy and I undertook an extensive tour of the county last year and the Chief Constable and I have had held ‘meet the police events’, in all of the districts. I receive healthy levels of correspondence and have met dozens of local people throughout the year. That process, combined with meeting with Home Office Ministers and officials along with related research by my office has led me to refresh my police and crime plan with new areas of focus. These do not replace the existing plan but require an increased focus on\n• Burglary\n• The principle that every crime matters\n• An increased focus on rural and serious acquisitive crime\n• Embracing Child Friendly Gloucestershire.\nNone of these can be fully achieved without an enhancement to the way the police and the public communicate with each other.\nThe Constabulary, I\\’m pleased to report is in a healthy financial position; the books are balanced and this is very significant achievement that should be noted by the panel.\nCredit must go to my chief financial officer, Peter Skelton, to successive Chief Constables and to my office. On matters of finance, we have always been graded good or outstanding by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabularies, Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS).\nSometimes people ask, what does a PCC do? A good grasp of the finances is key to the success of any Commissioner and since day one I\\’ve taken the lead on finances. It takes up a large proportion of my time, but it has paid dividends. Many millions of pounds have been saved which can be directly attributed to interventions from my office and that work has contributed to the strong financial position we find ourselves in today. All increases from the government uplift, and increases realised from this precept, will be used for growth. That is not a position every force enjoys. We are building on very strong foundations.\nMy assumption is that panel members will have read the papers and will have questions.\nIf this budget is approved, and the government uplift programme is not amended to the detriment of Gloucestershire, the position is this: When the government uplift is combined with the uplift we began locally two years ago, the constabulary will grow by in excess of 300 officers and staff over the next three years. Whilst that is to be celebrated, it is nothing less than the Police Officers, staff and our residents deserve.\nI do not underestimate how hard it may prove to achieve that growth, neither does the Chief Constable and neither does the government. I am, however, very confident we will achieve it.\nOur new state of the art Training Centre – The Sabrina centre [in Berkeley] opens in May. Without that we could not have trained the officers and staff that we need to. Again, some ask what does a Commissioner do? Well the Sabrina Centre is something we did for the force and the county.\nThe Home Secretary Priti Patel has asked to be kept informed as have other organisations and forces. It will be a world class Training Centre, located here in Gloucestershire.\nAchieving the uplift for Gloucestershire is not without risk. The known risks at the moment are:\n• The Strategic Spending Review, which will take place next year,\n• A review of the police funding formula, the year after.\nI\\’m very grateful that at a recent meeting with all six of our county’s MPs, they agreed support this work and lobby Ministers and Government to make sure Gloucestershire is not disadvantaged. I\\’m very grateful for that.\nAnother risk identified by Government is attracting sufficient recruits in year three. In order to recruit 20,000 more we will have to recruit and train nearer 50,000. I am very confident Gloucestershire will achieve that, not least because of the work that\\’s been undertaken by the Chief Constable to make Gloucestershire Constabulary an ‘employer of choice’\nFinally, all of the above can only be achieved with the support of the public.\n10 years of cuts which corresponded with significant increases in demand and increased complexity has taken its toll and of course the public has noticed. And so has the government, by the way.\n2020 is the year we build on the very strong foundations we have laid. We have weathered the storms and weathered them well. The future looks brighter and will create many new opportunities.\nI have been very clear with the Chief Constable and his senior team that there must be an enhancement to the various ways that police and the public communicate with each other.\nThe Constabulary must also now embrace the principle of ‘every crime matters’\nThat is the reason I have created a fund of one million pounds for this work to commence immediately. That one million will be one off funding for this year but it can be converted into long term revenue funding by the Commissioner’s finance panel when assurances are given that the enhancements made are sustainable.\nI commend this budget to the panel; I recommend that the precept is increased by 2.7% which is less than the 4% that I am allowed to increase it by the government.\nIn doing so, I\\’ve taken into consideration the ability of households to pay and my responsibility to provide the Constabulary with sufficient funds to be both effective and efficient. For that I will continue to hold them to account on behalf of the public.\n[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row css_animation=\\”\\” row_type=\\”row\\” use_row_as_full_screen_section=\\”no\\” type=\\”full_width\\” angled_section=\\”no\\” text_align=\\”left\\” background_image_as_pattern=\\”without_pattern\\”][vc_column][/vc_column][/vc_row]",

The College of Policing defines these as “incidents where a witness or other evidence is likely to be lost”, and “a degree of urgency is still associated with immediate police action.”\nBurglary response time have doubled in just one year.\nWhen compared to figures from 2020/21, the deterioration in wait times was even more stark with Gloucestershire seeing their burglary response times more than double.\nGloucestershire must do better\nThe figures also revealed a disturbing postcode lottery, with response times varying significantly depending on the police force. The worst performing force was Northamptonshire, with a staggering average response time of 28 hours and 2 minutes for burglary calls. They were followed closely behind by Durham, where victims were left waiting nearly 26 hours for an officer to arrive. Meanwhile, average response times in Bedfordshire were nearly 15 minutes, while Cumbria response times sat at just a little over one hour.\nLets not just blame the Police, the Tory PCC didnt deliver either.\nIneffective resourcing have left local police forces overstretched, under-resourced and unable to effectively respond to local crime. In Gloucestershire the tory PCC failed to deliver even one of the extra 150 police officers he promised in his last election manifesto.\nThe public deserve better.\n“When someone has been the victim of a burglary, they deserve a swift response from the police. Yet thanks to the massive cuts by the Conservatives , this is increasingly out of reach.\n“Years of ineffective resourcing of local police forces by Conservative ministers mean that all too often, the basics of stopping and solving crime are missed.\n“The fact that traumatised burglary victims are being left waiting for hours, wondering if the police will even arrive, is unacceptable. To think that crucial evidence may be lost in the process too is unforgivable.\nIt’s time to return to a time where in Gloucestershire ‘every crime matters and every victim counts’ , so people can be confident that if they do fall victim to crime, the police will turn up and investigate properly.”",

Whilst in my early days as a police officer I did sometimes think that was the right course of action for lots of cases , as I’ve got older, and I hope wiser, I’ve changed my mind.\nWhilst there will always be some who must be locked-up, putting others behind bars without any rehabilitation is not the answer. And then there are those who, to my surprise – and who I’ve heard of on a trip to Eastwood Park Women’s prison this week – would rather be in prison than free in society. That’s right; some people actually want to be in prison!\nOne inmate I was told about referred to the prison in South Gloucestershire as “her home”. She was in a community where she felt most comfortable; where she had friends around her. She also knew that on the inside, she could get the help and services she needed quicker than if she was on the outside.\nAccommodation\nIt’s because of this and many other stories like it that my office is currently looking into the situation facing inmates on release from prison. One of the biggest problems is a lack of accommodation. When people are released from prison, often with little more than a couple of quid in their pocket; with no place to go and no one to welcome and integrate them back into society; the result is often predictable. They end up re-offending and going straight back to prison.\nIrrespective of whether the women I mentioned wanted to go back into prison, the simple truth is society is failing them. In some parts of the country, the answer is to give the prisoner a tent to take with them. A practical solution maybe but not one that I would advocate. I would rather see a system that works and provides for these vulnerable people and helps give them a second chance to make something of their lives.\nSupport\nThe cupboard isn’t completely bare and I am a big supporter of the Nelson Trust which does immense work with women and men struggling with addiction and other issues. People from the Trust regularly go into Eastwood Park and other prisons to offer help and support to those inside adjust to life on the outside. The prison governor and her team in Eastwood Park are also doing their best with limited resources to help their inmates move-on, but the sad truth is that too many of our criminals are stuck in a cycle of crime.\nHope & Despair\nThere can be no doubt that the system is creaking, only today in the Guardian there is a story about the state of our prisons, which highlights a “crumbling infrastructure” , added in the failed privatisation of the probation service which is failing offenders who do want to get on the straight and narrow.\nI came away from my visit to Eastwood Park feeling both happy and sad. Happy that the will is there from those working in the prison service, but sad that they, like the police, don’t have the tools to put their ideas into practice.",

In 2015, Martin as PCC helped get it off the ground with a grant of £40,000 from the Commissioner’s Fund.\nForest Fighting Fit caters for many young people who previously might have been hanging around on street corners. It has given them a focus and filled a void that might have otherwise led them towards trouble.\nOne of the young members has struggled with a condition most of his life told me that he has discovered the benefits of boxing which have had amazing results on his health. It’s helped him to keep fit and manage his aggressive behaviour. He went on to say that “The discipline of boxing has helped him control his anger and he’s found that he’s able to focus better at school which has also boosted his confidence.\nCommissioner\\’s Fund\nFor me that is such a good example of the work being done by Forest Fighting First which is replicated by many other Commissioner’s Fund projects around the county.\nForest Fighting Fit is one of more than 400 projects supported through the Commissioner’s Fund since 2012 to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour throughout the county.\nIt operates at the Miners’ Welfare Hall in Cinderford on every Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings and most Sunday mornings.\nTackling ASB without the need for the police\nWhat I really like about this particularly project is that it is a community initiative aimed at dealing with ASB but also about offering young people a place for them to hang out. One of the main reasons I was passionate about joining Martin as his deputy is that the “AND CRIME” element of the PCC role is the arena we and the Office of the PCC can really make an impact. It’s about helping to reduce the demand on the police but also making our communities safer and more cohesive.\nIf you’ve read this and think it might be a good place for you or someone you know, new members and volunteers are welcome and can get in touch on 07790025743 or visit the ‘White Lotus Martial Arts and Fitness’ facebook page.",

This public spat is unsightly and a distraction.\nI maintain it was the right decision to look at the governance of the fire service and believe if both blue light services are closer aligned working to one plan, the public will get a better service. And for me its about the public and not about who owns or runs what.\nCommitted to reform\nThe Minister in his letter to me hasn’t ruled out the change happening, in fact he says he is committed to the reform agenda.\nHere are just some of Nick Hurd’s words:\nWe remain fully committed to emergency services collaboration and to the\npolicy of enabling PCCs to take on fire governance.I am grateful for your ongoing engagement on this agenda and I look forward to hearing more from you and the Fire and Rescue Authority about the progress you are making together.\nBut sadly the government’s commitment to this agenda, has fallen on deaf ears when it comes to councillors and especially the lead councillor responsible for the fire service , councillor Dave Norman.\nI said at the beginning in conversations with the leader of the county council, Mark Hawthorne that I didn’t want to “take over” fire, but wanted our two emergency services more aligned, but by taking an oppositional approach from day one, with a lack of transparency has made working with them difficult.\nI urge councillors to put aside this petty political point scoring and remember why we are elected to represent the public.\nI was told that the fire service had “governance and scrutiny at every level”, this I believe has been exposed with a raft of stories and allegations which have come to light.\nMis-information\nWhat has frustrated me the most about this debate, is the amount of lies and mis information spread about me, the plans and my motivation. I’ve heard rumours relating to the fact I have plans to change the terms and conditions of fire officers – FALSE to the fact I will take over the running of the fire service – FALSE.\nThankfully my office has produced a list of frequently asked questions click here to read through them.\nWhat next?\nMy determination and resolve has not wavered, because we owe it to the men and women of the fire service to enable them to do their job to the best of their abilities working closely with the police as enshrined in law.\nOne of the outcomes from doing the initial work looking at a change in governance ( paid for by the government ) was the idea of a collaboration board. I setup this up and remain committed to driving change through that. Officers in both the police and fire are getting on with some quick wins. But for real fundamental change to get better outcomes for the public, this will only happen when the two blue light services are closer aligned and sadly with the current administration at the county council who have declared an “air war” on me, that remains unlikely.",

It does, and when it does happen it can be devastating.\nBut I will not increase the fear of crime by taking statistics out of context to fit a certain narrative.\nA month or so ago I had my office prepare a presentation for councillors and members of the Police & Crime Panel to give them the full facts, no spin, but the full context. Those figures can be seen by clicking here.\nFear of crime\nDince being PCC I have worked with organisations and communities in our rural areas to make them as safe as they can be and I pledge to continue doing that.\nThrough early intervention and prevention and working with organisations and our local councils together will we keep our communities safe.\nElection questions\nOne organisation I have worked with closely is the National Farmer\\’s Union.\nI believe we\\’ve worked well together and look forward to that relationship continuing.\nThe NFU recently sent me a series of questions so that they could let their members know where I stand on certain issues.\nBelow is the questions and my response.\nNFU Questions :\n1)Tell us your ambitions for rural policing in Gloucestershire\nSince being PCC in 2012 I have listened to the concerns of rural Gloucestershire and as the voice of the public in policing have pushed for accessible and visible policing across all of the county. That is a real challenge in a large rural county like ours.\nI believe the closure of many small rural police stations and police houses well before I became commissioner has left a lasting legacy and the feeling of lack of presence especially in some rural communities. Whilst I would love to put them all back, the resources aren’t there and I will be truthful and honest with you and not just offer things to get votes. But I do have some new ideas going forward.\nI hope my actions over the last 8 years have shown that I have pushed for greater investment in supporting our rural communities and rural policing. From the establishment of our rural crime unit, specialist equipment for dealing with rural crime, to it being embedded in my policing plan under the Green & Pleasant county priority.\nOn being re-elected in 2016, and with austerity easing from 2018 onwards, we’ve been able to put back resources into community policing and the essential preventative work – so I am proud that under my leadership\n- We now have rural and environmental crime officers\n- We have pushed working with communities and landowners through the use of the Whatsapp group\n- I am a founding member of the National Rural Crime Network and\n- Your force in Gloucestershire is now being recognised regionally, nationally and internationally for best practice.\nSo I believe we have a lot to celebrate but always more to do.\n2) What are the main challenges and opportunities for rural policing in Gloucestershire, and how will you work to support farming businesses?\nFear of crime and reassurance is a huge part of the challenge.\nWhilst our rural communities do have a much lower crime rate than other areas of the country and county, that doesn’t mean if you are a victim of crime in a rural area you feel it any less.\nTackling fear of crime is something I am working on with, for example, Cotswold District Council through their community safety partnership.\nRelationships are so important and I remain committed to ensuring our Rural & Environmental crime officers, along with our neighbourhood policing teams, are embedded in our rural communities and are visible and accessible to you. One of the biggest challenges is to continue to be consistently proactive.\nThe force has carried-out some really good operations and campaigns and there has been some good cross border activity too. The challenge is doing it more regularly and consistently but it presents an opportunity too.\nWe have seen some great proactive investment in crime prevention – such as the miles of bunds we’ve done together to protect farmland – and, wherever possible, I want to support our landowners, farmers and rural residents do all they can to protect themselves and therefore make them less likely to fall victim to crime.\nWe also have the Commissioner’s Fund which has heavily supported some communities but can and should be utilised better for the benefit of our rural areas too.\n3)What will your first 100 days look like?\nThe last year has been hard on everyone. People are tired. But my energy and that of my office is concentrated on working with the police to try new things, to innovate but also to realise when things are working well.\nSo my first 100 days will be to continue being a strong voice for all our communities in policing, encouraging innovation, relationships and continue working together to keep Gloucestershire safe.\nSince being PCC my door has always been open to regular meetings with the NFU & CLA as well as others from our rural communities and that partnership approach of working together will continue.\nAfter a decade of austerity and despite the recent surge in recruitment, we’ve still not been able to recruit enough volunteers and Specials to replace those lost.\nI’m afraid the suggestion made by others that Gloucestershire could recruit 300 officers at a stroke is both unrealistic and unworkable.\nHowever, we now have a plan in place to get recruitment back on track and one of my commitments is around training for “rural specials” who understand some of the specific needs of rural communities and rural areas and this training is already underway.\nOver the last decade crime has gone up everywhere without exception, though Gloucestershire has seen the second lowest crime rise of anywhere other than Thames Valley. We are 5th lowest for crime nationally, but we want to be better and through an embedded plan and a commitment from me and the Chief Constable to continue working with you, I believe we can succeed in keeping our county one of the safest places to live, work and play.\n4) How will you ensure crimes in rural areas are consistently reported?\nI’ve made a commitment to invest £1 million a year on public contact, as part of my Every Crime Matters priority which is embedded in my police and crime plan.\nThat priority is my challenge to the force, on your behalf, and I will hold them to account to see it is fulfilled.\nYou might have seen the recent Click, Call and Connect campaign, I expect this to be an on-going campaign and conversation with the public around engagement and accessibility of the police.",

That is the only conclusion I can draw from the council’s request to the National Fire Chiefs’ Council (NFCC) to withdraw their invitation to me to address their national conference.\n‘Sticks and stones’ you might think but this is the latest episode in a worrying trend. It’s a blatant attack on free speech and I’m not prepared to ignore it any longer.\nFor those of you who may not know, this is because I was charged by the Home Office to carry out a review to decide who is most fit to oversee our fire and rescue service – the county council or my office. During that time, and it’s been going on for almost two years, the county council has unashamedly declined to co-operate, effectively refusing to speak to me; they forbade firefighters from talking to me or taking part in a public consultation even though as members of the public they were perfectly entitled; they have now leaned on the NFCC to stop me talking to them and have even blocked me from saying hello in person to Gloucestershire’s new Chief Fire Officer.\nWhat have they got to hide?\nIf their record of governance is as good as councillors claim, why didn’t they just show me the evidence? Why didn’t they let their firefighter employees talk to me about what a good job they are doing? And why try to influence a consultation by telling the people who are most affected not to take part?\nI would have enjoyed the opportunity to speak to the country’s chief fire officers but as my report, and its conclusions, has already gone to the Home Office, it would have been too late to change anything.\nSadly, the council’s intransigent opposition has made this whole exercise unnecessarily unpleasant.

Look at it now and it’s not only the hair styles and fashions that have changed.\nThe photographs and advertisements provide a fascinating insight how much the world in which we live is different and how the police have had to adapt to keep pace.\nWith the official re-launch of Coleford Police Station as the Forest of Dean Police Station, no doubt the headline writers will make much of the fact that it is the last one in the area where, in 1993, we read there were 11. It is a good line and I understand how the media works.\nBut that is only part of the story, distorted through the prism of nostalgia, because this is not an area where you can compare like with like.\nOf those eleven police stations, the majority were manned by constables. Twenty years ago, computers were in their infancy and radios didn’t work in most parts of the Forest. Connectivity, if not impossible, was very difficult and more often than not, officers had to keep in touch through public call boxes.\nAs a uniformed sergeant in Lydney in 1995, I went on patrol and was also responsible for custody. Offenders then could be left unsupervised for long periods – unthinkable now. The Cinderford Community Concern Group was looking forward to the launch of a new confidential hotline. That has now been overtaken by Crimestoppers which has a 24-hour nationwide network.\nIn today’s landscape, Coleford is at the centre of the Forest of Dean police hub. Cinderford, Lydney and Newent – where the constabulary retains a presence, albeit in other public buildings – are its spokes.\nTechnology has improved immeasurably since the early days of analogue radios. Today’s equipment was chosen specifically with officers who work in rural areas in mind and tested extensively in the Forest to make sure it works. It means officers can communicate with clarity and confidence.\nThey have been liberated from their desktop computers and can stay on patrol where the public want them for a greater proportion of their shift. Now, when you are encouraged to approach them in a coffee bar or on the street, they can take or provide information on a hand-held device\nI understand that many lament the loss of their village police station but we cannot blame it all on cost cutting measures when post offices and pubs have gone the same way. Even former giants like Rank Xerox have left the Forest. Sad though it may be, it is the natural wastage of an ever changing world. We may not have quite as many bobbies on the beat as people would like but they are better equipped for their more varied and more complex workload.\nSaving Coleford, when it was earmarked for closure, was a promise I made before I was first elected in 2012 and I had no idea then how difficult that would be to achieve. But since the Ministry of Justice agreed to the sale, a great deal of time and effort has been put in by many people into improving the environment for officers, staff and visitors.\nPeople in the Forest of Dean have told me how important it is for law enforcement in the area to retain its own identity. I believe that developing Coleford as a hub for the Police and other criminal justice services like the Community Rehabilitation Company, National Probation Service and providing a space for use by the community is crucial to that.\nThe Coleford based hub is now a site people who live in the Forest of Dean can both respect and be proud of.",

Damningly, the report says,\n‘What is worrying in this case is the noticeable absence of hearing the voice of Megan – and when she did raise concerns it was not fully explored or acted upon sufficiently.\nMegan’s daily life was one of severe physical and mental neglect and abuse. Her life was without love or affection.\nAt the age of six she was admitted to hospital and described as ‘acutely unwell’.\nFrom the day of her birth, Megan’s status in this world was that of a ‘Child in care’.\nThe reality was care seemed to be missing.

I’m not sure I like that as a general rule, but I can live with it provided there’s very strong independent oversight and regulation that reassures me it’s a force for good.\nIt is often said we police by consent, a phrase that is commonly used, but not always understood. In the context of the lockdown, it simply means that the vast majority of the public support the measures with little need for any enforcement by the police.\n“Anyone who engages in social media will know the vast range\nof views on how we should behave during the lock down”\nEqually, it means the vast majority are supportive of the way the police conduct themselves; how they apply the law and exercise discretion – and that remains a cornerstone of policing in Gloucestershire.\nOverall, I think the Chief Constable has got it about right. His officers not only had to apply the law, but also interpret government instructions and guidance that are somewhat ambiguous. Friendly advice has been given along with stern warnings and penalty tickets and hopefully public support has been maintained. However, anyone who engages in social media will know the vast range of views on how we should behave during the lock down.\nAs we move into week four of at least six weeks of lockdown I welcome the Government’s affirmation that our beautiful parks and open spaces should remain open as they are an asset to minimise the strain on those who don’t have gardens or live in flats or basements, especially those who have children or other specific needs.\nHopefully it doesn’t lead to a stampede and that those of us for which the lockdown is less of a burden give way to others less fortunate so that social distancing can be maintained.\nThis post was published on the official OPCC website on the 23/4/2020",

However, road deaths and injuries are not inevitable.\nThe past few decades have demonstrated how effectively a comprehensive road safety strategy can reduce the numbers of people killed and injured on the roads.\nThe Commissioner’s Fund has supported many successful programmes and initiatives and will continue to do so but the core work of the Road Safety Partnership must and will be protected. Drive for Life events must be available to all secondary schools, rural road safety campaigns must continue and to do so the Road Safety Partnership will be refreshed with a new operating model supported by a new business plan.\nI understand the County Council must seek to get the most out of every pound spent on its services and will be making very difficult decisions on where to reduce spending. Road safety cannot be immune to these financial realities but there are many reasons to protect road safety spending as much as possible. It is an ethically, socially and economically sound policy area that delivers real cost savings and improves peoples’ lives and I call upon the County Council to protect this funding.\nExperience of working with voluntary disability groups has shown me the difficulty for people using wheel chairs or pushing prams who often find the pavement blocked by inconsiderate parking. Whilst parking issues clearly sit within the remit of local authorities the police will work with them to reduce danger and ensure the free rite of passage for pedestrians, parents with prams & pushchairs and in particular those with mobility needs.\nEqually, Gloucestershire’s motorists and cyclists cannot enjoy or move along our roads in safety unless and until the plague of potholes blighting our county is finally resolved. I will call upon Gloucestershire County Council and Highways England to set out its plan to eradicate potholes from our county.\nEveryone – whether on foot, bicycle, horse, motorcycle or car – must be able to share our roads in safety.\nI do not propose anything I cannot achieve, unlike my opponents who make promises they are powerless to keep because they relate to decisions that rest solely with the Chief Constable.

It’s possible many people still don’t know about the PCC and the significant role he plays in the life of Gloucestershire. I say ‘he’ because Martin Surl became the county’s first elected commissioner in 2012 and re-elected in 2016.\nDuring my year as High Sheriff, our paths crossed many times when I saw his work first hand and that is why I feel qualified to endorse Mr. Surl as the best candidate. There are many reasons for this.\nBeing ‘the first’ in anything is difficult but he has established the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner as a credible driving force for good within the county. He has successfully integrated local volunteers and communities into an overall strategy for preventing and reducing crime and anti-social behaviour – work, incidentally, that is much admired by many other PCCs – and any parent with a child who is about to learn to drive should be grateful for the huge investment made in safer driving programmes aimed at young people who are statistically the most vulnerable of our road users.\nAll of this has been quite apart from his core responsibilities of managing the police budget, holding the chief constable to account, overseeing the biggest re-organisation of Gloucestershire police in 40 years and re-designing the police estate and saving local taxpayers many millions of pounds into the bargain.\nMaybe I should declare an interest here as I also agree with Mr. Surl that the Police and Crime Commissioner should not be a party politician.

While I am Police and Crime Commissioner, it will operate in as responsible and sustainable a way as possible.\nAlready Gloucestershire is the only force in the UK to hold ISO 14001 accreditation which gives advice on how to measure consumption and reduce waste. It will not only maintain that accreditation but will go further by seeking new opportunities to reduce waste & pollution.\nBy the end of 2016, I will expect the Constabulary to have conducted a root and branch audit of its environmental footprint. The Constabulary is planning how best to continue to harness technology and achieve digital transformation and I will also ask the Chief Constable to present to me a plan to operate in a paperless environment.\nRe-cycling will become the norm, not the exception, with opportunities to contribute located in all police buildings.

It also has one of the worst accident records.\nWith Gloucestershire Constabulary due to take back control of local roads policing in April 2019, it’s the sort of operation that I want to see repeated more often.\nThis is not about bashing the motorist.

This is a new model of collaborative roads policing which, if it proves a success, can be put into practice elsewhere.\n“My Police and crime plan has always been about creating a change of culture on our roads.

I exempt staff from criticism. Their job would be challenging under any circumstances, yet they manage to rise above their jaded working environment on a daily basis.\nBut if we don’t plan for the future, I fear we will find local justice being dispensed in Bristol and that must not be allowed to happen.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is aware and appear susceptible to a new, multi-court building at Quedgeley. I recently raised it informally with Cotswolds MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, who saw merit, and Gloucester MP Richard Graham, who, it has been reported, is happy to leave it to the MoJ following his own unsuccessful lobbying.\nLib Dem Councillor Jeremy Hilton wants any new building in the city, possibly within the King’s Quarter development.\nWhilst it is true a new courthouse has been on the city council’s agenda for several years, all previously suggested locations have been sold for development. And would a courthouse really fit alongside the high quality restaurants and other leisure outlets planners visualise for the Kings Quarter showpiece?\nIf Mr. Hilton’s plan is realistic, I would happily support him but, right now, I believe Quedgeley fits the bill for a number of reasons.\nAs Police and Crime Commissioner, I own the land earmarked so building a new courthouse there would save taxpayers the cost of buying a site. The park and ride across the road provides good public transport links; junction 12 of the M5 is also nearby and offers easy access to the motorway network.\nIt’s even closer to Gloucestershire’s custody facility, resulting in more substantial savings in building costs. Whilst replacing the existing courts would release valuable re-development land in Gloucester and Cheltenham.\nThis would be a courthouse for the whole of the county. But if people allow vested local interests to give the impression we are not united, the Ministry of Justice will go somewhere else – and Gloucestershire will be left behind as usual.",

  "https_policecommissioner_net_/https_policecommissioner_net_the-kids-are-all-right-youth-project-breaks-down-barriers-with-the-police/content_105.html": "The last piece of significant research into the attitudes of young people towards the police did not make for comfortable reading. It found that a large proportion of young people either feared or lacked trust in law enforcement.\nThe report, by an the All-Party Parliamentary group for Children, stated that ‘some children and young people feel humiliated by the police and are convinced that the aim of the police is to target and undermine them’.\nThat research was published in 2014, and whilst I feel that Gloucestershire is by no means the worst example when it comes to the relationship between young people and the police, there was undoubtedly room for improvement.\nTwo years on and I am pleased to report progress is being made through the Youth Forums Project which sets out to bring police officers and young people together, in an informal setting, with a view to breaking down clichés and preconceptions that both groups hold about each other.\nThe aim of the project was twofold: To identify, challenge and resolve negative perceptions that police officers and young people hold about each other; and to foster wider community benefits. The police officers involved were drawn from a range of ranks and roles including criminal investigation and neighbourhood policing. Similarly the young people came from a diverse range of socio-economic backgrounds to ensure the widest possible variety, of experiences.\nThere were ‘ice-breaker’ activities, where the groups got to know one another on a more ‘human’ level and ‘see past the uniform’. There were games and activities that focused on restorative justice, which, helped by the informal setting, personalised the environment and lessened the pressure.\nOver pizza, there were ‘lively’ discussions about how the two groups were perceived, how they perceived each other and what could be done to break down barriers that existed between the police and young people in general. In a setting such as this, where everyone had a chance to meet and talk, it became a whole lot easier to pose difficult questions and express long-held views and grievances in an atmosphere where different opinions were respected and taken seriously.\nThe project is run by Charlotte Calkin and Paul Mukasa from Restorative Gloucestershire. The evaluation, commissioned by the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner, has just been released, with research conducted by the School of Natural and Social Sciences at the University of Gloucestershire.\nBefore the sessions, police officers were asked for their impressions of young people they deal with as a part of their job. The project evaluation report states that the police officers believed that there was a ‘lack of respect’; that ‘young people could not see beyond the uniform’ and that ‘they [young people] were unwilling to take personal responsibility for their behaviour.\nOne police officer said before the sessions that “when [young people] are in a group they are difficult to talk to but when you get them on a one-to-one basis it is okay”\nAnother simply stated “I know why [young people] don’t like us, it is because we tell them what to do and they don’t like it”.\nThere was a similar negative reaction to the police from the young people taking part. A widely held view beforehand was that “police officers are all the same”, that police officers are often “intimidating in their demeanour and behaviour” and that police officers “do not respect young people”.\nWhen recalling a previous involvement with the police, one young person said “I just wasn’t taken seriously; as soon as I turned up with an adult suddenly it mattered”. Another believed that “police officers are a law unto themselves”.\nThankfully, the sessions led to a change of heart on both sides. The police officers who attended acknowledged that “the uniform can be intimidating” and the police need to make themselves more approachable.\nOne said, “I’ve learned that everybody absorbs information differently and we need to adapt our approaches to make sure some young people don’t develop negative views of the police”. Another said “I’ve learned that I should be wary of categorising people and will always keep an open mind”.\nOthers identified possible ways of bringing this sort of positive engagement to other parts of Gloucestershire with officers expressing an interest in taking the idea into schools.\nThe positive impact on young people was also evident in these comments.\n“Police officers are not as scary as had been made out” and that young people shouldn’t stereotype police officers, because “they are not all the same”, said one.\n“I learnt that the media do not always tell the full story about the police. I know now I should not be scared to go up to the police and talk to them in future”, said another.\nOne young person said that after meeting the police officers and talking to them, they now understood that the police were there to help them, and that they should be respected. Others commented that they felt more trust towards the police, that they would be more confident in approaching an officer and that “they are actually nice people sometimes”.\nFrom the day I was elected, I have prioritised helping Young People Become Adults and it will again be a priority in my new plan for 2017-21. It is a broad priority with aims ranging from developing a new approach to working with young offenders, to encouraging the Constabulary to develop community programmes to tackle knife crime. Young people are faced with many issues in modern society, and I want that the Constabulary to play its part in getting messages across about internet safety, sexual exploitation and drug and alcohol abuse.\nIt is crucial that we deliver sensitive, relevant and effective policing to ensure that our young people become law-abiding, productive members of society. I want the ‘system’ to work for young people, not against them, and this is what the Young People Becoming Adults priority focuses on. But at the heart of all of these aims, and the key to their success, is improving relations between young people and the police. If we are to have a safer, happier, more inclusive community, then we need young people onside.\nFor relations to improve there has to be a level of trust and respect from both sides and we need young people and the police on board, willing to engage with and most importantly, humanise each other. We must consider the clichés in order to break them down; society is quick to generalise a group of young people as potentially troublesome, and it is true that for some young people, uniformed police officers can look intimidating. Change has to be a team effort.\nDue to the obvious success of the project, the research team at the University of Gloucestershire has recommended that the Youth Forums Project be extended so that more young people and police officers can benefit from this type of interaction. I wholeheartedly agree with these recommendations.\nIt is fantastic that this project was a triumph and that both the police officers and the young people involved felt that they had been listened to and made a positive, productive impact. I hope to see a continuation of this initiative so that all of our communities can benefit from better relations between our police force and our young people.\nMany thanks to Restorative Gloucestershire , the University of Gloucestershire and all of the young people and Police Officers who took part.",
