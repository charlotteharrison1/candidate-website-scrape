Why should we be concerned?\n@dominictristram Record Migration Figures\n♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nI just wanted to say a quick thing on, the UK net migration figures, which are a record breaking high up 20%, 606,000 people, I think, are the latest figures per year. I think it’s worth just dwelling on the fact that many of the people who voted for Brexit did so because they didn’t like the idea of migration and how they must be feeling now because we’ve gone from lower numbers of people coming in and let’s face it, not liking migration is often, not always, but often due to racism, you know?\nPeople who don’t come from here coming in. And so these brexiters, now these, people who voted sometimes with a racist motive against staying in EU because they didn’t like migration, now have far more immigrants. But, those immigrants are now much less likely to be other white Europeans and much more likely to be people from other countries of different races. Now, how do you think they feel about that?\nI think if there is a silver lining from Brexit, and I don’t think there is particularly, but if there was one, it might be just imagining how many extremely annoyed racists there are at the moment.",

Or not.\nIt was hard to avoid the item on the news this morning about a group claiming that 'green taxes' are 'making billions'... far more, it is claimed, than the cost of pollution itself. Stating that fines and taxes are 'revenue generation' as if this is a bad thing is an old argument of course, and one that is often used against speed cameras. However, in this case the target is a much more serious one than speed cameras as it's an issue that is of vital importance to the whole world.\nFirst let us look at the claims. Apparently 'green taxes' brought in 21.9 billion last year, while the emissions had done 11.7 billion worth of 'damage'. 'Green taxes' here include things like fuel duty - hardly a green tax.. more like something that the government has always charged. It also includes landfill tax and other taxes that could be considered green of course, but the scope is rather wide. What they actually mean therefore is a collection of taxes that is levied against things that may harm the environment, rather than green taxes in particular.\nWhat I really have a problem with is the 'cost' of emissions they have come up with. Just how have they calculated this, exactly? Is the 'cost' of a landfill the amount it would be to dig it all up? No - it's the cost of burning-off the methane. I don't think that their idea of costs and mine, or any normal person, are quite the same. Also, how do you put a cost on the effect of a ton of CO2 going into the atmosphere and having some part in flooding yet more of Bangladesh? No, the whole 'cost' is a nonsense. 'Green' taxes aren't there to level some sort of account we have with the environment, they're there to stop people polluting in the first place. The only thing that will make some people stop is to hit them in the wallet, since appealing to their morals seems to fail. People must be priced out of their cars and flights, and motivated into recycling by the cost of not doing it. Society isn't profiteering from this, just making people pay something closer to the real cost of their selfish ways.\nFinally, just who are The Tax Payers Alliance? Well, take a look. Surprise surprise, they are the usual right-wing nutjobs. Just who let a story by these people make the headlines? The chairman Andrew Allum left the Tories 'having lost faith that it represented his brand of free market, individualist and compassionate politics', that is to say that they probably weren't quite right-wing enough for him. The chief executive, Matthew Elliot, is a young chap who has worked for 'Britain’s leading Eurorealist think-tank', so he's clearly going to look at European issues objectively, right?

Letter To The Bath Chronicle About the NHS Changes and Circle\np(meta). 21st November 2011\nHere’s a letter I sent to the Bath Chronicle that was published this week.\nSir,\nThe recent news that Hinchingbrooke Hospital is being handed-over to the private healthcare company Circle to run is a timely reminder of the fact that our MP Don Foster voted for the controversial Health and Social Care Bill.\nDespite coalition assurances that this would not lead to privatisation, we are already seeing that this is as true as David Cameron’s promise of ‘no top-down reorganisation of the NHS’. After all, what is the handing-over of an NHS hospital to the private sector if not privatisation?\nCircle are not the friendly sounding ‘John Lewis’ style mutual often portrayed - more than half of the business is owned by ex bankers and speculators including Tory party donors such as Paul Ruddock and Crispin Odey. It is based in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands, so while NHS money is going to make some Tory donors very wealthy they are not even going to pay tax on the profits. It’s worth remembering that it was Labour who started negotiations to give control of Hinchingbrooke to profit-making companies, and it was is their market-based NHS changes that allowed the current coalition NHS dismemberment to take place so quickly.\nThis is the sort of NHS that Don Foster and his coalition supporters voted for. They are trading our health for their donors’ profits. The Green Party is the only party that is fighting for a public NHS working for people, not profit.\nDominic Tristram Bath and North East Somerset Green Party Odd Down Bath",

On the one hand, I completely and utterly disapprove of politicisation of the police brought-about by this government via its elections for Police Commissioners. The fact that those elected will ‘earn’ so much money for it (85,000 per year here) and that nobody wanted these elections in the first place doesn’t help.\nIf a minimum turnout threshold was required for validity of the whole election things would be clear-cut - I would not vote, and general voter apathy would be the end of it. However, that isn’t the case, so I must vote since, as this article points out, not voting lets the loonies in. Thankfully there are no EDL or other far-right candidates in my area, but someone will be elected whether I like it or not, so I must mitigate the possible damage.\nI am left with the choice (in Avon and Somerset) of three candidates from the three Old Parties and an independent, Sue Mountstevens.\nTo keep politics out of policing should I vote for Sue Mountstevens? I’ve read her whole Web site and I’m still not sure how authoritarian she is. Actually, what she does say is a good example of how pointless this election is. It’s all very well saying she’ll respond to concerns, improve transparency, etc etc, but all of the candidates say that. What does she really think? And how much scope do any of the candidates have to do anything anyway? There isn’t much, from what I can tell, and again this illustrates how pointless these elections are.\nFor all of their faults, the Liberal Democrats generally stand for tolerance and socially liberal policies, so isn’t their candidate a safter bet, despite the political influence? Not voting for a Lib Dem candidate just because of the things they’ve done in government, such as destroying the NHS, seems rather petty when the alternative is likely to be worse when it comes to crime and policing.\nLabour have repeatedly proved themselves to be far too authoritarian when it comes to crime and punishment, so much so that there’s not much between them and the Tories. They use dogma and ideology as a basis for their crime and punishment policies, which are generally of the ‘string them up’ kind, despite all evidence showing that it’s not an effective way to cut crime. Anyone interested in actually cutting crime cannot vote for these policies. Whatever actual scope they have to influcence policing policy as a PCC, the fact that they have those thoughts in the first place makes them unsuitable candidates for my vote.\nSo, what to do? I have still to decide. I will try to find out more about Sue Mountstevens, but overall I am sad that I am being forced to vote for someone in an election I think is completely wrong-headed in the first place. How can the Tories claim that there is no place for democracy in the Lords and then introduce it into the police, possibly the last place politics should be involved?\nI urge you to vote, especially if you have EDL and the like standing in your area. Racists cannot be allowed to run our police, and by not voting you might let them in. Even if you don’t have any such candidates we should all give it some thought and vote appropriately. Boycotting this election is not giving the government a ‘bloody nose’ - given that the elections will happen regardless, you may well end-up with a police service that goes in the opposite direction you want.",

But this plan means there will be less parking for patients.\nMost staff get to hospitals well before patients and visitors. At the moment the cost will encourage some to walk, get the bus, cycle, et cetera. What do you think the effect will be if they all know they can get a space for free all day? Many of those who currently use other methods to get to work will drive. It is obvious. And so fewer spaces will be available for everyone else.\nThen there is the problem of people who will park at the hospital to do the shopping et cetera. Why wouldn’t they if it is free?\nNow I am not saying that there aren’t problems with low paid staff having to pay to park at work, patients and visitors paying to be ill, etc etc. But this policy is massively simplistic and won’t help anyone apart from staff ho want to drive and the lucky few others who find a space.\nWe should be finding ways of encouraging anyone who is physically able and doesn’t have to drive not to drive to hospital and, if that is impossible, working to make it possible. If you stop people who don’t have to drive driving, there is plenty of space for people who can’t.\nNote: Corbyn would still be a much better PM than May, just in case anyone takes any criticism to think I’m suggesting otherwise.",

This measure, ineffective at actually stopping any serious crime, has been widely slammed in regard to loss of our privacy. We would have the most intrusive state in Europe.\nBut Bath MP Ben Howlett must consider other consequences. He claims to support the cluster of technology companies vital to Bath and Bristol, but as someone who has worked in such companies for the last 15 years I can assure him that if his government’s plans to end secure Internet communication happen, a huge number of these companies will leave the UK.\nIt is tempting for governments to be seen to be ‘doing something’. I suggest that Mr Howlett considers just how bad such draconian laws are, not just for the privacy of the people of Bath, but for the economy too.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2017_07_14_nhs-vacancies_html/content_61.html": "You may have seen the news today about the scale of NHS vacancies that is threatening hospitals all over the country with closed wards and services.\nRegardless of current issues around pay and Brexit, the articifical and ideological imposition of an internal market has been making this problem worse for years. When a hospital starts to have issues then it can set off a vicous circle that just makes it worse until it is forced to cut services. For example, one hospital not a million miles away from where I live in Bath started having problems recruiting staff for its Emergency Department. If you want to work in an ED do you pick a hospital where you will be one of too few staff trying to hold a struggling department together, or would you choose to work just down the road in a safer ED where you are more likely to have the support you need?\nThere are solutions to this problem, such as hospitals buying each other and becoming multi-site, then allocating staff as required. However, this is difficult and staff can still understandably resist such moves. Unfortunately the very idea of the internal market, where hospitals are forced to compete, forces these issues to occur. Added to this, hospitals require a number of different services and specialists to support things like an ED, and if those services are lost then there can be knock-on effects.\nOf course, on top of this generally problematic structure of enforced competition has come years of pay caps, cuts and destructive policies have brought the NHS to a cliff edge, but Brexit has been the final straw that has pushed it over the edge. Hospitals around the country now regularly cannot staff to safe levels. We’ve seen more nurses and midwives leaving the NHS than joining, with the main reason given by them being staffing levels and workload. Again, this is a vicious circle - as numbers fall, other staff will start to think the same way. Everyone has a limit to their tolerence.\nThe government must immediately reinstate NHS bursaries and go on a recruitment drive for students. Of course they won’t, because the Tory plan has always been to destroy the NHS, and that is coming along nicely. Sadly, even if there was a change of government tomorrow and proper recruitment started, the new staff won’t be available for three years.\nTry not to get ill.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2013_03_20_budget_html/content_194.html": "Today George Osborne revealed his latest budget. There were no huge surprises - the economy is considerably worse than predicted yet again, and potentially positive-sounding news about borrowing not rising this year turned-out to be the same sort of ‘creative accounting’ that the government mocked the Brown government for. Basically, austerity has made the economy flat-line, and we’ll be lucky to avoid a triple-dip recession in this, the worst economic performance the UK has given for the last 100 years.\nBut it’s not all doom and gloom… or so the government would like us to think by making a few transparently crowd-pleasing announcements. There’s the unexpected drop of 1p on a pint of beer, and a more-or-less expected drop of the fuel escalator. The beer thing is a ridiculous move that doesn’t really benefit anyone individually (who will notice?), but as a nation will cost a good few nurses salaries. The 3p rise in fuel duty not only reduces money coming to the Treasury, but does nothing to combat congestion, pollution and climate change. While this is not surprising from our current government, it is an expensive, populist and pointless move however you look at it.\nThe rise in the personal allowance to 10,000 pounds earlier than planned is a good thing, as it reduces the tax burden on the poorest. However, this is really offset by mad policies such as giving money to households earning up to 300,000 a year for childcare but not giving it to the poorest.\nThen, of course, there’s the extension of the public sector pay cap of 1% for another year, along with a new provision to stop increases in pay when staff move up bands. It’s a sorry sign of how much this government values its nurses and teachers that by the next general election they will have received an effective 10% pay cut. To put this is perspective, today Barclays announced it was paying nine bankers a combined bonus of 39 million pounds. It seems that nursing the sick and educating our children deserves a pay cut, while fixing the Libor rate deserves more money than the average person receives in a lifetime.\nThere we also moves to provide interest-free loans for house purchasers, with purchasers only having to find a 5% deposit. Industry experts have pointed-out that this is likely to lead to an increase in property prices, making the problem of Britain’s massively over-valued housing supply even worse. Even so, you may think that this is government action aimed at helping people who can’t afford a house, but is this true? It seems that it applies to everyone, including landlords with existing property portfolios. So is this yet another bung for rich friends of the government? Let’s remember that there’s only a housing crisis for the poor because the Thatcher government sold-off all of our council housing for a knock-down price in the 80’s, and in some areas landlords own up to 40% of these houses we all paid for to help the poorest in society.\nThere are a few other items - a less publicised move to help the already wealthy was the cut in stamp duty on AIM trading. It’s good to know we’re all in this together. How many libraries will that cost? Schools and the NHS will ‘be protected’, even though they haven’t so far, with both receiving cuts in real terms throughout this parliament. Then there are tax allowances for shale gas investments, even though most experts agree that shale gas in the UK is a non-starter. This, and the failure to raise fuel duties, make this one of the most environmentally irresponsible budgets for a long time.\nGeorge Osborne already has the worst economic prediction accuracy of any chancellor in recent times. Who believes him now? Why does he think that the policies that have so spectacularly failed to achieve his aims so far are suddenly going to start working now? Meanwhile, the wealth continues to flow from the many to the few. A cynic might think that actually everything is going rather according to his plans.",

Labour seems unwilling to contemplate this. The proposed Lib Dem mansion tax is a small step the right direction, but the wealthiest do not keep their wealth in residential property.\nWe are the 7th richest country in the world yet among the 32 members of the OECD only 6 countries are more unequal than the UK.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2016_03_20_schools-privatisation_html/content_50.html": "This week the Conservative government announced that it is going to force all schools in England to become ‘academies’, however well they are performing and whether they, or the parents and children, want to or not.\nAn LEA school is basically owned and run by the council on behalf of the local population, and it has been done this way since 1902. LEA-run schools must teach the national curriculum, employ qualified teachers that are paid according to nationally-set pay scales, and serve meals that meet national nutritional standards. The local authority is responsible for the provision and quality of the schools, and there is therefore public accountability - they can be voted out if the schools have problems, or other councils with better ideas for education can be voted in. Importantly, because the council has control of the schools in its area it can create strategic plans between its schools for dealing with populations and differing needs of children within it.\nWhat happens when an LEA school becomes an academy? Firstly, school buildings and land that are publicly owned are handed-over to the organisations that will run the academy. This is sometimes done via long leases, but sometimes a complete and permanent transfer of assets. This is an important point - buildings and land that we all own are taken from us, and we receive absolutely nothing in return. The total value of public assets lost to us when all schools in England are forced to become academies will be in the hundreds of millions.\nThose who defend academies will claim that this isn’t an issue, since academies are run by charities. This might be strictly true, but that doesn’t mean there are not vast profits to be made. Almost all academies are part of ‘academy chains’, and the staff they employ get very generous salaries - much more than under the LEA system. It is also easy to set-up for-profit firms that supply schools, so you often find that those involved in academies are making a tidy profit indirectly. All in all, although academies themselves may be ‘not for profit’ in the strictest sense, vast profits and salaries are generated around them. This is all money being taken out of educating our children.\nAnother thing to consider is that academies do not have to follow the national curriculum, so as a parent it’s much more difficult to know what your child is actually being taught. Not only that, but if your child has to move schools for any reason they could end-up finding themselves in the middle of an entirely different syllabus. What’s worse is that the people teaching them don’t even have to be qualified teachers - academies are not obligated to employ teachers with Qualified Teacher Status. As a parent you have no assurance that teaching staff have really done any training at all.\nOf course, another announcement this week is relevant here - the QTS itself is being scrapped. This is just another step on the path of devaluing teaching as a profession. Any teacher will tell you that teaching can be very hard and is most certainly a skill. Can anyone just walk in to a classroom and be an effective teacher? Of course not. Is QTS a perfect way of indicating those that can? No, but it’s something. If there are problems with the QTS then the thing to do is improve QTS itself. What we’ll have instead is a system where the head teacher of a school determines if a teacher is good enough or not. This is so open to a massive variation in standards that it’s a problem waiting to happen.\nAlong with not having to employ qualified teachers, academies also do not have to pay teachers according to national pay scales. The outcome of this is obvious, with better teachers being lured away to wealthier areas and pay disparity making teacher morale even lower in schools where they are paid less.\nQuite apart from the teaching, academies aren’t great for pupils in other ways. Their meals don’t have to meet national nutritional standards (quite why they are exempt is, quite frankly, inexplicable), and academies don’t have to meet standards for the amount of outdoor play space available to pupils either. It’s not unreasonable that given this we’ll see a large number of schools sell-off playing fields once academy status is forced, especially given how money can now be creamed-off such sales and into the pockets of individuals.\nWe must also consider the impact of all of this on children with special educational needs. As an LEA loses the scale required to make SEN services viable, it will become increasingly impossible for them to be run by the public sector. As the ‘market’ in academies develops, consultancy companies will therefore grow up to provide SEN services and, as they strive to cut costs and hit targets (i.e. identifying specific needs and/or coming up with ways to accelerate progress so that academy chains buy into their services more) the actual drive to meet the needs of children, which are almost always more complex than a single assessment can achieve, will be lost. These companies will also seek to pay lower than market salaries meaning less well qualified or inexperienced staff will fill the market and more expensive experienced staff, who know what they are doing, understand how schools work and have spent years developing relationships with the communities that they serve, will be lost. Ultimately, children with any sort of SEN will lose out, but so will other children, particularly in schools that strive (despite forced academy status) to remain inclusive end up being the dumping ground for unwanted children, meaning that the other children in those schools will not be given the teacher time and support that they need. In turn, inclusive schools will fail to meet attainment and progress targets and will be shuffled from academy chain to academy chain in an effort to achieve that elusive improvement that will be all but impossible because the high quality support services that these schools need are not profitable enough for the private sector to bother running properly. As with so many actions of this government, those that need the most help will lose the most.\nFinally, while this isn’t part of the forced academy programme, it’s worth mentioning that the government has announced that it will scrap parent governors. There doesn’t seem to have been a single reason put forward for this, but it must make even the most ardent Tory voter sit up and take note. For a party that constantly bangs-on about ‘small government’ and putting power in the hands of the people, this is a move that is all about taking away the voice of the parents. The government has described some sort of mechanism for parents holding schools to account, but it is completely toothless and inconsequential compared to actually having them on the board of governors. Parents are going to lose both democratic oversight of schools and their representation at governor level - a massive loss of power from end users and a transfer to people potentially making vast profits from academy chains.\nSo there are a number of reasons that we should all be concerned about this forced privatisation of our schooling system, whether we have children or not: it’s bad news for children given the lessening of standards of teaching, food and play, it’s bad news for parents with less oversight of schools and difficulty changing them, and it’s bad news for residents, who will lose democratic accountability for how their taxes are spent and face vast sums of those funds being siphoned-off in huge salaries by unaccountable bodies.\nThis move is not based on evidence. It’s not based on what teachers have asked for. It’s not based on what pupils need. The only reason for it is shifting assets and services into the private sector - Tory ideology - and we’re seeing it in pretty much every public service. Education is simply the latest battle in an ongoing war being waged against us. And we’re losing.",

Similarly, it’s possible to stop spending manpower on minor drugs offenses such as possession while there are not enough resources to investigate violent assault.\nThe position of the Green Party is that this position of PCCs should not exist because it is a politicisation of the police, and I agree with this. However, just as with the Lords, there is nothing to be gained by refusing to engage with positions you don’t think should exist as it allows those with regressive policies to run unopposed. It is also vital that we provide Green voters with someone to vote for in every election. As such, as have stood PCC candidates. In Avon and Somerset it is Chris Briton.\nChris has a long career in the Probation Service and has is a great believer in restorative justice. Greens believe in using evidence as a basis for policy, and Chris will use best practice from both his own experience and policing systems around the world and set police priorities that have been actually shown to work.\nWe all have a choice tomorrow. We can choose a Green PCC who has worked in the system and will use his position to actually help victims and prevent crime, or other candidates who are simply taking a step along their career path from being councillors, or promising failed populist authoritarian ‘string ‘em up’ policies.\nFind out more about Chris on his Facebook page.\nLet’s change things for the better.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2023_05_09_coronation-protest-arrests_html/content_212.html": "A number of peaceful protestors were arrested at the Coronation. Why should we be concerned?\n@dominictristram A number of peaceful #protestors were arrested at the #Coronation. Why should we be concerned?\n♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nSo the Coronation happened, and one thing you may have seen in the news is that a, small number of pro Republican and I do mean Republican in the very literal sense of not wanting a monarchy. Some pro-republican protestors were arrested and moved on and they’ve all been released without charge.\nBut I think what this really shines a light on is just how insidious the anti protest legislation is that , this government’s bought in. Now, I’m fundamentally opposed to criminalizing any peaceful protest, but the excuse they gave, which did win some people over, was that there are too many disruptive people sitting in roads and locking themselves onto things and being difficult to remove, and that was a massive inconvenience. And that’s what they pitched as , the reason why they wanted to bring this legislation in. But of course, what’s happened, as always happens when you give the police these powers, is that they’ve used these to, , effectively stop people protesting the coronation.\nNow they had placards, there was no evidence they wanted anything more disruptive than holding placards, . They’d actually asked the police for permission to have the protest and were given the permission and yet they were arrested and carted away. And people say, oh yeah, but it’s fine because they were released without charge. And you know what? They were but their right to protest was effectively removed because they were being held during that time and being arrested isn’t fun. But, apart from anything else, t he government don’t even really need to criminalize the actual act of protest by charging people. If they can just arrest them and then release ‘em without charge - gets around some of the awkwardness of having to go to court to prove anything, doesn’t it? But because police can arrest people for these, I’m not going to say crimes, can arrest people for having disruptive protests, they do. Now, this is obviously being used to silence an inconvenient protest that doesn’t actually break any of the laws that the Tories have brought in, but somewhat more worryingly, even if you don’t agree with the republicans, it was used to arrest community volunteers handing out rape alarms.\nNow these were community volunteers working with the local borough, handing out rape alarms, which, the police claimed, could have been used to startle the horses. Or something. Now they weren’t, obviously, and there’s no evidence that they were being planned to be used that way. So it doesn’t help those people who got arrested, people who are doing good work.\nIt’s just the slippery slope into authoritarianism. Everyone always denies it. “These Just Stop oil protests are disruptive. It’s only those we want to stop”. As soon as you give the police the powers to stop a protest, they will. They’ll stop pretty much any protest. And we see this repeatedly whenever more power is granted.\nIt’s always used to the fullest extent, even if that’s not actually even what the government wanted. But of course, the government did want this. It’s like the laws stopping single person protests in Parliament Square, which were literally brought in just to stop one man having his anti-Brexit protest. And of course, now the police have any power they like to stop any single person protests. If you are standing outside Parliament demanding action for, let’s say somebody who’s wrongfully deported and then was killed abroad or something awful, you wouldn’t be allowed to do that anymore because the government had some vindictive reason to bring that legislation in because it was inconvenient for them to be reminded how inept Brexit was.\nNow we should all care because even if you don’t agree with a particular protest against this government, whether it’s because you agree with the government or because you disagree with the protest, if you then agree with legislation to ban protests one day, that power will inevitably be used against you in protest you agree with, because there will be a different government that’s doing things you don’t like.\nOr it’ll be a protest against something that you want to protest. This was seen to some extent by the Countryside Alliance march. Now, I don’t agree with the pro-hunting position of the Countryside Alliance at all, but the people who were on that march getting bashed on the head by policemen were exactly the sort of people who would’ve supported those actions against most protestors. Largely. I’m generalizing, but a lot of those people on that march would’ve been exactly the sort of people who would typically approve of such measures, giving the police those powers.\nSo this is what happens. You support something because you disagree with the protestors. In that case, lo and behold, it’s used against you. So always stand up for the civil liberties we have in this country traditionally, which are being eroded by this government.\nWhether it’s the right to asylum, the right to protest, these things are fundamental and you have to stand up for them, even for people you disagree with.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2016_03_20_schools-privatisation_html/content_57.html": "This week the Conservative government announced that it is going to force all schools in England to become ‘academies’, however well they are performing and whether they, or the parents and children, want to or not.\nAn LEA school is basically owned and run by the council on behalf of the local population, and it has been done this way since 1902. LEA-run schools must teach the national curriculum, employ qualified teachers that are paid according to nationally-set pay scales, and serve meals that meet national nutritional standards. The local authority is responsible for the provision and quality of the schools, and there is therefore public accountability - they can be voted out if the schools have problems, or other councils with better ideas for education can be voted in. Importantly, because the council has control of the schools in its area it can create strategic plans between its schools for dealing with populations and differing needs of children within it.\nWhat happens when an LEA school becomes an academy? Firstly, school buildings and land that are publicly owned are handed-over to the organisations that will run the academy. This is sometimes done via long leases, but sometimes a complete and permanent transfer of assets. This is an important point - buildings and land that we all own are taken from us, and we receive absolutely nothing in return. The total value of public assets lost to us when all schools in England are forced to become academies will be in the hundreds of millions.\nThose who defend academies will claim that this isn’t an issue, since academies are run by charities. This might be strictly true, but that doesn’t mean there are not vast profits to be made. Almost all academies are part of ‘academy chains’, and the staff they employ get very generous salaries - much more than under the LEA system. It is also easy to set-up for-profit firms that supply schools, so you often find that those involved in academies are making a tidy profit indirectly. All in all, although academies themselves may be ‘not for profit’ in the strictest sense, vast profits and salaries are generated around them. This is all money being taken out of educating our children.\nAnother thing to consider is that academies do not have to follow the national curriculum, so as a parent it’s much more difficult to know what your child is actually being taught. Not only that, but if your child has to move schools for any reason they could end-up finding themselves in the middle of an entirely different syllabus. What’s worse is that the people teaching them don’t even have to be qualified teachers - academies are not obligated to employ teachers with Qualified Teacher Status. As a parent you have no assurance that teaching staff have really done any training at all.\nOf course, another announcement this week is relevant here - the QTS itself is being scrapped. This is just another step on the path of devaluing teaching as a profession. Any teacher will tell you that teaching can be very hard and is most certainly a skill. Can anyone just walk in to a classroom and be an effective teacher? Of course not. Is QTS a perfect way of indicating those that can? No, but it’s something. If there are problems with the QTS then the thing to do is improve QTS itself. What we’ll have instead is a system where the head teacher of a school determines if a teacher is good enough or not. This is so open to a massive variation in standards that it’s a problem waiting to happen.\nAlong with not having to employ qualified teachers, academies also do not have to pay teachers according to national pay scales. The outcome of this is obvious, with better teachers being lured away to wealthier areas and pay disparity making teacher morale even lower in schools where they are paid less.\nQuite apart from the teaching, academies aren’t great for pupils in other ways. Their meals don’t have to meet national nutritional standards (quite why they are exempt is, quite frankly, inexplicable), and academies don’t have to meet standards for the amount of outdoor play space available to pupils either. It’s not unreasonable that given this we’ll see a large number of schools sell-off playing fields once academy status is forced, especially given how money can now be creamed-off such sales and into the pockets of individuals.\nWe must also consider the impact of all of this on children with special educational needs. As an LEA loses the scale required to make SEN services viable, it will become increasingly impossible for them to be run by the public sector. As the ‘market’ in academies develops, consultancy companies will therefore grow up to provide SEN services and, as they strive to cut costs and hit targets (i.e. identifying specific needs and/or coming up with ways to accelerate progress so that academy chains buy into their services more) the actual drive to meet the needs of children, which are almost always more complex than a single assessment can achieve, will be lost. These companies will also seek to pay lower than market salaries meaning less well qualified or inexperienced staff will fill the market and more expensive experienced staff, who know what they are doing, understand how schools work and have spent years developing relationships with the communities that they serve, will be lost. Ultimately, children with any sort of SEN will lose out, but so will other children, particularly in schools that strive (despite forced academy status) to remain inclusive end up being the dumping ground for unwanted children, meaning that the other children in those schools will not be given the teacher time and support that they need. In turn, inclusive schools will fail to meet attainment and progress targets and will be shuffled from academy chain to academy chain in an effort to achieve that elusive improvement that will be all but impossible because the high quality support services that these schools need are not profitable enough for the private sector to bother running properly. As with so many actions of this government, those that need the most help will lose the most.\nFinally, while this isn’t part of the forced academy programme, it’s worth mentioning that the government has announced that it will scrap parent governors. There doesn’t seem to have been a single reason put forward for this, but it must make even the most ardent Tory voter sit up and take note. For a party that constantly bangs-on about ‘small government’ and putting power in the hands of the people, this is a move that is all about taking away the voice of the parents. The government has described some sort of mechanism for parents holding schools to account, but it is completely toothless and inconsequential compared to actually having them on the board of governors. Parents are going to lose both democratic oversight of schools and their representation at governor level - a massive loss of power from end users and a transfer to people potentially making vast profits from academy chains.\nSo there are a number of reasons that we should all be concerned about this forced privatisation of our schooling system, whether we have children or not: it’s bad news for children given the lessening of standards of teaching, food and play, it’s bad news for parents with less oversight of schools and difficulty changing them, and it’s bad news for residents, who will lose democratic accountability for how their taxes are spent and face vast sums of those funds being siphoned-off in huge salaries by unaccountable bodies.\nThis move is not based on evidence. It’s not based on what teachers have asked for. It’s not based on what pupils need. The only reason for it is shifting assets and services into the private sector - Tory ideology - and we’re seeing it in pretty much every public service. Education is simply the latest battle in an ongoing war being waged against us. And we’re losing.",

Actually, until today it wasn't too bad - we've been heading out of Ikebukuro away from town so the metro is really quiet. However, my colleague from the UK left today and I started on a week of a new journey to an office in Kawasaki. This new route on the train (rather than the Metro) takes me right around Tokyo so I've now experienced crowded trains! To be honest they're not that bad though - they go every few minutes, so if the current one is a bit of a crush you can just wait for the next one. This doesn't seem to occur to the locals though who are clearly in a rush to get everywhere, and they happily cram on until the train is about to burst. Madness. Mind you, they give me odd looks while I just stand aside to let them on.\nThe train I get takes me on the Yamanote line, and I don't know if this is unique, but all of the stations have their own little tune when you arrive. It's quite cute and I guess pretty useful when you get to know your tune, but some of the choices are a bit odd. One of them plays the tune from Goodfellas (or some other gangster film - I can't remember which)... you know, the guitar-y\nItalian sounding one.

Most people (bar the odd rebellious teenager) queue for the trains on the handy painted lines on the platform, wait for people to get off when the train arrives, and then get on (although they never stop doing this, of course!). People tend to either sleep or stare at their feet, but if you do make eye contact they seem friendly. I have to say though, the women seem to be much chirpier.

You can't tell what most people are reading though since they tend to put their books into little covers so you can't see the title. Perhaps they're all reading porn?!

Now more than ever there is a large amount of conflicting advice offered to people who are wondering who to vote for. I wanted to write a brief guide to help them to think this through.\nThis guide is entirely impartial. I’m not going to suggest who you vote for or encourage you to vote one way or the other. My goal here is simply to try and increase engagement and encourage people to think in a structured way about their vote. The more confident you are that you have voted in the best way you could, the better you will feel. Believe me, it’s true!\nI’m going to explain how, whatever your beliefs and what you want politics to be like, no vote is ‘wasted’, as long as you vote with clear objectives.\nOK, let’s go.\nStep 1 - What do you really believe?\nThe first thing to do is clear your mind of anything to do with political parties. Try to ignore any preconceptions. Forget about your MP, the leaders of the parties, how you have voted before, or anything else. Why? Because we need to identify your core values. This is the essential first step for casting your vote.\nTake a few minutes to consider things that are important to you that a government can change. It doesn’t matter what they are - just jot them down in the order that they occur to you. Your list could include education, healthcare, defence. Don’t think about it to0 much, just write them down as they pop into your head.\nCongratulations! Your list is more or less automatically in the order of importance to you. Don’t question it too much at this point, because the more you question it the more existing biases come in.\nNow, starting at the top of the list, think of any of your ‘deal breakers’ in that area. These are things on which you absolutely will not compromise. Not everyone has these, but if you do it’s important to note them down to remind yourself of them later. Examples might be that you will not vote for climate change deniers, renationalisation, NHS privatisaion, nuclear weapons… it’s up to you - big moral certainties with no blurred edges.\nThat’s it - well done! You’ve got your own very basic priority list. That’s all you need.\nStep 2 - Examine policies without bias\nWhen you read a manifesto it’s almost impossible not to go into it with either a positive or a negative bias, depending on your existing impression of the party or the people in it. This is not good for sound reasoning. What is required is a way to see the policies without seeing who wrote them and choose the one you prefer, then see which manifesto has the most policies you agree with. Thankfully that tool exists.\nUsing a Web browser go to Vote For Policies. This is a neutral site which does just that - it allows you to see corresponding policies from all of the parties without seeing which party they are from. You don’t have to enter your name or any identifying information, just your postcode at the end if you want to see how other people in your constituency have chosen.\nGo to the site and fill-in as much as you can. When you start it will ask which areas are important to you. Make sure you select as many of the items from your list in step 1 as you can, and ideally more. The more you choose the longer the quiz will take, but the more accurate the answer will be.\nMake sure you are honest with yourself and rule-out any policies which are deal-breakers you identified in step 1.\nWhen you have completed the quiz the site will give you a result in the form of a pie chart. This illustrates a percentage showing how many of your results corresponded to each party. The party with the largest percentage is the one you agree with most.\nThe result may not surprise you, or it might. Whatever the case, it is an undeniable, unbiased illustration of which party represents your views most closely.\nSo, who should you vote for? Let’s see.\nStep 3 - Who can you actually vote for?\nNow that you know who you agree with most you must find out if they standing in your constituency. If you are not sure simply go to Who Can I Vote For? and type in your postcode.\nAt this point you will also see any independent candidates who are standing. It’s impossible for these to appear on the Vote For Policies site, so now is the time to consider if they are more closely aligned to your views than the party identified in step 2. It’s not always easy to do this - the best way is to either go to a hustings or contact them directly.\nNote down the name of your constituency if you didn’t know it as you will need it later. It might not be what you expect, such as the name of your town.\nIf your chosen party isn’t standing and there are no independents (or you don’t agree with them), you can substitute the party that next most closely aligned to your views in step 2.\nStep 4 - Who should you vote for?\nFor some people this is the tricky part, and it’s all down to our unfair electoral system. ‘first past the post’. This means that the makeup of parliament does not reflect the number of votes cast nationally. The result of this is unexpected situations like a majority government being elected with under 40% of the vote, and some MPs being elected on just over 6,000 votes while others receive over 47,000.\nI consider it vital for democracy that we have electoral reform in the UK. I’m not going to discuss that further at this point, but in the vast majority of democracies the ‘who should I vote for’ discussion would end at this point because the number of MPs elected reflects the national vote, so you only have to consider who you like best. It shames us that it isn’t the case here. Join an organisation that campaigns for electoral reform, such as Make Votes Matter, and help to ensure you can vote for what you believe in at future elections. If your favourite party doesn’t support electoral reform (they all do expect the largest two), work hard to change their minds.\nAnyway, it is absolutely a valid decision to ignore the unfair electoral system and vote for the party you believe in most, regardless of quirks in the electoral system. In many ways that is the most democratic action and the one that is truest to yourself. However, you should consider the effects of first past the post.\nWhat are ‘marginals’ and ‘safe seats’?\nSome constituencies are referred to as ‘marginals’. These are seats where the winner has a majority of fewer than 3,000 votes. You have probably noticed if you live in one of these as you will have a lot more leaflets and perhaps people knocking on your door than people you know in constituencies that are ‘safe’.\nMarginal constituencies are the ones that are likely to elect an MP from a different party than last time. The opposite is a ‘safe’ seat, where it is very unlikely that an MP from a different party will be elected. If you live in a safe seat it’s possible that you will receive hardly any election material at all.\nFind out what type of constituency yours is by finding it in this list. This will list a large amount of information for each entry, including the majority of the winning party last time. Remember, if the majority is under 3,000 you are definitely in a marginal. The higher it is over that, the safer it is. Of course, things can change. Have a look at the polls as close as you can to polling day and work out how that national swing would effect your constituency. If you live in even a moderately safe seat then it probably won’t, by itself.\nNext consider local factors. This time around (2019) there are many constituencies where one party standing in 2017 has stood aside, so that immediately ‘frees up’ those votes. In other constituencies there are local factors such as scandals hitting a party, or a particularly strong campaign that might change. It may be impossible to judge how this might change how people vote. It might not at all. You must use your best judgement to assess this and whether it realistically results in change given majority of the party who won last time.\nRemember, it’s always true that most seats are safe seats.\nWhat is ‘tactical voting’?\nThis is when you choose not to vote for the party you like best based on the fact that a party you really dislike might win, and by voting for a party that isn’t your favourite, they might not. It’s a compromise. The more marginal the constituency is, the stronger the argument for tactical voting.\nSome of the larger parties will try to tell you that you should always vote tactically. This is wrong. In a safe seat there is no such thing as a tactical vote, and that’s more true the safer the seat is.\nThere is also no such thing as tactical voting in a constituency where it’s not clear who the two largest parties will be.\nAs an illustration, take a look at this list of Conservative-held seats. These are in order of the swing needed to beat the sitting Conservative. As you can see, where the seat is a marginal it can be won from the Conservatives with a swing of 4% or less. The swing needed then goes up a lot as the majority increases.\nThe national swing is nearly always lower than people think. The largest ever swing from Conservative to Labour was 10.2%, and the largest ever from Labour to Conservative was 5.3%. These are all-time records - national swings are usually much lower.\nYou can see the current predicted swings here. At the time of writing, the day before the election, the Conservatives are down 0.3% and Labour are down nearly 8%.\nSo now you have as good an idea as anyone else how likely your constituency is to vote for an MP for a different party this time. You will be in one of two categories, one of which is much more clear cut than the other.\nShould you vote ‘tactically’ in a safe seat?\nIf you are in a safe seat you should go ahead and vote for the party you identified as the one you agree with most. Your vote won’t change who is elected and won’t change who is in government.\nIf that’s the party that won last time, great - lucky you! If it’s not the party who won last time you should definitely still vote for them.\nIf your chosen party is not standing in the safe seat, consider chosing the ‘next best fit’ party from step 2 as long as it supports electoral reform. Chosing the one of the big two parties, which reject reform, is a vote for more elections where you can’t vote for what you really want.\nIf your chosen party is standing but not the one that won last time, you should definitely still vote for them. You might wonder what the point is if they won’t win, but there’s always a point. More than one, in fact:\n- You will help your party keep its deposit. Parties have to pay £500 to stand, and this is a large amount of money for smaller parties. They get this deposit back if they get at least 5% of the vote. Your vote can help them to get that money back and spend it on things like local elections. Parties that struggle to win in general elections often have many hundreds of councillors, so that money can be used to get councillors of the party you like best onto your local council\n- Media companies cover parties more when their national vote share increases. Since parties struggle to break through without media coverage, your vote will help your party become a serious contender in the future. This is in your interests since they most closely represent your views\n- You will help the MPs elected elsewhere in your chosen party. There is state funding for political parties called ‘Short Money’. All opposition parties with MPs receive funding based on the number of votes nationally, whether they win in that constituency or not. For every 200 votes they receive an extra £33. In smaller parties without much money this makes a huge difference. For example, the Green Party currently have one MP, but the national vote share results in Short Money that pays for parliamentary researchers who can help her find the data she needs to hold the government to account. By voting for your party, even if you are told they are a ‘wasted vote’, you are helping their MPs elected elsewhere speak up for what you believe in Parliament. This is vital.\nShould you vote ‘tactically’ in a marginal seat?\nThis is a personal decision. Its easier if you don’t really mind the two parties most likely to win in your constituency - let them fight it out and vote for the party you like best anyway, for the reasons in the list above.\nIf you strongly oppose one of the two parties most likely to win then you have a tougher choice. The more marginal your constituency is, the more you may feel you have to vote for one of the two to ‘keep the other out’. This in understandable and I’m not going to try to persuade you otherwise. All I would suggest is that you make yourself feel better about this compromise, and help the party that you really wanted to vote for, by ‘vote swapping’.\nTo vote swap, go to Swap My Vote and enter the party you want and the one you are willing to vote for tactically. You will be matched-up with someone willing to vote the other way. In this way you can help stop the party you dislike winning your constituency while at the same time helping your chosen party gain national vote share, or perhaps even win in a different constituency. It doesn’t feel as good as voting for who you like best, but if you feel you have to vote tactically it’s the next best thing.\nWhatever you do - go and vote!\nDo vote. It’s important. But equally importantly, don’t let anyone try to bully or convince you to vote for someone you don’t want to vote for. You have the tools you need to find out if you really do agree with a party. You have the information here to know if a ‘tactical’ vote makes sense. The only wasted vote is one that you haven’t considered, is one blindly made on the advice of people whose agenda may be different to yours, or one you simply don’t believe in.\nI hope this guide has been helpful to everyone. We all have our biases but I have been careful to make it politically neutral, so it should help you however you vote.\nPlease do contact me with any suggestions for changes!",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2024_11_01_NHS-privatisation_html/content_177.html": "A Letter to the Bath Chronicle printed in the paper on 24th October 2024\nThroughout my time ‘in politics’ and as the Green Party candidate for Bath’s MP in multiple elections I have campaigned for a publicly owned and operated NHS, and against privatisation.\nThe Green Party is the only party with this policy. This is true despite what Labour candidates and activists have told me over the years, claiming to be the ‘party of the NHS’ and that they are also against privatisation, despite all evidence to the contrary. Unfortunately this seems to be also widely held by some voters, who believe that Labour is still a left-leaning party at heart.\nI wonder how many of the voters who put Labour into second place in the last election will therefore be somewhat surprised that, under the new Labour government, community health services in BaNES, Swindon and Wiltshire have just been handed over to a profit-making company in a huge £1.3bn deal?\nThey will sometimes tell voters that this is somehow ‘not privatisation’. That is a lie. Services that could be run by the NHS (with any savings from efficiency improvements going back into improving other NHS services) will be run by a company with an incentive to spend as little as it can on care so that it can maximise profits. This is NHS money given to shareholders instead of being spent on patients.\nThis is just the beginning - under Wes Streeting, the private sector is set to take control of much more of our NHS to profit from.\nThe Green Party is the only party that will put NHS services back into public hands. For Greens, it is a fundamental principle that the NHS should be run for people, not profit. This is a view shared by the majority of the public.\nYours faithfully,\nDom Tristram,\n2024 Green Party MP candidate for Bath\nTo receive my new politics posts directly by email or in the Substack app, please subscribe",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2016_11_12_virgin-care_html/content_14.html": "On the 11th of November Virgin Care was finally confirmed as the successful bidder to run over 200 community healthcare services in Bath and NE Somerset. This was decided by unanimous vote by the local Clinical Commissioning Group and a majority vote (35 to 22) by the Conservative-led local authority.\nAs a Green Party member I am opposed to privatisation of our NHS and running NHS or other publicly-funded health services for profit. Indeed, this is very much the view of the population of Bath, which is why I was elected as a local hospital governor in 2012 on a platform of opposing such changes. However, regardless of whether one agrees with the private sector running our health services or not, this whole deal has been a farce.\nThere has been an apparent neutering of democracy in several stages of the bidding process. One of our Green Party councillors in Bath, Lin Patterson, sits on the council’s Health and Wellbeing Select Committee. She was asked to remove herself from discussions about the Virgin Care bid as a result of signing a petition against the services going to a private provider, and the council being concerned that this might be a basis for Virgin to sue.\nOf course, there is no legal basis at all for Virgin to do so, so either the Conservatives running the council considered it as a convenient way to remove a dissenting voice, or they genuinely do fear Virgin Care, in which case they should possibly not be handing them vital healthcare services. In either case, constituents who voted for our councillor at least partly on the basis of her views on private health providers had their voices ignored.\nDemocracy was also badly served in the closing stages of the bidding process. Members of the public were not allowed to ask questions at the meeting of the CCG where it was decided to give Virgin the contract. Later at the council meeting, two motions requesting for the decision to be delayed until details of the bid could be scrutinised by the council’s Select Committee were rejected with no decent explanation.\nWhile Virgin Care have won many services around the country, the deal in Bath would be the first time any adult social care services have been run for profit. Not to allow the Select Committee to examine the detail of the proposed deal seems foolhardy, at best. The 76 page business case recommending Virgin Care to the public was published less than a week before the decision was made - hardly a lot of time for careful examination.\nThe council and CCG put much weight on the fact that Virgin Care promised to ‘reinvest any profit’ back into local services. One must question how anyone who believes that this promise means anything is in a position to decide how to spend £700m of our money. Virgin Care, like many if not all companies that win NHS work, doesn’t make profits.\nIn 2015 Virgin Care made a loss of £9.1m, much as it has for each of the last five years. There are many instances of multinational companies using elaborate structures of holding companies and loans to ensure that no taxes are paid on profits. Indeed, the ultimate owner of Virgin Care is based in a tax haven.\nProfits are being made, and to assume that they aren’t and that Virgin Care wish to lose money for seven years as some sort of public service shows those awarding this work to them are either dangerously naive or manifestly underestimating the intelligence of the public. Or, more likely, they simply don’t care that the promises are worthless.\nThe largest opposition group on BaNES council is the Liberal Democrats. Recently they have been vocal in opposing the Virgin Care bid, but this position must presumably be on a technicality in the bidding process rather than an objection in principle. After all, the Liberal Democrats voted for the Health and Social Care Act while part of the coalition government, despite it being in no manifesto and against the wishes of both the public and the medical profession. Many of us warned at the time that it would lead to the fragmentation and forced privatisation of the NHS, and for them to object to this now doesn’t seem very convincing.\nOne must take both a long term forward view and a consideration of the past to separate convenient political opposition from genuine concern over the future of our NHS. When I ran for Parliament in Bath last year I was the only candidate warning of the dangers of allowing profit-making companies access to vital services. The profit motive leads to procurement processes like this where those assessing bids seem blinded by slick marketing and meaningless promises. Once these services are in the hands of people who profit from them it will be very difficult to get them back. It is immensely frustrating when the very events some of us predicted back in 2010, when we were dismissed as alarmist, are now coming to pass.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2011_12_08_cameron-in-europe_html/content_174.html": "David Cameron is in Brussels today trying to resolve the European financial crisis. If the Euro fails then it won’t only cause massive damage to the Euro block, but every other economy in the EU. French Europe Minister Jean Leonetti said “The situation is serious - the euro can explode and Europe unravel …That can be a catastrophe not just for Europe and for France but for the world.” Even the most Euro-sceptic pundits accept that this is the case, so it is only right that our Prime Minister is talking to the other leaders concerned and trying to formulate a way forward.\nBut what is the way forward that he is arguing for? If one were to listen to those on the right of the Tory party, such as backbencher Bernard Jenkin, the right outcome would be some sort of referendum on our membership of the EU before we commit to anything. However, this is a nonsense - the Euro crisis is time critical, and every day that passes without a resolution makes matters worse. How long would a referendum take to organise? Even if the actual voting was organised quickly, such an important and multi-faceted topic such as our membership of the EU cannot be argued sufficiently in a short space of time. The decision reached in such a referendum would have a lasting impact in almost every facet of British life. So no, we cannot have a referendum, but those calling for it know this - they are just scoring easy political points with those on the Right.\nGermany and France are suggesting changes that will enforce financial discipline with penalties for those Euro-zone nations that fail to operate within set constraints. They are hoping that all 27 countries can agree to them, but if not, they may propose a more unified set of ‘core’ countries. The failure of Britain to engage properly with Europe for the last few decades mean that we will almost certainly find ourselves in the ‘slow lane’. So what will Cameron argue for? He has said that he wants the “best deal for the UK”, and by this he really means the financial sector, where he has pledged to resist any attempts to introduce a transaction tax. How far he will go in holding the position is yet to be seen, but if he doesn’t he’s unlikely to be popular with his party or supporters in the City. But is Cameron’s defence of the financial sector worth the losses we all suffer every extra day that the markets lose confidence in Europe? And is there any evidence that a transaction tax will actually weaken London as a market? If the rules apply in all of Europe then any trading is unlikely to move elsewhere in the EU, and are we really meant to think that traders would abandon Europe altogether? More importantly, if they did, would it really be a bad thing?\nWhile Britain’s economy is overly dependent on the financial sector as the recent crisis has shown, it still contributes under 10% of our GDP (around 8% in 2009). Despite this it is unique within industries with the ease in which it can relocate, and therefore hold national governments to ransom if they don’t pass favourable legislation. Other industries that are important to the economy do not receive such favour from the coalition government. For example, the creative industries contribute over 20 billion annually, yet this government has scrapped the (profit making) UK Film Council and scrapped plans for tax breaks on the games industry which would have created nearly 10,000 high-value jobs. Cameron’s mission in Europe should be simple - come to the speediest conclusion of the Euro crisis without holding-out for special exemptions for the UK. We’re all in this together and it’s in our interest to work together. Cameron’s mission shouldn’t be to work for “what’s best for the UK” but to work for what’s best for everyone.",

In a nutshell this cross-party bill seeks to reinstate the NHS based on its founding principles and reverse the creeping privatisation and marketisation of our NHS. It would strip away the costly and wasteful market mechanisms and return much-needed funds to treating patients, rather than the massively bureaucratic process of splitting NHS services into tiny parts for handing-out to private companies and NHS organisations - a process reckoned to cost billions per year.\nOur new MP Ben Howlett makes much noise about how he is both ‘proud of the NHS’ and happy to rebel against his party in issues where there is clear evidence and public support. Since the huge majority of the public don’t want to see the NHS privatised, will we be able to count on his support for today’s bill, or will he all too predictably ignore the public will and fall into line with his party now that he is elected?\nDominic Tristram 2015 Green Party PPC for Bath\nYou can read more about the excellent NHS Public Reinstatement Bill here.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2015_01_01_new-year-message_html/content_52.html": "Dear supporters,\nI hope that you have all had an enjoyable and restful festive break, and that you are feeling fully charged for the coming few months!\nI probably don’t need to remind you how brilliant 2014 has been for us as a party. We have seen our membership explode nationally, but especially here in Bath, where we have more than tripled our membership over the last twelve months. We are the fastest growing political party in England and Wales and the second fastest growing in Scotland, and the media is finding it harder than ever to ignore us. This is so important, not only for increasing our membership, but to spread our message to people who have not had a chance to hear it before.\nThere’s a real feeling of momentum both in the growth of the party and in what we can achieve, as demonstrated by the election of our first Green MEP in the South West, Molly Scott Cato. The European Election saw us gain around 20% of the vote in Bath - a massive increase, and one that we should all take as a hugely positive sign that people are beginning to look outside the big parties and consider the policies of smaller parties more carefully.\nIn Bath we are particularly lucky. Many people who have previously voted Lib Dem are feeling very let down, and parties holding seats almost always lose votes when their existing MP stands down. Many voters do not have a natural home in any of the other parties, and inexplicably they have stood candidates that will struggle to convince the public that they are seriously contesting the seat. We have a huge opportunity to come in and surprise everyone.\nWe know that our polices are the most popular of all of the parties, and they are resonating more strongly than ever before. The single most important thing that we can do is get our message out there. If people voted for policies and not parties we would win, and while that’s good to know, it shows how much work we still have to do.\nI’m not going to pretend that the time from now until polling day is going to be easy. While our message is a positive one, the other parties are involved in an arms race of intolerance and austerity. We must assume that as they notice our growing success they will turn their attention to us. We will be ready for them with the politics of hope, tolerance, fairness and a willingness to work for a better future for us and our planet. Unlike the other parties we do not have millionaire donors or friends in the media to pay our way into people’s minds, but our message is so much stronger. We just need to make sure that we spread that message whenever we can. It is a message of hope, of change and of something different. People are ready for it.\nI am hugely optimistic about what we can do in 2015, and I’d love as many of you to be involved as possible. Every single thing you can do to help us will be appreciated, whether you have time to volunteer to go canvassing, manning a stall, or you simply have a space where you can display a poster. We need to let the people of Bath know that we are here and that we mean business!\nI wish you the very best for the New Year. Let’s do this!",

We met in the pub after work and went for some food at The Salamander before heading back to mine for some geeky gaming on the PS3. On Tuesday I was hosting again, this time a student from Indiana called Emma. She 'enjoyed' a rather random evening of helping to push-start cars and going on a random trip to the cinema to see Goya's Ghosts, which was pretty good. The cinema was almost empty, but then it was a late showing and a bit of an 'arthouse' film. It was well done, but don't expect a happy story!",

While major targets may be destroyed, it will be impossible to significantly damage a force such as ISIL from the air. With the threat of air strikes they will remain in cover, resulting in significant civilian casualties, and thus creating another generation of radicalised survivors set on vengeance against ‘the west’.\nNot only is the military effectiveness questionable, but as Green MP Caroline Lucas, who voted against the action, said, “There are no easy answers. But there is this certainty: killing people rarely kills their ideas.” Even if we kill significant numbers of ISIL members, bombs will not stop their ideology.\nI do not for one minute condone ISIL or their abhorrent actions. However, we are about to spend £3bn on killing people, some of whom will be entirely innocent. We should be concentrating on aiding those who are at risk in the region, intensifying diplomatic efforts and adopting a coherent foreign policy based on clear principles, consistently applied.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2024_05_22_sunak-calls-general-election_html/content_7.html": "Today the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that the General Election will take place on the 4th of July.\nThis came as a surprise to many, including candidates such as myself. The assumption was that the government would hold an election in the autumn, and this was based on the almost universal prediction that they know they will lose and want to retain power for as long as possible. If nothing else they could have hoped that Labour would suffer some sort of disaster or appalling gaff and played for time.\nHowever, here we are - in six weeks the nation will go to the polls.\nIt would take a brave commentator, even in the Tory press, to publicly state that the Tories will win. They almost certainly will not. The only real question is how badly they will lose and how large the Labour majority will be (if indeed they achieve a majority).\nI’m not going to pretend that the Greens are going to form the next government, but I do think that the best possible outcome of the election is a Labour minority government that depends on the support of other progressive parties such as the Greens to stay in power. This isn’t just because I want power for the sake of it, but because while a Labour majority government will almost certainly be better than a Tory one, it is still a poor outcome for the country.\nOver the coming weeks I will discuss why this is. I’ll also talk about national issues, policy, the situation in Bath where I am standing, and anything else that you might want to hear about! Please let me know if there’s any subject you want me to cover.\nIn the meantime I’d like to finish by saying that I very much look forward to giving the people of Bath the choice of a fairer, greener country and the chance to vote for real change. The campaign might feel long but it will feel short for us candidates!\nSubscribe to my newsletter on Substack, have a look at my campaign Web site, follow me on social media (I’m on pretty much all of it - you can find the links on my Web site). Even better, help in my campaign! I won’t lie to you - the Greens have much, much less money than the other parties. Every volunteer is very much appreciated.\nI look forward to making the Green case in hustings and events. Let me know if you want me to come to yours!

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2011_10_04_planning-laws_html/content_317.html": "h1. Planning Laws\np(meta). 4 October 2011\nThe government has told us that there’s a significant factor limiting economic growth. While I’m sure we all have a good idea that there must be a number of things that can fall into this category, I’m guessing that the government surprised us all when it claimed that this factor was the planning laws.\nThe government claims that ‘red tape’ is preventing the construction of much needed homes. These homes, it argues, are essential to kick-start the economy, and the action of local authorities and ‘NIMBYs’ is preventing these homes being built. The government has suggested that planning permission for greenfield sites should be granted far more often, and once this happens the supply of homes will magically increase, including those allocated for social housing.\nThere are a few problems with this. Firstly, there is actually no shortage of greenfield sites with planning permission already granted. Over 300,000 plots for new homes with full planning permission are already held in land banks by developers. By some estimates there is enough of this banked land to build at full capacity for nearly seven years. It would seem that actually getting the land and planning permission does not seem to be a significant barrier to the construction industry.\nA major concern is the apparent willingness of the government to concrete over green fields rather than use derelict land that already exists. Not only is this land generally unused and unpleasant to look at, but it is often much more conveniently placed in towns and cities to use the existing infrastructure. It is also closer to road and rail links and places of work. Building housing on such sites would contribute less new traffic and pollution.\nThe Tories are in a difficult position. They get a lot of votes from farmers and rural types, but at the same time the massive majority of their funding comes from the City and big business. Big business wants to build indentikit estates in the London commuter belt. Wealthy people want to live in the suburbs, not the city. It’s also profitable to build out of town shopping centres, nuclear power stations, and so on. Changing the planning rules will make this easier, but these are all things that people in rural areas generally resist. It would be convenient for local councils and rural MPs to be able to wash their hands of the responsibility.\nI suggest that not a single house should be built on greenfield sites while there are any brownfield sites in areas where housing is required. This seems so obvious that its shouldn’t even have to be said. The same is true of empty housing - there were nearly 80,000 empty dwellings in London alone in 2010 and 737,491 across England. This is a mind-boggling number. These should be used before any more are built. Only when the brownfield sites have gone and the empty houses are being used should we consider building on our open spaces.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2019_12_11_voting-guide_html/content_13.html": "As you may have noticed, there is an election tomorrow. Now more than ever there is a large amount of conflicting advice offered to people who are wondering who to vote for. I wanted to write a brief guide to help them to think this through.\nThis guide is entirely impartial. I’m not going to suggest who you vote for or encourage you to vote one way or the other. My goal here is simply to try and increase engagement and encourage people to think in a structured way about their vote. The more confident you are that you have voted in the best way you could, the better you will feel. Believe me, it’s true!\nI’m going to explain how, whatever your beliefs and what you want politics to be like, no vote is ‘wasted’, as long as you vote with clear objectives.\nOK, let’s go.\nStep 1 - What do you really believe?\nThe first thing to do is clear your mind of anything to do with political parties. Try to ignore any preconceptions. Forget about your MP, the leaders of the parties, how you have voted before, or anything else. Why? Because we need to identify your core values. This is the essential first step for casting your vote.\nTake a few minutes to consider things that are important to you that a government can change. It doesn’t matter what they are - just jot them down in the order that they occur to you. Your list could include education, healthcare, defence. Don’t think about it to0 much, just write them down as they pop into your head.\nCongratulations! Your list is more or less automatically in the order of importance to you. Don’t question it too much at this point, because the more you question it the more existing biases come in.\nNow, starting at the top of the list, think of any of your ‘deal breakers’ in that area. These are things on which you absolutely will not compromise. Not everyone has these, but if you do it’s important to note them down to remind yourself of them later. Examples might be that you will not vote for climate change deniers, renationalisation, NHS privatisaion, nuclear weapons… it’s up to you - big moral certainties with no blurred edges.\nThat’s it - well done! You’ve got your own very basic priority list. That’s all you need.\nStep 2 - Examine policies without bias\nWhen you read a manifesto it’s almost impossible not to go into it with either a positive or a negative bias, depending on your existing impression of the party or the people in it. This is not good for sound reasoning. What is required is a way to see the policies without seeing who wrote them and choose the one you prefer, then see which manifesto has the most policies you agree with. Thankfully that tool exists.\nUsing a Web browser go to Vote For Policies. This is a neutral site which does just that - it allows you to see corresponding policies from all of the parties without seeing which party they are from. You don’t have to enter your name or any identifying information, just your postcode at the end if you want to see how other people in your constituency have chosen.\nGo to the site and fill-in as much as you can. When you start it will ask which areas are important to you. Make sure you select as many of the items from your list in step 1 as you can, and ideally more. The more you choose the longer the quiz will take, but the more accurate the answer will be.\nMake sure you are honest with yourself and rule-out any policies which are deal-breakers you identified in step 1.\nWhen you have completed the quiz the site will give you a result in the form of a pie chart. This illustrates a percentage showing how many of your results corresponded to each party. The party with the largest percentage is the one you agree with most.\nThe result may not surprise you, or it might. Whatever the case, it is an undeniable, unbiased illustration of which party represents your views most closely.\nSo, who should you vote for? Let’s see.\nStep 3 - Who can you actually vote for?\nNow that you know who you agree with most you must find out if they standing in your constituency. If you are not sure simply go to Who Can I Vote For? and type in your postcode.\nAt this point you will also see any independent candidates who are standing. It’s impossible for these to appear on the Vote For Policies site, so now is the time to consider if they are more closely aligned to your views than the party identified in step 2. It’s not always easy to do this - the best way is to either go to a hustings or contact them directly.\nNote down the name of your constituency if you didn’t know it as you will need it later. It might not be what you expect, such as the name of your town.\nIf your chosen party isn’t standing and there are no independents (or you don’t agree with them), you can substitute the party that next most closely aligned to your views in step 2.\nStep 4 - Who should you vote for?\nFor some people this is the tricky part, and it’s all down to our unfair electoral system. ‘first past the post’. This means that the makeup of parliament does not reflect the number of votes cast nationally. The result of this is unexpected situations like a majority government being elected with under 40% of the vote, and some MPs being elected on just over 6,000 votes while others receive over 47,000.\nI consider it vital for democracy that we have electoral reform in the UK. I’m not going to discuss that further at this point, but in the vast majority of democracies the ‘who should I vote for’ discussion would end at this point because the number of MPs elected reflects the national vote, so you only have to consider who you like best. It shames us that it isn’t the case here. Join an organisation that campaigns for electoral reform, such as Make Votes Matter, and help to ensure you can vote for what you believe in at future elections. If your favourite party doesn’t support electoral reform (they all do expect the largest two), work hard to change their minds.\nAnyway, it is absolutely a valid decision to ignore the unfair electoral system and vote for the party you believe in most, regardless of quirks in the electoral system. In many ways that is the most democratic action and the one that is truest to yourself. However, you should consider the effects of first past the post.\nWhat are ‘marginals’ and ‘safe seats’?\nSome constituencies are referred to as ‘marginals’. These are seats where the winner has a majority of fewer than 3,000 votes. You have probably noticed if you live in one of these as you will have a lot more leaflets and perhaps people knocking on your door than people you know in constituencies that are ‘safe’.\nMarginal constituencies are the ones that are likely to elect an MP from a different party than last time. The opposite is a ‘safe’ seat, where it is very unlikely that an MP from a different party will be elected. If you live in a safe seat it’s possible that you will receive hardly any election material at all.\nFind out what type of constituency yours is by finding it in this list. This will list a large amount of information for each entry, including the majority of the winning party last time. Remember, if the majority is under 3,000 you are definitely in a marginal. The higher it is over that, the safer it is. Of course, things can change. Have a look at the polls as close as you can to polling day and work out how that national swing would effect your constituency. If you live in even a moderately safe seat then it probably won’t, by itself.\nNext consider local factors. This time around (2019) there are many constituencies where one party standing in 2017 has stood aside, so that immediately ‘frees up’ those votes. In other constituencies there are local factors such as scandals hitting a party, or a particularly strong campaign that might change. It may be impossible to judge how this might change how people vote. It might not at all. You must use your best judgement to assess this and whether it realistically results in change given majority of the party who won last time.\nRemember, it’s always true that most seats are safe seats.\nWhat is ‘tactical voting’?\nThis is when you choose not to vote for the party you like best based on the fact that a party you really dislike might win, and by voting for a party that isn’t your favourite, they might not. It’s a compromise. The more marginal the constituency is, the stronger the argument for tactical voting.\nSome of the larger parties will try to tell you that you should always vote tactically. This is wrong. In a safe seat there is no such thing as a tactical vote, and that’s more true the safer the seat is.\nThere is also no such thing as tactical voting in a constituency where it’s not clear who the two largest parties will be.\nAs an illustration, take a look at this list of Conservative-held seats. These are in order of the swing needed to beat the sitting Conservative. As you can see, where the seat is a marginal it can be won from the Conservatives with a swing of 4% or less. The swing needed then goes up a lot as the majority increases.\nThe national swing is nearly always lower than people think. The largest ever swing from Conservative to Labour was 10.2%, and the largest ever from Labour to Conservative was 5.3%. These are all-time records - national swings are usually much lower.\nYou can see the current predicted swings here. At the time of writing, the day before the election, the Conservatives are down 0.3% and Labour are down nearly 8%.\nSo now you have as good an idea as anyone else how likely your constituency is to vote for an MP for a different party this time. You will be in one of two categories, one of which is much more clear cut than the other.\nShould you vote ‘tactically’ in a safe seat?\nIf you are in a safe seat you should go ahead and vote for the party you identified as the one you agree with most. Your vote won’t change who is elected and won’t change who is in government.\nIf that’s the party that won last time, great - lucky you! If it’s not the party who won last time you should definitely still vote for them.\nIf your chosen party is not standing in the safe seat, consider chosing the ‘next best fit’ party from step 2 as long as it supports electoral reform. Chosing the one of the big two parties, which reject reform, is a vote for more elections where you can’t vote for what you really want.\nIf your chosen party is standing but not the one that won last time, you should definitely still vote for them. You might wonder what the point is if they won’t win, but there’s always a point. More than one, in fact:\n- You will help your party keep its deposit. Parties have to pay £500 to stand, and this is a large amount of money for smaller parties. They get this deposit back if they get at least 5% of the vote. Your vote can help them to get that money back and spend it on things like local elections. Parties that struggle to win in general elections often have many hundreds of councillors, so that money can be used to get councillors of the party you like best onto your local council\n- Media companies cover parties more when their national vote share increases. Since parties struggle to break through without media coverage, your vote will help your party become a serious contender in the future. This is in your interests since they most closely represent your views\n- You will help the MPs elected elsewhere in your chosen party. There is state funding for political parties called ‘Short Money’. All opposition parties with MPs receive funding based on the number of votes nationally, whether they win in that constituency or not. For every 200 votes they receive an extra £33. In smaller parties without much money this makes a huge difference. For example, the Green Party currently have one MP, but the national vote share results in Short Money that pays for parliamentary researchers who can help her find the data she needs to hold the government to account. By voting for your party, even if you are told they are a ‘wasted vote’, you are helping their MPs elected elsewhere speak up for what you believe in Parliament. This is vital.\nShould you vote ‘tactically’ in a marginal seat?\nThis is a personal decision. Its easier if you don’t really mind the two parties most likely to win in your constituency - let them fight it out and vote for the party you like best anyway, for the reasons in the list above.\nIf you strongly oppose one of the two parties most likely to win then you have a tougher choice. The more marginal your constituency is, the more you may feel you have to vote for one of the two to ‘keep the other out’. This in understandable and I’m not going to try to persuade you otherwise. All I would suggest is that you make yourself feel better about this compromise, and help the party that you really wanted to vote for, by ‘vote swapping’.\nTo vote swap, go to Swap My Vote and enter the party you want and the one you are willing to vote for tactically. You will be matched-up with someone willing to vote the other way. In this way you can help stop the party you dislike winning your constituency while at the same time helping your chosen party gain national vote share, or perhaps even win in a different constituency. It doesn’t feel as good as voting for who you like best, but if you feel you have to vote tactically it’s the next best thing.\nWhatever you do - go and vote!\nDo vote. It’s important. But equally importantly, don’t let anyone try to bully or convince you to vote for someone you don’t want to vote for. You have the tools you need to find out if you really do agree with a party. You have the information here to know if a ‘tactical’ vote makes sense. The only wasted vote is one that you haven’t considered, is one blindly made on the advice of people whose agenda may be different to yours, or one you simply don’t believe in.\nI hope this guide has been helpful to everyone. We all have our biases but I have been careful to make it politically neutral, so it should help you however you vote.\nPlease do contact me with any suggestions for changes!",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2012_09_16_nhs-vultures_html/content_284.html": "Catalyst is an ‘award winning international corporate finance advisor’. As such, they advise investors and private equity firms about promising opportunities. One of the things that they advise on is the British healthcare ‘industry’.\nSo, given the Coalition promise that their Health and Social Care Act was ‘absolutely not’ about privatisation, what do you think Catalyst are telling advisers? Let’s start with this opinion piece, which is interesting reading. The first line pretty much says it all: “It’s time to put the trials and tribulations of the Health and Social Care Act to one side and emphasise the opportunities for the private sector in healthcare services.” Yes, that’s right - it’s time to put aside the fact that the Tories and Lib Dems have managed to persuade the majority of the electorate that their ‘reforms’ aren’t about privatisation, and go ahead and talk about the privatisation.\nOf course, this privatisation has been going on for some time, but you probably haven’t heard much about it. Granted, you may have heard about Circle Healthcare’s takeover of Hinchingbrooke, or maternity services in the Wirral. You may also have heard about Virgin Care’s and CareUK’s contracts with the NHS - they happened to be mentioned in the Catalyst opinion piece too.\nWhat you probably haven’t heard is that these private providers have failed numerous inspections since they started providing services. CareUK have failed 9 inspections by the Care Quality Commission this year, and yet may take over the George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton this year. I guess failing inspections might not stop such things happening when your old Executive Director has given more than a quarter of a million pounds to the Tories.\nVirgin Care’s Woking Community Hospital was also inspected. Among other things, the Care Quality Commission’s report found patients lying in their own urine, and Virgin were judged to have failed to treat patients with respect and involve them in discussions. Of course, you didn’t hear this on the news - you only hear about ‘NHS problems’.\nThis article is a rather good summary of what has happened so far. And we can look forward to a lot more privatisation. As this Catalyst ‘Healthcare Services Sector Report’ shows, investors are lining-up to pick the flesh from the bones of the NHS. You’ll notice that the report even includes a quote from the Chief Executive of Southern Cross (at the bottom of page 5) - you’ll remember how they are a great example of private care.\nOf course, some people might say that they don’t care if the NHS is run by private companies for profit, as long as it’s ‘free at the point of use’. This is what the Liberal Democrats cling to as an excuse for voting for the NHS break-up. Interestingly, ‘free at the point of use’ has already started to change - certain Trusts have ended the right for pregnant mothers to have a 12 week scan. Some Trusts have begun denying hernia operations and treatment for varicose veins to NHS patients. Stephen Dorrell MP, the Chairman of the Health Select Committee has said that some services will be charged for and some will not. As to which will be… well, that’s a ‘postcode lottery’, thanks to the Government’s break-up of the NHS into lots of tiny, easy-to-buy pieces. And don’t think that the private sector will be competing on merit - the coalition have mandated that NHS hospitals have to each sell six services to the likes of CareUK and Virgin by next year, whether it’s cheaper, better, or more efficient… or not.\nFinally, the government are keen to point out that other countries don’t operate healthcare like we do here (or did, until recently). Interestingly, doctors in the country that most closely resembles the system we’re moving to now don’t really like it at all and want to get rid of market forces. Fancy that.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2012_01_05_rail-fare-increase_html/content_213.html": "Photo by Bright Meadow\nI’m painfully aware of the UK’s rail system, travelling around 5,000 miles a month by train at the moment. These hours sat in trains and stations have included pretty much every sort of event, fault and engineering issue that might reasonably be expected. Thankfully I don’t have to pay for this travel as my company foots the bill, but one can’t help but be aware of the costs involved. At the start of the year most rail fares in the UK went up, with the average rise being just under 6%. Some fares rose by almost twice as much.\nRunning a railway network is, of course, pretty expensive. However, while this is true it’s presumably true in the rest of Europe too, and yet UK commuters pay between 3.5 and 10 times more than equivalent European journeys. It’s tempting to believe in the dismissal of this by free-marketer’s that it’s because European railways receive a lot more subsidy than the UK’s, but ticket revenue currently amounts to around £6.5 billion a year, while government pays around £4bn. This subsidy is not provided entirely to keep the trains running - a significant proportion of it goes directly into the pockets of shareholders and bosses. For example, this page showing profits and executive pay in 2008 shows a number of operating company CEOs receiving pay packets of around a million pounds. This is despite their companies having to receive billions in subsidies to operate. We have the strange situation in that these companies are effectively public (in that we pay for them through taxes), yet they cream-off some of this money in excessive pay and ‘profits’. How does this make sense? On most rail routes passengers don’t have any choice of provider, and fares and timetables dictated by regulators. What have the companies done to deserve these ‘profits’ and huge pay packets?\nRail problems in the UK are down to political free-market ideology and, whether you agree with that or not, a botched privatisation. The model for BR’s privatisation was that used in Sweden in 1988, where the state railway was split into two - a track network operator and train operating companies. This was the first time such a split had been tried, and John Major’s Conservative government followed this model in The Railways Act of 1993. It is notable that the Swedish privatisation suffered from the train operating companies repeatedly going bankrupt and was renationalised in 2001.\nThatcher herself considered the privatisation of BR a step too far, but prepared the ground for it. First the British Transport Hotels were sold off in 1982 and, Sealink was sold in 1984. These were both profitable assets for the state, but the hotels were sold off cheaply to private owners, and the old Sealink routes are now making those profits for Swedish company Stena Line. British Rail’s engineering division, which under BR made trains and equipment within the UK and for export, and employed thousands of workers, was sold in 1988. Privatisation of BR caused orders to effectively stop, which lead to the almost complete destruction of the train manufacturing industry in the UK, with the former BR works in Derby the only remaining site. After passing through a number of owners the remains of the old BR engineering works are now run by Canadian company Bombardier, one of the companies which took over BR’s R&D facilities after privatisation. By 1993, when the Railways Act was written to sell what remained of BR, all that was left was the rail network and trains.\nSo privatised UK rail is inefficient, but surely we are getting some benefits? Well, no. You may occasionally see shiny trains, but these are mostly refurbished BR equipment, in fact the average age of trains in the UK is currently no different to that under the last years of BR. Any new trains, which would previously have been built by BR in the UK by British workers are now either built for Canadian profit in the remaining ex-BR plants in Derby or Crewe, or imported. Old BR works in York and Birmingham have closed. Despite this, the privatised railways now receive more government subsidy than BR ever did. In 1994, the total government support received by BR was £2,168m in 2005 terms, while in 2005, government support from all sources totalled £4,593m, despite a lack of any increase in government investment in improving infrastructure.\nThe train operating companies claim that they are investing money from increased fares, but how did this compare with BR? While BR received less financial support than in most European countries from the government, it successfully completed major infrastructure upgrades such as the electrification of the West Coast, Great Eastern and East Coast main lines, the design and introduction of the InterCity 125 and InterCity 225 express trains and the total modernisation of various routes around London. In BR’s final years it could claim to run more trains at more than 100 mph than any other railway in the world. Since privatisation there has been considerable expenditure on modernising the system, but largely confined to a few routes - and many of these investment schemes were in fact initiated by British Rail rather than the private companies.\nThe big parties know the privatisation has failed, even the Tories - in 1996 Chris Grayling, Conservative transport spokesman, admitted that the split of the rail industry into track and train components had been a mistake. In 2004, the Labour Party Conference voted by 2 to 1 in favour of the government taking the train operating companies back into public ownership as franchises expired, but this was immediately ruled out by the then Transport Secretary Alastair Darling. The Labour leadership has refused to consider renationalisation since. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all support continuation of the privatised structure, despite what (in Labour’s case) their members may wish. Only the Green Party support bringing the railway network back into public hands.\nThe McNulty review of the UK railway industry in 2011 found that the fragmentation of the industry in the course of privatisation had caused a permanent increase in costs of between 20% and 30%. The UK rail network has moved from being one of the best and cheapest to run under BR to one of the most expensive, and the country has lost almost all of its engineering and train manufacturing capacity. The government should not be allowing these private companies to increase fares - in these times of ‘austerity’ they should be pursuing the most efficient option available, renationalisation.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2013_07_10_royal-mail-privatisation_html/content_187.html": "The coalition government today announced its plans to sell-off another public service - Royal Mail. The deal has been sweetened by offering 10% of the shares to Royal Mail staff, while the rest will sold on the stock market (rather than sold to another operator).\nThe sell-off of Royal Mail is economically illiterate, of course. In the twelve months up to March it made £403m - that’s money going into the public purse and reducing taxes for all. Indeed, this profit growth looks set to continue thanks to the growth of Internet shopping, with the volume of parcels seeing a 5% annual rise. While selling the company may raise £2bn, that’s only around five year’s worth of profit. This is plainly bad value for the taxpayer, but handy for George Osborne to fix short-term holes in his budget.\nRoyal Mail is, of course, obliged to provide universal service for post. That is to say, you can post a letter from anywhere to anywhere for the same price. This is a basic requirement of a service, whether phone, post or electricity supply. However, clauses in the Postal Services Bill show that the regulator will have a new duty to decide whether the universal guarantee places an “unfair” burden on Royal Mail, so a privatised Royal Mail will not have to bother delivering post to rural areas if it decides it is too expensive to do so. Do the government really think that these deliveries will continue once profit is the motive, rather than public service?\nSo why are the government privatising yet another publicly owned organisation given how appallingly bad value previous privatisations have been? Vince Cable has said “It’s now time for employees to hold a stake in the company and share in its success.”, but he seems to have forgotten that they already do since we all own it already. The employees may well get to own a bit more, but every other person in the UK will own a lot less. There are also claims that privatisation will allow ‘much needed investment’, but requiring the private sector to do this is one of the biggest myths peddled by neoliberal voices in the main three parties. The government could invest if it wanted to, and public sector borrowing is the cheapest borrowing and has never been cheaper. You don’t magically find investment in a service by selling it - look how well that has worked with the railways, where subsidies are higher than they ever were under British Rail with little investment to show for it.\nNo, this move is nothing to do with improving Royal Mail. It’s not improving its efficiency, value for money, or quality. It’s about everything else this government does - selling-off every publicly owned asset we have in a mad rush before the next election in the vain hope that it will be undo-able by future government. The neoliberal dream of ‘small government for the rich’ is moving ever closer, and we must be aware of the lies being peddled to make it that way. The public do not want this. The staff do not want it. Who does? Tory and Lib Dem friends in the City who are hungry for another asset-stripping operation on something we all own that will be sold for far less than it’s worth and we’ll all miss when it’s gone.\nAnd we will miss it. In ten year’s time the post will be like the trains. Do you want to post a letter to granny in Devon? Well, you’ll have to find out which of several ‘postal operators’ deliver to her village. If any do, you’ll have to get a price for sending a letter of that size/shape/however else they all (differently) calculate the cost. Then, of course, you’ll have to find a post-box for the correct company. If there is one near you, that is. And even if you’re prepared for all of that to get cheaper stamps, prepare to be disappointed - postal services really only work with scale. With several smaller services they will all cost more.\nIf you think this is simply scare-mongering, the real world has plenty of examples. You can read about what happened to the Dutch postal system after privatisation. Even the Daily Mail, stalwart of all that is repellant, said “Privatisation in Holland…also led to the closure of around 90 per cent of the country’s post offices…Dutch post boxes are emptied only once a day…complaints about the reliability of Holland’s privatised post are widespread. The move was supposed to increase competition and lead to better services. But the opposite occurred. New firms paying workers below the minimum wage hit deep into the profits of TNT. In response, TNT replaced 11,000 workers who work more than 25 hours a week with cheaper part-time workers and franchisees. TNT says it wants to cut deliveries to just three days a week. ‘If politicians want six days a week, then they will have to finance it,’ declared Peter Kuinz, TNT’s managing director.”\nThat’s the reality of what the government is doing, and it really isn’t to help you or save you money, it’s about changing our postal system to deliver the maximum amount of unwanted mail at the minimum cost to businesses. And remember that Labour want to privatise Royal Mail too, however much you might see them in the news objecting to this.\nWe will lose our public services if we don’t fight for them. Whatever Cable says, this is not yet a done deal. Support the strikers and make your views known. It’s the only way to hang on to a sensible system that we all depend upon, especially the elderly and vulnerable.",

With the current (and very welcome!) competition between the parties on who can be the most 'green' I expected more green taxes for one thing, yet the only real difference is a slight increase in fuel duty and a higher road tax for the most polluting vehicles, although the threshold for this is so high that it doesn't even cover most 4x4.\nThe move that surprised almost everyone was the 2p cut in the basic rate of income tax, although this came with the scrapping of the 10p band, so those on the lowest wages will actually pay more.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2017_03_29_article-50_html/content_99.html": "Today is the day. Despite knowing that she is causing potentially irreversible harm to the country she leads, our Prime Minister has chosen to trigger Article 50, signalling our exit from the EU in two years.\nFirstly it’s important to consider the legitimacy of this decision. We have a Prime Minister who was not leader (and nobody expected to be leader) when her party won a majority in 2015 - a victory that came with just 24% of the vote, thanks to our broken electoral system. When her party won its mandate it was on a pro-EU position, and indeed they specified in their manifesto that even if we left the EU they were committed to staying in the single market.\nThe referendum itself has been criticised at length. Yes, the campaign to remain was poorly run, and it was hindered by being supported by a number of unpopular politicians. However, the ‘leave’ campaign was demonstrably built on, to be generous, a mistaken take on how the EU actually works and, more accurately, lies.\nThe fact that politicians promising to give money to the NHS were ideologically opposed to the very existence of the NHS couldn’t have escaped the notice of anyone who thought about it for more than a second. The £350m figure itself was a provable lie, and talk about the EU being ‘undemocratic’ didn’t stand up to scrutiny, as well as being a ridiculous accusation by people who support the British electoral system, with FPTP, an unelected second chamber who are appointed for life, and a reigning monarch.\nBut as I say, all such criticisms have been made many times. We can complain about the abject failure of the government to demand a significant majority to make constitutional change (just like almost every other country does, and the EU!). We can complain about the campaigns on both sides. We can complain about the question being put in the first place. But the result happened, and 36% of the electorate voted to leave.\nThe worst betrayal was what happened next.\nNobody significant in the leave campaign suggested leaving the single market or any other EU institutions. This was not the question on the ballot. Even so, the hard right coup in the Conservative Party resulted in the referendum being taken to mean ‘hard Brexit’. Not only that, but there has been a subsequent campaign by the Leave side to paint this as the only option, with anyone questioning it painted as a ‘remoaner’ or being against the ‘will of the people’.\nLet us be absolutely clear - the only ‘will of the people’, ignoring failures in the campaigns and uninformed electors, was the ‘will’ of 36% of the people. That ‘will’ was to leave the EU - nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is up for negotiation.\nIt makes me furious when those who talk about ‘respecting democracy’ support the use of the executive to implement their hard-right ideals without debate. Just look at the faux outrage from the Right and their masters in the tabloids when someone had the temerity to use the law to force the government to actually take leaving the EU to the Commons for a vote. Judges, upholding the law, were branded as ‘enemies of the people’. MPs representing constituencies where the majority voted to remain were told that representing their constituents (which is their job) would somehow be ‘undemocratic’. Almost every action taken by the Leave side since the referendum has been against democracy and the rule of law.\nAnd now we are at the stage where we are actually triggering our intent to leave. It is a profoundly sad day. The worst part is that not only is it obvious to me, but it’s obvious to the majority of MPs and even the Prime Minister herself. They are knowingly taking a course of action that they know will make the people they represent poorer and less free, and they are doing it because they are scared of the right wing press, and in some cases for their jobs.\nSo who are the ‘enemies of the people’? I’ll tell you who they are - it’s those MPs who have taken a decision they know is wrong because they are cowards.\nSome ask for patience. “Let’s see how it goes”, they say, “it might work out OK”. Yes, it might. It’s unlikely, but it might. If we are very, very lucky then we might just end-up with a deal that almost as good as what we have now, and we’ll have spent years and untold billions getting to that position. In the worst case, and the government worryingly seem to be easy with this, we will end-up with no deal, and trade with our closest neighbours and the largest trading block in the world will become more difficult and expensive. We will all be a lot poorer. Forgive me if I don’t think that this process or either outcome is somehow something we should support.\nSo there are the self-serving MPs. They deserve our anger and contempt. Then there were the people who knew exactly what leaving the EU would mean and campaigned for it. They are, by and large, the hard right. They are people who call worker and environmental protections ‘red tape’, think climate change is a ‘hoax’, and have a long record of campaigning against anything that gets in the way of big business and the rich. They are your Rupert Murdochs, your Nigel Farages, your Daniel Hannans - people who two minutes of research would show have no record of wanting to help ordinary people at all. They are the super-rich parasites who hate anything that stops them and their friends getting richer. Yet, as all through history, they somehow paint themselves as ‘anti establishment’ despite being the epitome of the establishment.\nFor the record I don’t think many involved with the Leave campaign were racist. Sure, they appealed to racists, but racism and intolerance have always been tools of the right to divide opposition. As a result they picked-up some racist campaigners and racists voted to leave because of promises over immigration control. But don’t be fooled - the puppet masters at the top don’t worry about race. For them it’s about power and money.\nI’m not going to say it’s wrong to criticise people who voted to leave. Sure, they are not all racist - we probably all know perfectly reasonable people who voted that way and who are in no way racist. But we should still be angry at them, just as we should be angry at anyone who takes an active step to make us poorer and restrict opportunity for us and our children.\nThis referendum was not like a normal election. While I despair when people vote Tory then complain that the NHS is getting worse without realising they are the cause, that is at least (theoretically) something that can be undone in five years. But not with the referendum.\nI want to be clear on this. If you voted to leave the EU then everything that happens in the next few years is your fault. The inability of my children to work, live and love in Europe without having to jump through hoops or pay is your fault. The loss of the chance for my children to escape the UK’s most expensive universities in the world and be educated for free in the EU is your fault. The restriction on their opportunities and lives, and the loss of freedoms we have all enjoyed for the last 40 years is your fault.\nI am furious with you. I’m furious with either your intention to restrict the lives and opportunities of others or the wilful neglect of your uninformed vote. In 15 years time when university is for the rich and my kids can’t go (or must accept crippling debt) I will blame you. When foreign travel becomes a luxury on the rich can afford I will blame you. When we are living in a polluted tax haven and I am not allowed to sell-up and move to a more enlightened country I will blame you.\nYou have tied me and my family to a hard-Right rock of ignorance and intolerance and left it to sink. You have condemned generations to being part of your little-England fantasy against their wills. You have changed my children’s futures from those of outward looking collaboration to one of us-and-them narrow minded nationalism, where they have to accept wages and working conditions to compete with the Indians and Chinese who are now their ‘competitors’, rather than the wages and protections you yourself enjoyed as part of a European workforce.\nYou might not know what you have done. You might not accept it’s your fault. But it is.\nHowever, redemption is always possible. The anger will always be there for what has happened, but let’s work together to get out of this situation. Let’s fight to stop Brexit. If that doesn’t work, let’s fight to make it as ‘soft’ as possible, then pledge to rejoin as soon as possible.\nHistory will judge those who acted to make their country, themselves and their families poorer and remove their freedoms and opportunities. We now all have a chance to be on the right side of history by joining the fight to keep what we can, and if necessary get it back.\nWhat are you going to say when your children ask you “What did you do when they were taking those freedoms from us?”. Whatever the future holds, I’ll be able to look mine in the eye. I hope you will too.",

Considering that I haven't really run around much since school (where, let's face it, I was forced to.. usually by a rather insistent Brother James) this might seem like a slightly foolhardy step. However, I do have until the 16th of March next year to get ready for it, so it's not insurmountable.\nWhere there's a difficult looking task, there's a gadget to help. In my case I plumped for a GPS watch that I can plug into the computer to see my route and stats on Google Maps.

This is an opportunity for us all to celebrate and, importantly, promote small businesses - specifically (as it is a Saturday), shops.\nBath is incredibly fortunate in that is has a large number of independent shops. Some of them have prepared special gifts for customers tomorrow (first come first served!) - you can see a list of the shops involved here. I encourage you to pop along to as many as you can and make the most of the effort that our lovely local shops have gone to. Then, of course, continue to go to them next time you’re in town!\nThere are many good reasons to shop with independent businesses. Not only is money spent in the community more likely to stay in the community, but smaller businesses employ proportionately more staff, are more likely to buy from other local businesses, and are much more likely to pay all taxes due. It is also much better for the environment for people to shop close to where they live - the only way to create a sustainable society is for most goods to be available locally for most of the people.\nSustainable industries are most likely to be small businesses, not-for-profit enterprises, charity or community-based organisations, publically owned or mutuals. Scaling up might be through social franchises, with local ownership and control.\nOf course, it is a core philosophy of the Green Party to promote shopping locally and to prefer independents over large corporations with their dodgy tax practices and offshoring. We have always and will continue to campaign for tax relief for small businesses, and we have a significant number of policies designed to promote and help them. For example, small businesses in the UK find it difficult to get timely access to external funds and affordable interest rates. We would create Community Banks which would have funds available for local activities. They would give local firms and co-operatives access to funds managed locally and supplied at preferential rates. Community scale investment could also be supported through the creation of community currencies which could be supported by local councils.\nPromoting and using small business is something I try to do every time I need to buy anything, regardless of whether I am fighting an election or not. It’s easy for politicians to claim to ‘support local businesses’ but not actually do so, especially when they belong to parties with ties to huge corporations. We are the only party that does not receive funding from those large companies and therefore have not been compromised.",

However, my MP Ben Howlett and his Conservatives don’t think that should be the case. They voted down a law that would have made it a legal requirement for rented property to be habitable.\nAsk yourself why. Isn’t a property fit for human habitation the very least one should expect when renting? Who do these Tories represent? It’s certainly not you and me.\nThe simple fact is that the Tories don’t fight for you. They fight for the millionaires that fund them. Some of those millionaires are property barons who don’t like having to provide decent housing. Others, of course, run private healthcare companies which is why the Tories are giving them our NHS. Yet others run academy chains and free schools, which is why education is being taken out of local democratic control and handed to people who profit from it.\nWe have four years to the next election.

Bin Charges and the Big Society\np(meta). 14 April 2011\nIt looks as though the government is set to scrap fines for breaking the rules of domestic waste collection. This is being hailed by many as a good thing. But why do they think this?\nCurrently councils have the power to levy a fixed-penalty notice on residents if they repeatedly break the rules covering rubbish collections, such as recycling incorrectly or leaving waste out on the wrong day. Recycling incorrectly can include persistently putting the wrong materials into recycling containers or putting recyclable materials into the landfill waste. In reality few people have received fines for this as most councils will simply throw contaminated recycling into general waste [1] before moving on to fines in a small percentage of cases.\nBut fines or no fines, let’s be clear - it is our responsibility to do our bit in these constrained times. David Cameron might call this his ‘Big Society’, some of us may call it social responsibility and just doing ‘the right thing’. If councils have got to the point where they are cutting bugets for education and closing libraries, do we want them to have to pay out their scant resources on landfill tax that has to be paid thanks to people not sorting their rubbish? Or the costs of having people sort through recycling? If people can’t even be bothered to spend two seconds considering which bin to put their recycling into, is there any hope at all for the ‘Big Society’ when it comes to expecting people to take over from the State?\nThe strange thing is that it’s generally the people on the Right who are complaining about having to sort their rubbish, and it’s the Tories who are heralding the scrapping of fines as some sort of great social win. At the same time however these are exactly the same people who are telling us that we’ll all have to pitch-in to help. This is smallest bit of pitching-in imaginable, and yet they are already refusing. Is this a case of ‘do what I say, not as I do’?\nThose of us with an environmental bent have been seperating our recycling for years, of course, and anyone whose council offers food waste collection really has no reason to have ‘smelly’ rubbish. It depends on area of course, but somewhere such as Bath (where I live), where there is little that isn’t collected via doorstep recycling, fortnightly collections are fine. For some people like myself who don’t have kids, monthly collections would probably be ok.\nI honestly struggle to think of how a single person or couple could possibly fill a black bag with non-recyclables in a normal week, which rather suggests that they’re not recycling. Not only should the council refuse to keep subsidising this laziness, but they absolutely should start a regime of fines. The carrot has been used for long enough - it’s time to bring-out the stick.\nReferences\n- http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=27489\n–",

Yes, almost certainly. But we need to go further than that. #dangerousdogs ♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nLet’s talk about dangerous dogs. Now, there’s a very simple solution to a lot of the problem we have with dogs, in my mind: all dogs, literally every dog, should be licensed. Also if you have any kind of conviction for cruelty or irrresponsiblity keeping a dog, then you are banned from keeping any more dogs for life.\nThat’s it - end of. Minimum. After all, a pet is a responsibility, not a right. If you prove yourself cruel or irresponsible then why should you be allowed any more dogs? So that’s just off the bat - no dogs if you’re found cruel or irresponsible. Dog licensing was previously only used as a slight revenue generator in the past when we had dog licenses, but now with today’s technology we have a much better scope for using it to ensure that dogs are well treated and that owners are responsible.\nDogs are already microchipped, or should be. A licensing scheme can tie that microchip to the license. A vet could demand to see your license every time you take your dog in. If you buy or sell any dog, you should demand to see licenses. People might say “Oh, well, there’ll be a black market, people won’t bother with them.”\nAnd sure enough, when we had dog licenses it is estimated that about half the people with dogs didn’t have one. But technology has moved on and that’s not a good argument for not doing it again.\nIn my mind, in a world where people are regularly bitten by dogs there’s no excuse for not trying to do something about it. You can’t just shrug, and you can’t say equally, “Oh, but my freedom! Why shouldn’t I be allowed an enormous fighting dog?” Because why should you have one?\nWe should just use statistics. Look at all breeds, and if more than a certain percentage of dog attacks are by this particular breed, put restrictions on it. Start with just making sure that they are muzzled (ie it’s a legal requirement to muzzle them in public). If that doesn’t work then look at stronger measures. But there’s no point just sort of shrugging our shoulders and going “what can we do?”\nAt the moment Suella Breverman’s looking at banning ‘bully XL’ dogs. We’ll see where that goes. But let’s say she does. There’ll be another dog. There’ll be another large fighting dog that the sort of people who buy these things go for, so the only solution is to look over all dog breeds and come up with some sort of automatic ‘if X many attacks happen, then this is considered a dangerous dog’ calculation. Muzzle them by default and then ban them if it goes beyond a sudden higher percentage than that.\nI’ve got a dog. I love dogs. I love pets, but I’m not the sort of person who wants to buy a dog to look tough, a dog that looks dangerous. I think there is a certain psychology behind those people that we, as a country, shouldn’t really endorse or support. So sure, look dangerous if you want, but make sure that dog’s wearing a muzzle. And be ready to accept severe penalties if you willingly circumvent these attempts to keep your dog safe.",

In theory the cable should be ok if it can live with the Tivo, and indeed it can. Although there are no spare SCART or composite outputs on the Tivo, the Slingbox comes with an adapter that sits between the SCART socket and cable and sneaks some composite video out. This goes into the Slingbox. Out of the Slingbox come two IR LEDs that you position in front of the Tivo so that it receives their signals, as if they were the remote.

The press seems to be aching for us to get involved in yet another conflict that will resolve nothing but will almost certainly kill a lot of innocent people and make us more enemies in the world.\nHave we learned nothing?\nSome argue that a bombing campaign could save lives here. Let’s be generous and say that we agree (if ISIS are eliminated). How many bombing runs will that take? A thousand?

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2011_11_15_circle-nhs-takeover_html/content_311.html": "h1. Circle’s NHS Takeover\np(meta). 15 November 2011\nCircle Healthcare’s 10 year contract to run Hinchingbrooke hospital got plenty of media attention over the weekend, and this is not without reason - it marks the first major move of a private healthcare company in taking over NHS services. It is not the first private sector involvement of course - private companies have been used to provide some services and treatment centres for a while now, and then there are contracted-out services such as cleaning and catering. However, this deal marks a significant departure into a new area, where a private company is actually managing NHS staff and is directly responsible for critical services such as A&E.\nSo who are Circle Healthcare? John Lister has written an excellent piece on the company in The Guardian which there is little point me repeating here, but it is definitely a worthwhile read. Circle are not the ‘cuddly John Lewis-style partnership’ that they often claim to be, so much as mostly being owned by bankers, hedge funds and private equity, based in offshore tax havens. That’s right - any money that Circle makes from the taxpayer is not going to have any tax paid on it, it will simply flow out of the country.\nCircle cannot really hope to run Hinchingbrooke more cheaply than the current management unless they cut staff or services. It is interesting that the contract signed with them has not been published. Ten years is a long time though, and one can imagine that they will not be allowed to fail. Perhaps, as in other privatisations, they will be given public assets for little or no cost? Perhaps existing debts will be covered by the NHS? The future may answer these questions, but by then it will be too late for someone, whether that’s the local population and their health, or the taxpayer.\nWhere’s there’s money to be made you can bet there are some questionable ethics. Circle’s backers include Paul Ruddock, whose company, Lansdowne UK, owns 18.9% of Circle Holdings. Ruddock is one of the Conservative party’s most generous donors. Other shareholders include Odey Asset Management with a 21.4% share; its founder, Crispin Odey, is also a large Tory donor. Is it possible that these large donors to the Tories gave their money without any understood pay-off? If it is then they must be very happy at this unlikely co-incidence.\nNow let’s address some mistruths people will often hear around this story. Some may claim that this isn’t privatisation, but what else would you call it when something that is currently run by the public sector is handed to the private sector? What else could anyone mean by privatisation? An operation that was run for public benefit will now be run for profit.\nAlso, some may say that the current hospital management have ‘failed’ and ‘deserve’ to be replaced. Why does Hinchingbrooke owe so much? Well, that’s mostly because of a huge PFI deal that they were strong-armed into making by the Department of Health. If services were to be updated it was the only way the government would give them the money. What would you have done? Offer services in unsuitable old buildings, unsuitable for modern equipment and increasing chances of hospital infections, or take the only source of money that the government was willing to give you? Because the NHS is run as a service, and not a business, the managers made the decision that was in the best interests of the patients and made the deal. I don’t think they should be punished for this.\nIt is interesting to hear of Ali Parsa, founder of Circle, speculating why Hitchingbrooke may be in trouble. He pointed out that there were 5,000 patients living within a “few miles of the hospital that do not use us. That’s £5m in lost patient income every year.” Just listen to his words - it’s all about ‘patient income’. Is that the way we want our hospitals to think? And what is he going to do to convince those people to come to hospital? Make them sick? Spend lots of money on advertising that rubbishes other local NHS hospitals?\nFor all the talk of ‘failing’ hospitals it is worth considering the fact that good care is now secondary to being forced by government into bad deals with the private sector, as with Hitchingbrooke’s PFI debt. Perhaps if the Department of Health was willing to invest in capital projects like new hospitals and not force providers into expensive PFI deals, everyone would be better off?\nDavid Cameron said something rather telling on Saturday “From the Health Secretary, I don’t just want to know about waiting times. I want to know how we drive the NHS to be a fantastic business”. It’s not a business, Cameron - it’s a service. It’s a service which should be there for our health, not as a ‘business’ to make money. It is easy to dismiss this as the usual Tory obsession with everything having to make a profit for rich investors, but let’s not forget that it was Labour’s Andy Burnham who kicked-off the process of getting private management into Hitchingbrooke in the first place. Labour are almost as bad as the Tories and Liberal Democrats when it comes to a baseless belief in the efficiency of the private sector. It is a source of considerable frustration to me that the actual evidence is that the NHS is the most efficient healthcare system, whereas there is absolutely no evidence that companies such as Circle can even run a general hospital. Indeed, they have yet to even run one of their own fully-private ones at a profit.\nWe are feeling the effects of a fundamental shift in the way that elected officials operate, started by the last Tory government, continued by Labour, and now accelerating under the coalition. Over these years the role of national and local government has been steadily transformed from providing municipal and sociabilityal services for the people to facilitating further investment opportunities for private capital. This general change goes uncriticised by the media and more or less unnoticed by the electorate, but the results can be seen in the funding of political parties by companies and the advantages handed to them, paid for by the taxpayer.\nIn the end one must remember a fundamental difference between Circle and the NHS. The overriding priority of Circle is to make a profit. The overriding priority of the NHS is to provide a health service. Circle have no experience of running a general hospital and only employ 568 staff. They have never made a profit, but any that they might make will go to the British Virgin Islands to avoid tax. The NHS, on the other hand, is the most efficient healthcare system in the world, and everyone who works for it pays their full share of tax in the UK. Who would you want running your hospital?",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2024_06_06_close-of-nominations_html/content_40.html": "Even those with little interest in politics couldn’t help but notice the general election campaign since the date was announced. The relatively short amount of time all of the parties have (although it might not feel that way to those on the receiving end) means that a lot of ‘stuff’ has to fit into six weeks.\nThis has pros and cons as a candidate. My immediate advantage over some of the others is that I was selected absolutely ages ago, back in 2022 I think, so my local party hasn’t had to scramble around with a rushed selection process.\nThe Green Party nationally has actually been much more ‘on the ball’ than most others in this regard. A few days after the election was announced we already had the second largest number of candidates selected - more than the Tories and Lib Dems.\nThe Tories being caught on the back foot by the announcement might come as a surprise to many people. “Surely they would have been briefed that an election was coming before the general public were?”, you might think. This very much appears not to be the case, and by all accounts there were many local Conservative ‘associations’ rather annoyed about not knowing the date in advance.\nSo here we are, one day away from the deadline for nominations and some candidates are probably not quite confirmed yet. This means that despite all of the media noise you might not actually get to vote for someone you expected to. They may also be some unexpected candidates on the ballot.\nI am pleased to say that my papers are in and validated, and I will definitely be on the ballot for Bath. My Green colleague in the photo, Edmund Cannon, will also definitely be on the ballot for North East Somerset and Hanham (where Rees-Mogg is standing).\nLabour, the Tories, the Lib Dems and Reform have also announced candidates for Bath, but until the council publishes the statement of persons nominated and notice of poll tomorrow we won’t know for sure who is definitely going to be an option for voters.\nA great result for me, although admittedly unlikely, would be if everyone else is late or has messed-up their forms and I am the only candidate, thus winning by default.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2024_12_10_spotify-wrapped_html/content_163.html": "Why I wont be sharing my ‘Spotify Wrapped’\nEvery year, around this time, countless artists eagerly share their Spotify Wrapped stats with the world. Let me be clear from the start: I don’t begrudge anyone doing so. If an artist is proud of what they’ve achieved, more power to them. This isn’t an article criticising their choice to celebrate their milestones. Rather, it’s about why I’ve chosen not to participate.\nIt’s Not About Hiding Anything\nI’m not shying away because I’ve got something to hide. I’m perfectly open about the fact that my music reaches a modest audience. In fact, this year, I’ve gained more listeners than ever, and I’m pleased with that. But I’m still operating on a small scale. My reluctance to share my stats doesn’t stem from embarrassment or a desire to obscure my standing. Instead, it’s about something deeper: the toxic culture that surrounds these numbers.\nThe Problem With Spotify’s Numbers\nI’ve always had a problem with Spotify prominently displaying an artist’s monthly listener count on their profile. This feature fosters an unhealthy obsession with numbers. It drives behaviours like playlist botting and paid promotions to artificially inflate stats because, like it or not, those figures influence how listeners perceive music.\nThe logic is flawed, but it exists nonetheless: low numbers equate to low quality in the eyes of some. This system discourages genuine discovery of lesser-known artists. On other streaming platforms, where such statistics aren’t front and centre, listeners are arguably more inclined to give unfamiliar music a chance. That’s real discovery—finding artists who are talented but not yet well-known.\nSpotify, however, perpetuates a cycle of promoting the already popular. Even the platform’s much-touted discovery features, like its recommendations, often lead to artists who are already well-established. After one of my songs finishes playing, the next recommendation is almost always someone with hundreds of thousands of listeners—artists I already know. That’s not discovery; it’s recycling. What about the smaller, independent artists who deserve a shot?\nThe Broader Implications for Artists\nThis obsession with numbers has practical consequences too. Venues and promoters increasingly use Spotify stats to determine whether an artist is worth booking. They’ll often check monthly listener counts as part of their decision-making process. For many smaller musicians, this makes Spotify an inescapable part of their career, even if they’d rather direct listeners to platforms like Bandcamp or Tidal, which pay far better royalties.\nSpotify has us hooked, and they know it. Their dominance ensures that artists feel compelled to drive traffic to the platform, even if it’s not in their best interest. I’m guilty of it myself. When I release a song, I post a Spotify link because I want those numbers to climb. I resent doing it, but the ecosystem leaves me little choice.\nWhy I’m Opting Out of Spotify Wrapped\nThis brings me to Spotify Wrapped, the culmination of this numbers-driven culture. Every year, artists and listeners alike are encouraged to share their stats as a badge of honour. It’s become a normalised ritual, but it’s ultimately just another way Spotify reinforces the importance of these numbers.\nAs an artist, I can see my stats anytime. They’re useful for marketing, understanding my audience, and planning my next moves. But making these numbers public doesn’t benefit me—or most artists. Unless you’re a massive name, your numbers will always pale in comparison to someone else’s. It’s a game that smaller artists can’t win.\nA Call for Change\nInstead of feeding this toxic system, I propose we do better. Let’s stop amplifying Spotify’s advertising under the guise of Wrapped. Let’s question why we’re promoting a platform that pays Joe Rogan hundreds of millions while underpaying independent artists. Let’s push for platforms that treat musicians more fairly and genuinely support discovery of new talent.\nI’m not suggesting that Spotify has no place in the music industry, but its current model doesn’t serve smaller artists. Wrapped is a celebration of numbers, not music. So this year, I’m choosing to step back. My voice may be small, but it’s one I’ll use to advocate for something better—something that values artistry over algorithms.\nTo receive my new politics posts directly by email or in the Substack app, please subscribe",

On the one hand, I completely and utterly disapprove of politicisation of the police brought-about by this government via its elections for Police Commissioners. The fact that those elected will ‘earn’ so much money for it (85,000 per year here) and that nobody wanted these elections in the first place doesn’t help.\nIf a minimum turnout threshold was required for validity of the whole election things would be clear-cut - I would not vote, and general voter apathy would be the end of it. However, that isn’t the case, so I must vote since, as this article points out, not voting lets the loonies in. Thankfully there are no EDL or other far-right candidates in my area, but someone will be elected whether I like it or not, so I must mitigate the possible damage.\nI am left with the choice (in Avon and Somerset) of three candidates from the three Old Parties and an independent, Sue Mountstevens.\nTo keep politics out of policing should I vote for Sue Mountstevens? I’ve read her whole Web site and I’m still not sure how authoritarian she is. Actually, what she does say is a good example of how pointless this election is. It’s all very well saying she’ll respond to concerns, improve transparency, etc etc, but all of the candidates say that. What does she really think? And how much scope do any of the candidates have to do anything anyway? There isn’t much, from what I can tell, and again this illustrates how pointless these elections are.\nFor all of their faults, the Liberal Democrats generally stand for tolerance and socially liberal policies, so isn’t their candidate a safter bet, despite the political influence? Not voting for a Lib Dem candidate just because of the things they’ve done in government, such as destroying the NHS, seems rather petty when the alternative is likely to be worse when it comes to crime and policing.\nLabour have repeatedly proved themselves to be far too authoritarian when it comes to crime and punishment, so much so that there’s not much between them and the Tories. They use dogma and ideology as a basis for their crime and punishment policies, which are generally of the ‘string them up’ kind, despite all evidence showing that it’s not an effective way to cut crime. Anyone interested in actually cutting crime cannot vote for these policies. Whatever actual scope they have to influcence policing policy as a PCC, the fact that they have those thoughts in the first place makes them unsuitable candidates for my vote.\nSo, what to do? I have still to decide. I will try to find out more about Sue Mountstevens, but overall I am sad that I am being forced to vote for someone in an election I think is completely wrong-headed in the first place. How can the Tories claim that there is no place for democracy in the Lords and then introduce it into the police, possibly the last place politics should be involved?\nI urge you to vote, especially if you have EDL and the like standing in your area. Racists cannot be allowed to run our police, and by not voting you might let them in. Even if you don’t have any such candidates we should all give it some thought and vote appropriately. Boycotting this election is not giving the government a ‘bloody nose’ - given that the elections will happen regardless, you may well end-up with a police service that goes in the opposite direction you want.",

It is in the interests of all parties for younger voters to fully participate in our democratic system.\nOne problem is that the young are disenfranchised. One clear reason why the Scottish referendum had such a high level of engagement was the inclusion of 16 and 17 year olds. These people are old enough to work full time, marry and have children - isn’t it only fair that they have a say in how their taxes are spent and their children are cared for?\nIt is also clear that many people don’t vote because they consider that their choice won’t make a difference to the result. This is understandable when a majority government can be elected by just 24% percent of eligible voters. The case for using a form of proportional representation in general elections is very strong, and indeed we already use it in other elections. It is time to bring the election of our MPs in line.\nI realise that you have personally benefited from the current system, but I would ask you to consider the future of our democracy, and falling engagement with it, and place tackling this above any party political interests. We all benefit if the public are more engaged with politics.\nYou have a chance to change all of this for the better.

Today has seen another piece of compelling evidence with the news that NHS Wirral has announced it will be using a private provider to provide maternity care.\nThe private company being used, ‘One to One Midwifery’, has an initial three year contract. It is also in talks with other NHS trusts to take over more maternity services. This is privatisation - a private company will now profit from the NHS and we won’t have a choice about it. That’s right, we won’t have a choice, and this is very important to understand. The government keeps providing all sorts of misleading reassurances about patient ‘choice’ being great. There is no actual evidence to show that choice improves care or outcomes, but even if you think it does, choice is not being provided here. Patients in the area are simply being referred to One To One’s services, as the first post on this Mumsnet page demonstrates.\nYou may believe in a fragmented NHS with many competing providers, but even if you do, that’s simply not happening - private companies are simply being handed monopolies, just as they were when other public services were nationalised. Just like the trains, where we were promised that competition would reduce fares and improve services yet the result was higher fares, higher taxpayer subsidies and worse services, the same is going to happen to healthcare.\nBy definition, patient ‘choice’ in healthcare will mean replication, and replication is waste. If patients are referred to ‘One to One’ then the NHS services won’t be used and will eventually be scaled back and closed. To suggest otherwise is simply nonsensical. Once the NHS facilities close, bad luck - you have to use One To One, and you can bet that they’ll start charging way more than the NHS ever did.\nPrivate healthcare companies are in it for the long game. They can afford to lose money on contracts until the NHS services are cut - the profits will come after that, when people have no choice but to use them. Their objective is to make money after all, and you can’t make money unless you pay your staff less or provide a worse service than a non-profit organisation. And for those free-marketers who claim that this just shows that the private sector is more efficient, One To One has only been able to provide the service with the backing of the Department of Health for the insurance, so the tax-payer is taking the risk while the private sector is making the profits.

While major targets may be destroyed, it will be impossible to significantly damage a force such as ISIL from the air. With the threat of air strikes they will remain in cover, resulting in significant civilian casualties, and thus creating another generation of radicalised survivors set on vengeance against ‘the west’.\nNot only is the military effectiveness questionable, but as Green MP Caroline Lucas, who voted against the action, said, “There are no easy answers. But there is this certainty: killing people rarely kills their ideas.” Even if we kill significant numbers of ISIL members, bombs will not stop their ideology.\nI do not for one minute condone ISIL or their abhorrent actions. However, we are about to spend £3bn on killing people, some of whom will be entirely innocent. We should be concentrating on aiding those who are at risk in the region, intensifying diplomatic efforts and adopting a coherent foreign policy based on clear principles, consistently applied.",

Normal service has been resumed.\nThe separation of church and state should be one of the fundamental objectives of anyone who supports democracy, so we should all take note when something happens that works against this goal. I noticed this story today about a couple of Christians campaining against homosexuals who have just received an out of court settlement from the police after getting into trouble for calling 'homosexual practice' morally wrong.\nThe article does not give a few key details, such as where the couple wanted the leaflets displayed. We can assume that it was a council property though, hence them asking Wyre Borough Council permission. It is therefore completely correct that the council refused, since it is not their place to help any church distribute its propaganda. The leaflets that the couples were objecting to were simply informing gay people of their rights, and were therefore exactly the sort of thing that the council should be distributing.\nLet's leave aside for a moment the fact that the views of these people is bigoted, unpleasant, and down to some deeply objectionable beliefs. What we should be concerned with is the fact that they felt that they had to 'counter' a leaflet explaining someones rights with one containing their bigotry, which doesn't help anyone at all. Even worse, they expected facilities run by the council (and therefore at the tax payers expense) to aid them and their religion. This is fundamentally wrong, and the council were correct to refuse. I would argue that the police involvement went too far since free speech is important, and this ended-up being counter-productive. However unfair this may have been though, the state has no business distributing religious propaganda. I would encourage anyone living in Fleetwood to remind the council of this.\nThe separation of church and state should be one of the fundamental objectives of anyone who supports democracy, so we should all take note when something happens that works against this goal.

This measure, ineffective at actually stopping any serious crime, has been widely slammed in regard to loss of our privacy. We would have the most intrusive state in Europe.\nBut Bath MP Ben Howlett must consider other consequences. He claims to support the cluster of technology companies vital to Bath and Bristol, but as someone who has worked in such companies for the last 15 years I can assure him that if his government’s plans to end secure Internet communication happen, a huge number of these companies will leave the UK.\nIt is tempting for governments to be seen to be ‘doing something’. I suggest that Mr Howlett considers just how bad such draconian laws are, not just for the privacy of the people of Bath, but for the economy too.",

As I write this there are no MPs - parliament has been dissolved, and the so-called ‘short campaign’ has started. Across the country, PPCs like me are handing their forms and deposits into their local authority so that they are officially General Election candidates. To people who aren’t politics nerds, they’ll start to notice a barrage of election leaflets and stuff about elections on TV. Most of them will probably already be fed up with it all!\nFor me, this is the final phase of a year-long campaign. Bath has been one of the busiest constituencies in the UK for hustings and other events, and it is all rather exhausting. It is with some relief that I can see election day itself in sight, but there’s a lot to do before that!\nIn Bath and North East Somerset there are local elections on the same day as the General Election, and the Green Party is standing candidates in every ward for the first time. This is great, and a reflection on our massively increased membership that we’ve seen explode over the last year or so. We’ve never had a councillor here, but it’s looking like we’ll get some this time so it’s all systems go.\nThen of course there’s the General Election. As you can see from the graph above, we’re doing pretty well! That graph is from the Telegraph - not known for being sympathetic to the Greens - and is a sign that we’re seeing a massive change. Support for the Lib Dems has collapsed, and that’s a lot of voters coming our way.\nLocally, Lib Dem campaigning has entirely consisted of ‘it’s a two horse race’ and ‘nobody but the Lib Dems or Tories can win here’ fearmongering. It’s the sort of political nonsense that people are fed up with, and it’s obviously also untrue, given that we beat the Lib Dems in the Euro elections last year.\nBut we will see what happens. The posters are going up around the city. People are beginning to think about who they want to vote for in earnest.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2008_04_14_gm-crops_html/content_309.html": "GM crops\nThere have been some worrying noises coming from the government about GM crops recently, and the pro-GM case is being made more loudly every day. One might think that we don't have to worry about this since public opinion is so strongly against GM, but such opinion is easily swayed by only hearing one side of the argument, or worse, invalid argument. This has been demonstrated recently by the shift of opinion towards nuclear power that has taken place in a relatively short timescale, thanks mainly to piggy-backing a genuine concern (CO2 emissions). The government presented a false dichotomy - it's either nuclear power or more fossil fuels - rather than anything valid. Will the same thing happen with GM?\nThe news has recently been full of reports of food riots in developing countries due to the increasing costs of grain. The 'obvious' solution to this, as trotted-out by sections of the press, ministers, and those with vested interests, is the use of GM crops. However, what would these crops actually achieve, and are they in fact our only choice?\nThe main selling-point of GM crops is their resilience to herbicides. Companies such as Monsanto don't try to hide this fact, and yet it's a commonly held belief that using GM crops would allow us to use less chemicals on the fields. This is a myth. Many GM crops make the plants more tolerant of them, allowing the farmers to use far more. This does its job and kills the weeds, but also causes far more pollution. Funnily enough some crops, such as Monsanto's ''Roundup Ready' varieties, are specifically engineered to be resistant to their 'Roundup' herbicides. It's not unusual for GM crop producers to modify plants to further their other products.\nMonsanto is a particularly shady company, of course. They have a history of suing farmers who happen to have had their crops wind-pollinated by GM crops in neighbouring farmers fields. It's actually amazing that Monsanto win in such cases - what are farmers meant to do? Pollen can travel for several miles and can remain active for up to ten years, and if it happens to fall onto non-GM fields it can pollenate plants there, making it very difficult to prevent contamination. If your crop is contaminated with GM pollen like this then you lose the ability to say GM-free, through no fault of your own. However, it gets worse - if you decide to keep some grain to replant next year, and unknown to you it has been contaminated, you can be sued by Monsanto, as this farmer in Canada can testify. Of course, some countries wouldn't want to allow this sort of thing, but it's useful for Monsanto when the US mandates GM crops as part of an aid package. GM crops or starvation? It's not a tough choice, but once GM is there it's there for good.\nThe pro-GM groups usually trot-out the line that GM crops will save poor countries. Let's assume that an African farmer decides to make use of GM - what should he grow? He'd probably want to grow crops suited to the climate, such as yams. However, he's unlikely to find that the GM companies are willing to help him here. The biotech companies are like the drugs companies in that they invest in the areas most likely to make them money, hence lots of research into cancer (which hits the rich, western world) and little into malaria (which doesn't). So we end-up with plenty of GM wheat that will make lots of money from western farmers, but little that will grow in Africa and actually help the poor.\nThe power of GM food producers and the rest of the biotech food industry is immense. For instance, a bill currently being considered in the US prohibits organic milk producers from being able to label their product as free from Bovine Growth Hormone, but it fails to force any milk produced from hormone-treated cows from being labelled as such. This bill is being pushed-through by Monsanto and other GM lobbyists and is almost certain to succeed, and it shows immense contempt for the consumer. Whether consumers want GM food or not, they should be given the choice.\nIn the end, it is wrong that a corporation can 'own' any species, whether they created it or not. Now that the possibility of doing so is legal, where will it end. As scientists develop more complex 'artificial' animals, as will happen with the human-hybrid work recently in the news, what is the point at which a life should no longer be owned? How can a corporation decide what forms of life can breed, and which must die without doing so? Isn't a fundamental purpose of any living thing to reproduce?\nIf you have time, be sure to watch The World According To Monsanto\", which was shown on French TV.

A small and perfectly achievable increase in our vote will get our lead candidate Molly Scott Cato elected, and we’ll get another Green voice in Europe.\nWhy is this important, and why should you care? Here are the key points:\n- Green MEPs have the best activity level of all UK parties - they work hardest for you\n- The Green Party is opposed to the TTIP, unlike all of the other main parties and UKIP. These trade talks undermine our democratic rights and market regulation.\n- Greens work in Europe for you, not corporations. They are your best option for protecting your rights and safety at work\n- Greens support a Financial Transactions Tax (the ‘Robin Hood Tax’) and restrictions on excessive pay\n- Greens work tirelessly to protect your environment\n- Green MEPs in Europe form a larger group than the groups Conservatives or UKIP belong to, and so your voice will be more powerful if represented by us.\nYou can read the manifesto here\nYou may be disillusioned with politics. I understand - there is little between the large parties. But this election uses PR, so you can vote for who you really want and know it will ‘count’. If you vote for the Green Party you know our MEPs will work hard within the European Parliament for you and for a better Europe.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2014_07_10_strikes_html/content_122.html": "Along with some Green Party colleagues I took part in the march through Bristol by the unions that were striking today. The weather was perfect and the turnout excellent, and we had a thoroughly enjoyable time with almost total support from passers by. This was just one of many such marches throughout the country, with hundreds of thousands taking part.\nAlso today, David Cameron announced Tory plans to require 50% of union members to vote for a strike in order for it to be legal. At the same time he refused to allow workplace balloting or any other means to make voting easier. Obviously this move is nothing to do with democracy and simply a means to try to make legal industrial action more difficult. If Cameron has a problem with low turnouts then he should probably ask his own government to resign, and certainly the Police Commissioners that hardly anyone voted for.\nThe government didn’t stop there - Cameron’s official spokesman said that public sector strikes were ‘always wrong’. The sheer audacity of such a claim is unbelievable. This government has presided over a real-terms 20% pay cut for some of the most important jobs in the country - teachers, nurses, carers… real jobs, helping the youngest and most vulnerable in society. Not only have teachers had to deal with Gove, the most inept education secretary in living memory, but NHS staff have seen their organisation sold-off, slandered and maligned and mismanaged by a government intent on destroying it. Still they work harder than most of us, only to be hear that if they were to strike it would always be wrong.\nLet me be clear. Public sector workers were absolutely right to strike today. They have been demonised and sniped at by a government that hates them and any public service ethos. They are told that even a pay rise that matches inflation is ‘unaffordable’ by a government that finds money to give tax cuts to the rich and spends time lobbying Brussels to exempt our bankers from rules stopping obscenely high pay.\nThe money is there - the wealthiest have seen their wealth vastly increase, yet the working poor are going to food banks. Some public sector workers are now earning the minimum wage because their pay can’t go any lower. Teaching is now one of the worst paid graduate professions, yet millions are found to set-up unnecessary ‘free’ schools and academies - vanity projects for people like Toby Young. This government has no interest in improving education - its sole objective is to remove the responsibility for it from the State, just as it wants to for health.\nAnd where were Labour today, while the unions that fund it were calling for action? Labour refused to back the strikes. Only the Green Party backed them and marched with the strikers. Labour know that they can’t back fair public sector pay because they are committed to Tory austerity plans, and that means no increase in pay for the foreseeable future.\nWe reject austerity. We demand a living wage - a fair wage - and treating people who do the most important jobs in society well.",

This is fine, after all, his novel Midnight's Children won the 'Booker of Bookers' as the best book in 25 years - quite an achievement really. It's a prize that is definitely deserved.\nHowever, it was bound to upset some religious fundamentalists, who are still a bit upset that Rushdie wrote a book that they believe mocked their religion, or Mohammed, or something (most of them haven't read it so it doesn't matter anyway). This was to be expected, and ignored. However, when Labour peer Lord Ahmed waded-in and started saying he was \"appalled to hear Salman Rushdie had been given a knighthood ... honouring the man who has blood on his hands, sort of, because of what he did, I think is going a bit too far\". So then, Lord Ahmed, what did Rushdie do, exactly? In what way has he got blood on his hands? Is he the one suggesting that someone should become a suicide bomber and kill Rushdie, much like the oh-so-innocent Pakistan parliament? No, he was simply writing a piece of fiction, something that we have a right to do in this country. Why are you siding with religious nutjobs rather than someone you're actually meant to represent?\nLord Ahmed has no right to be representing Britain and should be sacked immediately. No, we don't cave-in to the lunatic demands of religions in this country. In fact we pander far too much to them as it is, and I'm not just talking about Muslims.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2015_12_28_new-year-message_html/content_21.html": "2015 has been quite the year. These are dark times in many ways, and we are seeing the rights and protections that have been hard-won over generations being torn away by the forces of arrogance, ignorance and greed. Who would have thought, at the turn of the millenium, that Britain would see a million people depending on food banks to survive, and the architects of that destitution voted in again with a majority?\nThe government will continue its reckless destruction of our social safety net in 2016, and it also plans a fire-sale of a huge number of our assets, more than any government in history. Selling-off profit-making assets at a loss is, of course, yet more of the economic ineptitude that this government is renowned for, and yet a friendly media somehow spins the opposition as less credible. By the time the Tories are finished we will be forced to pay profit-making monopolies to do anything - buy a house, mint coins, take out student loans - and you can bet that a significant number of these companies won’t be paying taxes in the UK either.\nAlso, as I write this, huge swathes of the country are under water as we face yet more extreme weather, entirely as predicted for decades as the consequence of our emissions on the environment. This year has been the warmest on record by quite some way, and 13 of the 14 hottest years on record have taken place this century. Yet the voice of the science deniers still grows louder in the press, causing far too many people to doubt the need for action even as their homes are flooded. It is beyond belief that in 2015, with the effect of climate change ruining thousands of lives in the UK, our government is actually making things worse with its failure to tackle flood prevention and stop destructive farming practices, halting of renewable energy and pushing for even greater fossil fuel use, including fracking under our national parks and other important areas.\nMeanwhile, the main opposition party is in disarray, busier destroying itself than standing-up for our interests. Who knows what will happen to Labour, but fundamentally it’s a party of neoliberal free-marketers who have found themselves with a leader who is close to actually being socialist. Corbyn is a decent man, but he is in the wrong party, and sympathetic members who think that his selection as leader will change it are at best optimistic.\nIt would be so easy to get depressed about all of this and give up. That is what the Tories, Murdoch and the usual suspects are counting on. In 2016 they will hope that the EU referendum will keep us occupied while they dismantle the rest of the state. The reality is that the referendum is an irrelevance compared to what our own government is actually doing, but like Labour’s leadership battles it is a gift to them as they continue their work and quietly rig democracy so that they can never lose again.\nBut we can choose not to play their game. Let’s make 2016 the year we fight them. And win. Because hear this - we can win. We can refuse to let them continue to transfer the wealth of the country to the rich and powerful. We can refuse to let them run our NHS into the ground. We can refuse to let them take away our rights at work, in public places, in the law.\nWe can stand up to them, because together we have the only thing they really fear, the only thing they can’t control - numbers. We are the many and they are the few, and ultimately this counts for more than you can imagine. Because what the 1% have in power depends on the 99% listening to them and believing them. We will never have the resources they have: the money, the media barons, the power. But those resources mean nothing if people choose not to believe them, not to listen to them, and not to bow down to injustice.\nThat is the resolution I ask you to join me in making. Help us to make 2016 the year that we open the eyes of the people to what is happening. Help others to see what is being taken away from us all and the lies we are being told to keep us compliant. Help us to take this country back from the money men to whom people are purely a vehicle for personal gain.\nThere is hope. Where this message gets a fair hearing we can win. In Bath this General Election we got the largest increase in vote share despite having a tiny fraction of the resources of the other parties. In every hustings where a poll was taken we came first. When people hear the message of hope and fairness they respond. We will never have as much money as those that place it above all else, so the way we kick them out is on the streets, through word of mouth, through people power.\nSo please, make it your resolution to help spread the word, in whatever way you can. It’s no exaggeration to say that the country, and the world, depends on it. Join our party - you’re all welcome, and we’re the only party where everyone has an equal say - ordinary people like us who don’t act for power, but to help our families, our neighbours, strangers, and the world. Not through selfishness, but for the Common Good.\nI wish you, your friends and family all the best for the New Year.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2022_10_11_despising-tories_html/content_216.html": "Nicola Sturgeon is in trouble for saying she despises what Tories stand for. But that viewpoint is entirely valid.\n- [Listen on Apple Podcasts]\n- [Watch/listen on Spotify]\n- [Watch on TikTok]\n- [Watch in Instagram]\n- [Watch on YouTube]\nGenerated transcript:\nNow you’ve probably seen recently that Nicola Sturgeon has caused a bit of a fuss in some circles by saying that she detests the Tories. She later clarified that she detests the party and everything they stand for rather than individual Tories, which is clearly what she meant in the first place.\nThis has upset quite a few people. The ask how one could you say such a thing? It’s unprofessional. You should never let people’s politics get in the way of how you feel about them. The language is uncalled for and all that sort of stuff. But it’s not exactly a controversial viewpoint when I say good on her, because actually if somebody holds those views and makes it their business to enforce those views on the people, it’s justified. For example the Conservatives today have blocked some of the very few good things that Michael Gove pushed for when he was in a position of power in their party. So they’re getting rid of the ban on no fault evictions and lots of protections that were going to be bought in for renters.\nNow, it’s pretty rare that the Tories do something for people who don’t have as much and have fewer advantages in life. So for the Tories to then shelve those few things (which were manifesto commitments, let’s remember) is appalling. So there’s a PM with no mandate doing things with no mandate and getting rid of the things they actually were voted in to do by some people, eg actually had a mandate for.\nI mean, that’s pretty detestable, isn’t it? It makes a mockery of democracy for one thing. But there’s no reason to stop a ban on no fault evictions other than potentially pressure from landlords and people with money.\nIt’s taking something that some of the cherished ‘red wall’ voters that they have who got them into power. That’s the sort of policy that would appeal to them. And so some of them voted Conservative and now we see that all of the things that could have conceivably helped people with less money have all been stripped out.\nAnd now it’s all become about helping people with money. Even long term voters are beginning to realize that this is a party that’s been taken over by the hard right. There’s no ‘One Nation Conservatives’ left in a position of responsibility in the party.\nThe Tory party of old that could have commanded respect (in some ways) from me and people like me is gone. It’s all about enriching the already rich, and it is despicable. It’s a body where if people actively support it at this point they’re worthy of contempt and they’re worthy of criticism because they are basically trying to make other people’s lives worse, and it’s all just for them. If it doesn’t make a profit then these people don’t count, and that’s not a viewpoint that is worthy of respect.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2014_10_13_nhs-strike_html/content_149.html": "This morning I was at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, supporting the striking midwives and other staff. Despite the weather it was a great turnout, with a good atmosphere with plenty of support from passing motorists.\nThis was the first strike of NHS staff for thirty years, and the first ever strike of midwives called by the RCM in its 133 year history. Along with members of Unison, Unite, GMB, UCATT, around 400,000 health care workers are taking action.\nMuch as the Right like to portray public sector workers as ‘downing tools’ every five minutes, the fact that it has been 30 years since an NHS strike shows that to be an incorrect stereotype. It is clear, therefore, that NHS staff must have a very serious issue.\nAnd indeed they do - most have suffered a real-terms pay cut over the duration of this parliament. There was a glimmer of hope for them when the NHS independent pay review panel recommended a 1% rise. That’s 1% - hardly an enormous amount after years of a pay freeze, but it was something. The government then declared that this pay rise was ‘unaffordable’ and stated that it would not be awarded on top of increments.\nThis is, of course, nonsense - the money required is a tiny percentage of the NHS budget, but more importantly, if tax cuts for higher rate tax payers are affordable, the first thing we should be doing is making sure that those we depend on to save lives aren’t paid less now in real terms than they were five years ago. And make no mistake, a lot of NHS workers are not paid well - a nurse starts on £21,300, which is below the average graduate salary. They are then expected to work long hours for nothing. Notice the panic at the union’s announcement that their staff are going to ‘work to rule’, or in other words, do what they are paid to do. This should be what everyone does anyway, rather than the government relying on the good will of NHS staff to cover shortfalls in staffing on their own time.\nSo there’s the pay, but of course that’s on top of the Coalition Government’s massively disruptive NHS reorganisation and privatisation. Billions have been spent on breaking the NHS up into little pieces that are easier to sell, and indeed, many services have been sold off - 70% of NHS contracts have gone to the private sector. The destruction of the old NHS structure that was required to enable this has led to staff not knowing whether they will have a job in a year’s time, or if they do, what they’ll be doing and where they’ll be doing it. It is a costly farce that is costing lives of patients, and even the Tories have admitted that its the single worst thing they’ve done. If you’re told about a lack of funds in the NHS preventing staff getting a pay rise, remember that we spend £30bn just to allow private companies to take NHS money.\nI am proud to stand with NHS staff and their demand for the very small recommended increase. It’s not much. They save lives. Did the MPs reject their 9% increase? No.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2013_07_10_royal-mail-privatisation_html/content_60.html": "The coalition government today announced its plans to sell-off another public service - Royal Mail. The deal has been sweetened by offering 10% of the shares to Royal Mail staff, while the rest will sold on the stock market (rather than sold to another operator).\nThe sell-off of Royal Mail is economically illiterate, of course. In the twelve months up to March it made £403m - that’s money going into the public purse and reducing taxes for all. Indeed, this profit growth looks set to continue thanks to the growth of Internet shopping, with the volume of parcels seeing a 5% annual rise. While selling the company may raise £2bn, that’s only around five year’s worth of profit. This is plainly bad value for the taxpayer, but handy for George Osborne to fix short-term holes in his budget.\nRoyal Mail is, of course, obliged to provide universal service for post. That is to say, you can post a letter from anywhere to anywhere for the same price. This is a basic requirement of a service, whether phone, post or electricity supply. However, clauses in the Postal Services Bill show that the regulator will have a new duty to decide whether the universal guarantee places an “unfair” burden on Royal Mail, so a privatised Royal Mail will not have to bother delivering post to rural areas if it decides it is too expensive to do so. Do the government really think that these deliveries will continue once profit is the motive, rather than public service?\nSo why are the government privatising yet another publicly owned organisation given how appallingly bad value previous privatisations have been? Vince Cable has said “It’s now time for employees to hold a stake in the company and share in its success.”, but he seems to have forgotten that they already do since we all own it already. The employees may well get to own a bit more, but every other person in the UK will own a lot less. There are also claims that privatisation will allow ‘much needed investment’, but requiring the private sector to do this is one of the biggest myths peddled by neoliberal voices in the main three parties. The government could invest if it wanted to, and public sector borrowing is the cheapest borrowing and has never been cheaper. You don’t magically find investment in a service by selling it - look how well that has worked with the railways, where subsidies are higher than they ever were under British Rail with little investment to show for it.\nNo, this move is nothing to do with improving Royal Mail. It’s not improving its efficiency, value for money, or quality. It’s about everything else this government does - selling-off every publicly owned asset we have in a mad rush before the next election in the vain hope that it will be undo-able by future government. The neoliberal dream of ‘small government for the rich’ is moving ever closer, and we must be aware of the lies being peddled to make it that way. The public do not want this. The staff do not want it. Who does? Tory and Lib Dem friends in the City who are hungry for another asset-stripping operation on something we all own that will be sold for far less than it’s worth and we’ll all miss when it’s gone.\nAnd we will miss it. In ten year’s time the post will be like the trains. Do you want to post a letter to granny in Devon? Well, you’ll have to find out which of several ‘postal operators’ deliver to her village. If any do, you’ll have to get a price for sending a letter of that size/shape/however else they all (differently) calculate the cost. Then, of course, you’ll have to find a post-box for the correct company. If there is one near you, that is. And even if you’re prepared for all of that to get cheaper stamps, prepare to be disappointed - postal services really only work with scale. With several smaller services they will all cost more.\nIf you think this is simply scare-mongering, the real world has plenty of examples. You can read about what happened to the Dutch postal system after privatisation. Even the Daily Mail, stalwart of all that is repellant, said “Privatisation in Holland…also led to the closure of around 90 per cent of the country’s post offices…Dutch post boxes are emptied only once a day…complaints about the reliability of Holland’s privatised post are widespread. The move was supposed to increase competition and lead to better services. But the opposite occurred. New firms paying workers below the minimum wage hit deep into the profits of TNT. In response, TNT replaced 11,000 workers who work more than 25 hours a week with cheaper part-time workers and franchisees. TNT says it wants to cut deliveries to just three days a week. ‘If politicians want six days a week, then they will have to finance it,’ declared Peter Kuinz, TNT’s managing director.”\nThat’s the reality of what the government is doing, and it really isn’t to help you or save you money, it’s about changing our postal system to deliver the maximum amount of unwanted mail at the minimum cost to businesses. And remember that Labour want to privatise Royal Mail too, however much you might see them in the news objecting to this.\nWe will lose our public services if we don’t fight for them. Whatever Cable says, this is not yet a done deal. Support the strikers and make your views known. It’s the only way to hang on to a sensible system that we all depend upon, especially the elderly and vulnerable.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2018_10_22_bath-studio-school_html/content_55.html": "It was with disappointment that I heard the sadly expected news that the Bath Studio School faces closure. As people may know, this is yet another closure of a secondary school in Odd Down, forcing many local children to travel miles across the city just to get to school even though there are perfectly good school buildings where they live.\nI have been impressed by the level of interest the school has shown both to the development of its children and to the wider Odd Down community. It has been a pleasure to have been interviewed by the children a number of times and to have faced some really good questions in the many hustings they have run. Few schools have shown such consistent interest in engaging their children with the world.\nUnfortunately there is little or nothing the council can do about the closure. It’s interesting to see our MP and so many local councillors, especially from the Lib Dems, make a fuss. The three largest parties have spent years removing responsibility for our schools from councils and handing it to ‘academy chains’ and ‘free schools’, with no democratic control and bosses who syphon-off funds to award themselves huge pay packets. This is the result - the people have no voice when schools close. Complaints from the three big parties when these closures happen are either dishonest public displays or show that they are ignorant of the effect of their own policies.\nThe law makes it difficult and no other party wants to do it, but it is still actually possible to start LEA (council run) schools. I will work with my Green Party colleagues to do this on the BCA site and, if the studio school site ceases to be used as a school, reopen it as an LEA school. I’m interested in hearing from residents who would like to support this campaign.\nIn the meantime I will do what I can to keep it open. Yesterday I wrote to Damien Hinds, the Secretary of State for Education, to ask him to intervene and stop the school closing. If fellow Odd Down residents or other concerned people in Bath would like to add anything to my further letters to him on this then please let me know.\nDominic Tristram Green Party PPC for Bath and Odd Down campaigner",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2015_09_22_corbyn_html/content_278.html": "With some reluctance I’ve decided to write something about Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader of the Labour Party thanks to so many people asking me about it. I am reluctant because in many ways it’s a matter for Labour members, and to others it really makes no difference until (if?) Labour policy actually changes. At that point I’ll be only too happy to comment. However, as I say, people have asked, so here goes.\nFirstly let me say that Corbyn was the only one of the leadership candidates that seemed to offer Labour any hope of changing to be close to ‘old’ Labour. Burnham was ok I suppose, but we’ve seen his voting record for authoritarian nonsense like ID cards, and he was a fan of ruinous PFI in the NHS. At least he was better than Kendall.\nSo anyway, I was pleased when Corbyn won. Of course I was - a lot of the policies he supports are Green Party policy. He’s much more closely aligned to us than to his own party on most policies. With the indisputable combination of lack of media coverage and, when we do receive coverage, bias against our party, to have the main opposition party advocating our position can only be a good thing. Shifting the argument over to our position means that it is discussed more widely even where previously the media did not discuss us.\nIt is also good to see the majority that Corbyn won by, and there are many Labour supporters who are very pleased that they now have a leader that shares their values. Some of those have approached me (and I am guessing other Greens) and talked about ‘working together’ and so on.\nThis is where I have a slight problem though. What did these people do in May? I’d be surprised if any of them didn’t vote Labour, but consider that for a minute. They voted for a pro-austerity Thatcherite party, even they supposedly believe in everything Corbyn has been saying. Why would they do that? Why wouldn’t they vote for the Greens, a party that actually agreed with far more of their supposed values than the Labour Party? In Tory/Labour marginals they could conceivably vote Labour as the logical best choice, but there aren’t many Tory/Labour marginals.\nHere in Bath it certainly wasn’t a Tory/Labour marginal, yet we were fighting a supposedly left-wing local Labour Party who were only too happy to be part of a party machine telling voters that our plans to renationalise rail, abolish tuition fees, and many other things that Corbyn supports were ‘unrealistic’ or unaffordable. In my (many!) hustings I was putting forward arguments that the local Labour Party supposedly believed in far more than the view that their candidate argued for, but they were happy to both back him and select him in the first place (their PPC, by the way, backed Liz Kendall for leader, so is very much to the right of the party).\nWhat are we in the Green Party to make of this? We’re going to hear a lot from Labour in the coming months about working together as a ‘progressive’, non-tribal force to fight the Tories. I have a lot of time for that argument, but only when I trust that those putting it forward actually believe it. Why would I listen to those who fought to get a candidate elected who was so distant from the views they supposedly have? What’s that if not tribal?\nLabour nationally spent huge sums in Brighton trying to beat Caroline Lucas and our only council, and almost equally huge sums in Bristol West to stop us getting second MP - this rather than spending that money on fighting the Tories. Almost everyone involved is still in the Labour Party.\nI’m not saying we can’t work with Corbyn, but the ball is in Labour’s court. He’s already had to compromise on some of his policies, and he missed a real opportunity to ‘show willing’ by giving Caroline Lucas a position in his shadow cabinet. My feeling is that there is a lot of good will being sent his way by people of a progressive persuasion, but Labour will have to do something meaningful, such as offer PR without a referendum or stand down in three or four constituencies for us, before I’ll really believe that ‘working together’ doesn’t mean ‘help Labour win’.\nIn the end we are a party where policy is decided by members. Labour is a party were policy can be dramatically changed by one man. And one man can change it back. I’ll take democracy over that.",

You’ll have heard the overall result, and above you can see the details for Bath. Thank you to all who voted for me!\nI didn’t win, which is a shame. I also missed third by just a few hundred votes, which is also a shame, but I’m pretty sure that’s entirely down to tactical voting - I had a lot of people saying they supported me but were too scared not to vote Lib Dem.\nThe good news is that the Green vote had the highest increase of all the parties. In a way I take that as a ‘win’ - not as good as an actual win, but on a personal level I feel I did pretty well. Of course it wasn’t just me though - I had the backing of a large team of dedicated local members who spent many hours leafleting, door knocking, organising events… you name it. I would like to thank them all.\nWe now have a government that I doubt any of you are happy with. I am certainly not. You will hear that this is because people loved the Tory message, but of course that’s not true - their vote nationally increased by less than one percent (less than Labour’s did). There is no appetite for Tory policies.\nIn Bath the Tory vote share rose by more - 6.4% - but the Green vote share increase was much higher, and the combined ‘left wing’ share rise was 16%, more than that of the right wing parties. From this we can see that what actually happened in Bath was that the people punished the Lib Dems for colluding with a Tory government and most of those people voted for offerings to the left of what the Lib Dems were offering.\nWhile we have to live for up to five years of a Tory government, we can take some comfort from the fact that things here are on a progressive trajectory. People are also a bit restless that we have a Tory majority government on about 25% of the national vote. They are ruling for 1 in 4 of us, and with such a slim majority they won’t be popular. Perhaps they won’t last the full term? Let’s hope that’s the case.\nI also want to address the ‘tactical vote’ thing I warned about before polling day. We know for a fact that it happened. It didn’t help. The Lib Dems lost by thousands, and even if they had held Bath we’d still have a Tory government. Think how inspiring it would have been to have a few thousand more Green votes! We’ve got the momentum for great things here in Bath in the next election - the surge is there even more than the result implies.\nOur NE Somerset candidate Katy Boyce saw a vote share increase of 4.2% giving her 5.5% overall. This is a great result in such a Tory stronghold, so congratulations to her!\nIn the local election we saw our first two councillors elected in Bath - Lin Patterson in Lambridge and Jonathan Carr in Abbey. We were also very close to getting Jon Lucas in Westmoreland (by 12 votes!), and Vipul Patel and Michael Tichelar in Walcot. Two councillors (and very close to getting five) is a great result.\nGetting a group on the council and 12% at the general election is not only a success in itself but a great foundation for future success. The next local election is four years away and we’ve got a great start on getting more councillors elected, and a great momentum in the Green vote.\nIt’s debatable whether Labour were really a left-wing party as it is, but it looks like they may well lurch to the right, in their panic. That would be a mistake for them and the people of the UK. However, it would be an opportunity for us. We have a few years now to make our anti-austerity message of social justice clear. The pundits are wrong - the people want it. We will provide it.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2024_12_11_health-ceo_html/content_124.html": "US healthcare results in inequality and bankruptcy, but when limited to everyday people it doesn’t often make the news. The death of a wealthy CEO might finally get the attention of those in power.\nOn the 4th of December news emerged of the assassination of healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in the United States. While details are still unfolding (the current leading suspect Luigi Mangione claims to be innocent), the incident raises broader issues about the role of profit-driven healthcare systems and the dangers they pose.\nDisparities in Attention\nThe first striking observation is the disproportionate media attention given to this case. Murders occur daily in America, often involving firearms, yet the killing of a wealthy individual garners significantly more coverage than the countless lives lost among ordinary citizens. This disparity reflects a broader societal tendency to prioritise the wealthy and influential, but it also serves as a stark reminder of the systemic inequalities at play.\nI want to make it clear that I celebrate no deaths, including this one. I hate the way the US healthcare system is, and I think it’s immoral for people to become as rich as this man was on the back of it, but I will not condone those celebrating this as some sort of ‘payback’.\nWhat is true is that the murder of someone very wealthy has reminded everyone of the obvious truth behind the industry that made him wealthy, and indeed the whole concept of private healthcare: the incentive to profit by spending as little money as possible on treatment while charging as much as you can get away with.\nThe Suspect and His Motives\nWhat makes this case unusual is the profile of the suspect. By all accounts, he is wealthy, well-educated, and had no prior criminal record or history of violence. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university, earning both a degree and a master’s in computer science—hardly the typical background of someone who would commit such an act.\nFriends of Mangione suggest he suffered a debilitating back injury from a surfing accident and endured chronic pain despite undergoing multiple treatments. Despite his wealth and insurance coverage, he allegedly faced repeated denials of certain treatments by his insurer, who deemed them unnecessary. These frustrations may have led him to target the CEO of the insurance company, an individual who had profited significantly from a system that, to the suspect, denied him care.\nIt’s critical to state unequivocally that I believe that violence is never a solution to a non-violent problem. However, understanding the conditions that drive someone to such desperation is essential. The suspect appears to have meticulously planned the attack, isolating himself for months before targeting the CEO—a calculated act rooted in personal grievance rather than random violence.\nThe Inevitable Outcome of Profit-Driven Healthcare\nThis case highlights the perils of introducing profit motives into healthcare. In systems where financial gain becomes a priority, insurers and providers often save money by denying treatments, regardless of the impact on patients. For every pound saved, an additional pound is pocketed by executives and shareholders. This dynamic breeds resentment, particularly when patients feel abandoned by a system that prioritises profit over care.\nAnd yet, we are told by this Labour government, and many UK governments before it, that involving private healthcare in the NHS is somehow necessary because the NHS is ‘broken’ or ‘not fit for purpose’. This is a lie and must be called out.\nThe UK’s NHS, while far from perfect, historically stood as a model of efficiency and equity. Until 2011, it was widely recognised as one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the world, delivering strong outcomes for relatively low expenditure.\nHowever, the introduction of private sector involvement under successive Conservative and Liberal Democrat governments has fundamentally altered its landscape. Waiting lists have soared, A&E targets are missed, and patients struggle to see GPs—all symptoms of a system weakened by reforms that prioritise cost-cutting over care.\nThe Danger of Following America’s Lead\nDisturbingly, Labour’s current health proposals seem poised to deepen this trend. Figures such as Health secretary Wes Streeting advocate for increased private sector involvement in the NHS, bringing in consultants and advisors to implement “efficiency” measures. But let’s be clear: the private sector’s primary goal is not to improve healthcare—it is to make money. Every pound saved by denying care or cutting corners flows into the pockets of CEOs and shareholders.\nThis profit-driven model inevitably creates winners and losers. The winners are the corporations and the ultra-wealthy, who profit from extracting money from healthcare systems. The losers are patients denied timely, effective care. The U.S. offers a grim warning: a system where wealth dictates access to healthcare creates desperation, and desperation breeds violence.\nA Crossroads for the NHS\nThe UK now faces a choice. Do we continue down the road of increasing private sector involvement, accepting that this will likely exacerbate inequality and reduce access to care? Or do we return to a model that prioritises public investment in the NHS, ensuring healthcare remains a right, not a privilege?\nDesperate people will resort to desperate measures. While the violence seen in the U.S. is extreme, it serves as a cautionary tale. By allowing profit motives to dictate healthcare policy, we risk creating a society where people are pushed to their limits—financially, emotionally, and physically. The solution is not more private sector involvement but less.\nWe must resist efforts to privatise further and instead invest in a truly public NHS. This is not just about preserving healthcare; it’s about preventing a future where desperation turns into tragedy.\nThere happens to be a petition by We Own It running right now asking Wes Streeting not to make new PFI deals. This is just a part of his agenda to siphon more NHS money, our money, off to the private health sector. I urge you to sign it and share it.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2016_08_18_banes-community-health_html/content_225.html": "Community health services were split-off from the NHS a few years back as part of the Tory/Lib Dem NHS reforms. In Bath and NE Somerset they are currently run by Sirona, a not-for-profit Community Interest Company.\nThis was, of course, only a temporary arrangement. As all of us who have been trying to warn of the privatisation agenda have said for years, handing NHS services to non-profits was only a stop-gap move to soften people up for the desired handover to profit making companies. And so it has come to pass here in Bath, where Sirona’s services look like they will be handed to Virgin Care in a few months time after today’s announcement.\nWhy does this matter? The mantra of pro-privatisers is along the lines of ‘as long as it’s free at the point of delivery, who cares?’. There are perfectly valid philosophical reasons why proft is best kept out of healthcare, but we don’t even need to consider those to know this is a bad idea. To compete with a non-profit provider on price a profit-making provider must cut either staff or services.\nIt’s a fantasy to believe that there are huge inefficiencies that will magically be found by private providers. Indeed, before the Tory and Lib Dem ‘reforms’ the NHS was by most measures the most efficient healthcare system in the world. Despite this, some on the political right insist that the profit motive will improve efficiency, whatever the evidence, and the result is services like this being put out to tender.\nThe CCG has said “There will be a clause in the contract which requires any financial surplus to be reinvested into services in BaNES. Virgin Care has committed to meet this requirement.” Sounds good, right? Well, it’s worthless. Virgin Care has never declared a profit, and the reason is simple. Like many multinationals, Virgin Care is owned by a complex chain of companies and trusts that ultimately reside in the British Virgin Islands, outside the reach of the UK tax man. The upshot of this is that NHS money will almost certainly be extracted and paid to shareholders, tax free. Thinking about it for one minute is all you need to do - why would Virgin, a profit-making company tasked with making money for its shareholders, bid for work they wouldn’t make money from? It wouldn’t.\nAll is not lost quite yet. Preferred bidder status is not the same as winning the work. The partnership of non-profit providers also bidding (LiNK) could object or question the scoring. Let’s hope they do.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2012_10_26_gary-mckinnon_html/content_267.html": "I don’t often find myself agreeing with both the Daily Mail and Theresa May, but credit where it’s due, the government was right to throw-out the extradition of Gary McKinnon to the USA.\nHowever, it is worth specifying why I agree. It is not, as Theresa May states, right to block it only because McKinnon has Asperger’s syndrome and is clinically depressed (although this in no way counts against him). Rather, this extradition should never have been considered in the first place, whatever his mental state.\nGary McKinnon has never been to the USA. He has never committed a crime in the USA. Technically he has committed a crime in the UK - unauthorised access to a computer network. Between 2001 and 2002, from his bedroom in his parents house, he accessed 97 computers in the US without authorisation. The maximum penalty for this in the UK is two years in prison. The CPS decided that in McKinnon’s case it was not in the public interest to prosecute.\nMcKinnon managed to break into the US computers because the US military hadn’t even implemented basic security precautions - the passwords on all of the systems involved had either been left blank or at their default settings. McKinnon left messages on the systems pointing-out the weak security, but, crucially, did not steal confidential information or sabotage the US systems in any way. The only real ‘damage’ to the US military was egg on their faces once it was revealed how appalling their security was.\nThis is a crucial point. The US military are claiming that McKinnon’s actions have resulted in $800,000 of damage, yet what this amount actually covers is the work securing the systems as they should have been secured in the first place if competent people had been running them. If anything, they were lucky it was harmless McKinnon who revealed their incompetence, rather than someone who had more malicious intentions. In the eyes of the US though, the offence is the same - they want to try McKinnon as a terrorist, and potentially lock him up for the rest of his life. And remember, this is for doing something that would result in a maximum of two years in prison under the jurisdiction of the UK, where he lives.\nSo Theresa May was right to refuse extradition, but not because he has Aspergers - she should refuse it because it is blatantly unjust. The extradition treaty with the US is completely one-sided, with the US not even having to provide any evidence to the UK courts. Just think about what that means for a moment. On the say-so of a foreign government, any one of us can in theory be shipped-off to a life in prison in another country for a ‘crime’ we didn’t even commit on their soil.\nCan you imagine the reaction of the US if we asked for one of their citizens on the same basis? Not that the treaty allows that, of course, but assuming it did, do you think they would say yes? The US is of course a country that refuses to recognise the International Criminal Court, putting it in the same boat as such paragons of virtue as Israel and Sudan. The map of countries who aren’t members of the ICC shows the sort of company that the US is in.\nThis isn’t just theoretical. US citizens accused of far worse than McKinnon are rapidly brought back to the US before they can face justice, and those are where they have actually committed the crime in the foreign country. A quick review of the 1998 Cavalese cable car disaster and various events in Iraq and Afghanistan might remind you of this.\nThe debate in the Commons after Theresa May’s announcement is also pretty shaming for Labour. It is their nasty authoritarian streak that resulted in the extradition arrangement in the first place (the Extradition Act of 2003), and they didn’t redeem themselves last week. Alan Johnson said “Gary McKinnon is accused of very serious offences. The US was perfectly within its rights, and it was extremely reasonable of them, to seek his extradition. We now do not know whether Gary McKinnon will ever have to face justice on those accusations … The home secretary has made a decision today that’s in her own party’s best interest; it is not in the best interests of the country.” Really? Who is being political here, opposing government actions purely for opposition’s sake?\nOn the contrary, this is perhaps May’s best action since becoming Home Secretary, and she’s done it using the Human Rights Act - something the Tories despise. Let’s hope that she can now look into the case of Richard O’Dwyer, who faces extradition to the US on copyright infringement charges. He ran the TVShack Web site which, despite the site containing no copyrighted material, is judged by US authorities to infringe since it contained links to places where people can watch TV online. Authorities in the US wish to imprison him for 10 years for something which isn’t even a crime in the UK. It’s time for this madness to end.",

It was all very noble, and one of the very limited number of Tory policies that I found myself agreeing with. After all, as the Tories themselves pointed out, the Labour government had all gone a bit ‘big brother’. Tory Dominic Grieve said “This Government’s approach to our personal privacy is the worst of all worlds – intrusive, ineffective and enormously expensive.” It seemed that should the Tories gain power, they would do something about it. A small consolation.\nNeedless to say, given how pretty much everything else promised by the coalition parties before the election turned out, I don’t think anyone was entirely surprised this Sunday when the government announced plans to monitor emails, Web sites visited, phone calls, and pretty much everything else you might choose to do on the Internet or your phone.\nI cannot emphasise strongly enough just how illiberal this is, and just how much it should anger you. The proposed changes would allow the government “to identify who an individual or group is in contact with, how often and for how long. They would also be able to see which websites someone had visited.” Sure, they might not be able to actually read your emails or texts without a warrant, but how important is that, really? I’m sure there are many people who might not want their browsing history to be public – the text of the pages themselves is rather secondary. And these things are available without a warrant, i.e. the government – any bit of it – will be able to just have a look at what you’re up to without having to actually suspect you of anything at all or justify why they’re doing it.\nNow, I’m sure we’ll be told there will be ‘safeguards’ and ‘controls’, but isn’t that what the requirement for warrants are? If the government really thinks you might be a terrorist I don’t think they’re going to have a problem obtaining a warrant. No, these laws aren’t necessary to fight terrorism. We already have some of the most draconian ‘anti-terror’ laws in Europe – the UK is the only European nation to have suspended article five of the European Convention on Human Rights which prevents arbitrary detention without trial, after all. And let’s face it, if the government can get away with locking random people up at-will without any evidence of wrong-doing, they’re not going to worry too much about keeping tabs on who we’re all talking to, especially when they won’t have to pay to do it (we all will, as ISPs and phone companies will have to collect the data for them).\nThe more technologically aware might think ’that’s fine, I’ll just encrypt everything’. Well good luck with that. If you fail to hand-over decryption keys to the government when asked you’ll end-up with up to five years in prison, thanks to Part 3, Section 49 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Remember, you don’t have to be under suspicion of anything at all. While RIPA isn’t new, the ability of the state to snoop on your Internet traffic at will, without reason, is. When they do that and notice encrypted traffic, what then? Well, ‘no smoke without fire’ might think PC Plod, and ask for your encryption keys. Bad luck if you’ve forgotten them – RIPA means it’s your job not to, or it’s five years in prison for you!\nBut let’s not get ahead of ourselves here. Why should we even worry about encryption keys, which Web sites we visit, who we’ve phoned, or any of this? It is no business of the state. I feel as strongly about this as I do about people who think it’s weird not to tell police my name or what I’m doing (note: don’t be rude, just politely refuse to tell them). If I am not committing a crime then it is no business of the police who I am or what I’m doing. They are here to serve us and we are not living in a police state – yet. It is a very sad thing that there are some who think it’s reasonable that the police (or government in general) should have a right to know every aspect of our lives. These people do not deserve the liberty that they are so willing to make the rest of us give up.",

In 2015 he gained the largest increase in vote share of any party and won every exit poll of voters over dozens of hustings and public meetings through the campaign.\nHe said: “It is an honour to be chosen again to be the Green Party’s candidate for any snap general election. The world of politics is in disarray and the environment, indeed the very air we breathe, seems to have been forgotten along the way. Bath desperately needs a voice to speak up for it at the same time as maintaining a principled stand on the other serious issues facing our city and country.”\n“I am passionate about our beautiful, diverse and vibrant city, where I have lived all of my working life. I believe the city is best served by politicians who have made their lives here and intend to stay here. I know what our area needs because my family and I rely on the same public services as everyone else.”\n“We are being governed by a failing coalition of a weak Conservative Party dictated to by a fringe party with extremist views. We have seen an amateurish and failing Brexit strategy that threatens to destroy not only our economy but also our environment and workplace rights. It can’t continue and I believe a snap general election is now inevitable.”\n“The Conservatives have proved that they cannot escape the destructive influence of their hard-right Eurosceptic fringe. The Liberal Democrats still cling to a fixation with privatisation despite the carnage that their NHS reforms resulted in. Labour have moved closer to us on social justice but have no coherent message on the environment, Brexit or our unsustainable economic model.”\n“The choice in that election is clear. Only the Green Party offer real solutions to protect our world for generations to come while actually tackling the underlying causes of inequality and failing services, rather than patching-up the symptoms.”\nThe Green Party is fully democratic and does not enforce shortlists for selections. Dom was selected via a poll of all local party members using a Single Transferrable Vote.\nENDS\nNotes to Editors\nDom’s priorities include:\n- Real action on Bath’s air quality and transport issues\n- Saving our NHS. Working to return privatised services to public ownership and increasing funding to at least that of comparable countries.\n- Positive action at local, national and international levels to seriously tackle climate change\n- Significant increase in affordable and social housing\n- Working constructively with BaNES Council, whoever is in power, to increase funding and protect vital services\n- Opposing Brexit and working to reduce corporate influence and increase democracy within the EU as a member",

But this plan means there will be less parking for patients.\nMost staff get to hospitals well before patients and visitors. At the moment the cost will encourage some to walk, get the bus, cycle, et cetera. What do you think the effect will be if they all know they can get a space for free all day? Many of those who currently use other methods to get to work will drive. It is obvious. And so fewer spaces will be available for everyone else.\nThen there is the problem of people who will park at the hospital to do the shopping et cetera. Why wouldn’t they if it is free?\nNow I am not saying that there aren’t problems with low paid staff having to pay to park at work, patients and visitors paying to be ill, etc etc. But this policy is massively simplistic and won’t help anyone apart from staff ho want to drive and the lucky few others who find a space.\nWe should be finding ways of encouraging anyone who is physically able and doesn’t have to drive not to drive to hospital and, if that is impossible, working to make it possible.

When a hospital starts to have issues then it can set off a vicous circle that just makes it worse until it is forced to cut services. For example, one hospital not a million miles away from where I live in Bath started having problems recruiting staff for its Emergency Department. If you want to work in an ED do you pick a hospital where you will be one of too few staff trying to hold a struggling department together, or would you choose to work just down the road in a safer ED where you are more likely to have the support you need?\nThere are solutions to this problem, such as hospitals buying each other and becoming multi-site, then allocating staff as required. However, this is difficult and staff can still understandably resist such moves. Unfortunately the very idea of the internal market, where hospitals are forced to compete, forces these issues to occur. Added to this, hospitals require a number of different services and specialists to support things like an ED, and if those services are lost then there can be knock-on effects.\nOf course, on top of this generally problematic structure of enforced competition has come years of pay caps, cuts and destructive policies have brought the NHS to a cliff edge, but Brexit has been the final straw that has pushed it over the edge. Hospitals around the country now regularly cannot staff to safe levels. We’ve seen more nurses and midwives leaving the NHS than joining, with the main reason given by them being staffing levels and workload. Again, this is a vicious circle - as numbers fall, other staff will start to think the same way. Everyone has a limit to their tolerence.\nThe government must immediately reinstate NHS bursaries and go on a recruitment drive for students. Of course they won’t, because the Tory plan has always been to destroy the NHS, and that is coming along nicely. Sadly, even if there was a change of government tomorrow and proper recruitment started, the new staff won’t be available for three years.\nTry not to get ill.",

What's worse is that even if you have the right equipment, playing the content is going to cost you CPU cycles just to remove all of the DRM that has been added anyway. Extra CPU cycles means a slower computer and more electricity used, along with more global warming of course. And for what? Those who want to rip the films and distribute them on the P2P networks are going to get around this anyway, so the only people who lose-out are legitimate users.\nI predict that some people will defend Microsoft and claim that it's not their fault if the film studios insist on this DRM.

Reply To Letter About Health Bill From Don Foster MP\np(meta). 15th September 2011\nHere’s a reply I received from my MP, Don Foster, to the letter I sent him about the Health and Social Care Bill.\nThis is a form reply he sent to everyone who contacted him. Needless to say, he voted for the bill again.\nNow we must take this to the Lords - there is a chance that some decent amendments will be made there. I urge you to consider donating to the 38 Degrees campaign for lobbying the Lords, and also to Adopt A Lord and write to him/her directly.\nAnyway, here is Don Foster’s reply.\nDear Dominic,\nThank you very much for contacting me about the reform of the NHS.\nI received comments from over 500 constituents and am grateful to all of them.\nI hope that this letter covers all the main points that were raised including the legal opinion that had been given to the organisation 38 Degrees. The length of this response reflects the seriousness and complexity of this issue.\nHowever, based on the substantial changes secured by my Liberal Democrat colleagues and me, on a consideration of a wide variety of advice on the legal opinion, on further assurances given by Health Ministers, and detailed discussions with very many people, I voted FOR the Bill on Wednesday. I hope what follows will help explain why.\nBut first, I want to make clear my position on “privatisation” of the Health Service.\nSome people have talked about the spectre of “privatisation” or “break up” of the NHS into some model resembling health care in the USA or many EU states. I am clear that there was never any intention that this was the purpose (or an unintended consequence) of the Bill. There was never a chance that I and my Lib Dem colleagues would have allowed that to happen; I can emphatically assert that – because of changes insisted upon by Liberal Democrats - there will be no “privatisation” of the NHS and no special concessions (i.e. “cherry picking” or favourable tariffs) to private sector providers of health care. The NHS will remain free at the point of need and treatments will be paid for by our taxes.\nIt is important to note that this does not mean that there is no role for non state-owned providers of health care. Ever since its inception in 1948, the NHS has commissioned care from private doctors and companies. The vast majority of family doctors in Bath are essentially private professional practices which derive most of their income from the NHS. There always has been, and will continue to be, a mixture of providers of health care. The important point for each patient is that the treatment is paid for by the NHS, no matter from whom it has been commissioned.\nWhere competition is present it will be in areas such as quality and alternative treatments, not on price for specific treatments as these will come under a set NHS tariff. Furthermore, unlike the previous government, the Coalition is determined that it will not simply promise payment to such organisations regardless of whether or not those organisations have seen NHS patients. The last government encouraged the setting up of Independent Sector Treatment Providers (such as those in Bristol, Shepton Mallet and Devizes) specifically to compete with NHS Trust Hospitals. I do not support this approach and I am delighted that the arrangements will now change so that they don’t undermine, for example, the RUH.\nOne of my key reasons for supporting the Bill was to “lock in” the very many significant improvements – like the ban on cherry-picking - that I and my Liberal Democrat colleagues in parliament achieved in recent weeks.\nAs you will be aware many people, including doctors, nurses and patients expressed concern regarding the contents of the initial version of the Health and Social Care Bill during the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference in March. Thanks to the subsequent actions of Nick Clegg and Liberal Democrats within government the progress of the Bill was paused while the concerns expressed were given proper consideration.\nThe result of this is a vastly improved Bill guaranteeing that the interests of patients are always put first and ensures that there will be no privatisation of the NHS and no special favours to the private sector.\nBecause these changes have not been well publicised I am listing some of them below. Competition • The core duty of Monitor (the Health over-sight body) will be to protect and promote patients’ interests. • We will remove the originally proposed powers of Monitor to “promote” competition and it will be required instead to support the delivery of integrated services for patients where this would improve quality of care for patients or improve efficiency. • The Bill will not change EU competition law (see below). Safeguards against privatisation • We will create additional safeguards against price competition and “cherry picking”. • So that providers cannot “cherry pick” the profitable, “easy” cases, services will be covered by a system of prices that accurately reflect clinical complexity, except where this is not practical. Commissioners will be required to follow “best value” principles when tendering for non-tariff services, rather than simply choosing the lowest price. • We will outlaw any policy to increase the market share of any particular sector of provider. This will prevent current or future Ministers, the NHS Commissioning Board or Monitor from having a deliberate policy of encouraging the growth of the private sector over existing state providers – or vice versa. The role of the Secretary of State • The policy is that the Secretary of State will be responsible – as now – for promoting a comprehensive health service. The wording of section 1(1) of the 2006 NHS Act will remain unchanged in legislation, as it has since the founding NHS Act of 1946. This will be underpinned by the new duties that the Bill already places on the Secretary of State, around promoting quality improvement and reducing inequalities.(See also below). Clinical commissioning groups • Commissioning consortia will continue to be based on groups of GP practices, but now others will be involved so that commissioning will involve patients, carers and the public and a wide range of doctors, nurses and other health and care professionals. Clinical commissioning groups will have a duty to promote integrated health and social care around the needs of users. • We will make it explicit in the Bill that commissioning groups must commission all urgent and emergency care within their boundaries, and are also responsible for any unregistered patients who live in their area. In other words, they will be responsible for their whole population not just their registered patients. • Clinical commissioning groups will not be required to start until they are ready to do so. • We will amend the Bill to strengthen and emphasise commissioners’ duty to promote choice, in line with the right in the NHS Constitution for patients to make choices about their NHS care and to receive information to support those choices. Governance and accountability for commissioning groups • Every commissioning group will have a governing body with decision-making powers, to ensure that decisions about patient services and use of taxpayers’ money are made in an open, transparent and accountable way. It will have to include at least one registered nurse and one doctor who is a secondary care specialist. • To enhance transparency and accountability, governing bodies will be required to meet in public and publish their minutes, and clinical commissioning groups will have to publish details of contracts with health service providers. Health and Wellbeing Boards and local authorities • We will give Health and Wellbeing Boards a new duty to involve users and the public. • The Bill will make clear that HWBs should be involved throughout the process as clinical commissioning groups develop their commissioning plans. • HWBs will have a stronger role in promoting joint commissioning and integrated provision between health, public health and social care. • Local authorities will still be able to challenge any proposals for the substantial reconfiguration of services. My other reason for supporting the Bill was because I was not persuaded by some of the arguments made against its revised form following the concessions gained by the Liberal Democrats.\nFor example, many constituents were concerned about the role of the Secretary of State for Health.\nThe original 1947 Act that established the NHS made the Minister for Health responsible for the provision of a comprehensive system of health care. Reforms of the NHS by successive governments have amended that duty, essentially reflecting that fact that government is usually an enabler rather than a direct provider or commissioner of services. Indeed, the current situation is that Secretary of State delegates the commissioning of health care to a network of Primary Care Trusts (B&NES PCT in our case).\nBut some people argued that the Bill will allow the Secretary of State to “wash his hands” of responsibility for commissioning within the NHS. I can assure you that this is not the case. The Bill retains the legal requirement that services be free of charge (except where already specified) and now includes requirements as to securing continuous improvement in the quality of services provided. It also promotes research and the use of evidence learned from research, and for the first time ever, promotes the need to reduce health inequalities. It would therefore be impossible for the Secretary of State to able to “wash his hands” of the NHS, while he remains legally required to deliver all of the duties outlined above. Crucially, the Secretary of State also retains the duty to promote a comprehensive health service, which dates from the founding NHS Act of 1946. That duty has stood the test of time for 60 years and has been unchanged by this Bill. The Secretary of State will have the duty to secure that services are provided for that comprehensive health service, and will have failed in his duty if they are not.\nThe Secretary of State also has the obligation to set the goals and priorities for the NHS through the “mandate”, which will set out what the Secretary of State wants the NHS to deliver. It will be updated every year and will be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny – giving Parliament, for the first time, a detailed say in what the NHS is tasked to deliver.\nHowever, I understand that despite all these existing provisions in the Bill there are still concerns regarding the role of the Secretary of State. It is understandable, given that we are talking about the future of our most treasured national institution, that people express such concerns and are not willing to tolerate even a sliver of doubt about the safety of the NHS in the future. That’s why my Liberal Democrat colleague, Health Minister Paul Burstow, announced in Parliament that the Government are willing to listen to the concerns that have been raised and, if necessary, offer clarifications or make amendments to put beyond legal doubt that the Secretary of State remains responsible and accountable for the comprehensive health service we all want to see. So, the Health Secretary will retain ultimate responsibility for the provision of health care.\nSome people have also have cited “competition” and “EU regulations” as a concern. The Bill makes no changes. They will be the same as those established by the last Government.\nBut we are making one change to what happens in a dispute. The government believes that if there are any disputes between organisations - private or public who deal with NHS patients they should not be referred to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) as though they were ordinary trade disputes. Instead these disputes will be referred to a special health body (Monitor) that is aware of how important and special health services are. This was the recommendation made by the independent Future Forum as the best safeguard against competition being applied disproportionately.\nHowever, I do understand and agree with concerns that businesses should not make unfair levels of profit from health care. As mentioned above, the Coalition government intends that this Bill will place important limitations on the applicability of competition law so that those charities or private firms who do bid to provide treatments should not be allowed to “cherry-pick” or undercut on matters of price.\nThroughout the consultation on this Bill, the Liberal Democrats have sought to emphasise the importance of properly integrating local health services and ensuring their sustainability, and enhancing local as well as Parliamentary accountability. As well as confirming existing and introducing new duties for the Health Secretary, the Bill also gives much more scope for decision making and scrutiny in Bath. A new Health and Well Being Board will be set up in B&NES Council will also have new duties in public health. I believe that we will be able to build an NHS that has a strong set of legal duties on the national government, but where local health care professionals and politicians will be able to design and commission health care services that address local needs.\nThe Liberal Democrats have made valuable changes to the Health and Social Care Bill which I believe will not only secure the future of a comprehensive system of health care but also lead to improved levels of service. The very nature of health care means that we cannot have a template of provision that can never be subject to reform or innovation. Advances in medical research and demographic change mean that we must make sure that our system of health care matches contemporary needs and circumstances.\nI greatly value the NHS and I fully understand that many people in Bath regard it as our greatest national institution. The issues discussed in this letter are as important to me as they are to you and I have given them a great deal of thought over many months. No piece of legislation can ever satisfy everyone and no doubt there is a scope for further clarification as the House of Lords now considers the Bill.\nThank you for your interest in the Bill and hope that this reply has gone some way to reassured you.\nYours, Don Foster MP </em>",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2014_09_15_scottish-referendum_html/content_116.html": "This week the country faces a major change as Scotland votes in its independence referendum. Rarely can the result of a vote have such an immediate and significant result on a country or state, so whether Scottish or not, it is of interest to all.\nIt has been an interesting campaign. For a long time the ‘no’ campaign was well ahead in the polls, and the powers-that-be in Westminster remained relatively quiet, presumably safe in the knowledge that nothing would change. However, over the last month or so the ‘yes’ campaign started pulling ahead and recently has either had a small lead or is neck-and-neck with ‘no’.\nThis has sent the apparently previously presumptuous politicians into a panic. Having denied Alex Salmond a third option, ‘devo max’, on the ballot paper, David Cameron has changed his mind. Now he, Ed Milliband and Nick Clegg have said that they will give Scotland what was being asked for in ‘devo max’ if independence is rejected. A desperate move, the result of which means that whatever the result of the referendum, more power will move to the Scottish parliament.\nSo why are we now looking at the possible victory of the ‘yes’ campaign after it lagged for so long in the polls? Obviously there is an element of people not deciding until close to the ballot, but some blame has to lie with the ‘no’ campaign. Not only has it been relentlessly negative, attempting to scare people with stories of job losses, rising prices, or not allowing them to use the pound, but to do so it has been wheeling-out politicians hated by the Scots (and a lot of other people), George Osborne, Cameron, and other Tories that have little to do with anyone outside the wealthy metropolitan bubble.\nI’m no PR man, but anyone can see that this was not going to work, and indeed it was likely to backfire. Scotland does not generally vote for right-wing politicians, and being the most right-wing government in memory, the current government is not popular there. Having figures such as Osborne telling the population that if they dare to vote ‘no’ he won’t let them use the pound simply turns previously neutral people towards independence. This isn’t unique to the Scottish referendum - many elections are lost and won by the electorate deciding to do the thing that the people they hate most don’t want them to do.\nOf course, all of the main parties and UKIP, and almost all of the press are in the ‘no’ camp. This certainly makes ‘no’ the vote that the unpopular establishment are encouraging. Obviously the SNP are pushing for ‘yes’, but they are not the only ones. We Greens are pushing for a yes vote too. We believe that all decision-making and action throughout all levels of government, including international government, should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity: namely that nothing should be done centrally if it can be done equally well, or better, locally.\nBut my support for Scottish independence is about more than a belief in local decision making. The Scots are, in general, more concerned with social justice than almost any Westminster government that is elected. There is a mood for change, and an appetite for creating their own destiny. Doom and gloom predictions of big business and establishment politicians are nothing compared to achieving the freedom to have more of a say in your own future. And remember, that future is not an eternal Alex Salmond - we don’t know what future governments the Scots may choose to elect, but whatever government they choose will be theirs, and it will represent them - probably quite accurately as they’ll almost certainly choose some sort of proportional representation. They will sink or swim by their own decisions.\nThe last time part of the UK had a referendum there were similar nay-sayers who doubted it could work. That was of course in 1919, and Ireland has done pretty well since. They’ve had their problems of course, but then which country hasn’t? Nobody seriously questions their decision to become independent. After the initial shock (to some) of a Scottish ‘yes’ vote, people will adjust just as quickly.\nAnd what of the rest of the UK? My hope is that if Scotland votes yes then a few things will happen. Firstly it will create a momentum for devolution of power within the remaining parts of the UK - perhaps an English parliament and regional assemblies. Secondly it will show people that getting engaged with politics can change things. The ‘yes’ campaign had few resources and the establishment didn’t take them seriously until very near the vote - it shows that strength of will is worth as much as the combined might of media and the establishment. Lastly, people in the remaining UK will be able to look to Scotland and see a country that used to be the same as theirs but now offers something different - a stronger voice calling for justice and fairness than for profits for the rich. If Scotland succeeds then the public in the UK can demand the same from our government - no tuition fees, no privatisation of the NHS, no ‘need’ for the City elite to call the shots. The cosy neoliberal lie that we must accept cuts to our wages and rrights while inequality balloons because ‘that’s just the way it must be’ will be shattered.\nSo good luck, Scotland. You have a once in a lifetime chance to change the path you are taking. Grasp it and don’t let go.",

In a nutshell this cross-party bill seeks to reinstate the NHS based on its founding principles and reverse the creeping privatisation and marketisation of our NHS. It would strip away the costly and wasteful market mechanisms and return much-needed funds to treating patients, rather than the massively bureaucratic process of splitting NHS services into tiny parts for handing-out to private companies and NHS organisations - a process reckoned to cost billions per year.\nOur new MP Ben Howlett makes much noise about how he is both ‘proud of the NHS’ and happy to rebel against his party in issues where there is clear evidence and public support. Since the huge majority of the public don’t want to see the NHS privatised, will we be able to count on his support for today’s bill, or will he all too predictably ignore the public will and fall into line with his party now that he is elected?\nDominic Tristram 2015 Green Party PPC for Bath\nYou can read more about the excellent NHS Public Reinstatement Bill here.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2015_09_22_corbyn_html/content_252.html": "With some reluctance I’ve decided to write something about Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader of the Labour Party thanks to so many people asking me about it. I am reluctant because in many ways it’s a matter for Labour members, and to others it really makes no difference until (if?) Labour policy actually changes. At that point I’ll be only too happy to comment. However, as I say, people have asked, so here goes.\nFirstly let me say that Corbyn was the only one of the leadership candidates that seemed to offer Labour any hope of changing to be close to ‘old’ Labour. Burnham was ok I suppose, but we’ve seen his voting record for authoritarian nonsense like ID cards, and he was a fan of ruinous PFI in the NHS. At least he was better than Kendall.\nSo anyway, I was pleased when Corbyn won. Of course I was - a lot of the policies he supports are Green Party policy. He’s much more closely aligned to us than to his own party on most policies. With the indisputable combination of lack of media coverage and, when we do receive coverage, bias against our party, to have the main opposition party advocating our position can only be a good thing. Shifting the argument over to our position means that it is discussed more widely even where previously the media did not discuss us.\nIt is also good to see the majority that Corbyn won by, and there are many Labour supporters who are very pleased that they now have a leader that shares their values. Some of those have approached me (and I am guessing other Greens) and talked about ‘working together’ and so on.\nThis is where I have a slight problem though. What did these people do in May? I’d be surprised if any of them didn’t vote Labour, but consider that for a minute. They voted for a pro-austerity Thatcherite party, even they supposedly believe in everything Corbyn has been saying. Why would they do that? Why wouldn’t they vote for the Greens, a party that actually agreed with far more of their supposed values than the Labour Party? In Tory/Labour marginals they could conceivably vote Labour as the logical best choice, but there aren’t many Tory/Labour marginals.\nHere in Bath it certainly wasn’t a Tory/Labour marginal, yet we were fighting a supposedly left-wing local Labour Party who were only too happy to be part of a party machine telling voters that our plans to renationalise rail, abolish tuition fees, and many other things that Corbyn supports were ‘unrealistic’ or unaffordable. In my (many!) hustings I was putting forward arguments that the local Labour Party supposedly believed in far more than the view that their candidate argued for, but they were happy to both back him and select him in the first place (their PPC, by the way, backed Liz Kendall for leader, so is very much to the right of the party).\nWhat are we in the Green Party to make of this? We’re going to hear a lot from Labour in the coming months about working together as a ‘progressive’, non-tribal force to fight the Tories. I have a lot of time for that argument, but only when I trust that those putting it forward actually believe it. Why would I listen to those who fought to get a candidate elected who was so distant from the views they supposedly have? What’s that if not tribal?\nLabour nationally spent huge sums in Brighton trying to beat Caroline Lucas and our only council, and almost equally huge sums in Bristol West to stop us getting second MP - this rather than spending that money on fighting the Tories. Almost everyone involved is still in the Labour Party.\nI’m not saying we can’t work with Corbyn, but the ball is in Labour’s court. He’s already had to compromise on some of his policies, and he missed a real opportunity to ‘show willing’ by giving Caroline Lucas a position in his shadow cabinet. My feeling is that there is a lot of good will being sent his way by people of a progressive persuasion, but Labour will have to do something meaningful, such as offer PR without a referendum or stand down in three or four constituencies for us, before I’ll really believe that ‘working together’ doesn’t mean ‘help Labour win’.\nIn the end we are a party where policy is decided by members. Labour is a party were policy can be dramatically changed by one man. And one man can change it back. I’ll take democracy over that.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2015_05_10_election-analysis_html/content_263.html": "So, after more than a year of campaigning, more than 25 hustings, TV, radio and a lot of meetings, the election happened. You’ll have heard the overall result, and above you can see the details for Bath. Thank you to all who voted for me!\nI didn’t win, which is a shame. I also missed third by just a few hundred votes, which is also a shame, but I’m pretty sure that’s entirely down to tactical voting - I had a lot of people saying they supported me but were too scared not to vote Lib Dem.\nThe good news is that the Green vote had the highest increase of all the parties. In a way I take that as a ‘win’ - not as good as an actual win, but on a personal level I feel I did pretty well. Of course it wasn’t just me though - I had the backing of a large team of dedicated local members who spent many hours leafleting, door knocking, organising events… you name it. I would like to thank them all.\nWe now have a government that I doubt any of you are happy with. I am certainly not. You will hear that this is because people loved the Tory message, but of course that’s not true - their vote nationally increased by less than one percent (less than Labour’s did). There is no appetite for Tory policies.\nIn Bath the Tory vote share rose by more - 6.4% - but the Green vote share increase was much higher, and the combined ‘left wing’ share rise was 16%, more than that of the right wing parties. From this we can see that what actually happened in Bath was that the people punished the Lib Dems for colluding with a Tory government and most of those people voted for offerings to the left of what the Lib Dems were offering.\nWhile we have to live for up to five years of a Tory government, we can take some comfort from the fact that things here are on a progressive trajectory. People are also a bit restless that we have a Tory majority government on about 25% of the national vote. They are ruling for 1 in 4 of us, and with such a slim majority they won’t be popular. Perhaps they won’t last the full term? Let’s hope that’s the case.\nI also want to address the ‘tactical vote’ thing I warned about before polling day. We know for a fact that it happened. It didn’t help. The Lib Dems lost by thousands, and even if they had held Bath we’d still have a Tory government. Think how inspiring it would have been to have a few thousand more Green votes! We’ve got the momentum for great things here in Bath in the next election - the surge is there even more than the result implies.\nOur NE Somerset candidate Katy Boyce saw a vote share increase of 4.2% giving her 5.5% overall. This is a great result in such a Tory stronghold, so congratulations to her!\nIn the local election we saw our first two councillors elected in Bath - Lin Patterson in Lambridge and Jonathan Carr in Abbey. We were also very close to getting Jon Lucas in Westmoreland (by 12 votes!), and Vipul Patel and Michael Tichelar in Walcot. Two councillors (and very close to getting five) is a great result.\nGetting a group on the council and 12% at the general election is not only a success in itself but a great foundation for future success. The next local election is four years away and we’ve got a great start on getting more councillors elected, and a great momentum in the Green vote.\nIt’s debatable whether Labour were really a left-wing party as it is, but it looks like they may well lurch to the right, in their panic. That would be a mistake for them and the people of the UK. However, it would be an opportunity for us. We have a few years now to make our anti-austerity message of social justice clear. The pundits are wrong - the people want it. We will provide it.",

It was an excellent party, and photos will be appearing on Facebook very soon, I'm sure. I'm ashamed to say that I was the only person there not in fancy dress. I have an excuse though - before the party I went to see the always funny Stewart Lee doing his show '41st Best Stand Up Ever' at the Ustiniv. Support came from the also brilliant Kevin Eldon in the form of some amusing poetry. Stewart Lee's set was great as always - perhaps a little less confrontational than previous ones, but very entertaining none the less. Hopefully he will be at Glastonbury again this year... not that I'm sure that the naked man and Jesus with crucifix 'heckles' could ever be beaten. They were proper Glasto moments indeed.\nAh yes, Glastonbury! I was up for 9am on Sunday morning, ready for the annual madness that is clicking on refresh and redialing the phone for three hours until I get through. Sure enough, with three of us doing that constantly I finally got through and bought tickets at about half eleven. It's always a joyous moment, and I didn't even have to get the inconvenient coach tickets this time (although I'll still go by bus, of course). As the day went on though the tickets still didn't sell out, and they were still there by the end of the day. It was most bizarre, and obviously in hindsight I wouldn't have got up early and gone through the pain of watching timeout messages for hours. Tickets are, in fact, still there now. It's funny - last year I was hoping that the rain would put off some of the fair-weather fans (see what I did there?) this year, and it turns out that may have happened. However awful Jay-Z is, there are always so many artists for every taste that the lineup really doesn't make much difference, so I don't buy that line of reasoning. I really don't think that the weather and mud could be any worse, and even if it is, it will still all be brilliant. Can't wait.\nAh yes, Glastonbury!

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2018_02_10_labour-tactical-voting_html/content_257.html": "On Friday I was optimistic to see this Tweet from Labour’s only councillor in Bath:\nDid all that work delivering scare tactic leaflets and dodgy bar charts? That’s what I mean. It’s time for the liberals to do what they’ve been avoiding for years: have a fair fight on the issues.\n— Cllr Joe Rayment 🌹 (@joerayment91) February 8, 2018\nIt’s good to see political parties called out for misleading graphs and stats, and locally the Lib Dems are masters at it. However, less than 24 hours later I saw this article in the Bath Chronicle, the source of which was a Labour press release, which states that if there ‘was no tactical voting’ then Labour could win. This struck me as immediately suspicious, since Labour hasn’t even been close to winning in Bath for a lifetime. Indeed, when I stood in 2015 I got about the same number of votes as the Labour candidate (on a much bigger swing), and in the last Bath election where tactical voting didn’t apply (the European elections) the Green Party easily beat Labour (and also beat the Liberal Democrats).\nI asked both Labour and the Bath Chronicle for the source data. The next day they still hadn’t responded but thankfully another source did, and the survey was very revealing.\nThere were a number of questions about polling intentions. The Greens were not given as a possible answer to any of them. The question that was the basis of the press release was actually ‘If the Conservatives, Lib Dems and Labour all had an equal chance of winning, who would you vote for?’ and again, the Greens were not an option.\nNow whether this was incompenent surveying technique or a deliberate attempt to exclude their closest rival party it’s hard to say, but clearly the press release from Labour and the Chronicle story are misleading.\nI pointed this out to the local Labour party and their councillor. Their attitude was ‘So what?’.\n‘Such is politics!’, you probably say, shrugging your shoulders. ‘Just let it go!’. Well, I would, but I feel that it’s important to shine a light on this spin and dishonesty. Labour, and Jeremy Corbyn in particular, like to talk about a ‘new kind of politics’ based on honesty where voters decide how to vote based on policy and issues, rather than dodgy leaflets, half-truths and deceptive statistics. They have not changed. They are guilty of doing the exact thing they criticise others for.\nIt’s just not good enough. I want politics to be clean. I want both policies and attitudes to be clear. I want the source of statements like this one by Labour to be public so we can make up our own minds. I want the public to make an informed choice.\nMost of all I want a fairer electoral system where tactical voting isn’t an incentive for anyone. Ironically, even though this is something the local Labour Party complain about in this stunt, they are a party that opposes electoral reform. I despise the hypocrisy and the alienation and apathy it creates in the electorate.\nYou can read the BaNES Green Party statement on this story here.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2015_04_29_bbc-points-west-debate_html/content_161.html": "I was pleased to be able to represent the Green Party at the televised debate shown on BBC1 this evening. Alongside me were Tessa Munt (Lib Dem), Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con), Thangam Debbonaire (Labour) and Steve Stanbury (UKIP).\nIt was an interesting evening. The audience were probably the most vocal of any hustings or debate I’ve done. There was lots of shouting and booing (not at me, thankfully!) and it was difficult to hear the chair and other panellists sometimes, although it doesn’t sound as bad on the telly.\nWhile I was pleased to be invited, I felt that I wasn’t given as much time as the other panellists, plus I had to contend with assertions about our policies from the chair when I don’t think the others had to, as well as tiresome ‘how are you going to pay for that?’ questions that the others didn’t get. It wasn’t just me - that was the general feeling on Twitter too. Such is life I suppose, but it was disappointing as we have a lot of very different policies on things like the NHS that I didn’t have an opportunity to get across.\nHowever, I think it was a good opportunity for raising my profile and definitely worth doing overall. Rees-Mogg got a lot of stick but was his usual self, the UKIP chap was ‘very UKIP’, and Debbonaire was saying things that were popular but well to the left of what her party actually believes, as is increasingly common with Labour. I’ve always admired Tessa Munt for having firm principles on fracking etc, and in many ways it’s a shame that she’s going to lose her seat to a Tory who will obviously be very pro-fracking.\nIt was good to get some TV in and wider exposure. The BBC production team were all lovely and my only real regret was that it was so short - there was so little time that it was never likely that we’d all get enough time to get our points over. This is true in all hustings to some extent of course, but this was the shortest of all.\nYou can watch the ‘background’ video for me that the BBC broadcast here.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2017_03_29_article-50_html/content_93.html": "Today is the day. Despite knowing that she is causing potentially irreversible harm to the country she leads, our Prime Minister has chosen to trigger Article 50, signalling our exit from the EU in two years.\nFirstly it’s important to consider the legitimacy of this decision. We have a Prime Minister who was not leader (and nobody expected to be leader) when her party won a majority in 2015 - a victory that came with just 24% of the vote, thanks to our broken electoral system. When her party won its mandate it was on a pro-EU position, and indeed they specified in their manifesto that even if we left the EU they were committed to staying in the single market.\nThe referendum itself has been criticised at length. Yes, the campaign to remain was poorly run, and it was hindered by being supported by a number of unpopular politicians. However, the ‘leave’ campaign was demonstrably built on, to be generous, a mistaken take on how the EU actually works and, more accurately, lies.\nThe fact that politicians promising to give money to the NHS were ideologically opposed to the very existence of the NHS couldn’t have escaped the notice of anyone who thought about it for more than a second. The £350m figure itself was a provable lie, and talk about the EU being ‘undemocratic’ didn’t stand up to scrutiny, as well as being a ridiculous accusation by people who support the British electoral system, with FPTP, an unelected second chamber who are appointed for life, and a reigning monarch.\nBut as I say, all such criticisms have been made many times. We can complain about the abject failure of the government to demand a significant majority to make constitutional change (just like almost every other country does, and the EU!). We can complain about the campaigns on both sides. We can complain about the question being put in the first place. But the result happened, and 36% of the electorate voted to leave.\nThe worst betrayal was what happened next.\nNobody significant in the leave campaign suggested leaving the single market or any other EU institutions. This was not the question on the ballot. Even so, the hard right coup in the Conservative Party resulted in the referendum being taken to mean ‘hard Brexit’. Not only that, but there has been a subsequent campaign by the Leave side to paint this as the only option, with anyone questioning it painted as a ‘remoaner’ or being against the ‘will of the people’.\nLet us be absolutely clear - the only ‘will of the people’, ignoring failures in the campaigns and uninformed electors, was the ‘will’ of 36% of the people. That ‘will’ was to leave the EU - nothing more, nothing less. Everything else is up for negotiation.\nIt makes me furious when those who talk about ‘respecting democracy’ support the use of the executive to implement their hard-right ideals without debate. Just look at the faux outrage from the Right and their masters in the tabloids when someone had the temerity to use the law to force the government to actually take leaving the EU to the Commons for a vote. Judges, upholding the law, were branded as ‘enemies of the people’. MPs representing constituencies where the majority voted to remain were told that representing their constituents (which is their job) would somehow be ‘undemocratic’. Almost every action taken by the Leave side since the referendum has been against democracy and the rule of law.\nAnd now we are at the stage where we are actually triggering our intent to leave. It is a profoundly sad day. The worst part is that not only is it obvious to me, but it’s obvious to the majority of MPs and even the Prime Minister herself. They are knowingly taking a course of action that they know will make the people they represent poorer and less free, and they are doing it because they are scared of the right wing press, and in some cases for their jobs.\nSo who are the ‘enemies of the people’? I’ll tell you who they are - it’s those MPs who have taken a decision they know is wrong because they are cowards.\nSome ask for patience. “Let’s see how it goes”, they say, “it might work out OK”. Yes, it might. It’s unlikely, but it might. If we are very, very lucky then we might just end-up with a deal that almost as good as what we have now, and we’ll have spent years and untold billions getting to that position. In the worst case, and the government worryingly seem to be easy with this, we will end-up with no deal, and trade with our closest neighbours and the largest trading block in the world will become more difficult and expensive. We will all be a lot poorer. Forgive me if I don’t think that this process or either outcome is somehow something we should support.\nSo there are the self-serving MPs. They deserve our anger and contempt. Then there were the people who knew exactly what leaving the EU would mean and campaigned for it. They are, by and large, the hard right. They are people who call worker and environmental protections ‘red tape’, think climate change is a ‘hoax’, and have a long record of campaigning against anything that gets in the way of big business and the rich. They are your Rupert Murdochs, your Nigel Farages, your Daniel Hannans - people who two minutes of research would show have no record of wanting to help ordinary people at all. They are the super-rich parasites who hate anything that stops them and their friends getting richer. Yet, as all through history, they somehow paint themselves as ‘anti establishment’ despite being the epitome of the establishment.\nFor the record I don’t think many involved with the Leave campaign were racist. Sure, they appealed to racists, but racism and intolerance have always been tools of the right to divide opposition. As a result they picked-up some racist campaigners and racists voted to leave because of promises over immigration control. But don’t be fooled - the puppet masters at the top don’t worry about race. For them it’s about power and money.\nI’m not going to say it’s wrong to criticise people who voted to leave. Sure, they are not all racist - we probably all know perfectly reasonable people who voted that way and who are in no way racist. But we should still be angry at them, just as we should be angry at anyone who takes an active step to make us poorer and restrict opportunity for us and our children.\nThis referendum was not like a normal election. While I despair when people vote Tory then complain that the NHS is getting worse without realising they are the cause, that is at least (theoretically) something that can be undone in five years. But not with the referendum.\nI want to be clear on this. If you voted to leave the EU then everything that happens in the next few years is your fault. The inability of my children to work, live and love in Europe without having to jump through hoops or pay is your fault. The loss of the chance for my children to escape the UK’s most expensive universities in the world and be educated for free in the EU is your fault. The restriction on their opportunities and lives, and the loss of freedoms we have all enjoyed for the last 40 years is your fault.\nI am furious with you. I’m furious with either your intention to restrict the lives and opportunities of others or the wilful neglect of your uninformed vote. In 15 years time when university is for the rich and my kids can’t go (or must accept crippling debt) I will blame you. When foreign travel becomes a luxury on the rich can afford I will blame you. When we are living in a polluted tax haven and I am not allowed to sell-up and move to a more enlightened country I will blame you.\nYou have tied me and my family to a hard-Right rock of ignorance and intolerance and left it to sink. You have condemned generations to being part of your little-England fantasy against their wills. You have changed my children’s futures from those of outward looking collaboration to one of us-and-them narrow minded nationalism, where they have to accept wages and working conditions to compete with the Indians and Chinese who are now their ‘competitors’, rather than the wages and protections you yourself enjoyed as part of a European workforce.\nYou might not know what you have done. You might not accept it’s your fault. But it is.\nHowever, redemption is always possible. The anger will always be there for what has happened, but let’s work together to get out of this situation. Let’s fight to stop Brexit. If that doesn’t work, let’s fight to make it as ‘soft’ as possible, then pledge to rejoin as soon as possible.\nHistory will judge those who acted to make their country, themselves and their families poorer and remove their freedoms and opportunities. We now all have a chance to be on the right side of history by joining the fight to keep what we can, and if necessary get it back.\nWhat are you going to say when your children ask you “What did you do when they were taking those freedoms from us?”. Whatever the future holds, I’ll be able to look mine in the eye. I hope you will too.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2015_07_09_budget_html/content_223.html": "After much speculation we now know the details of the first all-Tory budget for some time. It was always going to be bad for the less wealthy and anyone who depends on help from the state, but just how bad is it?\nBenefits ‘Cap’\nFirstly, let’s think about the purely ideological cuts that even the Tories don’t believe will achieve anything other than ‘good PR’ with a certain section of society. The most harmful is the ‘benefits cap’ - a hard limit of £20,000 in social security payments per household. This will apply whether or not anyone is in work, sick or disabled, and irrespective of how many children and dependents they have. As Green MP Caroline Lucas points out, it might not even be legal. And, as she says, the supposed ‘opposition’ Labour Party is not even opposing it.\nTax credits and Benefits Freeze\nEven taking into account possible higher wages, people receiving tax credits will be significantly worse off. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the group who will lose the most will be those who are in work but on low incomes.\nWorking people on lower incomes are hit with a bit of a ‘double whammy’ because not only are they going to lose their tax credits, but they are the group most likely to depend on other working-age benefits to supplement their income, and these benefits are going to be frozen from next year. This means a real-terms decrease in things like child benefit and most housing benefit - benefits have already faced a real-terms cut annually since 2013.\nThe Resolution Foundation is an organisation that campaigns for low and middle-income families. Their chief executive Gavin Kelly said “We shouldn’t think that a higher minimum wage will compensate all low income working families for their losses - many working households will be left significantly worse off”. They also warned that the changes will weaken the incentive both to enter work, and earn more.\nThe ‘National Living Wage’\nWhile George Osborne is not an economist he is quite a canny PR man. He announced a reasonable increase in the minimum wage (although not by as much as we are calling for). The cunning trick however was to call it a ‘National Living Wage’, which has effectively ‘stolen’ the phrase from the progressive side of politics, and has got to have really irritated the Living Wage Foundation.\nTheir statement on the budget makes some good points, but the main one is that the ‘National Living Wage’ that Osborne wants for 2020 isn’t even up to the level of today’s Living Wage in London. By 2020 this is likely to be true outside London as well, and of course with the cuts to Tax Credits the amount required for a Living Wage will actually increase. It has been estimated that with the various cuts announced in the budget a realistic Living Wage is up to £12 today.\nWhile any increase in the minimum wage is to be welcomed, this is not a Living Wage. And let’s remember, like many other Tory changes to benefits those under 25 won’t get this new increased minimum wage, for reasons which are largely inexplicable if you discount ‘because they don’t vote Tory’.\nPublic Sector and NHS\nTeachers, nurses, doctors and other vital workers heard the unwelcome news that they are to face another four years of real-term pay cuts. That’s on top of the five years they have already suffered.\nThis just shows the contempt of the Conservatives for our vital public services. There is a recruitment crisis for many of these jobs, especially nurses. Just how the Tories think that cutting their pay is going to help is anyone’s guess. Let’s be honest - this is all about getting people to leave the public sector by making it increasingly unpleasant to work for.\n“Britain needs a pay rise”, Osborne says. Yes it does, but the Tories don’t want that to apply to the public sector.\nStudents and Young People\nStudents have been hit with a couple of nasty shocks. Firstly we’ve seen the abolition of maintenance grants for poorer students, resulting in the increased burden of debt on the poorest in society. We’ve also seen the lifting of the cap on tuitions fees, meaning that universities will be able to charge more than £9,000. And they will.\nIt was interesting during the General Election campaign. I did a couple of hustings at Bath University which went well, and there were some very positive polls, with the Greens clearly in the lead. However, the Tories were in second place. For the life of me I can’t understand the mentality of a student who votes Conservative - nothing they offered students was attractive, and yet a considerable number vote for them. I can only imagine that it’s a misplaced aspiration assumption along the lines of ‘I’ll be rich one day, so I’ll vote for policies that favour the rich’ while at the same time ignoring the fact that they are definitely a student and will definitely have a student loan, and the Tories have the worst policies for those.\nBut we are where we are, and students are going to be hammered for five years. And it’s not just them of course - we’ve seen that people under 25 are going to lose out on vital benefits which will limit their personal development and ability to live independent lives.\nInheritance Tax\nWe knew before the budget that we’d see a cut in inheritance tax, so it was no surprise when it was announced. However, it is worth mentioning that at a time were we all have to apparently tighten our belts the people who don’t have to are those benefiting from an unearned income of up to a million pounds.\nIHT of 40% is currently payable on estates over £325,000, and this is doubled to £650,000 for couples. To put this into perspective, only 3% of estates currently pay any IHT at all, so it is not a ‘burden’ that the vast majority of us will ever have to worry about. To increase the limit only helps the very richest. Not only that, but it will drive property prices up because there will be less reason for people to sell to pay the taxes due.\nIt’s worth noting that not everything that is inherited is subject to IHT anyway. Some exclusions are unquoted shares, business investment and heritage assets - exclusions that enable the very wealthiest to avoid a lot of tax in the first place. We need to ensure that the various schemes used to avoid IHT are stopped.\nIf the Tories genuinely want to reward ‘hard work’ then they would indeed reform IHT, but they certainly wouldn’t be raising the tax free limit. The Green policy of taxing individual inheritances instead of the estate would be a start (and I’ve never heard a decent argument against it), but if we really want a society where people ‘deserve’ their wealth and get on by their own efforts then we need to reduce inherited wealth, not increase it.\nClimate and Environment\nWe’ve already seen the Tories halting expansion of our cheapest source of renewable energy, onshore wind. Renewables have now been hit with a new cost, and it’s ridiculous - they will now be subject to the Climate Change Levy. This is a charge made on carbon- emitting energy production as an incentive to move to renewables. Well, it was until now. There is no logic behind the decision to apply it to renewables, other than to make them less attractive to investors. One can only assume this was done to please Tory donors in the fossil fuel industry as I honestly can’t see any other reason for it.\nWe’ve also seen a redefining of the way vehicle duty works and an earmarking of funds for road-building programmes. We know that building roads simply generates more traffic. If we want a sustainable transport policy we need to be investing in other modes of transport and infrastructure changes that reduce road use, not increase it.\nConclusion\nThe government billed this budget as one for ‘working people’, but again we’ve seen that actually the people who have done best from Tory policies aren’t those that ‘work hard and get on’, but those who are already wealthy or who don’t work for their wealth at all. We’ve seen not only the increase in the tax free IHT allowance, but also a tax free allowance for dividends. Unearned income has consistently been treated favourably to earned income - what does this tell us about the society the Conservatives want?\nTo be fair there were a couple of positives - the end of relief on buy to let mortgage interest for one. But its not much, and it was massively offset by attacks on the poorest and most vulnerable.\nHowever saddened we may be, we should not be surprised. Let’s ensure we use our anger as an energy for change.",

Today we’ve had the news that the Chancellor has rolled back his 45p income tax band scrapping. That’s not a victory. I mean, it’s a sort of victory, but in the overall scheme of what’s happening it almost doesn’t matter. The costs to the country of bailing out the markets and buying government bonds and stuff after the disastrous mini budget the other day is 65 billion pounds, 65 billion pounds that obviously we are all going to pay for in one way or another.\nAnd that’s ignoring the upcoming cost of living crisis, or in fact ongoing. But it’s going to get worse. Well, what’s really infuriated me today is that they’ve just announced 18 billion in public sector cuts. Now these are real terms cuts because what they’re doing is basically not changing any funding based on the massively higher than expected rate of inflation.\nSo what that means is hospitals and schools and all these other things we all need - not just that, but every public service. Everything that the government does for us and for anyone else, it’s all going to have the same money that it would’ve got if inflation stuck at a rational sort of sensible amount, which wasn’t enough in the first place as anyone who has to wait 10 hours for an ambulance can tell you, or anyone who has to wait weeks to see a GP or anything, any kind of public service and even just dealing with, getting your driving license or your passport or anything else. All of these things are public services. They don’t just affect the poor. We’re not talking about benefits here. Not that attacking benefits is a good thing in any way, but these affect everyone, rich or poor.\nPublic services are vital for everyone. Now, of course, if you are very, very rich, you can get your way around them. With private healthcare or private schooling or whatever, but they’ll affect everyone else. And 18 billion so far has a cut. So what’s that mean? That means that schools that can’t really afford to get TAs or extra teachers or refurbished leaking classrooms will have even less money to do those things.\nThe obvious conclusion to that is that they’re going to have to sack people, hospitals who can’t afford to get bank staff into do operations or run clinics. What are they going to do? The obvious answer is they’re going to treat fewer people but they’re going to have to get that money somehow.\nThis isn’t money that is spare. This is money that’s not there right now. Public services have been crumbling for 10 years and this isn’t just rhetoric. I mean, we’ve gone from, as I’ve said in a previous recording, we’ve gone from a point in 2010 where the NHS was reaching the lowest waiting times in its history.\nSatisfaction was all time high. People forget that was just before the Tories got. What’s changed since then? Yes, it’s been coronavirus, but not till 10 years after the toys got in and the services have been degrading all that time. And what’s going to happen now, Now they’ve got even less money. This is a massive real terms cut and there’s no plans to change that a government’s so insistent on doubling down.\nIt’s a gender for just transferring wealth from all of us. To the super rich. It’s not going to change. It changed the 45 P tax rate because even the people who benefited from that cut actually said it’s ridiculous. So yeah, that was a relatively cost free, although made them look ridiculous. Cost free thing for the toys to do.\nBut this, this, don’t ever think this is anything except the war against ordinary people. Not just the poor, ordinary people, poor middle class, , people who might consider that. They’ve done quite. We’re all going to pay and all of this money is going to go to the super rich it’s gotta end because this is literally going to kill people. People not going to hospital or their doctors in time. It’s already killing people. It’s going get worse. People who don’t get the care they need, when they have issues, psychological issues or mental health issues, is going to get worse.\nSchools are going to get worse. There’ll be larger class sizes. There even fewer teachers. It’s just going to be an absolute nightmare. And as sooner these disaster capitalists are booted out, the better.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2016_03_11_nhs-reinstatement-bill_html/content_261.html": "Today was the second reading of the NHS Reinstatement Bill in the Commons. This cross-party bill basically restores the NHS by reversing the ongoing privatisation, and undoing the disasterous changes made by the Tory and Lib Dem Health Social Care Act, such as removing the responsibility of the Health Secretary for even providing healthcare at all.\nAll in all, the Bill contained measures that healthcare professionals and analysts have been calling for for years and has the backing of a large number of campaigners and politicians.\nFast forward to today and the second reading. It was ‘talked out’ by a small number of Tory MPs. This is a well-known method that is used, especially on Fridays when a lot of MPs don’t bother turning up, to stop legislation even going to a vote. It’s massively undemocratic but sadly something that happens. Thankfully it can be stopped if 100 MPs make something called a ‘closure motion’.\nHowever, without worrying about the archaic nature of Parliament, the thing to take from this is that is was obvious that at least 100 non-Tory MPs had to be there today. Senior Labour figures such as Jeremy Corbyn had previously stated support for the bill, so you would have thought that this wouldn’t be a problem, right?\nOnly 18 Labour MPs turned up. The bill was, predictably, talked-out.\nNow we can blame the Tories for their undemocratic use of parliamentary time here, of course, but the fact that they would do this was completely predictable. Who we can be angry with, completely justifiably, is Labour. If Labour had ensured that enough MPs were present they could have stopped the filibustering and taken the bill to a vote. As it was, not even Corbyn turned up.\nWould the vote have been won? That’s not essential. If a proper debate was held then Tory MPs would have been forced to publicly state how they wanted NHS services privatised - something they desperately still denied against all evidence at the last election. It would have shown them for what they are. Equally, Labour MPs who may well be in government in 2020 would be on record stating a willingness to end privatisation. Would that have held them to it? No, but it would make it more likely.\nAs it is, none of this happened. Labour MPs didn’t feel it was worth their time to try to save the NHS.\nLabour has picked-up members and the support of progressives with the promise that they have changed - that they will now oppose austerity and support public services remaining public. They had the best opportunity yet to prove that today and almost completely failed to do so.\nWhat is the lesson we should take from this? If you want politicians who will actually stand-up for the NHS, you need real progressives like Greens, Plaid and the SNP. Labour is not fit for purpose.",

I was asked a number of interesting questions. Some were pretty off-the-wall, as you might imagine from children aged from 4 or 5, but there were some great questions from the children in every school year.\nAfter we had talked to each class we faced the whole school in a Q&A session after each giving a two minute statement. The most difficult part for me was remembering to put everything in words that every child in the school would understand, as far as possible.

You may be tempted not to vote in this, but you should, and here’s why.\nPolice and Crime Commissioners can’t make laws and can’t tell the police to ignore them. However, they can set police priorities. What does this mean? Well, a PCC could suggest that spending huge sums on policing badger culls or harassing peaceful protest is not a priority when police budgets are constantly being cut. Similarly, it’s possible to stop spending manpower on minor drugs offenses such as possession while there are not enough resources to investigate violent assault.\nThe position of the Green Party is that this position of PCCs should not exist because it is a politicisation of the police, and I agree with this. However, just as with the Lords, there is nothing to be gained by refusing to engage with positions you don’t think should exist as it allows those with regressive policies to run unopposed. It is also vital that we provide Green voters with someone to vote for in every election. As such, as have stood PCC candidates. In Avon and Somerset it is Chris Briton.\nChris has a long career in the Probation Service and has is a great believer in restorative justice.

This isn't a cheap thing to buy in the UK, being about twice as much as it is in the US, but let's leave that aside for the minute. For now I feel I have to draw attention to the ridiculous things that Bill Gates is claiming, specifically that Vista is \"dramatically more secure than any other operating system released\". Let's just think about that statement for a minute as it's a ridiculous claim on a couple of levels.\nFirstly, you never claim that sort of thing on the day of release. Let's just imagine that someone releases a worm that breaks Vista in the next few months. It's almost certain to happen. It's going to make Bill (and Microsoft, by extension) look silly, and a bit cocky, while just saying \"it's better than XP\" wouldn't. Second, it's simply not true. I'm willing to accept that it's the most secure version of Windows ever, but any IT professional knows that Windows is a bit of a joke when it comes to security compared with any UNIX-based OS. There's a good reason why you just don't get viruses on Sun boxes and Macs - they're inherently more secure from the bottom-up than Windows is. UNIX has been around in one form or another since the 70's, and with software the older something is, the more time people have had to find bugs in it. Developing a modern OS from scratch is always going to result in more bugs than anything UNIX based. Developing something from current Windows code is going to be even worse.\nLet's hope that people don't fall for Bill's PR line. Where is the innovation? Were is WinFS? Where is, oh, anything that's not pretty-much ripped off OSX? Buy Vista if you have to use Windows, but don't claim it's more secure than anything else. I'm not knocking it - I'll install it where I would have had XP before, but it's not Gods gift to computing and I'd bet Windows users will still have to suffer virus checkers, spyware detectors, and all of the other stuff you have to currently run if you want to use Windows on the Internet.\nFirstly, you never claim that sort of thing on the day of release.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2013_02_06_gay-marriage_html/content_262.html": "Anyone who keeps an eye on the news can’t have missed the coverage given to the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill in the Commons yesterday. Credit where it’s due, David Cameron was behind it, but sadly 175 MPs voted against it - that’s almost half of the Conservatives in the Commons.\nWhat is the basis of opposition to gay marriage? It seems to boil down to two general ideas: that such a change was not in the manifesto and therefore has no mandate, and/or that marriage is somehow only meant to be applied to ‘one man and one woman’.\nLet’s deal with the first objection, as given by those such as former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth. I am actually in favour of manifesto commitments being binding. If a party promises something in their manifesto they should be legally obliged to at least put a bill to the vote in parliament. Yes, there would be ways to ensure that it never passed (like voting against it), but it would certainly be a step in the right direction towards being straight with the voters. This should not only apply to ‘positive’ commitments, but also ‘negative’ ones, i.e. things that the party won’t do.\nThese promises and commitments wouldn’t necessarily have to be included in published manifestos - they could also be given in speeches, leaflets, party policitcal broadcasts and so on. The legal test would be whether any reasonable voter might expect the party to do it. It would be similar to laws around advertising. After all, advertising is what the parties are doing in manifestos etc.\nIt’s true that there was no manifesto commitment to the introduction of gay marriage, but then there was no promise not to. Governments must be allowed to do things that aren’t in any manifesto or commitment (or not specifically excluded before the election), otherwise all governments would be rather hamstrung. As it is, we have a government where one party hasn’t kept a specific commitment (Lib Dems on tuition fees) and a main party who flat-out lied to get elected (Cameron on NHS reorganisations). These things should be criminal offences. It might be harsh, but being able to make promises then not act on them, or just lie, makes a mockery of the democratic process.\nNo party in government said anything about gay marriage, so legislating on it is fair game, whether Tories like it or not.\nLet’s consider the second point, which is the general ‘marriage can only be between a man and a woman’ argument. Up until now this has been true, of course. However, that doesn’t mean it’s right or shouldn’t be changed. Until quite recently, the very act of having sex was illegal if you were gay, and you don’t have to go back much further to see no votes for women, slavery, and so on. To modern minds is seems incomprehensible that politicians ever argued against the right for gay people to sleep with who they like, or votes for women, etc, but they did. We are simply seeing a more current version of the same argument. It rests on a resistance to change rather than logic or evidence, so it really has no validity.\nFinally one must consider the religious argument. Some MPs used faith as a reason to vote against the bill. Now, personally I don’t think religion has any place in politics, and every time it is brought-up in parliament strengthens the case for a full separation of church and state. However, aside from that I don’t think anyone could claim that the church will ‘suffer’ in this case. There is a clear exemption for churches who do not wish to perform gay marriages from doing so, so why should those churches stop others doing as their congregations wish? For the record, it is worth noting that all of the Muslim members of parliament voted for the bill.\nConservatives like to talk about ‘small government’ and shrinking the state, but ‘small c’ conservatives and those on the Right around the world are the most obsessed with what consenting adults do. I think that the state has no business saying much at all, and certainly not legislating, about activities that don’t harm anyone else. What difference does a gay marriage make to people who don’t like it, other than a vague unease that others don’t see life in quite the same way as they do? I guess racists feel the same, but we don’t have to pander to them, and they don’t get so many MPs arguing their case. And rightly so.\nWe live in an age where we like to think that equality is a given. The fact that so many MPs voted against the Bill rather shows that it isn’t. Let’s be clear - this is a vote that either shows you believe in equality or you don’t. Saying that people of the same sex shouldn’t marry is not only making government inexplicably concerned in the private lives of individuals, but is just plain old bigotry. To have people with such views making our laws should worry everyone.",

I also caught 'The Departed' which was pretty good, as well as another couple of films that I was clearly too tired to remember. I remember them being good though. After the efficiency of Tokyo's Narita airport I was expecting the worst from Heathrow, but my baggage was out quickly and the trip back to Bath was really painless. Mind you, travel makes you appreciate things more - I don't think any airport baggage handling can be quite as inefficient as San Francisco when we flew there from Vegas.

You may have heard that it was a bit wet\nthis year, and it was. Wetter than 2005 I'd say, but the new drainage stopped the\nflooding. It didn't stop the mud though! Anyway, more on that in a bit.\nOur bus was due to go at 8:45 on Wednesday morning, but I got a text on Tuesday evening\nsaying that it had been changed to 2pm. Slightly irritating, but that would mean getting\non-site by 3pm or so, which isn't bad. We got to Bath coach station around 1:20 and\nsettled in to the short wait, only to discover that the buses were rather disorganised.\nOur bus got gradually later, as did everyone else's. There was one guy from See Tickets\nwho were running everything, supposedly) and he was being mobbed by the 200 or so people\nwaiting, but didn't know what was going on. He did have all of the tickets in a carrier\nbag though, and the first few people who asked got their tickets and made their own way.\nThis got the guy a telling-off from his bosses though, so he soon stopped that. Time\nicked on and the police turned-up as they didn't like 200 increasingly-annoyed people\nhanging around the coach station. There wasn't much they could do though (apart from\ntelling people off for drinking), so everyone sat around getting frustrated for a few\nhours. Some reporters from the local paper\nturned up, but the only real story was See Tickets being inept.\nAnyway, our coach finally left at around 6pm, and we were on-site by 7. Despite my earlier\nlofty plans to head for Dragons Field, we set-up in Woodsies as usual - it's a good spot,\nespecially when rain is expected as it doesn't get too muddy. Even better, it's right next\nto gate A where we came in. Having set-up the tents we headed into the markets to look\nabout. Foolishly we thought that the solstice was on Thursday night, not Thursday morning,\nso we missed all of the celebrations at the stone circle. Bah! Still, we grabbed some food\nfrom the excellent Garlic Kitchen (this guy\nis also a fan), then after a bit of wandering around went up to the cinema tent to watch\nSerenity. After that it was back down into the markets for a bimble about, then back to\nthe tent for a relatively early one. Little did we know that it was the last time we'd see\nmuch on the ground other than mud.\nIt rained on Thursday, quite a lot. However, when it finished the ground didn't seem too\nbad. We did some things, but also drank quite a lot so I don't remember much about it. We\nspent some time in Chai Wallahs drinking their\nrather excellent chai, doing some wheatgrass shots, and listening to some of the guys from\nOne Taste, including the really, really good\nJamie Woon. Not only is he a great\nsinger/guitarist, but he does a very impressive local loop one man band thing. You really\nhave to see it. I can't remember anything else we did, but we were in the Leftfield\ndrinking quite a lot.\nOn Friday the ground had got pretty muddy, but it was still just about ok in the morning.\nThe bands had started of course, and we all had timetables in mind. First on my list were\nFlipron on the Avalon stage. I'd convinced Nicole\nthat they were worth seeing, and I think she was convinced. They're always great and it's\njust a shame that the set wasn't longer. It was getting muddier all the time though, and\nafter Flipron it was getting to the point where moving between stages had to be carefully\nconsidered as it took so flippin' long. More beer seemed to help my balance though. I\ncaught Rory Motion and '4 in a Field' in the cabaret tent, although I only really laughed\nat a couple of the comedians (Sean Hughes was good, and Ed Byrne was a good compere). We\ncaught Rufus Wainwright and Arcade Fire on the Other stage. I didn't bother with the\nArctic Monkeys, but I probably heard most of Bjork as I was stuck in the human traffic\njam heading towards the Pyramid stage.\nSaturday was even wetter. The rain not stopping had got less funny, but it wasn't going to\nstop us! The mud gave it a good go though. We poked around the Green Fields, then spent a\nvery enjoyable (and dry) afternoon in the cabaret tent watching Nina Conti, Simon Munnery\nPaul Nathan, Murray Lachlan-Young, Jeremy Hardy, Rhythm Wave, Marcus Brigstocke, Phil Ka\nand Mitch Benn. The highlights were Jeremy Hardy and Marcus Brigstocke, but it was\npretty much all good. I'm not sure what it says about me that the main thing I wanted to\nsee on the day was comedy though! Anyway, after that it was off to the John Peel stage\nto catch 'Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly', then back to the cinema tent to catch Hot Fuzz,\nalthough we gave up before the end (it was cold, and I've seen it before... it's good\nthough!). Oh, and we got into the Guardian photo montage thing,\naround about the 1:20 remaining mark. That's us, in yellow ponchos!\nMy main objective for Sunday was the Leftfield. We saw George Monbiot\ntalk about his environmental ideas which are always very insightful.\nEric Faulkner (yes him, from\nthe Bay City Rollers) then played two guitars at once, which was very impressive. Then\nthere was a debate called 'Another World is Possible' with Tony Benn, George Monbiot,\nand some union people. George Monbiot got very angry about the Iraq war and made some\nvery good points again. The next act was Marcus Brigstocke again, with a\nreduced (but slightly different) version of his set from the day before. Still funny.\nThen Ed Byrne did a really funny set, Tony Benn talked about nuclear weapons and\nTrident, Shazia Mirza did her 'angry feminist Muslim' thing, then Mark Thomas\ndid his funny (yet alarming) mass lone protest thing, ending with the good news that\nGordon Brown has suggested that he'll scrap the restrictions on protesting near\nparliament. After that we hoofed-it up to the Avalon stage to catch\nBilly Bragg, in great form as ever. Sadly,\nfar too many other people wanted to see him too, so we were stood some way outside the\ntent. Still a good gig though - he's always great to watch. After that we went back to\nthe Pyramid stage and caught a bit of the Manics, but then gave up and went to Chai\nWallah's again instead to drink chai and catch more Jamie Woon.\nAnd today.... dear God, the organisation! Or lack of it. Our bus was due to go at 8am,\nso we were up early putting our tents away in the rain (it had rained all night), and\ntrudged over to the site bus station. Of course, none of the buses were working and\nnobody knew what was going on. The mud was the deepest at the festival, and it actually\ncame over the top of my boots for the first time all weekend. We gave-up waiting where\nwe were meant to as it clearly wasn't going anyway, and went and stood near where the\nbuses were coming in. It was very wet and windy, and some people were clearly very cold,\ndespite the foil heat blanket things that were handed out. A bus for Bath eventually\nturned up at around 10, and about five coach loads of people tried to get on. We were\nlucky and made it in, but a lot of people didn't. I dread to think how long they had\nto wait. Urgh. So I got home just before midday, cold and wet, but overall happy.\nIt has easily been the wettest and coldest Glasto so far - even the floods of last time\nwent away by Sunday, and it was sunny then too. This time the rain was just relentless,\nand the mud. I won't forget that in hurry. As for my highlight... Jeremy Hardy? Not very\nrock'n'roll, but there you go. And Billy Bragg from a musical perspective I suppose, but\nthen I know all of his songs and agree with his views, so I probably got more out of it\nthan the other guys. Jaime Woon was good too, and I intend to check him out...",

The relatively short amount of time all of the parties have (although it might not feel that way to those on the receiving end) means that a lot of ‘stuff’ has to fit into six weeks.\nThis has pros and cons as a candidate. My immediate advantage over some of the others is that I was selected absolutely ages ago, back in 2022 I think, so my local party hasn’t had to scramble around with a rushed selection process.\nThe Green Party nationally has actually been much more ‘on the ball’ than most others in this regard. A few days after the election was announced we already had the second largest number of candidates selected - more than the Tories and Lib Dems.\nThe Tories being caught on the back foot by the announcement might come as a surprise to many people. “Surely they would have been briefed that an election was coming before the general public were?”, you might think. This very much appears not to be the case, and by all accounts there were many local Conservative ‘associations’ rather annoyed about not knowing the date in advance.\nSo here we are, one day away from the deadline for nominations and some candidates are probably not quite confirmed yet. This means that despite all of the media noise you might not actually get to vote for someone you expected to. They may also be some unexpected candidates on the ballot.\nI am pleased to say that my papers are in and validated, and I will definitely be on the ballot for Bath. My Green colleague in the photo, Edmund Cannon, will also definitely be on the ballot for North East Somerset and Hanham (where Rees-Mogg is standing).\nLabour, the Tories, the Lib Dems and Reform have also announced candidates for Bath, but until the council publishes the statement of persons nominated and notice of poll tomorrow we won’t know for sure who is definitely going to be an option for voters.\nA great result for me, although admittedly unlikely, would be if everyone else is late or has messed-up their forms and I am the only candidate, thus winning by default. One can always hope! Assuming they aren’t that hopeless then we have an interesting few weeks coming.\nTo receive new posts directly by email or in the Substack app, please subscribe",

I’m feeling pretty tired because I was at the count last night and, um, haven’t slept. But yeah, we’ve got three councillors in Bath and Northeast Sunset, which is brilliant. Thank you, everyone who voted. Three councillors is tripling what we had before. It gives us the same number of councillors as the conservatives.\nAnd just to put that in some sort of perspective, the conservatives ran the council until 2019. Things can change very quickly. The conservative nationally have done appallingly, of course, but at a local level the Conservatives chose to make their entire campaign based around opposing efforts to reduce traffic.\nAnti-anything, to promote active travel and safer streets. So they put all their eggs in one basket and it didn’t pay off because the trouble with the bubble that Tories seem to live in is that they hear a lot about how it’s really terrible that people are trying to make the city livable without using a car. And actually, as was proven in the last local elections when all of the parties, including the Tories, had dealing with traffic in their manifestos and this election where all the parties except the Tories had it in their manifestos again… and lo and behold, the Tories have lost seven seats.\nSo they’re down to the same as the Greens, though obviously the Greens are on their way up, Tories on the way down. So that’s kind of interesting. The Lib Dems obviously still have a huge majority and even more huge majority now. Labour are now the official opposition in the council, so interesting times. So yeah, always worth voting in local elections, . The Tories telling people all the way through that it’s them all the lib dems and actually hardly anyone voted Tory really compared to what they expected.\nSo a good thing.",

Sadly, the bill does very little or nothing to stop the sort of lobbying that Cameron promised to do something about before the election (i.e. by the wealthy, powerful and big business), but puts huge barriers up to charities and campaign groups doing what they do - speaking up on the issues they campaign for.\nMaina Kiai is a lawyer and Kenyan human rights activist who currently serves as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association.

In-house lobbyists – which enjoy the most influence in the UK government by far – are exempt.”\nIndeed, the bill would have such an impact on the ability of charities to do their work that a huge number of them have written a joint letter to the Government detailing their objection</a>.\nSadly, the government has ignored the charities and groups and is pressing ahead, despite vigourous protests. The campaigning group 38 Degrees ran a spirited campaign, and groups of constituents all over the country took their concerns to their MPs. In same cases, such as Tory MP Sir Richard Ottaway, they refused to meet their constituents and even called the police. Generally though, many Coalition MPs listened to the complaints. And ignored them.\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas, always opposed to the Gagging Law, found herself in an unusual situation when the Coalition used her as a possible beneficiary of the bill. This sort of logic is absurd, of course, as she points out in her article in that link, but it does show that even the Government can’t find any decent excuses as to why this bill is required. It simply caters for a problem that doesn’t exist and ignores problems that do, while at the same time making sure that only wealthy corporations and newspaper owners can influence public opinion, rather than civil groups such as 38 Degrees and Oxfam.\nYou can see why the Coalition are pushing this law through. The general election in 2015 is going to be running at a time where more than half a million people in this, the seventh richest country in the world, are depending on food banks to eat. A country where the sick and disabled are having vital benefits cut, and where the poor and young are demonised. It is charities and ground-level campaigning groups that will be publicising this, and that is why the government want to neuter them.\nWhen the bill went to the Lords it looked like the worst parts of the bill might be dropped. After much debate the Lords made a number of amendments via a Comission chaired by Lord Harries, which consulted on the legislation after the government failed to conduct any pre-legislative scrutiny. Today, the Commons rejected nearly all of the amendments. The story makes rather depressing reading.\nWith the Lords unlikely to try again, it seems as if this government has its way. It will be harder for charities and campaign groups to bring terrible legislation to the attention of the public, whether that’s when they try to sell-off our forests, or privatise our NHS. You can imagine the hearts of Tories and their stooges warming at the news. It is, however, a massive blow for democracy and one of the first things that the next government must overturn.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2013_02_06_gay-marriage_html/content_297.html": "Anyone who keeps an eye on the news can’t have missed the coverage given to the second reading of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill in the Commons yesterday. Credit where it’s due, David Cameron was behind it, but sadly 175 MPs voted against it - that’s almost half of the Conservatives in the Commons.\nWhat is the basis of opposition to gay marriage? It seems to boil down to two general ideas: that such a change was not in the manifesto and therefore has no mandate, and/or that marriage is somehow only meant to be applied to ‘one man and one woman’.\nLet’s deal with the first objection, as given by those such as former Tory defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth. I am actually in favour of manifesto commitments being binding. If a party promises something in their manifesto they should be legally obliged to at least put a bill to the vote in parliament. Yes, there would be ways to ensure that it never passed (like voting against it), but it would certainly be a step in the right direction towards being straight with the voters. This should not only apply to ‘positive’ commitments, but also ‘negative’ ones, i.e. things that the party won’t do.\nThese promises and commitments wouldn’t necessarily have to be included in published manifestos - they could also be given in speeches, leaflets, party policitcal broadcasts and so on. The legal test would be whether any reasonable voter might expect the party to do it. It would be similar to laws around advertising. After all, advertising is what the parties are doing in manifestos etc.\nIt’s true that there was no manifesto commitment to the introduction of gay marriage, but then there was no promise not to. Governments must be allowed to do things that aren’t in any manifesto or commitment (or not specifically excluded before the election), otherwise all governments would be rather hamstrung. As it is, we have a government where one party hasn’t kept a specific commitment (Lib Dems on tuition fees) and a main party who flat-out lied to get elected (Cameron on NHS reorganisations). These things should be criminal offences. It might be harsh, but being able to make promises then not act on them, or just lie, makes a mockery of the democratic process.\nNo party in government said anything about gay marriage, so legislating on it is fair game, whether Tories like it or not.\nLet’s consider the second point, which is the general ‘marriage can only be between a man and a woman’ argument. Up until now this has been true, of course. However, that doesn’t mean it’s right or shouldn’t be changed. Until quite recently, the very act of having sex was illegal if you were gay, and you don’t have to go back much further to see no votes for women, slavery, and so on. To modern minds is seems incomprehensible that politicians ever argued against the right for gay people to sleep with who they like, or votes for women, etc, but they did. We are simply seeing a more current version of the same argument. It rests on a resistance to change rather than logic or evidence, so it really has no validity.\nFinally one must consider the religious argument. Some MPs used faith as a reason to vote against the bill. Now, personally I don’t think religion has any place in politics, and every time it is brought-up in parliament strengthens the case for a full separation of church and state. However, aside from that I don’t think anyone could claim that the church will ‘suffer’ in this case. There is a clear exemption for churches who do not wish to perform gay marriages from doing so, so why should those churches stop others doing as their congregations wish? For the record, it is worth noting that all of the Muslim members of parliament voted for the bill.\nConservatives like to talk about ‘small government’ and shrinking the state, but ‘small c’ conservatives and those on the Right around the world are the most obsessed with what consenting adults do. I think that the state has no business saying much at all, and certainly not legislating, about activities that don’t harm anyone else. What difference does a gay marriage make to people who don’t like it, other than a vague unease that others don’t see life in quite the same way as they do? I guess racists feel the same, but we don’t have to pander to them, and they don’t get so many MPs arguing their case. And rightly so.\nWe live in an age where we like to think that equality is a given. The fact that so many MPs voted against the Bill rather shows that it isn’t. Let’s be clear - this is a vote that either shows you believe in equality or you don’t. Saying that people of the same sex shouldn’t marry is not only making government inexplicably concerned in the private lives of individuals, but is just plain old bigotry. To have people with such views making our laws should worry everyone.",

This only goes to show just how similar the two big parties have become. Inheritance tax should, if anything, be increased.\nOne thing that seems bizarre to me is quite why so many people worry about inheritance tax in the first place. In reality it simply isn't an issue for the vast majority of us. Last year 40,000 estates in England and Wales were liable to inheritance tax, while the same year there were 502,599 deaths. As a very rough guide that suggests that considerably fewer than ten percent of people who die have to worry about the tax at all. The reason that people worry about it is because they have an irrational optimism of their own financial future. Let's face it, most of us don't get rich. It's the sort of thinking that makes the public hostile to policies like 50% income tax on earnings over 100,000 - there's no way that's going to be a problem for most people, yet you hear people saying things like 'why tax success?' and other nonsense.\nSo what about the level at which the tax is payable? Well, until today it was 300,000 pounds. It has now (or will shortly) go up to 600,000 - a level which a tiny percentage of estates will reach. I think that this is a terrible decision, and if anything it should be reduced. The level at which tax starts to be paid all rather depends on what you want the tax to achieve, and inheritance tax is basically performing a redistribution function. It is one of the methods the state uses to make sure that too much money does not stay in the hands of too few people. If anything, this is becoming more of a problem, not less, so why on Earth are we reducing the effectiveness of one of the tools that we can use against it?\nIt's worth tackling the 'I've paid tax on it once, why should I pay again?' argument too. The reason that people are suddenly concerned about the tax in the first place is because property prices have increased so much. Houses have gone up in value far faster than inflation recently, which means that an initially modest investment is now worth hundreds of thousands. What people seem to forget is that the sum where 'tax has already been paid' is usually a small percentage of today's value, so in fact for most estates only a small percentage of the value has had tax paid on it anyway. It's only right that tax is paid, and paying once you've died seems like the most convenient time to me.\nIn the end we have to tax people on death precisely because property prices are high. By placing a tax on inherited properties people will be forced to sell them, placing the house back into the market. More houses on the market will help to bring prices down to a reasonable level, benefiting everyone. If the tax is reduced then the government will still need that money so they'll just tax something else, and that's going to be something that we all have to pay when we're alive, and probably something that has to be paid by far more people. Inheritance tax has so many logical advantages to such a majority of the population, so why has reducing it become so popular with voters? In the end we can probably put it down to selfishness and misplaced optimism, yet again.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2013_07_22_internet-censorship_html/content_228.html": "Today David Cameron has talked about his plans to introduce controls on Internet access and search, ostensibly to crack-down on child pornography, but with a fairly broad scope that encompasses child porn, ‘extreme’ porn, and porn in general.\nThe main proposal is to oblige anyone connecting to the Internet to ‘opt in’ to access to ‘online pornography’ by the end of next year. There are a number of problems with this. Firstly, exactly what will be filtered? This is not clear, but one might assume that it would be the same sort of filtering that is applied by similar filtering software one can install at home. No automatic filtering is perfect though, so it’s almost certain that along with the majority of ‘porn’ content some other content will also be removed, including subjects such as sex education, contraception advice, and possibly rape crisis and support services. This isn’t just speculation - the Internet is full of examples of over-zealous filters blocking inoffensive content.\nIt is important to realise that a filtered Internet service is not an Internet service. As such, UK ISPs will not really be able to claim to be ‘Internet Service Providers’ at all. This might seem like a slightly pedantic point, but it is important. If you’re happy for your provider to provide you with a filtered Internet, what else are they filtering? It is beyond your control. Up until now, it’s up to you (as an adult) to determine what content you want your family members to access and install filtering software appropriately. You have control. This change will mean that it’s no longer up to you. Happy to allow your teenage children to view nudity as part of artwork? Well, maybe the government isn’t - bad luck, it’s filtered. Happy to allow sex education videos? Well, it’s not up to you any more. Sure, you can ‘opt in’ to the unfiltered connection, but then you are in the same position you are in now anyway, except now you’re on a list.\nLet’s think about that list. When ISPs ask customers to ‘opt in’ to a proper Internet connection, how many people will be comfortable doing so? We know that ISPs share all sorts of data about their customers with the government, other companies, advertisers, etc, and this list will be no exception - in fact it will almost certainly be of interest. Do you want to be on such a list? Why should people who simply want unrestricted Internet access have to ‘opt in’ to anything when they know that they will be at risk of being judged?\nYou can picture the scenario - someone is in the frame for some crime, such as Christopher Jefferies (Joanna Yeates’ landlord that the press basically decided was guilty because he looked weird). It is revealed that they are on the ‘porn list’, and BAM! That’s all of the evidence that the ‘think of the children’ brigade will need.\nHow long will it be before I need to register with the government to be allowed access to books that they consider ‘vile’? Or films? Or art? Or ideas?\n“Oh well”, you may think, “if enough of the electorate wanted this maybe we should do it? That’s democracy.” Perhaps. But guess what? Last year the Department for Education held a consultation on “parental internet controls” to elicit views from parents. Most respondents indicated that parents were quite capable of taking responsibility for the online safety of their children. There is no call from the electorate for these measures.\nLet me be clear. In the West we rightly criticise other governments, such as China, for providing their citizens with a censored version of the Internet. Cameron is proposing the same for us. He might claim it’s just porn, and that may be how it starts, but the thing about a censored Internet is that you don’t know what you can’t see. Censorship is a tool of tyranny. It’s not about pornography, it’s about control. The moment you let your government decide what you may or may not read/watch/hear, you are encouraging fascism.\nAs well as having to opt-out of censorship, Cameron is also promoting another massively illiberal measure - outlawing possession of ‘extreme porn’. This “includes scenes of simulated rape”. ‘Includes’ is an interesting word there, since it shows that includes a bunch of other things too. One must wonder who defines what ‘extreme’ means exactly, since one man’s view of something as entirely harmless and mainstream might offend someone who is somewhat more conservative. The dangerous thing here is that Cameron is proposing legislating for morals rather than anything where there is any evidence it will reduce crime. There is no question that the ‘extreme porn’ being banned is created using consenting adults (any that isn’t is obviously illegal already). The proposal is that society is judging what some people do in the privacy of their own homes, harming no-one else, to be so ‘immoral’ that they should be locked-up at the taxpayer’s expense for three years, whether or not anyone else even sees the images.\nOnce possessing this ‘extreme porn’ is outlawed, what next? Logically one must also outlaw images of fake murders, since it’s almost certain that murderers have seen such images before going out to commit their crimes. Then what about simulated drug use? You could argue the same for that. This is the slippery slope that outlawing the depiction of anything must lead us down given the logic of creating the law in the first place. We would see the end of a lot of art and most films - certainly anything with more than a PG certificate. This law could already make possession of a lot of films illegal, i.e. basically anything that contains a rape scene. “But that’s not porn!”, you might say. Isn’t it? What’s the difference? Would you be happy to defend the depiction of rape in, say, Irreversible or I Spit On Your Grave as something that nobody could derive pleasure from? They’d be pretty sick, but of course they could, just as some people could from just about anything. That is why laws like this are so insidious.\nLet’s just hope that this is just another Coalition promise to ‘crack down’ that follows their previous attempts on such things as plain cigarette packaging and minimum alcohol prices.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2025_01_07_labour-nhs-privatisation_html/content_204.html": "Yesterday (6th January 2025) the Labour government announced of a significant increase in the use of private healthcare providers to address NHS waiting lists. While some may argue this is a pragmatic response to backlogs, the implications of this policy confirm a deeper, more troubling shift.\nA Pattern of Privatisation\nI have long pointed to the Labour Party’s pro-privatisation stance, but this warning has all too often fallen on deaf ears, both of Labour activists and some voters. I can’t tell you how many times I have been at hustings or meetings about the NHS where people simply don’t believe that Labour, the self-styled ‘party of the NHS’ has anything but the best of intentions for it and keeping it public.\nHowever, this is not the case. Even under Corbyn (who supported the Bill as a back bencher) the Labour Party was whipped to abstain on the NHS Reinstatement Bill, which would have put removing profits from NHS service into law.\nWes Streeting, the Shadow Health Secretary, has consistently shown sympathy towards private healthcare, and the Labour Party has received sizeable donations from private health companies. Yesterday’s announcement underscores a fundamental issue: the NHS is being incrementally handed over to private firms, under the guise of efficiency and backlog reduction.\nThis is not a short-term solution. Once private providers become even more entrenched in NHS operations, they are unlikely to leave. NHS money—already stretched to its limit—is being funnelled into private pockets, with no new funding in sight. For those who argue that private providers will simply vanish once waiting lists are cleared, the reality is far from it. Their presence will likely expand, creating a system where profit motives increasingly dictate healthcare provision.\nThe Staff Shortage Problem\nOne of the key flaws in this approach is the misconception that private hospitals can offer additional capacity. Private healthcare providers do not conjure up new staff; they largely rely on NHS-trained consultants, many of whom divide their time between public and private work. As private workloads increase, NHS capacity inevitably suffers. The problem isn’t a lack of facilities but a chronic shortage of staff—a situation exacerbated by diverting personnel to more lucrative private roles.\nSkimming Profits from Routine Procedures\nEven if we were to assume that private healthcare provides genuine extra capacity, this policy creates another financial burden for the NHS. Private providers typically focus on straightforward, high-volume procedures like hip and knee replacements—the very services where NHS hospitals can generate a modest surplus to offset the losses from more complex and costly treatments, such as emergency care or cancer therapies.\nBy outsourcing routine operations, the NHS loses this vital revenue stream, making it even harder to sustain essential but less ‘profitable’ services. The result? NHS hospitals will struggle even more, while private firms profit.\nShiny Private Facilities vs. Crumbling NHS Infrastructure\nIt’s easy to see why patients might prefer private hospitals, with their modern facilities. But this shouldn’t be a choice forced upon them due to the government’s neglect of NHS infrastructure.\nMy partner works in a typical, tired and crumbling NHS hospital where wards are sometimes closed because of plumbing disasters—a problem that could easily be resolved with proper investment in capital projects. Yet, funding for such improvements is sorely lacking.\nInstead of funnelling money into private hospitals, the government should be investing in NHS facilities, expanding capacity, and addressing the maintenance backlog. Shiny private hospitals might appear appealing in the short term, but they represent a long-term erosion of the NHS’s ability to provide universal, equitable care.\nA Solution: Nationalise Private Hospitals\nThe Labour government claims there is no alternative to private sector involvement, but history tells us otherwise. When the NHS was founded, private hospitals were brought into public ownership to ensure universal healthcare. If we truly want to expand NHS capacity, the solution is simple: nationalise private hospitals and integrate them into the public healthcare system.\nThis approach would immediately bolster NHS capacity without diverting funds to profit-driven providers. Anything less is a tacit admission that the government prioritises private profit over public health.\nWhat Can You Do?\nTo combat this privatisation agenda, take action now. Write to your Labour MP or local Labour Party and express your opposition to private sector outsourcing. Make it clear that their stance on this issue will influence your vote. Even if you’ve never voted Labour, they won’t know—what matters is the pressure from constituents.\nAdditionally, consider supporting a party that unequivocally opposes NHS privatisation. As a former Green Party candidate, I believe the Greens are the only party in England committed to removing private firms from the NHS and restoring it as a public service.\nYour vote is your voice—use it to demand a healthcare system that prioritises people over profit.\nThe future of the NHS depends on our collective action. If we fail to stand against these policies now, privatisation will continue, and the core principles of our healthcare system will be eroded beyond recognition.\nVote for what you believe in, and fight for a truly public NHS.",

This is true despite what Labour candidates and activists have told me over the years, claiming to be the ‘party of the NHS’ and that they are also against privatisation, despite all evidence to the contrary. Unfortunately this seems to be also widely held by some voters, who believe that Labour is still a left-leaning party at heart.\nI wonder how many of the voters who put Labour into second place in the last election will therefore be somewhat surprised that, under the new Labour government, community health services in BaNES, Swindon and Wiltshire have just been handed over to a profit-making company in a huge £1.3bn deal?\nThey will sometimes tell voters that this is somehow ‘not privatisation’. That is a lie. Services that could be run by the NHS (with any savings from efficiency improvements going back into improving other NHS services) will be run by a company with an incentive to spend as little as it can on care so that it can maximise profits. This is NHS money given to shareholders instead of being spent on patients.\nThis is just the beginning - under Wes Streeting, the private sector is set to take control of much more of our NHS to profit from.\nThe Green Party is the only party that will put NHS services back into public hands. For Greens, it is a fundamental principle that the NHS should be run for people, not profit.

It all went\npretty smoothly, and even though it started pouring with rain just after I got on the bus,\nit was sunny by the time we arrived on-site about 40 minutes later. They've sorted-out the\ntraffic this year, so only buses could go through Pilton. I don't know where the cars were\nsent, but it made the bus a lot quicker not having to sit in all the plebby car traffic.\nHurrah!\nI'd sent my tent up and had a cup of tea by about 1:30pm, so I headed off to find some\nmusic.

I stuck around for\nThe Subways\n(who were unimpressive) and Get Cape, Wear Cape, Fly,\nwho were ok.

They were ok, but I think they\nsuffered from the immediate downer that my brain adds to any Other Stage performance. I\nwandered-off to the Green Futures field to watch\nCaroline Lucas\nwipe the floor with some Tory in a debate entitled 'Can the Tories Deliver A Green\nAgenda?', one of a number of interesting events\nin that tent. I then strolled over to the Avalon stage to catch Hazel O'Conner, which was\nsuprisingly good. I then caught a strange act called 'Dancing On Your Grave' by\n'The Cholmondleys and the Featherstonehaughs',\nfollowed by a cute singer/songwriter called Hera from Iceland/New Zealand (another set I\nliked enough to buy the CD afterwards). There then followed a few hours of managing not to\nmeet-up with some friends, but I did catch the surprise Franz Ferdinand set on The Park\nstage.\nSaturday morning saw the site beginning to dry-up a bit after the rain on Friday, with the\nPyramid Stage not looking too bad.\nFirst up was Shakin' Stevens,\nwho was pretty poor actually.

The assumption was that the government would hold an election in the autumn, and this was based on the almost universal prediction that they know they will lose and want to retain power for as long as possible. If nothing else they could have hoped that Labour would suffer some sort of disaster or appalling gaff and played for time.\nHowever, here we are - in six weeks the nation will go to the polls.\nIt would take a brave commentator, even in the Tory press, to publicly state that the Tories will win. They almost certainly will not. The only real question is how badly they will lose and how large the Labour majority will be (if indeed they achieve a majority).\nI’m not going to pretend that the Greens are going to form the next government, but I do think that the best possible outcome of the election is a Labour minority government that depends on the support of other progressive parties such as the Greens to stay in power. This isn’t just because I want power for the sake of it, but because while a Labour majority government will almost certainly be better than a Tory one, it is still a poor outcome for the country.\nOver the coming weeks I will discuss why this is. I’ll also talk about national issues, policy, the situation in Bath where I am standing, and anything else that you might want to hear about! Please let me know if there’s any subject you want me to cover.\nIn the meantime I’d like to finish by saying that I very much look forward to giving the people of Bath the choice of a fairer, greener country and the chance to vote for real change. The campaign might feel long but it will feel short for us candidates!\nSubscribe to my newsletter on Substack, have a look at my campaign Web site, follow me on social media (I’m on pretty much all of it - you can find the links on my Web site). Even better, help in my campaign! I won’t lie to you - the Greens have much, much less money than the other parties.

As people may know, this is yet another closure of a secondary school in Odd Down, forcing many local children to travel miles across the city just to get to school even though there are perfectly good school buildings where they live.\nI have been impressed by the level of interest the school has shown both to the development of its children and to the wider Odd Down community. It has been a pleasure to have been interviewed by the children a number of times and to have faced some really good questions in the many hustings they have run. Few schools have shown such consistent interest in engaging their children with the world.\nUnfortunately there is little or nothing the council can do about the closure. It’s interesting to see our MP and so many local councillors, especially from the Lib Dems, make a fuss. The three largest parties have spent years removing responsibility for our schools from councils and handing it to ‘academy chains’ and ‘free schools’, with no democratic control and bosses who syphon-off funds to award themselves huge pay packets. This is the result - the people have no voice when schools close. Complaints from the three big parties when these closures happen are either dishonest public displays or show that they are ignorant of the effect of their own policies.\nThe law makes it difficult and no other party wants to do it, but it is still actually possible to start LEA (council run) schools. I will work with my Green Party colleagues to do this on the BCA site and, if the studio school site ceases to be used as a school, reopen it as an LEA school. I’m interested in hearing from residents who would like to support this campaign.\nIn the meantime I will do what I can to keep it open. Yesterday I wrote to Damien Hinds, the Secretary of State for Education, to ask him to intervene and stop the school closing. If fellow Odd Down residents or other concerned people in Bath would like to add anything to my further letters to him on this then please let me know.\nDominic Tristram Green Party PPC for Bath and Odd Down campaigner",

With the current (and very welcome!) competition between the parties on who can be the most 'green' I expected more green taxes for one thing, yet the only real difference is a slight increase in fuel duty and a higher road tax for the most polluting vehicles, although the threshold for this is so high that it doesn't even cover most 4x4.\nThe move that surprised almost everyone was the 2p cut in the basic rate of income tax, although this came with the scrapping of the 10p band, so those on the lowest wages will actually pay more. Now I'm probably in the minority in thinking that we don't pay enough tax as it is, so I didn't want to see cuts to income tax. At least it wasn't to the higher rate payers I suppose.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2010_06_08_recycling-and-charging_html/content_71.html": "h1. Recycling and Charging\np(meta). 08 March 2010\nThe government has announced that it has ruled out plans (made under Labour) to look into charging households for the amount of non-recyled domestic waste. The plan is instead to ‘reward’ people based on the weight of the waste they leave on the kerbside for recycling. The first scheme, which is no longer being considered, was to charge people based on the weight of non-recycled waste over a certain threshold, thus encouraging them to recycle more. The Tories were keen to label this as a ‘bin tax’ and have campaigned against it. As far as I’m aware, no local authority has used such a scheme.\nThere are a number of issues surrounding both schemes that have raised comment. One is the fact that bins in such schemes need an RFID chip or other marker, and there are concerns about some sort of ‘Big Brother’ monitoring of rubbish. While there are many reasons to be concerned about surveillance and monitoring by the state, this is not one of them. There is a level of paranoia here that can easily be ignored. After all, if the council really wanted to it could weigh your rubbish right now - people who use wheelie-bins have an easily-indentifiable container without having to use any chip. Privacy concerns are a non-issue in this case.\nThe real concern is the effect that these schemes this will have on the overall goal of the policy, which is reducing the amount of waste going to landfill. Consider the old ‘weigh your non-recyclable rubbish’ scheme. This would encourage you to reduce waste by: (a) recycling more, (b) making an effort not to purchase non-recyable items in the first place, and (c) consider more re-use. A charge on the weight of non-recylables directly encourages all of these points:\nPoint (a) is clearly desirable since a charge applies to disposing of non-recyclables. Everything that goes into the landfill waste rather than the recycling may cost you more money, so people will make an effort to sort their recycling.\nPoint (b) is desirable because it will actually cost money to dispose of non-recyclable goods. I’m mostly thinking of excessive packaging and throw-away goods here. If you’re looking at two comparable items, one in a massive amount of plastic and one in easily-recyclable cardboard, it starts making actual monetary sense to choose the one in the sensible packaging. A result of this may well be the reduction in the ridiculous amount of packaging used by supermarkets, since the cost-consious shoppers (as well as the existing environment-consious ones) will stop buying items with excessive packaging.\nPoint (c) is more indirect but will be encouraged by waste charging. For example, people may be more ready to put serviceable items onto FreeCycle or give them to friends or charity shops rather than simply throwing them away. People will also be rewarded for home composting or feeding chickens food waste, etc. This will all help to reduce landfill.\nFinally, charging for excessive waste is fair. Where there is no charging, people who make an effort to reduce their waste are subsidising those who don’t through their council tax. The wasteful are, in effect, being paid by the rest of us to continue their wasteful ways, and the environment still loses out.\nSo what about the scheme being discussed by Eric Pickles, where people receive rewards based on the weight of their recycling box? Let is consider our three waste reduction incentives discussed previously:\nPoint (a) - recycling more. This will be something that will undeniably be encouraged. People will have a financial incentive to sort their waste and put recyclable things in their recycling bin.\nPoint (b) - not buying non-recyclables in the first place. Here’s the big problem with the scheme. People will actually have an incentive to buy products with more packaging. True, this will only apply to packaging that can be recycled, but it’s more packaging none-the-less. As a direct result of this, retailers and manufacturers will face considerably less pressure to reduce their packaging. People will also directly financially lose-out by home composting, or otherwise processing their own waste. What would have been dealt with at source will now become the council’s (and therefore the tax payer’s) problem. This is also true of reducing food waste - people may end-up actually being paid to waste food by throwing it away. Let me be quite clear on this - paying people by weight for recycling is directly rewarding waste with taxpayers money.\nPoint (c) - the incentive to re-use items that would otherwise be thrown away is reduced. Things like composting at home have already been mentioned, but items that may otherwise be appreciated by the community may find themselves being thrown away rather than used. Imagine living in an area where electronic goods can be recycled, as happens in some authorities. People may put a perfectly good but old TV into the recycling rather than advertising it on FreeCycle as they’d receive a healthy payment (by weight) on a TV. The TV costs the council money to process, and the potential recipient still has no TV. This might be an extreme example, but there’s often a way to reuse a lot of waste. As we know, re-use is better than recycling.\nSo it seems fairly clear that charging for waste is a better system than rewarding recycling. So given that, why does the ‘carrot’ approach seem to be the one that the government is favouring? It’s probably down to political philosophy and a general Conservative aversion to taxes. In the much-publicised example authority using this approach, Windsor and Maidenhead, the American company RecycleBank also does rather well out of it.\nThe company receives a flat-rate payment from the council to administer the service but receives further revenue based on the savings in Landfill Tax it makes the council by diverting material from landfill. Councillor Liam Maxwell, lead cabinet member for sustainability at the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has said that the costs of the scheme were “commercially sensitive”. Should we be paying foreign companies for such services? Would our own councils be able to do it for less? The fact that the Conservatives are not willing to let us know the figures makes me rather suspicious that the sums don’t add-up, and yet again, money is flowing out of the UK for things that we should be doing ourselves.\nIn any case, whether you believe that the private sector should be taking a slice of the pie or not, it seems reasonably clear that charging for not recycling is the more efficient and effective policy for reducing waste. If we really want to make our society more efficient and cleaner it’s really what we should be trying to do. If you would like to see your Council Tax being put to a more effective use, and most probably paying less of it, I would encourage you to let your council know your views.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2023_05_09_coronation-protest-arrests_html/content_87.html": "A number of peaceful protestors were arrested at the Coronation. Why should we be concerned?\n@dominictristram A number of peaceful #protestors were arrested at the #Coronation. Why should we be concerned?\n♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nSo the Coronation happened, and one thing you may have seen in the news is that a, small number of pro Republican and I do mean Republican in the very literal sense of not wanting a monarchy. Some pro-republican protestors were arrested and moved on and they’ve all been released without charge.\nBut I think what this really shines a light on is just how insidious the anti protest legislation is that , this government’s bought in. Now, I’m fundamentally opposed to criminalizing any peaceful protest, but the excuse they gave, which did win some people over, was that there are too many disruptive people sitting in roads and locking themselves onto things and being difficult to remove, and that was a massive inconvenience. And that’s what they pitched as , the reason why they wanted to bring this legislation in. But of course, what’s happened, as always happens when you give the police these powers, is that they’ve used these to, , effectively stop people protesting the coronation.\nNow they had placards, there was no evidence they wanted anything more disruptive than holding placards, . They’d actually asked the police for permission to have the protest and were given the permission and yet they were arrested and carted away. And people say, oh yeah, but it’s fine because they were released without charge. And you know what? They were but their right to protest was effectively removed because they were being held during that time and being arrested isn’t fun. But, apart from anything else, t he government don’t even really need to criminalize the actual act of protest by charging people. If they can just arrest them and then release ‘em without charge - gets around some of the awkwardness of having to go to court to prove anything, doesn’t it? But because police can arrest people for these, I’m not going to say crimes, can arrest people for having disruptive protests, they do. Now, this is obviously being used to silence an inconvenient protest that doesn’t actually break any of the laws that the Tories have brought in, but somewhat more worryingly, even if you don’t agree with the republicans, it was used to arrest community volunteers handing out rape alarms.\nNow these were community volunteers working with the local borough, handing out rape alarms, which, the police claimed, could have been used to startle the horses. Or something. Now they weren’t, obviously, and there’s no evidence that they were being planned to be used that way. So it doesn’t help those people who got arrested, people who are doing good work.\nIt’s just the slippery slope into authoritarianism. Everyone always denies it. “These Just Stop oil protests are disruptive. It’s only those we want to stop”. As soon as you give the police the powers to stop a protest, they will. They’ll stop pretty much any protest. And we see this repeatedly whenever more power is granted.\nIt’s always used to the fullest extent, even if that’s not actually even what the government wanted. But of course, the government did want this. It’s like the laws stopping single person protests in Parliament Square, which were literally brought in just to stop one man having his anti-Brexit protest. And of course, now the police have any power they like to stop any single person protests. If you are standing outside Parliament demanding action for, let’s say somebody who’s wrongfully deported and then was killed abroad or something awful, you wouldn’t be allowed to do that anymore because the government had some vindictive reason to bring that legislation in because it was inconvenient for them to be reminded how inept Brexit was.\nNow we should all care because even if you don’t agree with a particular protest against this government, whether it’s because you agree with the government or because you disagree with the protest, if you then agree with legislation to ban protests one day, that power will inevitably be used against you in protest you agree with, because there will be a different government that’s doing things you don’t like.\nOr it’ll be a protest against something that you want to protest. This was seen to some extent by the Countryside Alliance march. Now, I don’t agree with the pro-hunting position of the Countryside Alliance at all, but the people who were on that march getting bashed on the head by policemen were exactly the sort of people who would’ve supported those actions against most protestors. Largely. I’m generalizing, but a lot of those people on that march would’ve been exactly the sort of people who would typically approve of such measures, giving the police those powers.\nSo this is what happens. You support something because you disagree with the protestors. In that case, lo and behold, it’s used against you. So always stand up for the civil liberties we have in this country traditionally, which are being eroded by this government.\nWhether it’s the right to asylum, the right to protest, these things are fundamental and you have to stand up for them, even for people you disagree with.",

He is wrong to follow the Labour and Liberal Democrat lead in confusing the issue with local taxation.\nSince the wealthiest people keep only about 10% of their total wealth in residential property a mansion tax simply misses the target. The wealth tax proposed by the Green Party would cost him £140,000 if charged at 2% and couldn’t be avoided by simply selling the mansion or leaving the country.\nThis is a national policy to address a national problem of inequality and unfairness since poor people currently pay a higher proportion of their income in tax. No doubt local taxation needs to be reformed, but a realistic reform of that will be based on the ability to pay.",

It was organised by students from both of the universities in Bath and supported by a number of other groups, including the Green Party.\nWe were very lucky with the weather - it was cold but sunny. Bath city centre was packed because of the Christmas Market, but we managed to get a decent crowd at the protest despite the traffic and travel chaos. After meeting at the Abbey we marched through town, ending-up at Southgate where we had a short rally.\nI was asked to do a short speech - you can watch it here (from about 4:20 onwards). All of the speeches are worth a watch, of course!\nThe shoppers crowding the streets were generally supportive and there was a good atmosphere. It was great to see so many young people getting involved in campaigning for their right to an education without a lifetime of debt. I enjoyed hearing the other speeches and chatting to other marchers about their concerns and Green Party policy.\nThe Green Party is the only party advocating free education with no fees or additional taxes. There would be no need for loans because, as well as the removal of fees, living costs would eventually be met by the Citizens Income. In the short term, maintenance grants will be reintroduced. We will also widen the range of people who are able to study by offering real support to mature students and students with families. There will be a minimum requirement for Universities and Higher Education Institutions to offer a free crèche to students and staff, nappy changing and breast-feeding facilities.\nEducation and learning are an essential part of a fulfilling life, not just a mechanism for training people for a job. This education should be life-long. We are not just cogs in the machine of work - education is an important part of personal fulfilment.",

But that viewpoint is entirely valid.\n- [Listen on Apple Podcasts]\n- [Watch/listen on Spotify]\n- [Watch on TikTok]\n- [Watch in Instagram]\n- [Watch on YouTube]\nGenerated transcript:\nNow you’ve probably seen recently that Nicola Sturgeon has caused a bit of a fuss in some circles by saying that she detests the Tories. She later clarified that she detests the party and everything they stand for rather than individual Tories, which is clearly what she meant in the first place.\nThis has upset quite a few people. The ask how one could you say such a thing? It’s unprofessional. You should never let people’s politics get in the way of how you feel about them. The language is uncalled for and all that sort of stuff. But it’s not exactly a controversial viewpoint when I say good on her, because actually if somebody holds those views and makes it their business to enforce those views on the people, it’s justified. For example the Conservatives today have blocked some of the very few good things that Michael Gove pushed for when he was in a position of power in their party. So they’re getting rid of the ban on no fault evictions and lots of protections that were going to be bought in for renters.\nNow, it’s pretty rare that the Tories do something for people who don’t have as much and have fewer advantages in life. So for the Tories to then shelve those few things (which were manifesto commitments, let’s remember) is appalling. So there’s a PM with no mandate doing things with no mandate and getting rid of the things they actually were voted in to do by some people, eg actually had a mandate for.\nI mean, that’s pretty detestable, isn’t it? It makes a mockery of democracy for one thing. But there’s no reason to stop a ban on no fault evictions other than potentially pressure from landlords and people with money.\nIt’s taking something that some of the cherished ‘red wall’ voters that they have who got them into power. That’s the sort of policy that would appeal to them. And so some of them voted Conservative and now we see that all of the things that could have conceivably helped people with less money have all been stripped out.\nAnd now it’s all become about helping people with money. Even long term voters are beginning to realize that this is a party that’s been taken over by the hard right. There’s no ‘One Nation Conservatives’ left in a position of responsibility in the party.\nThe Tory party of old that could have commanded respect (in some ways) from me and people like me is gone. It’s all about enriching the already rich, and it is despicable. It’s a body where if people actively support it at this point they’re worthy of contempt and they’re worthy of criticism because they are basically trying to make other people’s lives worse, and it’s all just for them. If it doesn’t make a profit then these people don’t count, and that’s not a viewpoint that is worthy of respect.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2018_02_10_labour-tactical-voting_html/content_277.html": "On Friday I was optimistic to see this Tweet from Labour’s only councillor in Bath:\nDid all that work delivering scare tactic leaflets and dodgy bar charts? That’s what I mean. It’s time for the liberals to do what they’ve been avoiding for years: have a fair fight on the issues.\n— Cllr Joe Rayment 🌹 (@joerayment91) February 8, 2018\nIt’s good to see political parties called out for misleading graphs and stats, and locally the Lib Dems are masters at it. However, less than 24 hours later I saw this article in the Bath Chronicle, the source of which was a Labour press release, which states that if there ‘was no tactical voting’ then Labour could win. This struck me as immediately suspicious, since Labour hasn’t even been close to winning in Bath for a lifetime. Indeed, when I stood in 2015 I got about the same number of votes as the Labour candidate (on a much bigger swing), and in the last Bath election where tactical voting didn’t apply (the European elections) the Green Party easily beat Labour (and also beat the Liberal Democrats).\nI asked both Labour and the Bath Chronicle for the source data. The next day they still hadn’t responded but thankfully another source did, and the survey was very revealing.\nThere were a number of questions about polling intentions. The Greens were not given as a possible answer to any of them. The question that was the basis of the press release was actually ‘If the Conservatives, Lib Dems and Labour all had an equal chance of winning, who would you vote for?’ and again, the Greens were not an option.\nNow whether this was incompenent surveying technique or a deliberate attempt to exclude their closest rival party it’s hard to say, but clearly the press release from Labour and the Chronicle story are misleading.\nI pointed this out to the local Labour party and their councillor. Their attitude was ‘So what?’.\n‘Such is politics!’, you probably say, shrugging your shoulders. ‘Just let it go!’. Well, I would, but I feel that it’s important to shine a light on this spin and dishonesty. Labour, and Jeremy Corbyn in particular, like to talk about a ‘new kind of politics’ based on honesty where voters decide how to vote based on policy and issues, rather than dodgy leaflets, half-truths and deceptive statistics. They have not changed. They are guilty of doing the exact thing they criticise others for.\nIt’s just not good enough. I want politics to be clean. I want both policies and attitudes to be clear. I want the source of statements like this one by Labour to be public so we can make up our own minds. I want the public to make an informed choice.\nMost of all I want a fairer electoral system where tactical voting isn’t an incentive for anyone. Ironically, even though this is something the local Labour Party complain about in this stunt, they are a party that opposes electoral reform. I despise the hypocrisy and the alienation and apathy it creates in the electorate.\nYou can read the BaNES Green Party statement on this story here.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2014_06_19_euro-vote-result_html/content_53.html": "The European Election already seems like a long time ago, and we have obviously been celebrating the election of our first MEP in the South West, Molly Scott Cato. We have achieved our goal and our candidate has been elected, but what will this mean for me in the election next year, and more generally in Bath, given that local elections are happening on the same day?\nThe results in BaNES were very interesting. We got 16.3%, beating both the Lib Dems and Labour, which is a very decent result. Now consider this - the Somerset NE constituency is generally Conservative, and Euro-sceptic Conservative at that. Their current MP Rees-Mogg has in the past suggested pacts with UKIP. The large Tory and UKIP vote in the BaNES area is very likely to have come from the Somerset NE parliamentary constituency. What this suggests is that in Bath the Green vote was likely to have been at least 20%.\nThis is great news. While the Lib Dems consider Bath to be their 4th safest seat, their support has crumbled. This isn’t really a surprise nationally, but for it to happen in Bath has probably surprised them.\nIt’s a perfect storm - long-serving MP Don Foster is not standing again, and the replacement Lib Dem PPC Steve Bradley is considered by many in his party to have been ‘flown in’, with members apparently rather put-out that a local candidate wasn’t chosen. Membership is plummeting, and it appears that votes are too, but who to? Let’s face it, Lib Dems who are frustrated that their party is enabling Tory policy are unlikely to vote Tory. Labour don’t seem to have picked-up the votes, but our vote has ballooned, and membership of the Green Party has risen by a huge 25% in the first five months of 2014 alone.\nIt is clear that many ex Lib Dem voters are now Green voters. This is understandable. The Lib Dems positioned themselves slightly to the left of the Labour party, but under this government we’ve seen them support the Tory privatisation of the NHS, slashing the commitment to renewables, support fracking, attack the poor and disabled and condemning millions of people to food banks simply to survive. Are these the policies that most Lib Dem voters really wanted? No, and with Labour signed-up to the Coalition austerity spending plans and UKIP taking the ultra-Tory route, we Greens are the only party that represents the ‘small l’ liberalism and environmental awareness of the Bath people.\nI am looking forward to the rest of the campaign, and to the election in 2015. I think we’re going to surprise a lot of people.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2014_10_13_nhs-strike_html/content_182.html": "This morning I was at the Royal United Hospital in Bath, supporting the striking midwives and other staff. Despite the weather it was a great turnout, with a good atmosphere with plenty of support from passing motorists.\nThis was the first strike of NHS staff for thirty years, and the first ever strike of midwives called by the RCM in its 133 year history. Along with members of Unison, Unite, GMB, UCATT, around 400,000 health care workers are taking action.\nMuch as the Right like to portray public sector workers as ‘downing tools’ every five minutes, the fact that it has been 30 years since an NHS strike shows that to be an incorrect stereotype. It is clear, therefore, that NHS staff must have a very serious issue.\nAnd indeed they do - most have suffered a real-terms pay cut over the duration of this parliament. There was a glimmer of hope for them when the NHS independent pay review panel recommended a 1% rise. That’s 1% - hardly an enormous amount after years of a pay freeze, but it was something. The government then declared that this pay rise was ‘unaffordable’ and stated that it would not be awarded on top of increments.\nThis is, of course, nonsense - the money required is a tiny percentage of the NHS budget, but more importantly, if tax cuts for higher rate tax payers are affordable, the first thing we should be doing is making sure that those we depend on to save lives aren’t paid less now in real terms than they were five years ago. And make no mistake, a lot of NHS workers are not paid well - a nurse starts on £21,300, which is below the average graduate salary. They are then expected to work long hours for nothing. Notice the panic at the union’s announcement that their staff are going to ‘work to rule’, or in other words, do what they are paid to do. This should be what everyone does anyway, rather than the government relying on the good will of NHS staff to cover shortfalls in staffing on their own time.\nSo there’s the pay, but of course that’s on top of the Coalition Government’s massively disruptive NHS reorganisation and privatisation. Billions have been spent on breaking the NHS up into little pieces that are easier to sell, and indeed, many services have been sold off - 70% of NHS contracts have gone to the private sector. The destruction of the old NHS structure that was required to enable this has led to staff not knowing whether they will have a job in a year’s time, or if they do, what they’ll be doing and where they’ll be doing it. It is a costly farce that is costing lives of patients, and even the Tories have admitted that its the single worst thing they’ve done. If you’re told about a lack of funds in the NHS preventing staff getting a pay rise, remember that we spend £30bn just to allow private companies to take NHS money.\nI am proud to stand with NHS staff and their demand for the very small recommended increase. It’s not much. They save lives. Did the MPs reject their 9% increase? No.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2013_03_11_the-true-face-of-ukip_html/content_189.html": "It was difficult to miss the Eastleigh by election at the end of February. Aside from a slight surprise to some that the Lib Dems held the seat, most of the press concentrated on the fact that UKIP beat the Tories. “What could this mean for Cameron?”, they asked. “Should the Tories lurch even more to the Right?”\nThe simple answer to these questions are, of course, “Very little” and “No”. The UKIP vote was almost entirely a protest vote. What makes me so sure? Well, both the Lib Dem and Tory votes fell by about the same percentage of the vote - about 14 - and this is what one might expect in a by election from the party in power. In this case there are two parties, so they both lost votes. One could assume that UKIP picked-up more votes from usual Tory voters than Lib Dems, but if this were a general election most of the UKIP voters would switch back to their regular parties. The turnout for UKIP was simply a protest in a constituency where Labour would be considered an outlandish choice.\nAt least, one can hope the above is true, and that the UKIP voters were simply protesting against this awful government rather than actually endorsing UKIP, for the policies of UKIP are variously horribly regressive, unfair, xenophobic, homophobic, and economically and scientifically illiterate. It’s worth considering some of what UKIP says and considering the sort of party they are.\nFirstly, defence. UKIP promise to increase the defence budget by 40%. The current defence budget is currently around 40 billion pounds (which is the fourth largest defence budget in the world), part of a total spend of 683 billion. Increasing it by 40% as UKIP suggest will bump it up to 56 billion. Where would UKIP find this extra 16 billion? It’s about the same as the combined budgets for industry, agriculture and employment. And what does UKIP want to do with such a vast increase in military spending? They don’t say, but history shows us that one must always beware of the military ambitions of Right-wingers. Whatever the cause, it would lead to a large increase in taxes, or cuts in other areas.\nUKIP would like to double the number of prison places. That’s right, double. No doubt they intend to demonstrate a commitment to reduce crime, but simply stating that there will be more prison places doesn’t reveal how they will catch all of the extra criminals. Also, one must consider the fact that the countries with the highest rate of incarceration generally have the highest crime, so the effect of prison places on crime is unclear, to say the least. There is also the cost - the current 90,000 prison places in England and Wales cost and average of 39,600 pounds a year each. Doubling these places would cost the taxpayer another 3.5 billion pounds.\nUKIP would also commit 90 billion to building nuclear power, while at the same time stopping all wind power programmes. Wind, bear in mind, results in electricity that costs on average about twice that generated by coal, thanks to fossil fuels not including the costs of pollution, flooding, and other damages. Opponents of wind complain about the cost, but nuclear is much more expensive, and leaves a legacy of radioactive waste for generations. It must be remembered that UKIP are the only party to deny the science of climate change - just another aspect of their appalling scientific illiteracy.\nAnother aspect of UKIPs mysterious thinking is a policy to make cyclists pay road tax and pay for parking for their bicycles. They also propose to take bicycles off the road where they would mean an ‘unacceptable delay to traffic’ (i.e. cars). Does this sound like a party that wants to tackle congestion and increase public health? We know the answer to the health angle, at least - UKIP would stop government funding of any public health campaigns, such as stopping smoking or eating more fruit and vegetables. Never mind that these campaigns have been shown to work, and such preventative measures save the NHS millions every year. Public health campaigns are a very efficient way to save money, as is increased physical fitness. Discouraging cycling helps no-one.\nFundamentally, UKIP is a party of the rich, for the rich. They are like a Tory party who has abandoned any pretence of representing anyone else. They talk the talk about the EU wasting taxpayers money, while at the same time Farage takes millions of pounds in expenses from the very taxpayers he claims to represent. UKIP are also rather famously crooked, with two of the MEPs in prison - one for benefit fraud and one for false accounting and money laundering relating to his EU expenses. While UKIP claim the EU is a gravy train, it seems they are the ones who are riding it. While they are ripping us off they aren’t even representing us: the three British MEPs with the worst attendance record are the Ukip MEPs David Campbell Bannerman, Paul Nuttall and Godfrey Bloom, each averaging under 63 per cent.\nFinally, one must consider the true nature of UKIP. As I say, they are not the cuddly, comical characters as portrayed by Farage. They are in a European Far Right group, along with anti-Semitic and openly racist parties. In fact it’s not just ‘in’ this group - it’s the largest constituent party.\nSo, there’s UKIP - a party that, while not openly racist itself, is happy in the company of racists. A party with huge spending plans yet that promises to cut taxes. A party that ignores science. A party which wants to remove almost all worker protections so you’ll have to work for longer and for less, yet reduce the taxes of the rich. A party with plans for questionable military expansion and national isolation. Is this a party that one should consider as a contender for even a vote in protest? Think about what you’re voting for.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2023_02_23_15-minute-cities_html/content_121.html": "Why have the Right suddenly started attacking plans to create cities where people live close to essential services?\n@dominictristram 15 Minute Cities and Conspiracy Theories\n♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nSo on Tuesday evening, 21st of February, , there was a protest outside the Guildhall in Bath against cuts to subsidised bus routes. A lot of Northeast Somerset is fairly remote from Bath, but people need to go in for hospitals and that sort of thing.\nAnd a lot of them depend on the bus service, especially if they don’t have cars. And the council has decided to basically cut all of those, and keep all the ones in Bath itself. Now, within Bath, it’s a small city. You can pretty much walk everywhere. You might not like it, but you can.\nWhereas if you live in some of the smaller villages in Northeast Somerset, you can’t. So it’s basically cutting off people’s lifelines. Definitely non drivers. So it’s a valid thing , to protest about, so a protest was organised for that outside the Guild Hall, which coincided with the evening of the full council meeting.\nNow, unfortunately, this was slightly hijacked by anti 15 minute City protestors. And that brings me really onto my main point for this video, which is, 15 minute cities and the strange and very sudden campaign by the right to attack them . Now, in case you’re not aware, the 15 Minute City concept basically says that everyone who lives in a city or I guess large town, should have all of the services they need for day-to-day life within 15 minutes of where they live, by walking or cycling.\nSo , shops, schools, doctor’s surgery, dentist, that sort of thing. Pretty much what life used to be like, now this is, , brought some very odd people outta the woodwork. Looking at some of the protestors on Tuesday. You saw people with very much coordinated placards saying something like democracy now, it’s some sort of coordinated anti 15 minute movement and it’s suddenly been whipped up by the sort of people who went on anti-vax protests and, rather than anything rational.\nIt’s about some imagined kind of ‘locking them down’ in to where they’d live somehow. And then that’s mixed with a healthy dose of antisemitism. Bear in mind anything about George Soros is basically antisemitism. They’re just saying Jews, it’s another word for Jews.\nIt’s the usual kind of hard right conspiracy theory nonsense that we’re getting more and more in everyday life now. And I guess it has always been bubbling under the surface, but the difference now is there’s actually been Tory MPs standing up in parliament saying the same sort of stuff, that this is some sort of great conspiracy to get people to, I don’t know, what - stay at home?\nI dunno, who would benefit from that conspiracy of giving you shops and schools close to where you live, but apparently it’s communists or something. And then there’s all sorts of other things woven into it, like s ome sort of United Nations programme?. The more you dig into conspiracy theories and the madness around them, the more you just can’t really believe that anyone with any kind of sense of logic or intelligence could ever fall for them. It’s like the anti-vaxxers. You might have valid reasons to be concerned about any medicine. Of course you might. But when people start talking about Bill Gates putting microchips in vaccines, it’s so immediately obviously rubbish that you’re amazed that so many people somehow buy into it and it’s no surprise that you see anti-vaxxers are now largely the same people protesting against 15 minute cities - protesting against something that entirely and utterly is meant to help them and improve their lives, and they somehow think that’s some sort of attack on them. I’ve said to them, what don’t you like about the, , ability to live somewhere where you can access services?\nAnd I’ve had one guy say to me, “I prefer driving. I like my car. I don’t want things to be close to where I live”. And when you’re dealing with that kind of logic,\nIt’s gone beyond debate. People say to you, oh, you shouldn’t dismiss people with these concerns you should listen to their viewpoints. But at what point do we say as a society and certainly as someone in politics, it’s not something I want to listen to because it’s so clearly nonsense.\nWhy should I waste my time? Talking to somebody who thinks George Soros wants you not to drive to the shops, why? Why? Why is that something that I should even contemplate debating as if it’s a valid viewpoint and when you’ve got Tory mps. And I have to say, it’s not just mps, but the local Conservatives in Bath are happy to go to these protests like them on social media, spread them, encourage them.\nI don’t believe the local Tories believe this for one second. But again, they’re weaponizing people who are easily led. They’re weaponizing conspiracy theories, just like Trump did. Of course, Trump didn’t believe that Hillary Clinton was running a paedophile ring from Pizza Express or whatever it was.\nTrump might be a bit of a fool, but he’s not. Entirely a fool. He’s calculating and he knows how to run an army of fools for his benefit. And it’s the same here. Local Tories want you to forget what they do as a party and what they do nationally as a party, , they try and distance themselves locally.\nBut ultimately when everything is going so wrong, it suits them. Instead of people being on the street saying, “why is it taking eight hours for an ambulance to arrive?” If there’s people on the streets instead saying, “we don’t want this thing that will help us. And here’s this mad conspiracy theory” . If they’re on the street, saying that they’re not actually protesting about something that Tories have done.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2013_07_04_nhs-charges-for-visitors_html/content_64.html": "Over the last couple of days you have probably heard Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been talking about introducing an ‘NHS fee’ for non-EU nationals. It has been suggested that this will be two hundred pounds per year, payable when visas are applied for or renewed. This is required, it is suggested, to help combat ‘health tourism’, or unpaid use of the NHS by those who are not entitled to free treatment.\nIs such a fee reasonable? The NHS does, of course, already have systems in place for charging those who are not entitled to free treatment, either by claiming the fees back from the health system of the country where the person is from, or from their insurer. Even so, because in GP surgeries and (especially) in hospitals there is not a culture of having to prove who you are before you get treatment, some of these people slip through without paying. The cost of this to the NHS is estimated to be between ten and thirty million pounds per year.\nThat sounds like a lot, but is it really? One must consider the cost of implementing some sort of identity checking system at all GP surgeries (there are 8,230 in England) and hospitals (there are 168 run by acute trusts in England, plus a few dozen more run by CCGs and other organisations). Let’s consider the GP surgeries first. Let’s say some sort of ID-checking system or contract costs the surgery 10,000 pounds a year, that’s 82,300,000 pounds. Woah! Suddenly we’re paying at least 2.5 times the ‘lost’ money. Let’s be generous to the government and say the system is a tenth of that - 1,000 pounds. That’s still 8,230,000 pounds. Let’s face it though, it’s certain to be more. Then there is someone’s time to run every new patient through the system. If that takes half an hour or so and that member of staff is earning the national average salary, that’s 8 pounds per new patient. That might not sound much, but it soon adds-up as this is all new patients, not just immigrants or people on visas. And then, of course, we have to add the cost of checks in hospitals.\nAll in all we can be fairly sure that the cost of implementing the checks will cost considerably more than the supposed savings we can make. But is the ‘health tourism’ cost real anyway? Anyone here on a visa is paying their taxes, just as a resident is. In fact, if they’re on a working or tourist visa they’ve probably paid more tax and claimed less in benefits during their time in the UK than many born-and-bred UK residents. Why shouldn’t they receive NHS care?\nOf course, even though Hunt’s sums are almost certainly wrong, that’s not really what he cares about. It’s nothing to do with charging immigrants, it’s about introducing a charging system full stop. Yes, it will start with immigrants, and the Tories will use the rise in UKIP-style xenophobia to justify spending more on stopping foreigner’s receiving NHS care than they can save by doing so. “It’s not about the money, it’s about fairness!” they’ll cry. And then there will be a charging system in place for NHS care. Before you know it, UK citizens will start to be expected to pay towards NHS treatment, or ‘top up’ certain payments. This isn’t speculation - we must always remember that Jeremy Hunt has put his name to a number of books and papers that advocate the end of the NHS being state funded and a move to it being a system of delivery run by private insurance. Then there are Tories such as Oliver Letwin, who is Minister of State remember, who famously said in 2004 that the NHS will “cease to exist within five years of a Conservative victory”.\nSo no, the charges for holders of visas don’t make sense, but then they are not really the objective. The real agenda here is the longstanding Tory ambition to charge us all for healthcare and end universal coverage, and this is simply a way they can use the xenophobia stoked-up by people like Farage to achieve this end without too much public outcry.\nI will leave you with the thoughts of Nye Bevan, creator of the NHS, on foreigners using the NHS. It’s as true today as it was then:\n“One of the consequences of the universality of the British Health Service is the free treatment of foreign visitors. This has given rise to a great deal of criticism, most of it ill-informed and some of it deliberately mischievous … The fact is, of course, that visitors to Britain subscribe to the national revenues as soon as they start consuming certain commodities … They make no direct contribution to the cost of the Health Service any more than does a British citizen. However, there are a number of more potent reasons why it would be unwise as well as mean to withhold the free service from the visitor to Britain. How do we distinguish a visitor from anybody else? Are British citizens to carry means of identification everywhere to prove that they are not visitors? For if the sheep are to be separated from the goats both must be classified. What began as an attempt to keep the Health Service for ourselves would end by being a nuisance to everybody. Happily, this is one of those occasions when generosity and convenience march together …” (In Place of Fear, 1952)",

The European Election saw us gain around 20% of the vote in Bath - a massive increase, and one that we should all take as a hugely positive sign that people are beginning to look outside the big parties and consider the policies of smaller parties more carefully.\nIn Bath we are particularly lucky. Many people who have previously voted Lib Dem are feeling very let down, and parties holding seats almost always lose votes when their existing MP stands down. Many voters do not have a natural home in any of the other parties, and inexplicably they have stood candidates that will struggle to convince the public that they are seriously contesting the seat. We have a huge opportunity to come in and surprise everyone.\nWe know that our polices are the most popular of all of the parties, and they are resonating more strongly than ever before. The single most important thing that we can do is get our message out there. If people voted for policies and not parties we would win, and while that’s good to know, it shows how much work we still have to do.\nI’m not going to pretend that the time from now until polling day is going to be easy. While our message is a positive one, the other parties are involved in an arms race of intolerance and austerity. We must assume that as they notice our growing success they will turn their attention to us. We will be ready for them with the politics of hope, tolerance, fairness and a willingness to work for a better future for us and our planet. Unlike the other parties we do not have millionaire donors or friends in the media to pay our way into people’s minds, but our message is so much stronger. We just need to make sure that we spread that message whenever we can. It is a message of hope, of change and of something different. People are ready for it.\nI am hugely optimistic about what we can do in 2015, and I’d love as many of you to be involved as possible. Every single thing you can do to help us will be appreciated, whether you have time to volunteer to go canvassing, manning a stall, or you simply have a space where you can display a poster. We need to let the people of Bath know that we are here and that we mean business!\nI wish you the very best for the New Year. Let’s do this!",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2024_12_11_health-ceo_html/content_183.html": "US healthcare results in inequality and bankruptcy, but when limited to everyday people it doesn’t often make the news. The death of a wealthy CEO might finally get the attention of those in power.\nOn the 4th of December news emerged of the assassination of healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in the United States. While details are still unfolding (the current leading suspect Luigi Mangione claims to be innocent), the incident raises broader issues about the role of profit-driven healthcare systems and the dangers they pose.\nDisparities in Attention\nThe first striking observation is the disproportionate media attention given to this case. Murders occur daily in America, often involving firearms, yet the killing of a wealthy individual garners significantly more coverage than the countless lives lost among ordinary citizens. This disparity reflects a broader societal tendency to prioritise the wealthy and influential, but it also serves as a stark reminder of the systemic inequalities at play.\nI want to make it clear that I celebrate no deaths, including this one. I hate the way the US healthcare system is, and I think it’s immoral for people to become as rich as this man was on the back of it, but I will not condone those celebrating this as some sort of ‘payback’.\nWhat is true is that the murder of someone very wealthy has reminded everyone of the obvious truth behind the industry that made him wealthy, and indeed the whole concept of private healthcare: the incentive to profit by spending as little money as possible on treatment while charging as much as you can get away with.\nThe Suspect and His Motives\nWhat makes this case unusual is the profile of the suspect. By all accounts, he is wealthy, well-educated, and had no prior criminal record or history of violence. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university, earning both a degree and a master’s in computer science—hardly the typical background of someone who would commit such an act.\nFriends of Mangione suggest he suffered a debilitating back injury from a surfing accident and endured chronic pain despite undergoing multiple treatments. Despite his wealth and insurance coverage, he allegedly faced repeated denials of certain treatments by his insurer, who deemed them unnecessary. These frustrations may have led him to target the CEO of the insurance company, an individual who had profited significantly from a system that, to the suspect, denied him care.\nIt’s critical to state unequivocally that I believe that violence is never a solution to a non-violent problem. However, understanding the conditions that drive someone to such desperation is essential. The suspect appears to have meticulously planned the attack, isolating himself for months before targeting the CEO—a calculated act rooted in personal grievance rather than random violence.\nThe Inevitable Outcome of Profit-Driven Healthcare\nThis case highlights the perils of introducing profit motives into healthcare. In systems where financial gain becomes a priority, insurers and providers often save money by denying treatments, regardless of the impact on patients. For every pound saved, an additional pound is pocketed by executives and shareholders. This dynamic breeds resentment, particularly when patients feel abandoned by a system that prioritises profit over care.\nAnd yet, we are told by this Labour government, and many UK governments before it, that involving private healthcare in the NHS is somehow necessary because the NHS is ‘broken’ or ‘not fit for purpose’. This is a lie and must be called out.\nThe UK’s NHS, while far from perfect, historically stood as a model of efficiency and equity. Until 2011, it was widely recognised as one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the world, delivering strong outcomes for relatively low expenditure.\nHowever, the introduction of private sector involvement under successive Conservative and Liberal Democrat governments has fundamentally altered its landscape. Waiting lists have soared, A&E targets are missed, and patients struggle to see GPs—all symptoms of a system weakened by reforms that prioritise cost-cutting over care.\nThe Danger of Following America’s Lead\nDisturbingly, Labour’s current health proposals seem poised to deepen this trend. Figures such as Health secretary Wes Streeting advocate for increased private sector involvement in the NHS, bringing in consultants and advisors to implement “efficiency” measures. But let’s be clear: the private sector’s primary goal is not to improve healthcare—it is to make money. Every pound saved by denying care or cutting corners flows into the pockets of CEOs and shareholders.\nThis profit-driven model inevitably creates winners and losers. The winners are the corporations and the ultra-wealthy, who profit from extracting money from healthcare systems. The losers are patients denied timely, effective care. The U.S. offers a grim warning: a system where wealth dictates access to healthcare creates desperation, and desperation breeds violence.\nA Crossroads for the NHS\nThe UK now faces a choice. Do we continue down the road of increasing private sector involvement, accepting that this will likely exacerbate inequality and reduce access to care? Or do we return to a model that prioritises public investment in the NHS, ensuring healthcare remains a right, not a privilege?\nDesperate people will resort to desperate measures. While the violence seen in the U.S. is extreme, it serves as a cautionary tale. By allowing profit motives to dictate healthcare policy, we risk creating a society where people are pushed to their limits—financially, emotionally, and physically. The solution is not more private sector involvement but less.\nWe must resist efforts to privatise further and instead invest in a truly public NHS. This is not just about preserving healthcare; it’s about preventing a future where desperation turns into tragedy.\nThere happens to be a petition by We Own It running right now asking Wes Streeting not to make new PFI deals. This is just a part of his agenda to siphon more NHS money, our money, off to the private health sector. I urge you to sign it and share it.",

I have my reservations about the trial itself and the fairness of it, although I wouldn't expect him to be found innocent of course. Whatever the outcome of the trial though, no society that wishes to consider itself civilised has any business condemning people to death. We are responsible for this really - the government hasn't been very vocal in its criticism of course, but apart from that, we generally have a policy of not turning prisoners over to countries where they may face execution. I believe that he was being held by the Americans, but in an ideal world we may have at least tried to influence them.\nObjections to the death penalty aside, no good can come from this. A life in prison would have been a 'worse' punishment for him and wouldn't have turned him into a martyr. Also, there's bound to be knowledge that he had which has gone with him to his grave that we've lost - locations of graves, who helped him in certain crimes, and so on.

This was a general hustings rather than being about a single topic and had a good sized audience of staff and students.\nThere were some good questions and the students were clearly engaged in the issues. Jon Monie (from ITV, and pantomime) span a wheel of fortune-style device to select questions, and there were also questions that we all had a chance to answer.\nA poll was taken before we had answered any questions, and again once we had finished. The results were encouraging, as can be seen in the photo above. At the start the Greens were polling ahead of the other parties at 35%.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2012_03_01_ignored-epetitions_html/content_62.html": "You may remember before the last general election that David Cameron made a big noise about democracy, bringing the will of the people into parliament, and so on. Part of this was his Government ‘e-petition’ site, where any petition that gets 100,000 signatures or more will be considered for debate in parliament. In August 2010, Cameron said “One of the points of the new e-petitions website is to make sure that if a certain level of signatures is reached, the matter will be debated in the House, whether we like it or not. That is an important way of empowering people.” All good, commendable stuff.\nAnd so, as I write this in 2012, which e-petition has the most signatures? It’s the petition to drop the Health Bill, tabled by GP Kailash Chand, which as of today has 166,187 signatures, well over Cameron’s limit of 100,000.\nThe mechanisms of parliament duly engaged and the petition was considered by the Backbench Business Committee. Thanks to the wonders of technology you can see a recording of the meeting here. Skip forward to 1:13 for the discussion on the e-petition, brought by Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Reynolds:\nIt’s about ten minutes for the bit about the e-petition. If you want to see how hollow coalition promises of democracy are, give it a watch. Who was the most critical of the idea of a debate? Liberal Democrat John Hemming.\nBig Society? Democratic engagement? Only if you agree with what the coalition is going to do anyway. Cameron’s lie about the e-petitions is small compared to ‘no top-down reorganisation of the NHS’, but it is another lie, no matter how you look at it.\nLie to get elected then ignore the public - maybe not a new idea, but the coalition is really rubbing it in our faces.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2010_06_08_recycling-and-charging_html/content_265.html": "h1. Recycling and Charging\np(meta). 08 March 2010\nThe government has announced that it has ruled out plans (made under Labour) to look into charging households for the amount of non-recyled domestic waste. The plan is instead to ‘reward’ people based on the weight of the waste they leave on the kerbside for recycling. The first scheme, which is no longer being considered, was to charge people based on the weight of non-recycled waste over a certain threshold, thus encouraging them to recycle more. The Tories were keen to label this as a ‘bin tax’ and have campaigned against it. As far as I’m aware, no local authority has used such a scheme.\nThere are a number of issues surrounding both schemes that have raised comment. One is the fact that bins in such schemes need an RFID chip or other marker, and there are concerns about some sort of ‘Big Brother’ monitoring of rubbish. While there are many reasons to be concerned about surveillance and monitoring by the state, this is not one of them. There is a level of paranoia here that can easily be ignored. After all, if the council really wanted to it could weigh your rubbish right now - people who use wheelie-bins have an easily-indentifiable container without having to use any chip. Privacy concerns are a non-issue in this case.\nThe real concern is the effect that these schemes this will have on the overall goal of the policy, which is reducing the amount of waste going to landfill. Consider the old ‘weigh your non-recyclable rubbish’ scheme. This would encourage you to reduce waste by: (a) recycling more, (b) making an effort not to purchase non-recyable items in the first place, and (c) consider more re-use. A charge on the weight of non-recylables directly encourages all of these points:\nPoint (a) is clearly desirable since a charge applies to disposing of non-recyclables. Everything that goes into the landfill waste rather than the recycling may cost you more money, so people will make an effort to sort their recycling.\nPoint (b) is desirable because it will actually cost money to dispose of non-recyclable goods. I’m mostly thinking of excessive packaging and throw-away goods here. If you’re looking at two comparable items, one in a massive amount of plastic and one in easily-recyclable cardboard, it starts making actual monetary sense to choose the one in the sensible packaging. A result of this may well be the reduction in the ridiculous amount of packaging used by supermarkets, since the cost-consious shoppers (as well as the existing environment-consious ones) will stop buying items with excessive packaging.\nPoint (c) is more indirect but will be encouraged by waste charging. For example, people may be more ready to put serviceable items onto FreeCycle or give them to friends or charity shops rather than simply throwing them away. People will also be rewarded for home composting or feeding chickens food waste, etc. This will all help to reduce landfill.\nFinally, charging for excessive waste is fair. Where there is no charging, people who make an effort to reduce their waste are subsidising those who don’t through their council tax. The wasteful are, in effect, being paid by the rest of us to continue their wasteful ways, and the environment still loses out.\nSo what about the scheme being discussed by Eric Pickles, where people receive rewards based on the weight of their recycling box? Let is consider our three waste reduction incentives discussed previously:\nPoint (a) - recycling more. This will be something that will undeniably be encouraged. People will have a financial incentive to sort their waste and put recyclable things in their recycling bin.\nPoint (b) - not buying non-recyclables in the first place. Here’s the big problem with the scheme. People will actually have an incentive to buy products with more packaging. True, this will only apply to packaging that can be recycled, but it’s more packaging none-the-less. As a direct result of this, retailers and manufacturers will face considerably less pressure to reduce their packaging. People will also directly financially lose-out by home composting, or otherwise processing their own waste. What would have been dealt with at source will now become the council’s (and therefore the tax payer’s) problem. This is also true of reducing food waste - people may end-up actually being paid to waste food by throwing it away. Let me be quite clear on this - paying people by weight for recycling is directly rewarding waste with taxpayers money.\nPoint (c) - the incentive to re-use items that would otherwise be thrown away is reduced. Things like composting at home have already been mentioned, but items that may otherwise be appreciated by the community may find themselves being thrown away rather than used. Imagine living in an area where electronic goods can be recycled, as happens in some authorities. People may put a perfectly good but old TV into the recycling rather than advertising it on FreeCycle as they’d receive a healthy payment (by weight) on a TV. The TV costs the council money to process, and the potential recipient still has no TV. This might be an extreme example, but there’s often a way to reuse a lot of waste. As we know, re-use is better than recycling.\nSo it seems fairly clear that charging for waste is a better system than rewarding recycling. So given that, why does the ‘carrot’ approach seem to be the one that the government is favouring? It’s probably down to political philosophy and a general Conservative aversion to taxes. In the much-publicised example authority using this approach, Windsor and Maidenhead, the American company RecycleBank also does rather well out of it.\nThe company receives a flat-rate payment from the council to administer the service but receives further revenue based on the savings in Landfill Tax it makes the council by diverting material from landfill. Councillor Liam Maxwell, lead cabinet member for sustainability at the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has said that the costs of the scheme were “commercially sensitive”. Should we be paying foreign companies for such services? Would our own councils be able to do it for less? The fact that the Conservatives are not willing to let us know the figures makes me rather suspicious that the sums don’t add-up, and yet again, money is flowing out of the UK for things that we should be doing ourselves.\nIn any case, whether you believe that the private sector should be taking a slice of the pie or not, it seems reasonably clear that charging for not recycling is the more efficient and effective policy for reducing waste. If we really want to make our society more efficient and cleaner it’s really what we should be trying to do. If you would like to see your Council Tax being put to a more effective use, and most probably paying less of it, I would encourage you to let your council know your views.",

Or not.\nIt was hard to avoid the item on the news this morning about a group claiming that 'green taxes' are 'making billions'... far more, it is claimed, than the cost of pollution itself. Stating that fines and taxes are 'revenue generation' as if this is a bad thing is an old argument of course, and one that is often used against speed cameras. However, in this case the target is a much more serious one than speed cameras as it's an issue that is of vital importance to the whole world.\nFirst let us look at the claims. Apparently 'green taxes' brought in 21.9 billion last year, while the emissions had done 11.7 billion worth of 'damage'. 'Green taxes' here include things like fuel duty - hardly a green tax.. more like something that the government has always charged. It also includes landfill tax and other taxes that could be considered green of course, but the scope is rather wide. What they actually mean therefore is a collection of taxes that is levied against things that may harm the environment, rather than green taxes in particular.\nWhat I really have a problem with is the 'cost' of emissions they have come up with. Just how have they calculated this, exactly? Is the 'cost' of a landfill the amount it would be to dig it all up? No - it's the cost of burning-off the methane. I don't think that their idea of costs and mine, or any normal person, are quite the same. Also, how do you put a cost on the effect of a ton of CO2 going into the atmosphere and having some part in flooding yet more of Bangladesh? No, the whole 'cost' is a nonsense. 'Green' taxes aren't there to level some sort of account we have with the environment, they're there to stop people polluting in the first place. The only thing that will make some people stop is to hit them in the wallet, since appealing to their morals seems to fail. People must be priced out of their cars and flights, and motivated into recycling by the cost of not doing it. Society isn't profiteering from this, just making people pay something closer to the real cost of their selfish ways.\nFinally, just who are The Tax Payers Alliance? Well, take a look. Surprise surprise, they are the usual right-wing nutjobs. Just who let a story by these people make the headlines? The chairman Andrew Allum left the Tories 'having lost faith that it represented his brand of free market, individualist and compassionate politics', that is to say that they probably weren't quite right-wing enough for him. The chief executive, Matthew Elliot, is a young chap who has worked for 'Britain’s leading Eurorealist think-tank', so he's clearly going to look at European issues objectively, right? Finally, Florence Heath works... and this is a good one... for an oil company. Brilliant. She's bound to be fully committed to the environment then.\nHonestly though, what the hell is the BBC doing even giving these people the time of day? Three people who make the UKIP look sensible manage to get headlines on the Today programme?! Maybe I'll start my own 'think tank', since I seem to be just as qualified to do so. The trouble is, when you take the 'green' side you probably find that industry is slightly less willing to grease your palm. Perhaps the BBC should just ignore press releases from organisations that can't be bothered to get their own domain for their Web site? It doesn't show a lot of commitment to their cause does it?

Also, how do you put a cost on the effect of a ton of CO2 going into the atmosphere and having some part in flooding yet more of Bangladesh? No, the whole 'cost' is a nonsense. 'Green' taxes aren't there to level some sort of account we have with the environment, they're there to stop people polluting in the first place. The only thing that will make some people stop is to hit them in the wallet, since appealing to their morals seems to fail. People must be priced out of their cars and flights, and motivated into recycling by the cost of not doing it. Society isn't profiteering from this, just making people pay something closer to the real cost of their selfish ways.\nFinally, just who are The Tax Payers Alliance? Well, take a look. Surprise surprise, they are the usual right-wing nutjobs. Just who let a story by these people make the headlines? The chairman Andrew Allum left the Tories 'having lost faith that it represented his brand of free market, individualist and compassionate politics', that is to say that they probably weren't quite right-wing enough for him. The chief executive, Matthew Elliot, is a young chap who has worked for 'Britain’s leading Eurorealist think-tank', so he's clearly going to look at European issues objectively, right? Finally, Florence Heath works... and this is a good one... for an oil company. Brilliant. She's bound to be fully committed to the environment then.\nHonestly though, what the hell is the BBC doing even giving these people the time of day? Three people who make the UKIP look sensible manage to get headlines on the Today programme?! Maybe I'll start my own 'think tank', since I seem to be just as qualified to do so. The trouble is, when you take the 'green' side you probably find that industry is slightly less willing to grease your palm. Perhaps the BBC should just ignore press releases from organisations that can't be bothered to get their own domain for their Web site? It doesn't show a lot of commitment to their cause does it? Either that or they're technically inept, but neither of these possibilities inspire a huge amount of confidence...",

In 2015 he gained the largest increase in vote share of any party and won every exit poll of voters over dozens of hustings and public meetings through the campaign.\nHe said: “It is an honour to be chosen again to be the Green Party’s candidate for any snap general election. The world of politics is in disarray and the environment, indeed the very air we breathe, seems to have been forgotten along the way. Bath desperately needs a voice to speak up for it at the same time as maintaining a principled stand on the other serious issues facing our city and country.”\n“I am passionate about our beautiful, diverse and vibrant city, where I have lived all of my working life. I believe the city is best served by politicians who have made their lives here and intend to stay here. I know what our area needs because my family and I rely on the same public services as everyone else.”\n“We are being governed by a failing coalition of a weak Conservative Party dictated to by a fringe party with extremist views. We have seen an amateurish and failing Brexit strategy that threatens to destroy not only our economy but also our environment and workplace rights. It can’t continue and I believe a snap general election is now inevitable.”\n“The Conservatives have proved that they cannot escape the destructive influence of their hard-right Eurosceptic fringe. The Liberal Democrats still cling to a fixation with privatisation despite the carnage that their NHS reforms resulted in. Labour have moved closer to us on social justice but have no coherent message on the environment, Brexit or our unsustainable economic model.”\n“The choice in that election is clear. Only the Green Party offer real solutions to protect our world for generations to come while actually tackling the underlying causes of inequality and failing services, rather than patching-up the symptoms.”\nThe Green Party is fully democratic and does not enforce shortlists for selections. Dom was selected via a poll of all local party members using a Single Transferrable Vote.\nENDS\nNotes to Editors\nDom’s priorities include:\n- Real action on Bath’s air quality and transport issues\n- Saving our NHS. Working to return privatised services to public ownership and increasing funding to at least that of comparable countries.\n- Positive action at local, national and international levels to seriously tackle climate change\n- Significant increase in affordable and social housing\n- Working constructively with BaNES Council, whoever is in power, to increase funding and protect vital services\n- Opposing Brexit and working to reduce corporate influence and increase democracy within the EU as a member",

While some may argue\nthis is a pragmatic response to backlogs, the implications of this policy confirm a\ndeeper, more troubling shift.</p>\n<p><b>A Pattern of Privatisation</b></p>\n<p>I have long pointed to the Labour Party’s pro-privatisation stance, but this warning has\nall too often fallen on deaf ears, both of Labour activists and some voters. I can’t tell\nyou how many times I have been at hustings or meetings about the NHS where people simply\ndon’t believe that Labour, the self-styled ‘party of the NHS’ has anything but the best of\nintentions for it and keeping it public.</p>\n<p>However, this is not the case. Even under Corbyn (who supported the Bill as a back\nbencher) the Labour Party was whipped to abstain on the NHS Reinstatement Bill, which\nwould have put removing profits from NHS service into law.</p>\n<p>Wes Streeting, the Shadow Health Secretary, has consistently shown sympathy towards\nprivate healthcare, and the Labour Party has received sizeable donations from private\nhealth companies. Yesterday’s announcement underscores a fundamental issue: the NHS is\nbeing incrementally handed over to private firms, under the guise of efficiency and\nbacklog reduction.</p>\n<p>This is not a short-term solution. Once private providers become even more entrenched in\nNHS operations, they are unlikely to leave. NHS money—already stretched to its limit—is\nbeing funnelled into private pockets, with no new funding in sight. For those who argue\nthat private providers will simply vanish once waiting lists are cleared, the reality is\nfar from it. Their presence will likely expand, creating a system where profit motives\nincreasingly dictate healthcare provision.</p>\n<p><b>The Staff Shortage Problem</b></p>\n<p>One of the key flaws in this approach is the misconception that private hospitals can\noffer additional capacity. Private healthcare providers do not conjure up new staff; they\nlargely rely on NHS-trained consultants, many of whom divide their time between public and\nprivate work. As private workloads increase, NHS capacity inevitably suffers. The problem\nisn’t a lack of facilities but a chronic shortage of staff—a situation exacerbated by\ndiverting personnel to more lucrative private roles.</p>\n<p><b>Skimming Profits from Routine Procedures</b></p>\n<p>Even if we were to assume that private healthcare provides genuine extra capacity, this\npolicy creates another financial burden for the NHS. Private providers typically focus on\nstraightforward, high-volume procedures like hip and knee replacements—the very services\nwhere NHS hospitals can generate a modest surplus to offset the losses from more complex\nand costly treatments, such as emergency care or cancer therapies.</p>\n<p>By outsourcing routine operations, the NHS loses this vital revenue stream, making it even\nharder to sustain essential but less ‘profitable’ services. The result? NHS hospitals will\nstruggle even more, while private firms profit.</p>\n<p><b>Shiny Private Facilities vs. Crumbling NHS Infrastructure</b></p>\n<p>It’s easy to see why patients might prefer private hospitals, with their modern\nfacilities. But this shouldn’t be a choice forced upon them due to the government’s\nneglect of NHS infrastructure.</p>\n<p>My partner works in a typical, tired and crumbling NHS hospital where wards are sometimes\nclosed because of plumbing disasters—a problem that could easily be resolved with proper\ninvestment in capital projects. Yet, funding for such improvements is sorely lacking.</p>\n<p>Instead of funnelling money into private hospitals, the government should be investing in\nNHS facilities, expanding capacity, and addressing the maintenance backlog. Shiny private\nhospitals might appear appealing in the short term, but they represent a long-term erosion\nof the NHS’s ability to provide universal, equitable care.</p>\n<p><b>A Solution: Nationalise Private Hospitals</b></p>\n<p>The Labour government claims there is no alternative to private sector involvement, but\nhistory tells us otherwise. When the NHS was founded, private hospitals were brought into\npublic ownership to ensure universal healthcare. If we truly want to expand NHS capacity,\nthe solution is simple: nationalise private hospitals and integrate them into the public\nhealthcare system.</p>\n<p>This approach would immediately bolster NHS capacity without diverting funds to\nprofit-driven providers. Anything less is a tacit admission that the government\nprioritises private profit over public health.</p>\n<p><b>What Can You Do?</b></p>\n<p>To combat this privatisation agenda, take action now. Write to your Labour MP or local\nLabour Party and express your opposition to private sector outsourcing. Make it clear that\ntheir stance on this issue will influence your vote. Even if you’ve never voted Labour,\nthey won’t know—what matters is the pressure from constituents.</p>\n<p>Additionally, consider supporting a party that unequivocally opposes NHS privatisation. As\na former Green Party candidate, I believe the Greens are the only party in England\ncommitted to removing private firms from the NHS and restoring it as a public service.</p>\n<p>Your vote is your voice—use it to demand a healthcare system that prioritises people over\nprofit.</p>\n<p>The future of the NHS depends on our collective action. If we fail to stand against these\npolicies now, privatisation will continue, and the core principles of our healthcare\nsystem will be eroded beyond recognition.</p>\n<p>Vote for what you believe in, and fight for a truly public NHS.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2025/01/07/labour-nhs-privatisation.html\">Labour Government Paves the Way for Large Scale NHS Privatisation</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on January 07, 2025.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2024/12/11/health-ceo2024-12-11T00:00:00+00:002024-12-11T00:00:00+00:00http://dominictristram.com<p><img src=\"../../../assets/img/2024/brian_thompson.png\" /></p>\n<p><em>US healthcare results in inequality and bankruptcy, but when limited to everyday\npeople it doesn’t often make the news. The death of a wealthy CEO might finally get the\nattention of those in power.</em></p>\n<p>On the 4th of December news emerged of the assassination of healthcare CEO Brian Thompson\nin the United States. While details are still unfolding (the current leading suspect Luigi\nMangione claims to be innocent), the incident raises broader issues about the role of\nprofit-driven healthcare systems and the dangers they pose.</p>\n<p><b>Disparities in Attention</b></p>\n<p>The first striking observation is the disproportionate media attention given to this case.\nMurders occur daily in America, often involving firearms, yet the killing of a wealthy\nindividual garners significantly more coverage than the countless lives lost among\nordinary citizens. This disparity reflects a broader societal tendency to prioritise the\nwealthy and influential, but it also serves as a stark reminder of the systemic\ninequalities at play.</p>\n<p>I want to make it clear that I celebrate no deaths, including this one. I hate the way the\nUS healthcare system is, and I think it’s immoral for people to become as rich as this man\nwas on the back of it, but I will not condone those celebrating this as some sort of\n‘payback’.</p>\n<p>What is true is that the murder of someone very wealthy has reminded everyone of the\nobvious truth behind the industry that made him wealthy, and indeed the whole concept of\nprivate healthcare: the incentive to profit by spending as little money as possible on\ntreatment while charging as much as you can get away with.</p>\n<p><b>The Suspect and His Motives</b></p>\n<p>What makes this case unusual is the profile of the suspect. By all accounts, he is\nwealthy, well-educated, and had no prior criminal record or history of violence. He\nattended the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university, earning both a degree\nand a master’s in computer science—hardly the typical background of someone who would\ncommit such an act.</p>\n<p>Friends of Mangione suggest he suffered a debilitating back injury from a surfing accident\nand endured chronic pain despite undergoing multiple treatments. Despite his wealth and\ninsurance coverage, he allegedly faced repeated denials of certain treatments by his\ninsurer, who deemed them unnecessary. These frustrations may have led him to target the\nCEO of the insurance company, an individual who had profited significantly from a system\nthat, to the suspect, denied him care.</p>\n<p>It’s critical to state unequivocally that I believe that violence is never a solution to a\nnon-violent problem. However, understanding the conditions that drive someone to such\ndesperation is essential. The suspect appears to have meticulously planned the attack,\nisolating himself for months before targeting the CEO—a calculated act rooted in personal\ngrievance rather than random violence.</p>\n<p><b>The Inevitable Outcome of Profit-Driven Healthcare</b></p>\n<p>This case highlights the perils of introducing profit motives into healthcare. In systems\nwhere financial gain becomes a priority, insurers and providers often save money by\ndenying treatments, regardless of the impact on patients. For every pound saved, an\nadditional pound is pocketed by executives and shareholders. This dynamic breeds\nresentment, particularly when patients feel abandoned by a system that prioritises profit\nover care.</p>\n<p>And yet, we are told by this Labour government, and many UK governments before it, that\ninvolving private healthcare in the NHS is somehow necessary because the NHS is ‘broken’\nor ‘not fit for purpose’. This is a lie and must be called out.</p>\n<p>The UK’s NHS, while far from perfect, historically stood as a model of efficiency and\nequity. Until 2011, it was widely recognised as one of the most efficient healthcare\nsystems in the world, delivering strong outcomes for relatively low expenditure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../assets/img/2024/nhs_ranking_2011.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>However, the introduction of private sector involvement under successive Conservative and\nLiberal Democrat governments has fundamentally altered its landscape. Waiting lists have\nsoared, A&E targets are missed, and patients struggle to see GPs—all symptoms of a system\nweakened by reforms that prioritise cost-cutting over care.</p>\n<p><b>The Danger of Following America’s Lead</b></p>\n<p>Disturbingly, Labour’s current health proposals seem poised to deepen this trend. Figures\nsuch as Health secretary Wes Streeting advocate for increased private sector involvement\nin the NHS, bringing in consultants and advisors to implement “efficiency” measures. But\nlet’s be clear: the private sector’s primary goal is not to improve healthcare—it is to\nmake money. Every pound saved by denying care or cutting corners flows into the pockets of\nCEOs and shareholders.</p>\n<p>This profit-driven model inevitably creates winners and losers. The winners are the\ncorporations and the ultra-wealthy, who profit from extracting money from healthcare\nsystems. The losers are patients denied timely, effective care. The U.S. offers a grim\nwarning: a system where wealth dictates access to healthcare creates desperation, and\ndesperation breeds violence.</p>\n<p><b>A Crossroads for the NHS</b></p>\n<p>The UK now faces a choice. Do we continue down the road of increasing private sector\ninvolvement, accepting that this will likely exacerbate inequality and reduce access to\ncare? Or do we return to a model that prioritises public investment in the NHS, ensuring\nhealthcare remains a right, not a privilege?</p>\n<p>Desperate people will resort to desperate measures. While the violence seen in the U.S. is\nextreme, it serves as a cautionary tale. By allowing profit motives to dictate healthcare\npolicy, we risk creating a society where people are pushed to their limits—financially,\nemotionally, and physically. The solution is not more private sector involvement but less.</p>\n<p>We must resist efforts to privatise further and instead invest in a truly public NHS. This\nis not just about preserving healthcare; it’s about preventing a future where desperation\nturns into tragedy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://weownit.org.uk/act-now/tell-wes-streeting-no-new-pfi-our-nhs\">There\nhappens to be a petition by We Own It running right now</a> asking Wes Streeting not to\nmake new PFI deals. This is just a part of his agenda to siphon more NHS money, our money,\noff to the private health sector. I urge you to sign it and share it.</p>\n<div class=\"substack-post-embed\"><p lang=\"en\">The Tragic Consequences of Profit in Healthcare: More Lessons from the U.S. by Dom Tristram</p><p>US healthcare results in inequality and bankruptcy, but when limited to everyday people it doesn't often make the news.

Let me be clear from the start: I don’t begrudge anyone doing so. If an\nartist is proud of what they’ve achieved, more power to them. This isn’t an article\ncriticising their choice to celebrate their milestones. Rather, it’s about why I’ve chosen\nnot to participate.</p>\n<p><b>It’s Not About Hiding Anything</b></p>\n<p>I’m not shying away because I’ve got something to hide. I’m perfectly open about the fact\nthat my music reaches a modest audience. In fact, this year, I’ve gained more listeners\nthan ever, and I’m pleased with that. But I’m still operating on a small scale. My\nreluctance to share my stats doesn’t stem from embarrassment or a desire to obscure my\nstanding. Instead, it’s about something deeper: the toxic culture that surrounds these\nnumbers.</p>\n<p><b>The Problem With Spotify’s Numbers</b></p>\n<p>I’ve always had a problem with Spotify prominently displaying an artist’s monthly listener\ncount on their profile. This feature fosters an unhealthy obsession with numbers. It\ndrives behaviours like playlist botting and paid promotions to artificially inflate stats\nbecause, like it or not, those figures influence how listeners perceive music.</p>\n<p>The logic is flawed, but it exists nonetheless: low numbers equate to low quality in the\neyes of some. This system discourages genuine discovery of lesser-known artists. On other\nstreaming platforms, where such statistics aren’t front and centre, listeners are arguably\nmore inclined to give unfamiliar music a chance. That’s real discovery—finding artists who\nare talented but not yet well-known.</p>\n<p>Spotify, however, perpetuates a cycle of promoting the already popular. Even the\nplatform’s much-touted discovery features, like its recommendations, often lead to artists\nwho are already well-established. After one of my songs finishes playing, the next\nrecommendation is almost always someone with hundreds of thousands of listeners—artists I\nalready know. That’s not discovery; it’s recycling. What about the smaller, independent\nartists who deserve a shot?</p>\n<p><b>The Broader Implications for Artists</b></p>\n<p>This obsession with numbers has practical consequences too. Venues and promoters\nincreasingly use Spotify stats to determine whether an artist is worth booking. They’ll\noften check monthly listener counts as part of their decision-making process. For many\nsmaller musicians, this makes Spotify an inescapable part of their career, even if they’d\nrather direct listeners to platforms like Bandcamp or Tidal, which pay far better\nroyalties.</p>\n<p>Spotify has us hooked, and they know it. Their dominance ensures that artists feel\ncompelled to drive traffic to the platform, even if it’s not in their best interest. I’m\nguilty of it myself. When I release a song, I post a Spotify link because I want those\nnumbers to climb. I resent doing it, but the ecosystem leaves me little choice.</p>\n<p><b>Why I’m Opting Out of Spotify Wrapped</b></p>\n<p>This brings me to Spotify Wrapped, the culmination of this numbers-driven culture. Every\nyear, artists and listeners alike are encouraged to share their stats as a badge of\nhonour. It’s become a normalised ritual, but it’s ultimately just another way Spotify\nreinforces the importance of these numbers.</p>\n<p>As an artist, I can see my stats anytime. They’re useful for marketing, understanding my\naudience, and planning my next moves. But making these numbers public doesn’t benefit\nme—or most artists. Unless you’re a massive name, your numbers will always pale in\ncomparison to someone else’s. It’s a game that smaller artists can’t win.</p>\n<p><b>A Call for Change</b></p>\n<p>Instead of feeding this toxic system, I propose we do better. Let’s stop amplifying\nSpotify’s advertising under the guise of Wrapped. Let’s question why we’re promoting a\nplatform that pays Joe Rogan hundreds of millions while underpaying independent artists.\nLet’s push for platforms that treat musicians more fairly and genuinely support discovery\nof new talent.</p>\n<p>I’m not suggesting that Spotify has no place in the music industry, but its current model\ndoesn’t serve smaller artists. Wrapped is a celebration of numbers, not music. So this\nyear, I’m choosing to step back. My voice may be small, but it’s one I’ll use to advocate\nfor something better—something that values artistry over algorithms.</p>\n<div class=\"substack-post-embed\"><p lang=\"en\">Spotify Wrapped by Dom Tristram</p><p>Why I wont be sharing my 'Spotify Wrapped'</p><a data-post-link=\"\" href=\"https://domtristrammusic.substack.com/p/spotify-wrapped\">Read on Substack</a></div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://substack.com/embedjs/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><em>To receive my new politics posts directly by email or in the Substack app,\nplease <a href=\"https://domtristrammusic.substack.com/\">subscribe</a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2024/12/10/spotify-wrapped.html\">Spotify Wrapped</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on December 10, 2024.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2024/11/06/trump2024-11-06T00:00:00+00:002024-11-06T00:00:00+00:00http://dominictristram.com<p>I set out today to discuss the Conservative Party leadership election here in the UK and\nthe implications of our new Tory leader. However, as events have unfolded across the\nAtlantic, my initial plan feels a bit trivial in light of the bigger picture. Like many,\nI presumed—perhaps naively—that the American election would head in a different direction.\nYet, here we are: Donald Trump has won.</p>\n<p>While the outcome of the Conservative leadership contest certainly holds significance\nwithin British politics, it pales in comparison to the potential ramifications of Trump’s\nreturn to power. The issues we face with certain Tory figures, however controversial or\ndisagreeable they may be, cannot compare to the scale of dismay surrounding Trump. Unlike\nConservative leaders, Trump openly denies climate change, has a history of convictions and\naccusations of sexual assault, and is embroiled in controversies ranging from mishandling\nstate secrets to even more shocking accusations. Despite any criticism one might level at\nKamala Harris or the American Democrats, the contrast in leadership styles and values\nbetween the two parties is stark.</p>\n<p>Certainly, I have my qualms with the American Democrats. They aren’t truly left-leaning,\nand their pro-Israel stance, particularly regarding the ongoing Gaza conflict, is far\nfrom something I align with. Nonetheless, whoever they put forward—whether it’s Biden, who\nmany argue is too old, or Harris, with her policy positions that I can’t support—is\nfundamentally better for democracy than someone with Trump’s record. Here is a man who\nopenly admits to behaviour many would find repulsive, has mused about using military force\nagainst his political opponents, and has even chosen a running mate who has questioned\nthe voting rights of childless women. It’s a surreal scenario, almost like something out\nof a dark political satire.</p>\n<p>When Trump lost the last election, he didn’t just concede quietly; he attempted a coup.\nThe images of him hoarding classified documents in his bathroom, allegedly sharing secrets\nwith foreign powers, paint an astonishingly grim picture. Meanwhile, figures like Elon\nMusk and other so-called ‘crypto bros’ are aligning themselves with Trump, seeing in him\nan easily manipulable figure who could serve their interests. It brings to mind the\noligarchs in 1990s Russia, only this time it’s in America, with the ultra-wealthy vying\nto consolidate power.</p>\n<p>Some might try to dismiss this outcome with the assurance that it’s only four years, and\npeople will see reason in time. Yet, America’s political landscape doesn’t work that way.\nThe politically appointed Supreme Court is already stacked in the Republicans’ favour, and\nwithin the next four years, Trump could appoint additional justices. This would likely\nsolidify a hard-right majority, capable of dismantling rights and protections long held\ndear by many Americans. Even if something were to happen to Trump, his influence would\nremain entrenched in the judiciary and the Senate for years, shaping policy far beyond\nhis own tenure.</p>\n<p>What’s particularly staggering is that this time, Trump might even have won the popular\nvote, a feat he didn’t achieve in his first election. It’s baffling to think that so many\ncould support a figure who openly disregards democratic principles and exhibits disdain\nfor so many groups within his own voter base—women, non-white citizens, and immigrants,\nto name a few. It’s enough to make Brexit seem like a minor hiccup in comparison.</p>\n<p>While I still hold the belief that people are generally decent, albeit sometimes misled,\ntoday has sorely tested that faith. Watching the outcome of this election unfold, I find\nmyself deeply concerned about what lies ahead. America’s leadership doesn’t only impact\nits own citizens but has a ripple effect on global issues—especially the climate crisis\nand conflicts in places like Ukraine.</p>\n<p>In any case, here we are on November 6th, faced with an unpredictable and turbulent path\nahead. Perhaps, when the dust settles, I’ll muster the energy to revisit the topic of the\nTory leadership. But for now—well, let’s just brace ourselves.</p>\n<div class=\"substack-post-embed\"><p lang=\"en\">Trump by Dom Tristram</p><p>Americans choose hate over hope</p><a data-post-link=\"\" href=\"https://domtristram.substack.com/p/trump\">Read on Substack</a></div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://substack.com/embedjs/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<p><em>To receive my new politics posts directly by email or in the Substack app,\nplease <a href=\"https://domtristram.substack.com/\">subscribe</a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2024/11/06/trump.html\">Trump</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on November 06, 2024.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2024/11/01/NHS-privatisation2024-11-01T00:00:00+00:002024-11-01T00:00:00+00:00http://dominictristram.com<p>A Letter to the Bath Chronicle printed in the paper on 24th October 2024</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../assets/img/2016/2016_junior_doctors_strike.JPG\" /></p>\n<p>Throughout my time ‘in politics’ and as the Green Party candidate for Bath’s MP in\nmultiple elections I have campaigned for a publicly owned and operated NHS, and against\nprivatisation.</p>\n<p>The Green Party is the only party with this policy.

For\nGreens, it is a fundamental principle that the NHS should be run for people, not profit.\nThis is a view shared by the majority of the public.</p>\n<p>Yours faithfully,</p>\n<p>Dom Tristram,</p>\n<p>2024 Green Party MP candidate for Bath</p>\n<p><em>To receive my new politics posts directly by email or in the Substack app,\nplease <a href=\"https://domtristram.substack.com/\">subscribe</a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2024/11/01/NHS-privatisation.html\">NHS Privatisation in Bath and NE Somerset</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on November 01, 2024.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2024/06/06/close-of-nominations2024-06-06T00:00:00+01:002024-06-06T00:00:00+01:00http://dominictristram.com<p>Even those with little interest in politics couldn’t help but notice the general election\ncampaign since the date was announced. The relatively short amount of time all of the\nparties have (although it might not feel that way to those on the receiving end) means\nthat a lot of ‘stuff’ has to fit into six weeks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../assets/img/2024/edmund_dom.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p>This has pros and cons as a candidate. My immediate advantage over some of the others is\nthat I was selected absolutely ages ago, back in 2022 I think, so my local party hasn’t\nhad to scramble around with a rushed selection process.</p>\n<p>The Green Party nationally has actually been much more ‘on the ball’ than most others in\nthis regard. A few days after the election was announced we already had the second largest\nnumber of candidates selected - more than the Tories and Lib Dems.</p>\n<p>The Tories being caught on the back foot by the announcement might come as a surprise to\nmany people. “Surely they would have been briefed that an election was coming before the\ngeneral public were?”, you might think. This very much appears not to be the case, and by\nall accounts there were many local Conservative ‘associations’ rather annoyed about not\nknowing the date in advance.</p>\n<p>So here we are, one day away from the deadline for nominations and some candidates are\nprobably not quite confirmed yet. This means that despite all of the media noise you might\nnot actually get to vote for someone you expected to.

My Green colleague in the photo, Edmund Cannon, will also definitely be\non the ballot for North East Somerset and Hanham (where Rees-Mogg is standing).</p>\n<p>Labour, the Tories, the Lib Dems and Reform have also announced candidates for Bath, but\nuntil the council publishes the statement of persons nominated and notice of poll tomorrow\nwe won’t know for sure who is definitely going to be an option for voters.</p>\n<p>A great result for me, although admittedly unlikely, would be if everyone else is late or\nhas messed-up their forms and I am the only candidate, thus winning by default.

The assumption was that the government would hold an election in the autumn, and this was based on the almost universal prediction that they know they will lose and want to retain power for as long as possible. If nothing else they could have hoped that Labour would suffer some sort of disaster or appalling gaff and played for time.</p>\n<p>However, here we are - in six weeks the nation will go to the polls.</p>\n<p>It would take a brave commentator, even in the Tory press, to publicly state that the Tories will win. They almost certainly will not. The only real question is how badly they will lose and how large the Labour majority will be (if indeed they achieve a majority).</p>\n<p>I’m not going to pretend that the Greens are going to form the next government, but I do think that the best possible outcome of the election is a Labour minority government that depends on the support of other progressive parties such as the Greens to stay in power. This isn’t just because I want power for the sake of it, but because while a Labour majority government will almost certainly be better than a Tory one, it is still a poor outcome for the country.</p>\n<p>Over the coming weeks I will discuss why this is. I’ll also talk about national issues, policy, the situation in Bath where I am standing, and anything else that you might want to hear about! Please let me know if there’s any subject you want me to cover.</p>\n<p>In the meantime I’d like to finish by saying that I very much look forward to giving the people of Bath the choice of a fairer, greener country and the chance to vote for real change.

Now of course the Tories have never really cared about the climate or the environment if it means spending money. I mean, that’s true, even though they have done some environmental things, and there are Tories who are greener than other Tories, and credit where it’s due, uh, people like Zach Goldsmith and even Boris Johnson have said some sensible things about climate and environment.</p>\n<p>I’ll give them that. I mean, I don’t agree with them in many ways, but they have said at least one or two sensible things, like maybe we should care about the climate, and maybe we should do something about it, and maybe we should get people out of their cars a bit, and maybe we should invest in public transport, and bikes in London, all these things.</p>\n<p>There are, and there have been, Tories in the past who have made some very small gestures towards , climate and responsibility of the environment. But now what’s happening? Now the Tories, having realised they’re going to lose the election because they’ve been appalling for the last 15 years or so, have decided that the environment is going to be something they weaponize, something they’re going to make, uh, aligned to left and right.</p>\n<p>Like in America, where if you’re on the left, you care about the climate, and if you’re on the right, you hate the climate. This is what the Americans have managed to do, so everything becomes divisive, and anyone on either side who suggests anything to do with helping the environment gets labelled as some sort of lefty.</p>\n<p>In this country, we’ve largely avoided that up until relatively recently. There was consensus that we needed to do something about net zero, and people argued about the speed we needed to do it, but it was generally accepted. For example, Boris Johnson, um, who I do not give much credit to, but he was fairly fundamental to expanding the, um, emissions zone in London, which now, um, Sadiq Khan’s getting all the grief about from Tory activists.</p>\n<p>That was Boris Johnson that pushed it. So let’s not forget. that the Tories have not traditionally been entirely bad when it comes to climate. But now they’ve decided they’re going to make it a divisive issue. So we get this ridiculous sort of stuff coming out of our Prime Minister saying we’re going to stop these things that actually aren’t happening.</p>\n<p>Because don’t get me wrong, these things here aren’t happening. at the moment. This tweet makes absolutely no sense at all. It’s entirely designed to anger people on the right, make them think that there is some sort of cabal of people who care about the climate who are somehow left wing and are making you do these things.</p>\n<p>These things are not true, okay? We are stopping. No, they’re not stopping anything because these things… aren’t happening. Now, there is small taxes on flights, of course, but that’s, they’re not going to stop those. They’re talking about some sort of mythical thing, some mythical tax that’s going to discourage you from flying, not what’s actually happening now, because they’re not talking about getting rid of that.</p>\n<p>So taxes on eating meat, you know, these are purely designed to be divisive. Now, of course, Let’s not forget the Tories are now talking about pushing back on our obligations to stop the sale of new diesel and petrol cars and gas boilers. And they’re pitching this as some sort of, oh, it’s unfair on the poor people who can’t afford new electric cars.</p>\n<p>Right, let’s be very clear. The poor, or I should say people with less money, are not thinking about buying brand new cars, full stop. They’re not. I mean, it’s ridiculous. It’s a made up thing that’s meant to make us feel, oh, the Tories are on the side of the working man. The Tories have never, and will never, be on the side of the working man or people who aren’t rich.</p>\n<p>They are not. The sale of new cars only affects… the wealthier people. You might want a cheaper new car, I don’t blame you, but if you are buying a new car, you’re not poor, okay? So let’s get away from this divisive politics. Let’s talk about the things that need to be talked about when it comes to the climate.</p>\n<p>We do need to accelerate where we are, route to net zero. 2050 is too late, 2030s. Too late. Everything’s too late. Today is the time to do it and the, you know, the next best day is tomorrow. So we need to accelerate these things and we can do it in a way that doesn’t disadvantage the people with less money.</p>\n<p>Let’s remember there’s more millionaires in this country than there’s ever been. They pay very little tax. Let’s get them to subsidize. Expensive insulation upgrades is on this list. What do you think that means? That means people living in rent and accommodation are going to have to pay more for energy.</p>\n<p>They don’t care about people without much money who are cold. They’re caring there about landlords. You know, it’s the messaging is all, , we’re helping people with less money. No, you only care about the rich. You’ve only ever cared about the rich. Don’t try and weaponize the climate to try and get people who aren’t rich on your side.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2023/09/21/politicising-climate.html\">Politicising Climate - Part of the 'Populist Playbook'</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on September 21, 2023.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2023/09/11/dangerous-dogs2023-09-11T00:00:00+01:002023-09-11T00:00:00+01:00http://dominictristram.com<p>As the media concentrates on yet another attack by a dog breed intended to be agressive, what can be done about the problem to tackle it permanently?</p>\n<!--<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram/video/7237410401359645979\" data-video-id=\"7237410401359645979\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" > <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@dominictristram\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram?refer=embed\">@dominictristram</a> <p>Record Migration Figures</p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-Dom-Tristram-7237410319471364890?refer=embed\">♬ original sound - Dom Tristram</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script>-->\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram/video/7277546289246522657\" data-video-id=\"7277546289246522657\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@dominictristram\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram?refer=embed\">@dominictristram</a> Should we ban <a title=\"bullyxl\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bullyxl?refer=embed\">#bullyxl</a> <a title=\"dogs?\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dogs%3F?refer=embed\">#dogs?</a> Yes, almost certainly.

Now, there’s a very simple solution to a lot of the problem we have with dogs, in my mind: all dogs, literally every dog, should be licensed. Also if you have any kind of conviction for cruelty or irrresponsiblity keeping a dog, then you are banned from keeping any more dogs for life.</p>\n<p>That’s it - end of. Minimum. After all, a pet is a responsibility, not a right. If you prove yourself cruel or irresponsible then why should you be allowed any more dogs? So that’s just off the bat - no dogs if you’re found cruel or irresponsible. Dog licensing was previously only used as a slight revenue generator in the past when we had dog licenses, but now with today’s technology we have a much better scope for using it to ensure that dogs are well treated and that owners are responsible.</p>\n<p>Dogs are already microchipped, or should be. A licensing scheme can tie that microchip to the license. A vet could demand to see your license every time you take your dog in. If you buy or sell any dog, you should demand to see licenses. People might say “Oh, well, there’ll be a black market, people won’t bother with them.”</p>\n<p>And sure enough, when we had dog licenses it is estimated that about half the people with dogs didn’t have one. But technology has moved on and that’s not a good argument for not doing it again.</p>\n<p>In my mind, in a world where people are regularly bitten by dogs there’s no excuse for not trying to do something about it. You can’t just shrug, and you can’t say equally, “Oh, but my freedom! Why shouldn’t I be allowed an enormous fighting dog?” Because why should you have one?</p>\n<p>We should just use statistics. Look at all breeds, and if more than a certain percentage of dog attacks are by this particular breed, put restrictions on it. Start with just making sure that they are muzzled (ie it’s a legal requirement to muzzle them in public). If that doesn’t work then look at stronger measures. But there’s no point just sort of shrugging our shoulders and going “what can we do?”</p>\n<p>At the moment Suella Breverman’s looking at banning ‘bully XL’ dogs. We’ll see where that goes. But let’s say she does. There’ll be another dog. There’ll be another large fighting dog that the sort of people who buy these things go for, so the only solution is to look over all dog breeds and come up with some sort of automatic ‘if X many attacks happen, then this is considered a dangerous dog’ calculation. Muzzle them by default and then ban them if it goes beyond a sudden higher percentage than that.</p>\n<p>I’ve got a dog. I love dogs. I love pets, but I’m not the sort of person who wants to buy a dog to look tough, a dog that looks dangerous. I think there is a certain psychology behind those people that we, as a country, shouldn’t really endorse or support. So sure, look dangerous if you want, but make sure that dog’s wearing a muzzle. And be ready to accept severe penalties if you willingly circumvent these attempts to keep your dog safe.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2023/09/11/dangerous-dogs.html\">Dangerous Dogs</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on September 11, 2023.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2023/05/26/record-migration-figures2023-05-26T00:00:00+01:002023-05-26T00:00:00+01:00http://dominictristram.com<p>A number of peaceful protestors were arrested at the Coronation.

I think it’s worth just dwelling on the fact that many of the people who voted for Brexit did so because they didn’t like the idea of migration and how they must be feeling now because we’ve gone from lower numbers of people coming in and let’s face it, not liking migration is often, not always, but often due to racism, you know?</p>\n<p>People who don’t come from here coming in. And so these brexiters, now these, people who voted sometimes with a racist motive against staying in EU because they didn’t like migration, now have far more immigrants. But, those immigrants are now much less likely to be other white Europeans and much more likely to be people from other countries of different races. Now, how do you think they feel about that?</p>\n<p>I think if there is a silver lining from Brexit, and I don’t think there is particularly, but if there was one, it might be just imagining how many extremely annoyed racists there are at the moment.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2023/05/26/record-migration-figures.html\">Record Migration Figures</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on May 26, 2023.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2023/05/09/coronation-protest-arrests2023-05-09T00:00:00+01:002023-05-09T00:00:00+01:00http://dominictristram.com<p>A number of peaceful protestors were arrested at the Coronation.

Some pro-republican protestors were arrested and moved on and they’ve all been released without charge.</p>\n<p>But I think what this really shines a light on is just how insidious the anti protest legislation is that , this government’s bought in. Now, I’m fundamentally opposed to criminalizing any peaceful protest, but the excuse they gave, which did win some people over, was that there are too many disruptive people sitting in roads and locking themselves onto things and being difficult to remove, and that was a massive inconvenience. And that’s what they pitched as , the reason why they wanted to bring this legislation in. But of course, what’s happened, as always happens when you give the police these powers, is that they’ve used these to, , effectively stop people protesting the coronation.</p>\n<p>Now they had placards, there was no evidence they wanted anything more disruptive than holding placards, . They’d actually asked the police for permission to have the protest and were given the permission and yet they were arrested and carted away. And people say, oh yeah, but it’s fine because they were released without charge. And you know what? They were but their right to protest was effectively removed because they were being held during that time and being arrested isn’t fun. But, apart from anything else, t he government don’t even really need to criminalize the actual act of protest by charging people. If they can just arrest them and then release ‘em without charge - gets around some of the awkwardness of having to go to court to prove anything, doesn’t it? But because police can arrest people for these, I’m not going to say crimes, can arrest people for having disruptive protests, they do. Now, this is obviously being used to silence an inconvenient protest that doesn’t actually break any of the laws that the Tories have brought in, but somewhat more worryingly, even if you don’t agree with the republicans, it was used to arrest community volunteers handing out rape alarms.</p>\n<p>Now these were community volunteers working with the local borough, handing out rape alarms, which, the police claimed, could have been used to startle the horses. Or something. Now they weren’t, obviously, and there’s no evidence that they were being planned to be used that way. So it doesn’t help those people who got arrested, people who are doing good work.</p>\n<p>It’s just the slippery slope into authoritarianism. Everyone always denies it. “These Just Stop oil protests are disruptive. It’s only those we want to stop”. As soon as you give the police the powers to stop a protest, they will. They’ll stop pretty much any protest. And we see this repeatedly whenever more power is granted.</p>\n<p>It’s always used to the fullest extent, even if that’s not actually even what the government wanted. But of course, the government did want this. It’s like the laws stopping single person protests in Parliament Square, which were literally brought in just to stop one man having his anti-Brexit protest. And of course, now the police have any power they like to stop any single person protests. If you are standing outside Parliament demanding action for, let’s say somebody who’s wrongfully deported and then was killed abroad or something awful, you wouldn’t be allowed to do that anymore because the government had some vindictive reason to bring that legislation in because it was inconvenient for them to be reminded how inept Brexit was.</p>\n<p>Now we should all care because even if you don’t agree with a particular protest against this government, whether it’s because you agree with the government or because you disagree with the protest, if you then agree with legislation to ban protests one day, that power will inevitably be used against you in protest you agree with, because there will be a different government that’s doing things you don’t like.</p>\n<p>Or it’ll be a protest against something that you want to protest. This was seen to some extent by the Countryside Alliance march. Now, I don’t agree with the pro-hunting position of the Countryside Alliance at all, but the people who were on that march getting bashed on the head by policemen were exactly the sort of people who would’ve supported those actions against most protestors. Largely. I’m generalizing, but a lot of those people on that march would’ve been exactly the sort of people who would typically approve of such measures, giving the police those powers.</p>\n<p>So this is what happens. You support something because you disagree with the protestors. In that case, lo and behold, it’s used against you. So always stand up for the civil liberties we have in this country traditionally, which are being eroded by this government.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s the right to asylum, the right to protest, these things are fundamental and you have to stand up for them, even for people you disagree with.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2023/05/09/coronation-protest-arrests.html\">Coronation Protest Arrests</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on May 09, 2023.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2023/05/05/the-results-are-in2023-05-05T00:00:00+01:002023-05-05T00:00:00+01:00http://dominictristram.com<p>The results are in, and the Greens and Tories have the same number of councillors in Bath and NE Somerset.

I’m feeling pretty tired because I was at the count last night and, um, haven’t slept. But yeah, we’ve got three councillors in Bath and Northeast Sunset, which is brilliant. Thank you, everyone who voted. Three councillors is tripling what we had before. It gives us the same number of councillors as the conservatives.</p>\n<p>And just to put that in some sort of perspective, the conservatives ran the council until 2019. Things can change very quickly. The conservative nationally have done appallingly, of course, but at a local level the Conservatives chose to make their entire campaign based around opposing efforts to reduce traffic.</p>\n<p>Anti-anything, to promote active travel and safer streets. So they put all their eggs in one basket and it didn’t pay off because the trouble with the bubble that Tories seem to live in is that they hear a lot about how it’s really terrible that people are trying to make the city livable without using a car. And actually, as was proven in the last local elections when all of the parties, including the Tories, had dealing with traffic in their manifestos and this election where all the parties except the Tories had it in their manifestos again… and lo and behold, the Tories have lost seven seats.</p>\n<p>So they’re down to the same as the Greens, though obviously the Greens are on their way up, Tories on the way down. So that’s kind of interesting. The Lib Dems obviously still have a huge majority and even more huge majority now. Labour are now the official opposition in the council, so interesting times. So yeah, always worth voting in local elections, . The Tories telling people all the way through that it’s them all the lib dems and actually hardly anyone voted Tory really compared to what they expected.</p>\n<p>So a good thing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2023/05/05/the-results-are-in.html\">Local Elections - The Votes Are In!</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on May 05, 2023.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2023/05/04/vote-today2023-05-04T00:00:00+01:002023-05-04T00:00:00+01:00http://dominictristram.com<p>Many (including me) have local elections today.

A lot of people think there’s not much point voting. What can a local council do? But actually a local council can do a lot of things, budgets for education and social care, .</p>\n<p>They can obviously do things to reduce pollution and reduce, , traffic or pedestrianize areas, all sorts of things that improve your quality of life. It’s worth voting in local elections because this is really the main opportunity. You have to choose a representative who you believe in. Local elections generally have low turnouts, which means that if you are fairly determined, you and some like-minded friends can get a councillor who you agree with.</p>\n<p>So you’ll get a lot of stuff from the big parties at general Elections saying only vote for the big parties. What’s the point of voting for a small one? Well, they can’t use that excuse at local elections. I’ll give you an example. I’ve just come back from my polling station it was about 1:00 PM.</p>\n<p>And so far today, in the whole day, they’ve had 53 votes. So if you and some like-minded friends, and it doesn’t have to be many, if you decide you’re all gonna vote, you can basically swing that whole result. Now, of course, that number will go up by the end of the day, but not by much. And you’re talking about people winning council seats on four or 500 votes sometimes.</p>\n<p>And where I live in Bath and Northeast Somerset we, T he Green Party, have lost out on council seats by as few as seven or eight votes on a few occasions. It’s always worth voting because your vote and the vote to your friends or family can just swing the whole result.</p>\n<p>Don’t believe people who tell you the greens can’t win . Don’t believe people who tell you your vote won’t make a difference. Because actually with such small margins, you can go from a ward where a party hasn’t even stood before to that party winning, and that does happen.</p>\n<p>You can get these surprise results and it’s because a lot of the time the big parties don’t even bother campaigning in what they consider safe ward. So go and vote. Maybe you’ll cause some surprises. A green councillor will always work in your best interests. So if you really want social and environmental justice, the Green Party isn’t the sort of party where people join because they know they’ll get elected and they can sit there comfortably doing, nothing.</p>\n<p>They join because they really want to help, really want to help their communities. So you’ve got a choice today. You can go make an active choice to elect people who really want to help out, really want to make your world better, or you can make a choice for more of the same.</p>\n<p>And believe me, not voting is the vote for more of the same. Please don’t do it. Please use your vote.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2023/05/04/vote-today.html\">Local Elections - Vote Today!</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on May 04, 2023.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2023/02/23/15-minute-cities2023-02-23T00:00:00+00:002023-02-23T00:00:00+00:00http://dominictristram.com<p>Why have the Right suddenly started attacking plans to create cities where people live close to essential services?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram/video/7203361531470286086\" data-video-id=\"7203361531470286086\" style=\"max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@dominictristram\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram?refer=embed\">@dominictristram</a> <p>15 Minute Cities and Conspiracy Theories</p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7203361583496448773?refer=embed\">♬ original sound - Dom Tristram</a> </section> </blockquote>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"></script>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram/video/7203361531470286086\">[Watch on TikTok]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/mWp19NZuST8/\">[Watch on YouTube]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generated transcript:</p>\n<p>So on Tuesday evening, 21st of February, , there was a protest outside the Guildhall in Bath against cuts to subsidised bus routes. A lot of Northeast Somerset is fairly remote from Bath, but people need to go in for hospitals and that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>And a lot of them depend on the bus service, especially if they don’t have cars. And the council has decided to basically cut all of those, and keep all the ones in Bath itself. Now, within Bath, it’s a small city. You can pretty much walk everywhere. You might not like it, but you can.</p>\n<p>Whereas if you live in some of the smaller villages in Northeast Somerset, you can’t. So it’s basically cutting off people’s lifelines. Definitely non drivers. So it’s a valid thing , to protest about, so a protest was organised for that outside the Guild Hall, which coincided with the evening of the full council meeting.</p>\n<p>Now, unfortunately, this was slightly hijacked by anti 15 minute City protestors. And that brings me really onto my main point for this video, which is, 15 minute cities and the strange and very sudden campaign by the right to attack them . Now, in case you’re not aware, the 15 Minute City concept basically says that everyone who lives in a city or I guess large town, should have all of the services they need for day-to-day life within 15 minutes of where they live, by walking or cycling.</p>\n<p>So , shops, schools, doctor’s surgery, dentist, that sort of thing. Pretty much what life used to be like, now this is, , brought some very odd people outta the woodwork. Looking at some of the protestors on Tuesday. You saw people with very much coordinated placards saying something like democracy now, it’s some sort of coordinated anti 15 minute movement and it’s suddenly been whipped up by the sort of people who went on anti-vax protests and, rather than anything rational.</p>\n<p>It’s about some imagined kind of ‘locking them down’ in to where they’d live somehow. And then that’s mixed with a healthy dose of antisemitism. Bear in mind anything about George Soros is basically antisemitism. They’re just saying Jews, it’s another word for Jews.</p>\n<p>It’s the usual kind of hard right conspiracy theory nonsense that we’re getting more and more in everyday life now. And I guess it has always been bubbling under the surface, but the difference now is there’s actually been Tory MPs standing up in parliament saying the same sort of stuff, that this is some sort of great conspiracy to get people to, I don’t know, what - stay at home?</p>\n<p>I dunno, who would benefit from that conspiracy of giving you shops and schools close to where you live, but apparently it’s communists or something. And then there’s all sorts of other things woven into it, like s ome sort of United Nations programme?. The more you dig into conspiracy theories and the madness around them, the more you just can’t really believe that anyone with any kind of sense of logic or intelligence could ever fall for them. It’s like the anti-vaxxers. You might have valid reasons to be concerned about any medicine. Of course you might. But when people start talking about Bill Gates putting microchips in vaccines, it’s so immediately obviously rubbish that you’re amazed that so many people somehow buy into it and it’s no surprise that you see anti-vaxxers are now largely the same people protesting against 15 minute cities - protesting against something that entirely and utterly is meant to help them and improve their lives, and they somehow think that’s some sort of attack on them. I’ve said to them, what don’t you like about the, , ability to live somewhere where you can access services?</p>\n<p>And I’ve had one guy say to me, “I prefer driving. I like my car. I don’t want things to be close to where I live”. And when you’re dealing with that kind of logic,</p>\n<p>It’s gone beyond debate. People say to you, oh, you shouldn’t dismiss people with these concerns you should listen to their viewpoints. But at what point do we say as a society and certainly as someone in politics, it’s not something I want to listen to because it’s so clearly nonsense.</p>\n<p>Why should I waste my time? Talking to somebody who thinks George Soros wants you not to drive to the shops, why? Why? Why is that something that I should even contemplate debating as if it’s a valid viewpoint and when you’ve got Tory mps. And I have to say, it’s not just mps, but the local Conservatives in Bath are happy to go to these protests like them on social media, spread them, encourage them.</p>\n<p>I don’t believe the local Tories believe this for one second. But again, they’re weaponizing people who are easily led. They’re weaponizing conspiracy theories, just like Trump did. Of course, Trump didn’t believe that Hillary Clinton was running a paedophile ring from Pizza Express or whatever it was.</p>\n<p>Trump might be a bit of a fool, but he’s not. Entirely a fool. He’s calculating and he knows how to run an army of fools for his benefit. And it’s the same here. Local Tories want you to forget what they do as a party and what they do nationally as a party, , they try and distance themselves locally.</p>\n<p>But ultimately when everything is going so wrong, it suits them. Instead of people being on the street saying, “why is it taking eight hours for an ambulance to arrive?” If there’s people on the streets instead saying, “we don’t want this thing that will help us. And here’s this mad conspiracy theory” . If they’re on the street, saying that they’re not actually protesting about something that Tories have done.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2023/02/23/15-minute-cities.html\">15 Minute Cities and Conspiracy Theories</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on February 23, 2023.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2022/12/15/asylum-seeker-drownings2022-12-15T00:00:00+00:002022-12-15T00:00:00+00:00http://dominictristram.com<p>I don’t want to hear false sympathy from this government - I want them to accept responsibility.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram/video/7177311106455702789\">[Watch on TikTok]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CmLy4b6MsGh/\">[Watch in Instagram]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Generated transcript:</p>\n<p>Hey, how you doing? It’s minus six out here today, so I’m gonna keep this brief, but I just wanted to say that if you don’t enable asylum seekers who have a legal right to claim asylum in this country, if you don’t give them a safe passage, so they’re forced to do things like use people’s smugglers and get in the back of lorries and cross the Channel in small boats, then you can’t really claim any kind of sadness when they drown in the Channel because it’s your fault. I want to be absolutely clear here.

The ask how one could you say such a thing? It’s\nunprofessional. You should never let people’s politics get in the way of\nhow you feel about them. The language is uncalled for and all that sort\nof stuff. But it’s not exactly a controversial viewpoint when I say\ngood on her, because actually if somebody holds those views and makes it their business\nto enforce those views on the people, it’s justified. For example the Conservatives\ntoday have blocked some of the very\nfew good things that Michael Gove pushed for when he was in a position\nof power in their party. So they’re getting rid of the ban on no fault evictions\nand lots of protections that were going to be\nbought in for renters.</p>\n<p>Now, it’s pretty rare that the Tories do something for people who don’t have as much and\nhave fewer advantages in\nlife. So for the Tories to then shelve those few things (which were\nmanifesto commitments, let’s remember) is appalling. So there’s a PM with no\nmandate doing things with no mandate and getting rid of the things they\nactually were voted in to do by some people, eg actually had a mandate for.</p>\n<p>I mean, that’s pretty detestable, isn’t it? It makes a mockery of\ndemocracy for one thing. But there’s no reason to stop a\nban on no fault evictions other than potentially pressure from landlords\nand people with money.</p>\n<p>It’s taking something that some of the cherished ‘red wall’ voters that they have who got\nthem into power. That’s the sort\nof policy that would appeal to them. And so some of them voted Conservative\nand now we see that all of the things that could\nhave conceivably helped people with less money have all been stripped\nout.</p>\n<p>And now it’s all become about helping people with money. Even long term\nvoters are beginning to realize that this is a party that’s been taken\nover by the hard right. There’s no ‘One Nation Conservatives’ left in a\nposition of responsibility in the party.</p>\n<p>The Tory party of old that could have commanded respect (in some ways) from me and\npeople like me is gone. It’s all about enriching the already rich, and\nit is despicable. It’s a body where if people actively support it at this point\nthey’re worthy of contempt and they’re worthy of criticism because they are\nbasically trying to make other people’s lives worse, and it’s all just\nfor them. If it doesn’t make a profit then these people don’t count, and that’s\nnot a viewpoint that is worthy of respect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2022/10/11/despising-tories.html\">On Despising What Tories Stand For</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on October 11, 2022.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2022/10/10/solar-farms2022-10-10T00:00:00+01:002022-10-10T00:00:00+01:00http://dominictristram.com<p>As the Tories announce a ban on new solar farms on agricultural land, we need to wonder\nwhy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/dom-tristrams-soapbox/id1377617516\">[Listen on Apple Podcasts]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1bFtKvUOvyLyawtE0TtHad?si=73e50970a285440b\">[Watch/listen on Spotify]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram/video/7152920725769161989\">[Watch on TikTok]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CjijQ2YskPx/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">[Watch in Instagram]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/LulAbd_A-A8\">[Watch on YouTube]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Transcript:</p>\n<p>Well here we are in a lovely sunny day in October and the sun has\nrather reminded me of a story I heard today or yesterday that the\ngovernment is seeking to ban solar farms on farmland or installing\nsolar panels on farmland, with the excuse being that we should be\nprioritizing food production now.</p>\n<p>There’s a couple of things about this. One is that at the same time they’re pushing to\nreopen and licence more North sea oil and gas exploration. Stopping solar\nand trying to encourage gas in a time of climate emergency is pretty stupid. But that aside,\nyou have to remember why solar farms are appearing on farmland. There’s two things. One, you can\nactually farm underneath them. If you have certain crops or maybe\npoultry and other livestock, you can put them under soda panels. That’s\nfine. You can have dual use in a lot of these fields, so it’s absolutely\nefficient as a way of using the space.</p>\n<p>That’s the first thing. So it’s not wasting space that for agriculture,\nit’s getting extra use out of space that would’ve had less use, and that’s an important\npoint. Another thing is why farmers are leasing their land, or sometimes doing this\nthemselves, for solar?</p>\n<p>Well, it’s because they can’t make the money on the agriculture because\nfood is undervalued. Even though food prices are going up, they still\ndon’t get paid enough to cover the cost of production, or the\nland is generally not suitable for the sort of agriculture that would\nmake the money. So why not, they think, make some money from renewables\nand let’s face it, the country could do with the energy.</p>\n<p>So why is the government saying that\nthey can’t do that? Well, from broad perspective, placing solar panels\non agricultural land doesn’t make sense. We should be putting them on\nland that’s otherwise used for buildings, for example, on roofs.</p>\n<p>That would be the most sensible place to put them. But the government’s\nnot doing that, is it? It’s not mandating solar panels on roofs for new\nbuildings or existing buildings. It’s largely ignoring the fact\nthat we’ve got all this space we could be generating energy from, and\nit’s up to private individuals whether they do or not, and of course of\nthere is a cost to that.</p>\n<p>But the government is not encouraging anyone to do it. In fact,\nit’s discouraging people from doing it by scrapping FIT payments. So\nfarmers are choosing to do this because they’re not getting the money from the\nagriculture that they could be running on that land. The main reason\nthey’re not getting the money is because of Brexit.</p>\n<p>It’s now much\nharder for people to make money to cover the cost of production from farming\nbecause of the friction that has been introduced into selling our goods\nto our main customer, which is obviously also our closest customer, the EU - both Ireland\nand the rest of Europe. That’s now much\nharder, much more costly for farmers to do. What were already pretty tight margins are\nmuch tighter, so a lot of farmers have either decided to stop producing certain products,\nor in fact not be farmers at all any more, and others are\ndiversifying. Now, whether that’s camp sites or solar farms or anything\nelse like that, these are all way farmers can make money from their land\nwhen the land is not paying for itself with agriculture.</p>\n<p>Now we’ve seen also\nat the same time, if you remember, the government rolled back on their\ncommitment to pay farmers for stewardship when Brexit happened. There\nwas talk of ending subsidies for just growing loads of food we don’t\nneed and pay farmers for looking after land. While you may not have noticed, that’s all\nbeen rolled back, There was\nsome optimistic talk about it, and lots of farmers even applied for some\nof these grants, but they’ve all been shelled for the indefinite future.\nSo what are farmers going to do? You tell them they can’t set up solar\nfarms, they’re going to have to do something else.</p>\n<p>What? What could that something else be? I can tell you what it wouldn’t\nbe - it wouldn’t be as useful for getting us out of the energy crisis\nbecause ultimately we need more renewable generation in this country.\nAnd if farmers are the people willing to allow their land to do it, and\nthe consumers with roofs and the money to buy panels aren’t doing it,\nlet the farmers do it and get us out of a hole. By stopping them you’re just going to\nincrease reliance on gas and increase energy prices, which isn’t going to help anyone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2022/10/10/solar-farms.html\">Ban On Solar On Agricultural Land</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on October 10, 2022.</p>http://dominictristram.com/2022/10/03/spending-cuts2022-10-03T00:00:00+01:002022-10-03T00:00:00+01:00http://dominictristram.com<p>As the Tories announce another £18bn in spending cuts, I look at their continuing war on\neveryone except the super-rich, and how this doesn’t just hurt the poorest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/dom-tristrams-soapbox/id1377617516?i=1000581405344\">[Listen on Apple Podcasts]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3lNUCPt6ndOYg7scLwVJMa?si=3e7d761e258c4089\">[Listen on Spotify]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dominictristram/video/7150277845070122245?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7145121764765419013\">[Watch on TikTok]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/CjQOMQosecd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">[Watch in Instagram]</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/zwvdE5oi82o\">[Watch on YouTube]</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Transcript:</p>\n<p>Well, I can’t really tell you how angry I am right now. Today we’ve had\nthe news that the Chancellor has rolled back his 45p income tax band\nscrapping. That’s not a victory. I mean, it’s a sort of victory, but in\nthe overall scheme of what’s happening it almost doesn’t matter. The\ncosts to the country of bailing out the markets and buying government\nbonds and stuff after the disastrous mini budget the other day is 65\nbillion pounds, 65 billion pounds that obviously we are all going to pay\nfor in one way or another.</p>\n<p>And that’s ignoring the upcoming cost of living crisis, or in fact\nongoing. But it’s going to get worse. Well, what’s really infuriated me\ntoday is that they’ve just announced 18 billion in public sector cuts.\nNow these are real terms cuts because what they’re doing is basically\nnot changing any funding based on the massively higher than expected\nrate of inflation.</p>\n<p>So what that means is hospitals and schools and all these other things\nwe all need - not just that, but every public service. Everything that\nthe government does for us and for anyone else, it’s all going to have the\nsame money that it would’ve got if inflation stuck at a rational sort of\nsensible amount, which wasn’t enough in the first place as anyone who\nhas to wait 10 hours for an ambulance can tell you, or anyone who has to\nwait weeks to see a GP or anything, any kind of public service and even\njust dealing with, getting your driving license or your passport or\nanything else. All of these things are public services. They don’t just\naffect the poor. We’re not talking about benefits here. Not that\nattacking benefits is a good thing in any way, but these affect\neveryone, rich or poor.</p>\n<p>Public services are vital for everyone. Now, of course, if you are very,\nvery rich, you can get your way around them. With private healthcare or\nprivate schooling or whatever, but they’ll affect everyone else. And 18\nbillion so far has a cut. So what’s that mean? That means that schools\nthat can’t really afford to get TAs or extra teachers or refurbished\nleaking classrooms will have even less money to do those things.</p>\n<p>The obvious conclusion to that is that they’re going to have to sack\npeople, hospitals who can’t afford to get bank staff into do operations\nor run clinics. What are they going to do? The obvious answer is they’re\ngoing to treat fewer people but they’re going to have to get that money\nsomehow.</p>\n<p>This isn’t money that is spare. This is money that’s not there right\nnow. Public services have been crumbling for 10 years and this isn’t\njust rhetoric. I mean, we’ve gone from, as I’ve said in a previous\nrecording, we’ve gone from a point in 2010 where the NHS was reaching\nthe lowest waiting times in its history.</p>\n<p>Satisfaction was all time high. People forget that was just before the\nTories got. What’s changed since then? Yes, it’s been coronavirus, but\nnot till 10 years after the toys got in and the services have been\ndegrading all that time. And what’s going to happen now, Now they’ve got\neven less money. This is a massive real terms cut and there’s no plans\nto change that a government’s so insistent on doubling down.</p>\n<p>It’s a gender for just transferring wealth from all of us. To the super\nrich. It’s not going to change. It changed the 45 P tax rate because even\nthe people who benefited from that cut actually said it’s ridiculous. So\nyeah, that was a relatively cost free, although made them look\nridiculous. Cost free thing for the toys to do.</p>\n<p>But this, this, don’t ever think this is anything except the war against\nordinary people. Not just the poor, ordinary people, poor middle class,\n, people who might consider that. They’ve done quite. We’re all going to\npay and all of this money is going to go to the super rich it’s gotta end\nbecause this is literally going to kill people. People not going to\nhospital or their doctors in time. It’s already killing people. It’s\ngoing get worse. People who don’t get the care they need, when they have\nissues, psychological issues or mental health issues, is going to get\nworse.</p>\n<p>Schools are going to get worse. There’ll be larger class sizes. There even\nfewer teachers. It’s just going to be an absolute nightmare. And as sooner\nthese disaster capitalists are booted out, the better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dominictristram.com/2022/10/03/spending-cuts.html\">£18bn Spending Cut Announced</a> was originally published by at <a href=\"http://dominictristram.com\">Dom Tristram</a> on October 03, 2022.</p>",

What about the UK? Though smaller, Bath enjoys qualities that are the envy of many other cities, a thriving cultural scene, a high proportion of independent shops, outstanding green space, world class heritage and a compact walkable centre, but is there room for improvement? Organised by local architects Stride Treglown, exciting speakers explore, in a rapid PechaKucha format, what we can learn from other liveable cities and ultimately produce a manifesto of ideas and recommendations for the city.\nWith speakers Silvana de Soissons (Foodie Bugle), Rob Barnard-Weston (Groundswell), Marc Dix (LT Studio Landscape Architects), Dominic Tristram (Bath Green Party), Adam Reynolds (Cycle Bath), Phil Hampshire (3Adapt), Ian Parkes & Eirini Christofidou (Stride Treglown), Charles Brindley (Active Thinking), Katharine Reeve (Bath Spa University).

Admittedly the magistrate could have handled it better than just walking out, but his point remains valid. You can't turn-up in court with your face covered - you could be anyone. Whose word do we have to take that this is actually the person who it should be?\nI don't know how the law stands on this. Could anyone turn up in court with their face covered and expect everyone else to go along with it? Somehow I doubt it, and if it's true for one person it should be true for all people. We can't give special permission for people to be exempt from laws and conventions because of some belief they hold. Where would it stop?

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2013_03_11_the-true-face-of-ukip_html/content_215.html": "It was difficult to miss the Eastleigh by election at the end of February. Aside from a slight surprise to some that the Lib Dems held the seat, most of the press concentrated on the fact that UKIP beat the Tories. “What could this mean for Cameron?”, they asked. “Should the Tories lurch even more to the Right?”\nThe simple answer to these questions are, of course, “Very little” and “No”. The UKIP vote was almost entirely a protest vote. What makes me so sure? Well, both the Lib Dem and Tory votes fell by about the same percentage of the vote - about 14 - and this is what one might expect in a by election from the party in power. In this case there are two parties, so they both lost votes. One could assume that UKIP picked-up more votes from usual Tory voters than Lib Dems, but if this were a general election most of the UKIP voters would switch back to their regular parties. The turnout for UKIP was simply a protest in a constituency where Labour would be considered an outlandish choice.\nAt least, one can hope the above is true, and that the UKIP voters were simply protesting against this awful government rather than actually endorsing UKIP, for the policies of UKIP are variously horribly regressive, unfair, xenophobic, homophobic, and economically and scientifically illiterate. It’s worth considering some of what UKIP says and considering the sort of party they are.\nFirstly, defence. UKIP promise to increase the defence budget by 40%. The current defence budget is currently around 40 billion pounds (which is the fourth largest defence budget in the world), part of a total spend of 683 billion. Increasing it by 40% as UKIP suggest will bump it up to 56 billion. Where would UKIP find this extra 16 billion? It’s about the same as the combined budgets for industry, agriculture and employment. And what does UKIP want to do with such a vast increase in military spending? They don’t say, but history shows us that one must always beware of the military ambitions of Right-wingers. Whatever the cause, it would lead to a large increase in taxes, or cuts in other areas.\nUKIP would like to double the number of prison places. That’s right, double. No doubt they intend to demonstrate a commitment to reduce crime, but simply stating that there will be more prison places doesn’t reveal how they will catch all of the extra criminals. Also, one must consider the fact that the countries with the highest rate of incarceration generally have the highest crime, so the effect of prison places on crime is unclear, to say the least. There is also the cost - the current 90,000 prison places in England and Wales cost and average of 39,600 pounds a year each. Doubling these places would cost the taxpayer another 3.5 billion pounds.\nUKIP would also commit 90 billion to building nuclear power, while at the same time stopping all wind power programmes. Wind, bear in mind, results in electricity that costs on average about twice that generated by coal, thanks to fossil fuels not including the costs of pollution, flooding, and other damages. Opponents of wind complain about the cost, but nuclear is much more expensive, and leaves a legacy of radioactive waste for generations. It must be remembered that UKIP are the only party to deny the science of climate change - just another aspect of their appalling scientific illiteracy.\nAnother aspect of UKIPs mysterious thinking is a policy to make cyclists pay road tax and pay for parking for their bicycles. They also propose to take bicycles off the road where they would mean an ‘unacceptable delay to traffic’ (i.e. cars). Does this sound like a party that wants to tackle congestion and increase public health? We know the answer to the health angle, at least - UKIP would stop government funding of any public health campaigns, such as stopping smoking or eating more fruit and vegetables. Never mind that these campaigns have been shown to work, and such preventative measures save the NHS millions every year. Public health campaigns are a very efficient way to save money, as is increased physical fitness. Discouraging cycling helps no-one.\nFundamentally, UKIP is a party of the rich, for the rich. They are like a Tory party who has abandoned any pretence of representing anyone else. They talk the talk about the EU wasting taxpayers money, while at the same time Farage takes millions of pounds in expenses from the very taxpayers he claims to represent. UKIP are also rather famously crooked, with two of the MEPs in prison - one for benefit fraud and one for false accounting and money laundering relating to his EU expenses. While UKIP claim the EU is a gravy train, it seems they are the ones who are riding it. While they are ripping us off they aren’t even representing us: the three British MEPs with the worst attendance record are the Ukip MEPs David Campbell Bannerman, Paul Nuttall and Godfrey Bloom, each averaging under 63 per cent.\nFinally, one must consider the true nature of UKIP. As I say, they are not the cuddly, comical characters as portrayed by Farage. They are in a European Far Right group, along with anti-Semitic and openly racist parties. In fact it’s not just ‘in’ this group - it’s the largest constituent party.\nSo, there’s UKIP - a party that, while not openly racist itself, is happy in the company of racists. A party with huge spending plans yet that promises to cut taxes. A party that ignores science. A party which wants to remove almost all worker protections so you’ll have to work for longer and for less, yet reduce the taxes of the rich. A party with plans for questionable military expansion and national isolation. Is this a party that one should consider as a contender for even a vote in protest? Think about what you’re voting for.",

The audience was filled with several experts on genetics and the ethics behind it, and some of the questions were quite good considering that it was a public event.

Still, you have to make the most of these things, so buy combining the powers of ice cream and beer, I got through the day.\nWe went to the Glass Arcade in St Nicholas Markets for lunch where I tried some Caribbean 'Ackee and Salt Fish'.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2012_01_05_rail-fare-increase_html/content_49.html": "Photo by Bright Meadow\nI’m painfully aware of the UK’s rail system, travelling around 5,000 miles a month by train at the moment. These hours sat in trains and stations have included pretty much every sort of event, fault and engineering issue that might reasonably be expected. Thankfully I don’t have to pay for this travel as my company foots the bill, but one can’t help but be aware of the costs involved. At the start of the year most rail fares in the UK went up, with the average rise being just under 6%. Some fares rose by almost twice as much.\nRunning a railway network is, of course, pretty expensive. However, while this is true it’s presumably true in the rest of Europe too, and yet UK commuters pay between 3.5 and 10 times more than equivalent European journeys. It’s tempting to believe in the dismissal of this by free-marketer’s that it’s because European railways receive a lot more subsidy than the UK’s, but ticket revenue currently amounts to around £6.5 billion a year, while government pays around £4bn. This subsidy is not provided entirely to keep the trains running - a significant proportion of it goes directly into the pockets of shareholders and bosses. For example, this page showing profits and executive pay in 2008 shows a number of operating company CEOs receiving pay packets of around a million pounds. This is despite their companies having to receive billions in subsidies to operate. We have the strange situation in that these companies are effectively public (in that we pay for them through taxes), yet they cream-off some of this money in excessive pay and ‘profits’. How does this make sense? On most rail routes passengers don’t have any choice of provider, and fares and timetables dictated by regulators. What have the companies done to deserve these ‘profits’ and huge pay packets?\nRail problems in the UK are down to political free-market ideology and, whether you agree with that or not, a botched privatisation. The model for BR’s privatisation was that used in Sweden in 1988, where the state railway was split into two - a track network operator and train operating companies. This was the first time such a split had been tried, and John Major’s Conservative government followed this model in The Railways Act of 1993. It is notable that the Swedish privatisation suffered from the train operating companies repeatedly going bankrupt and was renationalised in 2001.\nThatcher herself considered the privatisation of BR a step too far, but prepared the ground for it. First the British Transport Hotels were sold off in 1982 and, Sealink was sold in 1984. These were both profitable assets for the state, but the hotels were sold off cheaply to private owners, and the old Sealink routes are now making those profits for Swedish company Stena Line. British Rail’s engineering division, which under BR made trains and equipment within the UK and for export, and employed thousands of workers, was sold in 1988. Privatisation of BR caused orders to effectively stop, which lead to the almost complete destruction of the train manufacturing industry in the UK, with the former BR works in Derby the only remaining site. After passing through a number of owners the remains of the old BR engineering works are now run by Canadian company Bombardier, one of the companies which took over BR’s R&D facilities after privatisation. By 1993, when the Railways Act was written to sell what remained of BR, all that was left was the rail network and trains.\nSo privatised UK rail is inefficient, but surely we are getting some benefits? Well, no. You may occasionally see shiny trains, but these are mostly refurbished BR equipment, in fact the average age of trains in the UK is currently no different to that under the last years of BR. Any new trains, which would previously have been built by BR in the UK by British workers are now either built for Canadian profit in the remaining ex-BR plants in Derby or Crewe, or imported. Old BR works in York and Birmingham have closed. Despite this, the privatised railways now receive more government subsidy than BR ever did. In 1994, the total government support received by BR was £2,168m in 2005 terms, while in 2005, government support from all sources totalled £4,593m, despite a lack of any increase in government investment in improving infrastructure.\nThe train operating companies claim that they are investing money from increased fares, but how did this compare with BR? While BR received less financial support than in most European countries from the government, it successfully completed major infrastructure upgrades such as the electrification of the West Coast, Great Eastern and East Coast main lines, the design and introduction of the InterCity 125 and InterCity 225 express trains and the total modernisation of various routes around London. In BR’s final years it could claim to run more trains at more than 100 mph than any other railway in the world. Since privatisation there has been considerable expenditure on modernising the system, but largely confined to a few routes - and many of these investment schemes were in fact initiated by British Rail rather than the private companies.\nThe big parties know the privatisation has failed, even the Tories - in 1996 Chris Grayling, Conservative transport spokesman, admitted that the split of the rail industry into track and train components had been a mistake. In 2004, the Labour Party Conference voted by 2 to 1 in favour of the government taking the train operating companies back into public ownership as franchises expired, but this was immediately ruled out by the then Transport Secretary Alastair Darling. The Labour leadership has refused to consider renationalisation since. The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all support continuation of the privatised structure, despite what (in Labour’s case) their members may wish. Only the Green Party support bringing the railway network back into public hands.\nThe McNulty review of the UK railway industry in 2011 found that the fragmentation of the industry in the course of privatisation had caused a permanent increase in costs of between 20% and 30%. The UK rail network has moved from being one of the best and cheapest to run under BR to one of the most expensive, and the country has lost almost all of its engineering and train manufacturing capacity. The government should not be allowing these private companies to increase fares - in these times of ‘austerity’ they should be pursuing the most efficient option available, renationalisation.",

The MP for Bath, Ben Howlett, voted in favour of lifting the ban.\nI was saddened to see our MP Ben Howlett’s vote in parliament this week to allow fracking in formerly protected Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, National Parks and World Heritage Sites, such as Bath.\nMr Howlett has previously claimed to oppose fracking in Bath (a perfect example of NIMBY-ism), but this vote allows Bath to be fracked regardless of any special status.\nThe trouble with flown-in career politicians is that they rarely vote against their government. If Mr Howlett had any real connection with Bath he would understand that the vast majority of the people recognise that fracking is a real danger both to their area, and for the environment in general. This is just one of the reasons why the Green Party, the only party opposed to fracking, received the highest increase of vote share for any party in May.",

They'd quite like to scrap our data protection laws. These are the laws that put restrictions on what businesses can do with your personal data, such as not selling it to people who send junk mail. Apparently this 'red tape' is annoying for businesses. Another annoying bit of 'red tape' is the Working Time Directive, which they also plan to scrap.\nMuch as I don't want the Tories to win, some of their moves are beyond belief.

We have achieved our goal and our candidate has been elected, but what will this mean for me in the election next year, and more generally in Bath, given that local elections are happening on the same day?\nThe results in BaNES were very interesting. We got 16.3%, beating both the Lib Dems and Labour, which is a very decent result. Now consider this - the Somerset NE constituency is generally Conservative, and Euro-sceptic Conservative at that. Their current MP Rees-Mogg has in the past suggested pacts with UKIP. The large Tory and UKIP vote in the BaNES area is very likely to have come from the Somerset NE parliamentary constituency. What this suggests is that in Bath the Green vote was likely to have been at least 20%.\nThis is great news. While the Lib Dems consider Bath to be their 4th safest seat, their support has crumbled. This isn’t really a surprise nationally, but for it to happen in Bath has probably surprised them.\nIt’s a perfect storm - long-serving MP Don Foster is not standing again, and the replacement Lib Dem PPC Steve Bradley is considered by many in his party to have been ‘flown in’, with members apparently rather put-out that a local candidate wasn’t chosen. Membership is plummeting, and it appears that votes are too, but who to? Let’s face it, Lib Dems who are frustrated that their party is enabling Tory policy are unlikely to vote Tory. Labour don’t seem to have picked-up the votes, but our vote has ballooned, and membership of the Green Party has risen by a huge 25% in the first five months of 2014 alone.\nIt is clear that many ex Lib Dem voters are now Green voters. This is understandable. The Lib Dems positioned themselves slightly to the left of the Labour party, but under this government we’ve seen them support the Tory privatisation of the NHS, slashing the commitment to renewables, support fracking, attack the poor and disabled and condemning millions of people to food banks simply to survive. Are these the policies that most Lib Dem voters really wanted? No, and with Labour signed-up to the Coalition austerity spending plans and UKIP taking the ultra-Tory route, we Greens are the only party that represents the ‘small l’ liberalism and environmental awareness of the Bath people.\nI am looking forward to the rest of the campaign, and to the election in 2015.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2017_07_19_bbc-pay_html/content_207.html": "No doubt you have seen right-wing commentators frothing about BBC pay today.\nThe BBC exists in a market and operates as a commercial entity. This has been forced by successive right-wing governments. It has to compete with other broadcasters for talent.\nWhat the figures released today don’t show is that people often take less money from the BBC than they could get commercially. When they do leave for more cash, as happened recently with Bake Off, they are criticised as greedy money grabbers who don’t care about public service.\nSo what do the critics want? A BBC that can’t compete with commercial rivals and loses stars and programmes as soon as it makes them famous or popular? Or perhaps, more likely, they just hate the concept of public service broadcasting and will beat it with any stick they can until they can scrap it?\nAnd spare me this mock outrage about transparency around pay from the public purse. Where are the demands to see the pay of executives from firms that gain almost all of their income from the public sector, such as Capita and G4S? No, the government won’t be demanding those are published any time soon, and that’s because they are ideological hypocrites with an anti-public service agenda so obvious you can see it from space.\nI am not defending high pay. There’s a good case for dealing with excessive pay in many areas, but not just entertainment, and not just in non-profits. However, don’t think for one minute that’s what multi-billionaire Rupert Murdoch and his gutter press friends are supporting. This is about eliminating the concept of public service broadcasting.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2014_01_22_gagging-law_html/content_291.html": "Photo by 38 Degrees\nYou have probably heard of the “Gagging Bill” which is going though parliament at the moment. Its proper name is the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill, and that makes it sound rather good, doesn’t it? Sadly, the bill does very little or nothing to stop the sort of lobbying that Cameron promised to do something about before the election (i.e. by the wealthy, powerful and big business), but puts huge barriers up to charities and campaign groups doing what they do - speaking up on the issues they campaign for.\nMaina Kiai is a lawyer and Kenyan human rights activist who currently serves as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. He has said: “Although sold as a way to level the electoral playing field, the bill actually does little more than shrink the space for citizens – particularly those engaged in civil society groups – to express their collective will. In doing so, it threatens to tarnish the United Kingdom’s democracy … Provisions ostensibly designed to target corporate lobbyists have a loophole so big it swallows the rule. In-house lobbyists – which enjoy the most influence in the UK government by far – are exempt.”\nIndeed, the bill would have such an impact on the ability of charities to do their work that a huge number of them have written a joint letter to the Government detailing their objection</a>.\nSadly, the government has ignored the charities and groups and is pressing ahead, despite vigourous protests. The campaigning group 38 Degrees ran a spirited campaign, and groups of constituents all over the country took their concerns to their MPs. In same cases, such as Tory MP Sir Richard Ottaway, they refused to meet their constituents and even called the police. Generally though, many Coalition MPs listened to the complaints. And ignored them.\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas, always opposed to the Gagging Law, found herself in an unusual situation when the Coalition used her as a possible beneficiary of the bill. This sort of logic is absurd, of course, as she points out in her article in that link, but it does show that even the Government can’t find any decent excuses as to why this bill is required. It simply caters for a problem that doesn’t exist and ignores problems that do, while at the same time making sure that only wealthy corporations and newspaper owners can influence public opinion, rather than civil groups such as 38 Degrees and Oxfam.\nYou can see why the Coalition are pushing this law through. The general election in 2015 is going to be running at a time where more than half a million people in this, the seventh richest country in the world, are depending on food banks to eat. A country where the sick and disabled are having vital benefits cut, and where the poor and young are demonised. It is charities and ground-level campaigning groups that will be publicising this, and that is why the government want to neuter them.\nWhen the bill went to the Lords it looked like the worst parts of the bill might be dropped. After much debate the Lords made a number of amendments via a Comission chaired by Lord Harries, which consulted on the legislation after the government failed to conduct any pre-legislative scrutiny. Today, the Commons rejected nearly all of the amendments. The story makes rather depressing reading.\nWith the Lords unlikely to try again, it seems as if this government has its way. It will be harder for charities and campaign groups to bring terrible legislation to the attention of the public, whether that’s when they try to sell-off our forests, or privatise our NHS. You can imagine the hearts of Tories and their stooges warming at the news. It is, however, a massive blow for democracy and one of the first things that the next government must overturn.",

Since my last post I've mostly been working. Days here are long and it doesn't leave much time for anything else, but we've been eating well! Food and drink is possibly more expensive here than anywhere else. It doesn't help that we get back from work too late to eat in most of the restaurants, so we have to resort to the bar at the top of the hotel (where a couple of beers and some fried chicken each is 60 quid - urgh).\nAnyway, on Saturday we had a chance to see some sights. We went to the temple at Senso-Ji as we'd heard it was one of the best, and indeed it was. There are many tourist-tat shops that line the street (Nakamise-dori) between Asakusa Metro station and the temple compound and are interesting to poke about in. The temple itself is interesting but we were unlucky that when we visited there was some restoration going on, but there was still plenty to see.\nAfter the temple we decided to take the Sumida-Gawa river cruise to see the city from a different aspect. Unfortunately the boat was completely enclosed with no deck to walk about on, so it was hard to see much! What we did see was mostly bridges and skyscrapers, so it was a lot less interesting than something like a cruise on the Thames. I wouldn't recommend it unless you manage to get an open boat anyway.\nThe boat took us to a commercial district near the Tokyo Tower. Everything was closed and nobody was around - it was a bit bizarre really. There was a McDonalds in the bottom of one of the office buildings where we reluctantly bought lunch before heading into whatever bit of Tokyo we were in, in an attempt to find a Metro station to get home. We walked under a monorail, which is an excitingly futuristic thing to have, and we saw a bullet train too. Very Japanese! Eventually we randomly found Mita station and got the metro back to the hotel.\nOn Sunday we had to move hotels. We're now in the Crowne Plaza Metropolitan, and I have another decent view from my room. The hotel is in a much busier area than the Akasaka Prince, so it looks like there will be more to do. We're right by Ikebukuro station which, like many Japanese stations, is absolutely massive. Still, it's a bit closer to the office so we'll shave half an hour off each leg of the commute from tomorrow.\nIn the afternoon we went to the Meiji-Jingu shrine. To get there you have to walk through an interesting bit of Japanese culture - Cos-play-zoku, or the 'costume play gang'. These are teenagers who dress up in goth and punk dress and then hang around every weekend, while tourists come and pose with them for photos. It's very bizarre. We had to walk though them to get to the shrine so it was an interesting diversion, although I didn't take any photos as it felt a bit 'wrong' to take photos of scantily-clad 14 year olds. Anyway, the shrine itself is in a massive (by Tokyo standards) site full of trees and 'countryside', which is very pleasant. I think I saw more tourists there than anywhere else in Tokyo. Most days you don't see any Westerners, but the shrine was crawling with them. It was an impressive site, and we saw a couple of traditional Japanese weddings taking place. It must have been a bit weird for the people getting married as they had loads of tourists taking photos, but I suppose they wouldn't have done it there if they had minded. Odd though.\nAfter the shrine we went back to the area of the hotel and poked around BIC Camera, which is a bit like Richer Sounds. I don't think things are really that much cheaper in Japan though so I haven't succumbed to any impulse purchases yet. From BIC it was a short stroll back to the hotel where we had a rather nice meal. Hurrah!

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2011_07_29_dying-in-waiting-lists_html/content_310.html": "h1. Minimum Waiting Times, Deaths and Spin\np(meta). 29th July 2011\nI was infuriated to hear the main story in the headlines of the Today programme this morning. You may have heard it as something like ‘patients are being made to wait 15 weeks for operations and some of them die first, or go to private hospitals’. The story is on the BBC news Web site here.\nNow I have several problems with both the story and the way it has been reported. Firstly, and let’s be very clear here, these waits have not killed anyone. Only non-urgent surgery might be delayed - anything urgent would never be delayed in this way. Anyone who may have died on this waiting list (and again, there is no evidence that this has actually happened) will almost certainly have died of unrelated issues. The sort of surgery involved (joints, hips, etc) is usually performed on the old, and when dealing with such large numbers of people a small number are just going to die on any given day anyway.\nSo have people been ‘forced to go private’? Well, maybe… but there is no evidence of this, either. They may have done, they may not have done. Many patients remove themselves from the list (the ROTT rate) for a number of fairly everyday reasons, irrespective of waiting list times. Everyone involved in healthcare knows this. Is the ROTT rate significantly higher when people waiting for non-urgent surgery have to wait a couple of extra weeks? There is no evidence for this.\nSometimes a wait can be exactly what the patient needs. For example, patients who are waiting for something like a knee replacement because of obesity may no longer need one if they lose weight. If they are immediately given operations the NHS pays a lot of money for unnecessary surgery. You may be surprised by how many of these non-urgent operations are due to obesity and, although you wouldn’t suspect it if you listened to Andrew Lansley, NHS managers usually know what they’re doing.\nSo there’s nothing terribly wrong about a few minimum waits for non-urgent treatment. In an ideal world we’d all be treated the same day our GP refers us, but obviously that’s not going to happen. We have to remember that with the NHS budget being massively cut, NHS management are being forced to save money in almost every way they can. This is one of the least harmful ways.\nAnd then we have Andrew Lansley and his comments. I quote “This is exactly why we need to put patients’ interests first”. I want to be quite clear here - Andrew Lansley has a list of priorities, and ‘patients interests’ are very near the bottom. This news was a clumsy attempt to somehow convince people that the NHS is broken and needs his ‘reforms’. And how has he done this? He’s got some whining from private healthcare companies that the NHS is trying to ‘save money’ and ‘keep hospitals viable’. Well, Lansley, maybe they wouldn’t need to do this if you weren’t trying to systematically destroy the NHS? Of course they have to save money - you have slashed their funding so much that they have to make greater savings than any healthcare system has done in history while at the same time you are adding three new layers of bureaucracy, making thousands of people redundant, cherry-picking any profitable bits for your friends in private healthcare, and doing all this with no electoral mandate.\nSo yes, let’s blame the managers who are trying to run a healthcare system with ever fewer resources while they’re constantly being demonised by you and your ‘no top-down reorganisation’ lying colleagues. This is the worst sort of spin, but I don’t think you have anyone fooled - we can still remember what the NHS was like when your party last ran it.

Why should we be concerned?\n@dominictristram Record Migration Figures\n♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nI just wanted to say a quick thing on, the UK net migration figures, which are a record breaking high up 20%, 606,000 people, I think, are the latest figures per year. I think it’s worth just dwelling on the fact that many of the people who voted for Brexit did so because they didn’t like the idea of migration and how they must be feeling now because we’ve gone from lower numbers of people coming in and let’s face it, not liking migration is often, not always, but often due to racism, you know?\nPeople who don’t come from here coming in. And so these brexiters, now these, people who voted sometimes with a racist motive against staying in EU because they didn’t like migration, now have far more immigrants. But, those immigrants are now much less likely to be other white Europeans and much more likely to be people from other countries of different races. Now, how do you think they feel about that?\nI think if there is a silver lining from Brexit, and I don’t think there is particularly, but if there was one, it might be just imagining how many extremely annoyed racists there are at the moment.",

The DRM-free music will be 99p per track (instead of 79p for DRM) but will be at twice the bitrate, which is 256Kbps AAC. The per-album price will be the same as for DRM-restricted albums, and users will be able to upgrade their existing DRM-restricted tracks.\nSo why is this big news? Well for one thing DRM-free music is what everyone wants. You will now be able to buy music from the iTunes store and play it on any device, whether portable player or computer, etc. The higher bitrate is an added bonus of course as music will now sound even better. The objects that some people had about buying music on iTunes were largely about 'lock-in', but now all of those objections no longer apply. If people really object to the higher price and don't care about DRM then they can still buy the DRM-restricted files. Everyone is a winner!\nThe best thing about this move is of course that it will kill the WMA format. EVerything can play unprotected AAC files (yes, even the Zune), and the iTunes store easily has the largest selection of music available of all of the online music sites. The Zune wasn't an attempt at a competitive music player, it was an attempt to lock people into WMA, and therefore Windows. The multiplatform AAC and iTunes now stomps all over it as you'd be daft to buy your music anywhere else. WMA is dead as a commercial digital music format.\nThe consumer will benefit. Other music stores that only offer DRM-limited files will have to remove the DRM to compete, and at that point all online music stores will be competing on 'real' terms - price, available selection, and so on. It is a good day for everyone, even those who don't care for the iTunes store. Freedom of the user, and value for money, has been substantially increased.\nOnly EMI have signed-up so far, but that's about 20% of the music. The other labels will sign-up if they see that the EMI move is sucessful, so let's make that success happen!

It's still programming - I haven't decided to become a stuntman or something - but it's in quite a different area. No more telco stuff for me, at least for a while, as I'm now in the exciting world of Internet startups and fun things. I'm also programming on a Mac so I don't have to suffer Windows on a regular basis again. Huzzah! I've now got a shiny quad-core Mac Pro under my desk, which is pretty darn nippy.\nSo all is good on the work front. The weather has also been exceptional recently of course, so that has been nice. My new job is a bit further from home (about 45 minutes walk rather than 30) so I've decided to cycle in. Since there is nowhere to put a bike in my new office I decided to get a folding one. Not only can this be left under my desk and out of the way, but I can sling it into the back of the car for weekends away and so on. After looking at various makes and models I went for a Dahon Speed TR. This was a tough choice as I really wanted to buy a British bike (support local industry and all that), but although the Brompton folds much smaller it just doesn't have the gear range I need for Bath. The new bike arrived quickly and I've been cycling into work fine on it. The smaller wheels make it look slightly girly I suppose, but that's something I have to live with if I want the folding! The rolling resistance of smaller wheels also make it slightly harder to move - I feel that on the hill on the way home! Good exercise though, I suppose.\nI bought a PS3 - much nicer to look at than the XBox 360, and nicer firmware too. It also doesn't sound like a aeroplane taking off! I've just got 'Resistance' for it at the moment, but there are some more games on my list from ScreenSelect, so I'll get those at some point. The rental system works really well for games actually as I don't have to shell-out 50 quid for something I lose interest in pretty quickly. If only they carried Wii games they would be perfect. Anyway, if you want to 'friend' me then my handle is 'DominicUK'.\nOne final thing that I've been appreciating is the new Nine Inch Nails album, Year Zero. It's really good, but you don't have to take my word for it since you can listen to it on the NIN web site. The CD itself is pretty funky as it is heat sensitive. When you put it in the CD player it's black, but when it comes out it's white (with 'hidden' text). Cool! It goes black again when it cools down. It's a nice touch, and it makes me happier that I still buy CDs rather than downloading dodgy copies like skanky cheapskate pirates.\nSo all is good on the work front.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2016_08_18_banes-community-health_html/content_103.html": "Community health services were split-off from the NHS a few years back as part of the Tory/Lib Dem NHS reforms. In Bath and NE Somerset they are currently run by Sirona, a not-for-profit Community Interest Company.\nThis was, of course, only a temporary arrangement. As all of us who have been trying to warn of the privatisation agenda have said for years, handing NHS services to non-profits was only a stop-gap move to soften people up for the desired handover to profit making companies. And so it has come to pass here in Bath, where Sirona’s services look like they will be handed to Virgin Care in a few months time after today’s announcement.\nWhy does this matter? The mantra of pro-privatisers is along the lines of ‘as long as it’s free at the point of delivery, who cares?’. There are perfectly valid philosophical reasons why proft is best kept out of healthcare, but we don’t even need to consider those to know this is a bad idea. To compete with a non-profit provider on price a profit-making provider must cut either staff or services.\nIt’s a fantasy to believe that there are huge inefficiencies that will magically be found by private providers. Indeed, before the Tory and Lib Dem ‘reforms’ the NHS was by most measures the most efficient healthcare system in the world. Despite this, some on the political right insist that the profit motive will improve efficiency, whatever the evidence, and the result is services like this being put out to tender.\nThe CCG has said “There will be a clause in the contract which requires any financial surplus to be reinvested into services in BaNES. Virgin Care has committed to meet this requirement.” Sounds good, right? Well, it’s worthless. Virgin Care has never declared a profit, and the reason is simple. Like many multinationals, Virgin Care is owned by a complex chain of companies and trusts that ultimately reside in the British Virgin Islands, outside the reach of the UK tax man. The upshot of this is that NHS money will almost certainly be extracted and paid to shareholders, tax free. Thinking about it for one minute is all you need to do - why would Virgin, a profit-making company tasked with making money for its shareholders, bid for work they wouldn’t make money from? It wouldn’t.\nAll is not lost quite yet. Preferred bidder status is not the same as winning the work. The partnership of non-profit providers also bidding (LiNK) could object or question the scoring. Let’s hope they do.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2013_01_06_privatised-nhs-deaths_html/content_156.html": "As 2013 begins, the Tory and Lib Dem plan to privatise the NHS is on schedule. The schedule is, you will remember, to sell-off so much of it by the next general election that whatever the next government do it will be impossible to get the NHS back again. Always remember that end game. If nothing else it helps to explain the mad rush to sell, and the massive cock-ups along the way.\nAt the moment 105 healthcare firms, including InHealth, Specsavers, and Virgin Care, have been granted “any qualified provider” status, providing a number of NHS services. Of course, each time a private firm ‘wins’ these pieces of work, the corresponding NHS service is lost. If enough NHS services are lost then that’s when you lose your hospital. You may be tempted to think that these private companies have been awarded contracts based on some excellent offer, but sadly that isn’t necessarily the case. After all, the government has told PCTs that they must put three services out to AQP. Perhaps the local NHS provider does it best? The government doesn’t care - privatisation is the agenda, and patients be damned.\nYou may be bored of me going on about this. Perhaps you think I’m overreacting? Well, before the Health and Social Care Act was passed I stated that it would actually kill people. Right now, at the start of 2013, we can be reasonably confident that it has killed at least two people so far. Firstly there’s Anita Mansi who died at a clinic offering NHS services but run by Carillion last year. As you can see from the article, it’s not only fragmentation of care that results from a number of different providers, but the profit motive which, in this case, meant that Carillion didn’t bother buying enough ventilators. If Anita Mansi had been in an NHS hospital offering a large number of services, the chances of equipment and trained staff being available would have been much, much higher. This is obvious, yet the whole drive of the Coalition reforms is to split services across a large number of ‘suppliers’. Will they all have the equipment and/or staff that are required in unusual circumstances? No.\nIt’s not just clinical services, of course. Harmoni, the private company that runs out-of-hours GP cover for 8 million people, has faced criticism after a seven week old baby died due to long waits and minimal service. Again, the incentive for Harmoni is to reduce cover to a the minimum level they contractually can. Why? The less is costs them the more they can pocket and give to their shareholders.\nNobody is arguing that profit has a place in the world. However, consider how profits are made in NHS privatisation. The private provider pretty much has to say they’ll supply the service for less than the NHS provider to win the contract. How do you outbid an offer where no profit is made and still make a profit for your shareholders? You cut something. That something is almost always staff, whether in numbers or training. Harmoni did both, and Carillion did it by not buying the equipment they might need. Of course, they had everything they had to have to win the work, but when profit is your motivation, why would you buy more?\nI will leave you with the following piece of advice. Next time you are referred by your GP for anything, always choose the NHS provider. You may be spun a yarn about waiting lists (although there is rarely much in it), but your NHS provider will be in a large hospital with pretty much every piece of medical equipment going, and experts in pretty much anything that might go wrong, right there in the same building. Not only that, but you’ll be helping to keep our NHS in public hands. That advice may just save your life.",

As a consequence they are removing your rights to have any say over what happens near your home.\nTheir latest act is to remove the obligation for fracking firms to obtain planning permission for exploratory explosives and drilling, thus removing a vital way that both you and your local authority have any say.\nAgain, with this Tory government we see evidence that the voices of the wealthy are the only important ones to them.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2024_12_10_spotify-wrapped_html/content_296.html": "Why I wont be sharing my ‘Spotify Wrapped’\nEvery year, around this time, countless artists eagerly share their Spotify Wrapped stats with the world. Let me be clear from the start: I don’t begrudge anyone doing so. If an artist is proud of what they’ve achieved, more power to them. This isn’t an article criticising their choice to celebrate their milestones. Rather, it’s about why I’ve chosen not to participate.\nIt’s Not About Hiding Anything\nI’m not shying away because I’ve got something to hide. I’m perfectly open about the fact that my music reaches a modest audience. In fact, this year, I’ve gained more listeners than ever, and I’m pleased with that. But I’m still operating on a small scale. My reluctance to share my stats doesn’t stem from embarrassment or a desire to obscure my standing. Instead, it’s about something deeper: the toxic culture that surrounds these numbers.\nThe Problem With Spotify’s Numbers\nI’ve always had a problem with Spotify prominently displaying an artist’s monthly listener count on their profile. This feature fosters an unhealthy obsession with numbers. It drives behaviours like playlist botting and paid promotions to artificially inflate stats because, like it or not, those figures influence how listeners perceive music.\nThe logic is flawed, but it exists nonetheless: low numbers equate to low quality in the eyes of some. This system discourages genuine discovery of lesser-known artists. On other streaming platforms, where such statistics aren’t front and centre, listeners are arguably more inclined to give unfamiliar music a chance. That’s real discovery—finding artists who are talented but not yet well-known.\nSpotify, however, perpetuates a cycle of promoting the already popular. Even the platform’s much-touted discovery features, like its recommendations, often lead to artists who are already well-established. After one of my songs finishes playing, the next recommendation is almost always someone with hundreds of thousands of listeners—artists I already know. That’s not discovery; it’s recycling. What about the smaller, independent artists who deserve a shot?\nThe Broader Implications for Artists\nThis obsession with numbers has practical consequences too. Venues and promoters increasingly use Spotify stats to determine whether an artist is worth booking. They’ll often check monthly listener counts as part of their decision-making process. For many smaller musicians, this makes Spotify an inescapable part of their career, even if they’d rather direct listeners to platforms like Bandcamp or Tidal, which pay far better royalties.\nSpotify has us hooked, and they know it. Their dominance ensures that artists feel compelled to drive traffic to the platform, even if it’s not in their best interest. I’m guilty of it myself. When I release a song, I post a Spotify link because I want those numbers to climb. I resent doing it, but the ecosystem leaves me little choice.\nWhy I’m Opting Out of Spotify Wrapped\nThis brings me to Spotify Wrapped, the culmination of this numbers-driven culture. Every year, artists and listeners alike are encouraged to share their stats as a badge of honour. It’s become a normalised ritual, but it’s ultimately just another way Spotify reinforces the importance of these numbers.\nAs an artist, I can see my stats anytime. They’re useful for marketing, understanding my audience, and planning my next moves. But making these numbers public doesn’t benefit me—or most artists. Unless you’re a massive name, your numbers will always pale in comparison to someone else’s. It’s a game that smaller artists can’t win.\nA Call for Change\nInstead of feeding this toxic system, I propose we do better. Let’s stop amplifying Spotify’s advertising under the guise of Wrapped. Let’s question why we’re promoting a platform that pays Joe Rogan hundreds of millions while underpaying independent artists. Let’s push for platforms that treat musicians more fairly and genuinely support discovery of new talent.\nI’m not suggesting that Spotify has no place in the music industry, but its current model doesn’t serve smaller artists. Wrapped is a celebration of numbers, not music. So this year, I’m choosing to step back. My voice may be small, but it’s one I’ll use to advocate for something better—something that values artistry over algorithms.\nTo receive my new politics posts directly by email or in the Substack app, please subscribe",

This has been forced by successive right-wing governments. It has to compete with other broadcasters for talent.\nWhat the figures released today don’t show is that people often take less money from the BBC than they could get commercially. When they do leave for more cash, as happened recently with Bake Off, they are criticised as greedy money grabbers who don’t care about public service.\nSo what do the critics want? A BBC that can’t compete with commercial rivals and loses stars and programmes as soon as it makes them famous or popular? Or perhaps, more likely, they just hate the concept of public service broadcasting and will beat it with any stick they can until they can scrap it?\nAnd spare me this mock outrage about transparency around pay from the public purse. Where are the demands to see the pay of executives from firms that gain almost all of their income from the public sector, such as Capita and G4S? No, the government won’t be demanding those are published any time soon, and that’s because they are ideological hypocrites with an anti-public service agenda so obvious you can see it from space.\nI am not defending high pay. There’s a good case for dealing with excessive pay in many areas, but not just entertainment, and not just in non-profits. However, don’t think for one minute that’s what multi-billionaire Rupert Murdoch and his gutter press friends are supporting. This is about eliminating the concept of public service broadcasting.",

After meeting at the Abbey we marched through town, ending-up at Southgate where we had a short rally.\nI was asked to do a short speech - you can watch it here (from about 4:20 onwards). All of the speeches are worth a watch, of course!\nThe shoppers crowding the streets were generally supportive and there was a good atmosphere. It was great to see so many young people getting involved in campaigning for their right to an education without a lifetime of debt. I enjoyed hearing the other speeches and chatting to other marchers about their concerns and Green Party policy.\nThe Green Party is the only party advocating free education with no fees or additional taxes. There would be no need for loans because, as well as the removal of fees, living costs would eventually be met by the Citizens Income. In the short term, maintenance grants will be reintroduced. We will also widen the range of people who are able to study by offering real support to mature students and students with families. There will be a minimum requirement for Universities and Higher Education Institutions to offer a free crèche to students and staff, nappy changing and breast-feeding facilities.\nEducation and learning are an essential part of a fulfilling life, not just a mechanism for training people for a job.

Road and air travel are cheaper in real terms now than they have ever been, yet since privatisation rail travel has become quite a lot more expensive. This is despite the fact that more people are travelling by rail all of the time.\nThe ESRC have some interesting statistics on travel, such as the cost to the UK of road accidents being 16 billion pounds per year. Road travel is not cheap, but the government doesn't worry about paying for roads and road improvement with public money. Why should the railways be any different? It goes without saying that I think they should be renationalised, but what else could be done to improve them?\nI think that a big improvement could be achieved by putting a much higher tax on road transport of goods that could be transported by train, for one thing. We need new train lines to new depots in each town and city where goods can be unloaded and only the last part of the journey done by road. It is madness that we drive lorries with containers on them down motorways when rail is so much more efficient.\nThe railway network needs to be expanded. Where old lines closed in the 60's remain clear, they should be either reopened or protected from any development until such a time as they are economically viable. These lines were viable once, and the population was smaller then. If the costs of road transport start reflecting the true environmental costs, then these rail links will undoubtedly become useful again.\nFares need to become cheaper. Renationalisation is necessary for this, since I think it is fundamentally wrong to pay a public subsidy to a private company that makes a profit for its shareholders. If the railways were nationalised we could put an extra tax on petrol for road transport.. a couple of pence per litre say, and use that as a direct rail subsidy. Taxes on larger cars could also go to public transport, since taxing luxury cars takes the burden from the poor, who may still need to drive.\nFinally, we need to think very hard about the way we build our towns and cities. As long as people feel that they need their cars then they will probably keep them, so we should do as much as we can to remove that need. This is already true in most of London and other big cities, where cars are a luxury. All new housing developments should include local shops and pubs etc within half a mile of any house to prevent people from having to travel just to buy food. This isn't some pipe-dream since this always used to be the case! Rail and buses should link residential areas so that people can get to work, and there should be tax incentives to live in the town or city you work in, to reduce the need to travel. We can do this if we try. If we don't tackle it and just bury our heads in the sand, things are only going to get worse... especially when the oil starts to run out.\nThe ESRC have some interesting statistics on travel, such as the cost to the UK of road accidents being 16 billion pounds per year.

Here’s why.\n@dominictristram Local Elections - Vote Today\n♬ original sound Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nSo if like me, you have local elections today, then this is the day to go out and vote unless you’ve already used your postal vote. A lot of people think there’s not much point voting. What can a local council do? But actually a local council can do a lot of things, budgets for education and social care, .\nThey can obviously do things to reduce pollution and reduce, , traffic or pedestrianize areas, all sorts of things that improve your quality of life. It’s worth voting in local elections because this is really the main opportunity. You have to choose a representative who you believe in. Local elections generally have low turnouts, which means that if you are fairly determined, you and some like-minded friends can get a councillor who you agree with.\nSo you’ll get a lot of stuff from the big parties at general Elections saying only vote for the big parties. What’s the point of voting for a small one? Well, they can’t use that excuse at local elections. I’ll give you an example. I’ve just come back from my polling station it was about 1:00 PM.\nAnd so far today, in the whole day, they’ve had 53 votes. So if you and some like-minded friends, and it doesn’t have to be many, if you decide you’re all gonna vote, you can basically swing that whole result. Now, of course, that number will go up by the end of the day, but not by much. And you’re talking about people winning council seats on four or 500 votes sometimes.\nAnd where I live in Bath and Northeast Somerset we, T he Green Party, have lost out on council seats by as few as seven or eight votes on a few occasions. It’s always worth voting because your vote and the vote to your friends or family can just swing the whole result.\nDon’t believe people who tell you the greens can’t win . Don’t believe people who tell you your vote won’t make a difference. Because actually with such small margins, you can go from a ward where a party hasn’t even stood before to that party winning, and that does happen.\nYou can get these surprise results and it’s because a lot of the time the big parties don’t even bother campaigning in what they consider safe ward. So go and vote. Maybe you’ll cause some surprises. A green councillor will always work in your best interests. So if you really want social and environmental justice, the Green Party isn’t the sort of party where people join because they know they’ll get elected and they can sit there comfortably doing, nothing.\nThey join because they really want to help, really want to help their communities. So you’ve got a choice today. You can go make an active choice to elect people who really want to help out, really want to make your world better, or you can make a choice for more of the same.\nAnd believe me, not voting is the vote for more of the same.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2014_07_09_glastonbury-roundup_html/content_136.html": "I’ve been going to the Glastonbury Festival for around 15 years now, and I always thoroughly enjoy it. I have to admit that as I get a bit older I do like my luxuries though - this year I had the amazing luxury of my camper van. A huge awning, a proper bed, running water, my own toilet… it’s almost unrecognisable from my years spent shivering in tents or covered in mud for five days straight!\nNeedless to say, the festival itself was as excellent as ever. This was the first year I didn’t actually go around the whole site - I didn’t once walk in the area from the ‘right’ of the Pyramid stage up to and including the Other Stage, so I didn’t even set eyes on the Dance Village etc. Why? Well, partly because the weather made walks for the sake of walking a bit of a pain, but mostly because there was just so much to do in the ‘Avalon’ side of the Avalon/Babylon world.\nOne thing I knew that I could not miss was the tribute to Tony Benn at LeftField. Billy Bragg, Michael Eavis and Benn’s son and granddaughter gave very moving speeches. I have to say, I did feel myself welling-up a bit, and there were tears around the packed tent. Tony Benn was always worth seeing at Glastonbury, and it won’t be quite the same without him.\nThere were many good debates at LeftField this year, and it’s always brilliant to be around so many people who want change and to make Britain fairer and more progressive, and they’re mostly younger than me so the future is bright! Every year there is huge enthusiasm for the Greens and despair at what the government is doing and the rise of deeply unpleasant parties such as UKIP. While there is of course an element of ‘preaching to the converted’ at Glastonbury, it does indeed ‘recharge your activism’, as the LeftField slogan says.\nAs always, I spent quite a lot of time in the Speaker’s Forum in the Green Futures field. There were some excellent and inspirational talks again, with a good speech by Green Party leader Natalie Bennett as well as Jenny Jones, who gave a good talk on the very worrying and very murky world of undercover policing in lawful protest groups and NGOs.\nAs well as political and environmental talks there were also some purely interesting ones, mostly at the new ‘Free University of Glastonbury’ up at the Crow’s Nest. I’ve always had a soft spot for Professor Alice Roberts, but that wasn’t necessary to think that her talk on evolution was really excellent. She’s a brilliant science communicator and also just a generally friendly and excellent person. Who wouldn’t warm to someone who gives an excellent science talk then later that night bops around along with you to punk band Anti-Flag?\nThere was also some excellent comedy. Jeremy Hardy was brilliant as ever, and I caught Marcus Brigstoke’s Policy Unit (with Phil Jupitus, Josie Long and Nick Doody), Arthur Smith, Mark Steel and a few others. I miss the days when Stewart Lee was a regular Glastonbury feature, but there you go - times change.\nAnd so the music! Yes, lots of good stuff. The only thing I saw on Pyramid were Elbow, who were excellent. As I said previously, as I get older I lose patience with hanging around miles from the front of the stage having to watch it on the big screens. The atmosphere is good, but if you’re on your own there’s little point - better to catch the main stage acts on telly afterwards. There are literally dozens of stages on the site where you can be right up in the action, so that’s where I stayed this year. It was also conveniently away from the mud and rain.\nJust a quick mention of the rain - it was in no way as bad as it has been in ‘wet’ years, but I have honestly never seen rain as huge as that which fell on Friday during and after the impressive thunder storm. It was that big, fat, warm rain that you get in rainforests. I’ve never seen the like in the UK. Crazy.\nSo anyway, musical highlights included (in no particular order) old staples I’ve seen before such as Billy Bragg, Elbow, The Bad Shepherds, Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott, Flipron and Suzanne Vega, as well as some bands and artists which were new to me, including AlbaRoma (excellent gypsy punk), the WooHoo Revue (an Australian band that I can’t really describe but were excellently manic) and Kate Tempest - a genre that really isn’t my sort of thing but was really, really excellent. I’m sure there were others - I saw dozens - but those are the ones that most stick out in my mind.\nAnd so another year of Glastonbury is over. I don’t know if I’ll be able to go next year, so I tried to really make the most of it. If you haven’t been you owe it to yourself to try it at least once - it’s like nothing else on Earth.\nYou can see the rest of my photos here",

On Saturday I went and had a poke around Akihabara to see the shops etc. It certainly has a good range of electronics and manga porn. Being unable to appreciate Manga porn I stuck to the electronics shops though. There are some great gadgets and the Japanese seem to have a large number of options for really lightweight laptops which I liked the look of, but they're not cheap. I also looked at buying a camera since they are a bit cheaper here, but the Japan-only warranty didn't sound like a good idea, plus the possible duty to pay if I keep hold of the box. VAT in Japan is only 5% so even being a tourist doesn't save you much money.\nAkihabara is of course teeming with thousands of people looking for a bargain. They also have large numbers of women hanging around outside the station in strange French maid outfits handing out stuff. Not sure what they're advertising, but the Japanese don't bat an eyelid at such things. Most odd. Other than that, and the strange placing of sex shops between computer shops, it's all quite tame really. For shopping it's great as you don't get pushy salesmen grabbing you as soon as you stop to look at something. They do stand around and shout stuff, but it's to no-one in particular.\nAfter Akihabara I had a quick kip before heading out to Roppongi, an area known for its nightlife. I went there early evening as I wanted to just have a look around before it got too crowded. There's certainly lots to do though, even at that time of day - a lot of the bars seem to optimistically open all day. I went for a drink in some 'British pub' to check out the local take on what British pubs are like, and from all of the St Patricks Day flags it felt a bit more Irish than British, but never mind! I then had a drink at the Gaspanic Cafe, which was empty, then a burger at the New Zealand Centre (oddly), which promised many NZ beers but only had one. After that I headed to Geronimo's which was highly recommended in my Lonely Planet. There I met a bunch of expats and went for a Chinese with them, which was all highly random and entertaining, but I was back in time for the last train home!\nOn Sunday I went for a drink and a bite to eat with someone from CouchSurfing not far from Roppongi again. We chatted and watched the water from the pier and had a most pleasant evening. I caught the last train back to the hotel and arrived there to find all of the electricity off. The hotel had decided to rewire something, so I had an entertaining time preparing for bed and generally getting around the hotel. It's easy to forget how much you depend on electricity. It's not so bad at home, but believe me, it has its uses when you're staying on the 22nd floor of a hotel!\nAkihabara is of course teeming with thousands of people looking for a bargain.

It is in the interests of all parties for younger voters to fully participate in our democratic system.\nOne problem is that the young are disenfranchised. One clear reason why the Scottish referendum had such a high level of engagement was the inclusion of 16 and 17 year olds. These people are old enough to work full time, marry and have children - isn’t it only fair that they have a say in how their taxes are spent and their children are cared for?\nIt is also clear that many people don’t vote because they consider that their choice won’t make a difference to the result. This is understandable when a majority government can be elected by just 24% percent of eligible voters. The case for using a form of proportional representation in general elections is very strong, and indeed we already use it in other elections. It is time to bring the election of our MPs in line.\nI realise that you have personally benefited from the current system, but I would ask you to consider the future of our democracy, and falling engagement with it, and place tackling this above any party political interests. We all benefit if the public are more engaged with politics.\nYou have a chance to change all of this for the better. As your constituent and as someone I ask you to please consider supporting the Representation of the People (Proportional Representation and Reduction of Voting Age) Bill on Wednesday.\nBest wishes,\nDominic Tristram",

We will restore the public sector and bring back vital services.\nOnly the Green Party will give the NHS the £12bn extra it needs every year, halt and then push back privatisation, and ultimately scrap the failed ‘internal market’ ideological experiment that costs billions and helps no-one.\nOnly the Green Party believes that education should be free, and wealth no barrier to ambition. Only we will scrap tuition fees and write-off government held student debt.\nOnly the Green Party will ban fracking. Other parties might claim to care about the environment, but those are hollow words from any party that is willing to use ever more fossil fuels.\nThe system is clearly broken. There is only one real choice for change, and that choice is Green.\nFinally, I want to address tactical voting. As a party we don’t support it, since we think that nothing will change if people don’t vote for what they actually want. The columnist George Monbiot has written an excellent article on this in which he says “…do we keep voting for a diluted version of Tory politics, for fear of the concentrate? Or do we start to vote for what we want? Had the people of this nation heeded the noseholders a century ago, we would still be waiting for the Liberal party to deliver universal healthcare and the welfare state.”\nHowever, the local Lib Dem campaign seems to have exclusively consisted of telling people that it’s ‘either us or the Tories’ and some people might be tempted to believe them. It simply isn’t true, so if you are considering voting tactically to ‘keep the Tories out’, consider this:\n- No party is expected to get an outright majority\n- The Green Party beat the Lib Dems and Labour at the last election in Bath (the Euros)\n- The Liberal Democrats have already enabled five years of Tory government. They have said they’d do it again. Electing a Lib Dem MP is the same as electing a Tory MP, as far as enabling Tory government goes\n- UKIP have said many times that they will work with a Tory government\n- Labour have said they would rather see a Tory government than work with the SNP. The only way they could form a government is to work with the SNP\nSo you see, even using the tactical argument, a Green vote is the best ‘anti Tory’ vote you can make.\nAll I ask is that you consider everyone standing and vote for the one that you agree with most. That is the way democracy is meant to work, and this is the first election in Bath for a long time where it can indeed work that way, whatever the other parties say. You can read what we believe here, in our manifesto.\nOn Thursday you can vote for someone you don’t really agree with from fear of someone worse - a vote that will ensure that nothing really changes. Or you can vote for the policies we need for a fair, just and caring society - a vote for hope.\nWe can do this. We must do this. For the Common Good.",

This is true whether you are trying to buy a house or are renting. If you rent, with prices so high you might expect, at the very least, the property to be fit for habitation.\nIt might seem reasonable that this is the law. However, my MP Ben Howlett and his Conservatives don’t think that should be the case. They voted down a law that would have made it a legal requirement for rented property to be habitable.\nAsk yourself why. Isn’t a property fit for human habitation the very least one should expect when renting? Who do these Tories represent? It’s certainly not you and me.\nThe simple fact is that the Tories don’t fight for you. They fight for the millionaires that fund them. Some of those millionaires are property barons who don’t like having to provide decent housing. Others, of course, run private healthcare companies which is why the Tories are giving them our NHS. Yet others run academy chains and free schools, which is why education is being taken out of local democratic control and handed to people who profit from it.\nWe have four years to the next election. Four years to work together to get these Tories out. My party, the Green Party, isn’t funded by millionaires - it’s funded by ordinary members like you. It’s the only party where the ordinary members decide policy, which is why our policies work for you, not the property barons.\nWe are the fastest growing party in Bath. Join us.

The weather was perfect and the turnout excellent, and we had a thoroughly enjoyable time with almost total support from passers by. This was just one of many such marches throughout the country, with hundreds of thousands taking part.\nAlso today, David Cameron announced Tory plans to require 50% of union members to vote for a strike in order for it to be legal. At the same time he refused to allow workplace balloting or any other means to make voting easier. Obviously this move is nothing to do with democracy and simply a means to try to make legal industrial action more difficult. If Cameron has a problem with low turnouts then he should probably ask his own government to resign, and certainly the Police Commissioners that hardly anyone voted for.\nThe government didn’t stop there - Cameron’s official spokesman said that public sector strikes were ‘always wrong’. The sheer audacity of such a claim is unbelievable. This government has presided over a real-terms 20% pay cut for some of the most important jobs in the country - teachers, nurses, carers… real jobs, helping the youngest and most vulnerable in society. Not only have teachers had to deal with Gove, the most inept education secretary in living memory, but NHS staff have seen their organisation sold-off, slandered and maligned and mismanaged by a government intent on destroying it. Still they work harder than most of us, only to be hear that if they were to strike it would always be wrong.\nLet me be clear. Public sector workers were absolutely right to strike today. They have been demonised and sniped at by a government that hates them and any public service ethos. They are told that even a pay rise that matches inflation is ‘unaffordable’ by a government that finds money to give tax cuts to the rich and spends time lobbying Brussels to exempt our bankers from rules stopping obscenely high pay.\nThe money is there - the wealthiest have seen their wealth vastly increase, yet the working poor are going to food banks. Some public sector workers are now earning the minimum wage because their pay can’t go any lower. Teaching is now one of the worst paid graduate professions, yet millions are found to set-up unnecessary ‘free’ schools and academies - vanity projects for people like Toby Young. This government has no interest in improving education - its sole objective is to remove the responsibility for it from the State, just as it wants to for health.\nAnd where were Labour today, while the unions that fund it were calling for action? Labour refused to back the strikes. Only the Green Party backed them and marched with the strikers. Labour know that they can’t back fair public sector pay because they are committed to Tory austerity plans, and that means no increase in pay for the foreseeable future.\nWe reject austerity. We demand a living wage - a fair wage - and treating people who do the most important jobs in society well.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2024_11_06_trump_html/content_300.html": "I set out today to discuss the Conservative Party leadership election here in the UK and the implications of our new Tory leader. However, as events have unfolded across the Atlantic, my initial plan feels a bit trivial in light of the bigger picture. Like many, I presumed—perhaps naively—that the American election would head in a different direction. Yet, here we are: Donald Trump has won.\nWhile the outcome of the Conservative leadership contest certainly holds significance within British politics, it pales in comparison to the potential ramifications of Trump’s return to power. The issues we face with certain Tory figures, however controversial or disagreeable they may be, cannot compare to the scale of dismay surrounding Trump. Unlike Conservative leaders, Trump openly denies climate change, has a history of convictions and accusations of sexual assault, and is embroiled in controversies ranging from mishandling state secrets to even more shocking accusations. Despite any criticism one might level at Kamala Harris or the American Democrats, the contrast in leadership styles and values between the two parties is stark.\nCertainly, I have my qualms with the American Democrats. They aren’t truly left-leaning, and their pro-Israel stance, particularly regarding the ongoing Gaza conflict, is far from something I align with. Nonetheless, whoever they put forward—whether it’s Biden, who many argue is too old, or Harris, with her policy positions that I can’t support—is fundamentally better for democracy than someone with Trump’s record. Here is a man who openly admits to behaviour many would find repulsive, has mused about using military force against his political opponents, and has even chosen a running mate who has questioned the voting rights of childless women. It’s a surreal scenario, almost like something out of a dark political satire.\nWhen Trump lost the last election, he didn’t just concede quietly; he attempted a coup. The images of him hoarding classified documents in his bathroom, allegedly sharing secrets with foreign powers, paint an astonishingly grim picture. Meanwhile, figures like Elon Musk and other so-called ‘crypto bros’ are aligning themselves with Trump, seeing in him an easily manipulable figure who could serve their interests. It brings to mind the oligarchs in 1990s Russia, only this time it’s in America, with the ultra-wealthy vying to consolidate power.\nSome might try to dismiss this outcome with the assurance that it’s only four years, and people will see reason in time. Yet, America’s political landscape doesn’t work that way. The politically appointed Supreme Court is already stacked in the Republicans’ favour, and within the next four years, Trump could appoint additional justices. This would likely solidify a hard-right majority, capable of dismantling rights and protections long held dear by many Americans. Even if something were to happen to Trump, his influence would remain entrenched in the judiciary and the Senate for years, shaping policy far beyond his own tenure.\nWhat’s particularly staggering is that this time, Trump might even have won the popular vote, a feat he didn’t achieve in his first election. It’s baffling to think that so many could support a figure who openly disregards democratic principles and exhibits disdain for so many groups within his own voter base—women, non-white citizens, and immigrants, to name a few. It’s enough to make Brexit seem like a minor hiccup in comparison.\nWhile I still hold the belief that people are generally decent, albeit sometimes misled, today has sorely tested that faith. Watching the outcome of this election unfold, I find myself deeply concerned about what lies ahead. America’s leadership doesn’t only impact its own citizens but has a ripple effect on global issues—especially the climate crisis and conflicts in places like Ukraine.\nIn any case, here we are on November 6th, faced with an unpredictable and turbulent path ahead. Perhaps, when the dust settles, I’ll muster the energy to revisit the topic of the Tory leadership. But for now—well, let’s just brace ourselves.\nTo receive my new politics posts directly by email or in the Substack app, please subscribe",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2014_07_09_glastonbury-roundup_html/content_200.html": "I’ve been going to the Glastonbury Festival for around 15 years now, and I always thoroughly enjoy it. I have to admit that as I get a bit older I do like my luxuries though - this year I had the amazing luxury of my camper van. A huge awning, a proper bed, running water, my own toilet… it’s almost unrecognisable from my years spent shivering in tents or covered in mud for five days straight!\nNeedless to say, the festival itself was as excellent as ever. This was the first year I didn’t actually go around the whole site - I didn’t once walk in the area from the ‘right’ of the Pyramid stage up to and including the Other Stage, so I didn’t even set eyes on the Dance Village etc. Why? Well, partly because the weather made walks for the sake of walking a bit of a pain, but mostly because there was just so much to do in the ‘Avalon’ side of the Avalon/Babylon world.\nOne thing I knew that I could not miss was the tribute to Tony Benn at LeftField. Billy Bragg, Michael Eavis and Benn’s son and granddaughter gave very moving speeches. I have to say, I did feel myself welling-up a bit, and there were tears around the packed tent. Tony Benn was always worth seeing at Glastonbury, and it won’t be quite the same without him.\nThere were many good debates at LeftField this year, and it’s always brilliant to be around so many people who want change and to make Britain fairer and more progressive, and they’re mostly younger than me so the future is bright! Every year there is huge enthusiasm for the Greens and despair at what the government is doing and the rise of deeply unpleasant parties such as UKIP. While there is of course an element of ‘preaching to the converted’ at Glastonbury, it does indeed ‘recharge your activism’, as the LeftField slogan says.\nAs always, I spent quite a lot of time in the Speaker’s Forum in the Green Futures field. There were some excellent and inspirational talks again, with a good speech by Green Party leader Natalie Bennett as well as Jenny Jones, who gave a good talk on the very worrying and very murky world of undercover policing in lawful protest groups and NGOs.\nAs well as political and environmental talks there were also some purely interesting ones, mostly at the new ‘Free University of Glastonbury’ up at the Crow’s Nest. I’ve always had a soft spot for Professor Alice Roberts, but that wasn’t necessary to think that her talk on evolution was really excellent. She’s a brilliant science communicator and also just a generally friendly and excellent person. Who wouldn’t warm to someone who gives an excellent science talk then later that night bops around along with you to punk band Anti-Flag?\nThere was also some excellent comedy. Jeremy Hardy was brilliant as ever, and I caught Marcus Brigstoke’s Policy Unit (with Phil Jupitus, Josie Long and Nick Doody), Arthur Smith, Mark Steel and a few others. I miss the days when Stewart Lee was a regular Glastonbury feature, but there you go - times change.\nAnd so the music! Yes, lots of good stuff. The only thing I saw on Pyramid were Elbow, who were excellent. As I said previously, as I get older I lose patience with hanging around miles from the front of the stage having to watch it on the big screens. The atmosphere is good, but if you’re on your own there’s little point - better to catch the main stage acts on telly afterwards. There are literally dozens of stages on the site where you can be right up in the action, so that’s where I stayed this year. It was also conveniently away from the mud and rain.\nJust a quick mention of the rain - it was in no way as bad as it has been in ‘wet’ years, but I have honestly never seen rain as huge as that which fell on Friday during and after the impressive thunder storm. It was that big, fat, warm rain that you get in rainforests. I’ve never seen the like in the UK. Crazy.\nSo anyway, musical highlights included (in no particular order) old staples I’ve seen before such as Billy Bragg, Elbow, The Bad Shepherds, Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott, Flipron and Suzanne Vega, as well as some bands and artists which were new to me, including AlbaRoma (excellent gypsy punk), the WooHoo Revue (an Australian band that I can’t really describe but were excellently manic) and Kate Tempest - a genre that really isn’t my sort of thing but was really, really excellent. I’m sure there were others - I saw dozens - but those are the ones that most stick out in my mind.\nAnd so another year of Glastonbury is over. I don’t know if I’ll be able to go next year, so I tried to really make the most of it. If you haven’t been you owe it to yourself to try it at least once - it’s like nothing else on Earth.\nYou can see the rest of my photos here",

Surely the most rational approach to education is to maintain smaller local schools based in the communities they serve, avoiding the problem of children trekking across town to huge impersonal institutions, adding to congestion, pollution and traffic misery. Isn’t it better for children to be able to walk to school with their neighbours?\nSadly, this rational approach is not possible thanks to the people losing democratic control of education. Free schools and academies are simply vehicles for a small number of people to profit from state education, and an abdication of responsibility by government. Academies, introduced by Labour and embraced by the Tories and Lib Dems, remove the democratic voice of the most important people - those whose children use the schools.\nOnly the Green Party will abolish Free Schools and academies, stop our schools being used for profit and bring them back into local democratic control so that they are accountable to parents and the community.\nDominic Tristram Green Party Candidate for Bath 2015",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2015_07_09_budget_html/content_169.html": "After much speculation we now know the details of the first all-Tory budget for some time. It was always going to be bad for the less wealthy and anyone who depends on help from the state, but just how bad is it?\nBenefits ‘Cap’\nFirstly, let’s think about the purely ideological cuts that even the Tories don’t believe will achieve anything other than ‘good PR’ with a certain section of society. The most harmful is the ‘benefits cap’ - a hard limit of £20,000 in social security payments per household. This will apply whether or not anyone is in work, sick or disabled, and irrespective of how many children and dependents they have. As Green MP Caroline Lucas points out, it might not even be legal. And, as she says, the supposed ‘opposition’ Labour Party is not even opposing it.\nTax credits and Benefits Freeze\nEven taking into account possible higher wages, people receiving tax credits will be significantly worse off. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that the group who will lose the most will be those who are in work but on low incomes.\nWorking people on lower incomes are hit with a bit of a ‘double whammy’ because not only are they going to lose their tax credits, but they are the group most likely to depend on other working-age benefits to supplement their income, and these benefits are going to be frozen from next year. This means a real-terms decrease in things like child benefit and most housing benefit - benefits have already faced a real-terms cut annually since 2013.\nThe Resolution Foundation is an organisation that campaigns for low and middle-income families. Their chief executive Gavin Kelly said “We shouldn’t think that a higher minimum wage will compensate all low income working families for their losses - many working households will be left significantly worse off”. They also warned that the changes will weaken the incentive both to enter work, and earn more.\nThe ‘National Living Wage’\nWhile George Osborne is not an economist he is quite a canny PR man. He announced a reasonable increase in the minimum wage (although not by as much as we are calling for). The cunning trick however was to call it a ‘National Living Wage’, which has effectively ‘stolen’ the phrase from the progressive side of politics, and has got to have really irritated the Living Wage Foundation.\nTheir statement on the budget makes some good points, but the main one is that the ‘National Living Wage’ that Osborne wants for 2020 isn’t even up to the level of today’s Living Wage in London. By 2020 this is likely to be true outside London as well, and of course with the cuts to Tax Credits the amount required for a Living Wage will actually increase. It has been estimated that with the various cuts announced in the budget a realistic Living Wage is up to £12 today.\nWhile any increase in the minimum wage is to be welcomed, this is not a Living Wage. And let’s remember, like many other Tory changes to benefits those under 25 won’t get this new increased minimum wage, for reasons which are largely inexplicable if you discount ‘because they don’t vote Tory’.\nPublic Sector and NHS\nTeachers, nurses, doctors and other vital workers heard the unwelcome news that they are to face another four years of real-term pay cuts. That’s on top of the five years they have already suffered.\nThis just shows the contempt of the Conservatives for our vital public services. There is a recruitment crisis for many of these jobs, especially nurses. Just how the Tories think that cutting their pay is going to help is anyone’s guess. Let’s be honest - this is all about getting people to leave the public sector by making it increasingly unpleasant to work for.\n“Britain needs a pay rise”, Osborne says. Yes it does, but the Tories don’t want that to apply to the public sector.\nStudents and Young People\nStudents have been hit with a couple of nasty shocks. Firstly we’ve seen the abolition of maintenance grants for poorer students, resulting in the increased burden of debt on the poorest in society. We’ve also seen the lifting of the cap on tuitions fees, meaning that universities will be able to charge more than £9,000. And they will.\nIt was interesting during the General Election campaign. I did a couple of hustings at Bath University which went well, and there were some very positive polls, with the Greens clearly in the lead. However, the Tories were in second place. For the life of me I can’t understand the mentality of a student who votes Conservative - nothing they offered students was attractive, and yet a considerable number vote for them. I can only imagine that it’s a misplaced aspiration assumption along the lines of ‘I’ll be rich one day, so I’ll vote for policies that favour the rich’ while at the same time ignoring the fact that they are definitely a student and will definitely have a student loan, and the Tories have the worst policies for those.\nBut we are where we are, and students are going to be hammered for five years. And it’s not just them of course - we’ve seen that people under 25 are going to lose out on vital benefits which will limit their personal development and ability to live independent lives.\nInheritance Tax\nWe knew before the budget that we’d see a cut in inheritance tax, so it was no surprise when it was announced. However, it is worth mentioning that at a time were we all have to apparently tighten our belts the people who don’t have to are those benefiting from an unearned income of up to a million pounds.\nIHT of 40% is currently payable on estates over £325,000, and this is doubled to £650,000 for couples. To put this into perspective, only 3% of estates currently pay any IHT at all, so it is not a ‘burden’ that the vast majority of us will ever have to worry about. To increase the limit only helps the very richest. Not only that, but it will drive property prices up because there will be less reason for people to sell to pay the taxes due.\nIt’s worth noting that not everything that is inherited is subject to IHT anyway. Some exclusions are unquoted shares, business investment and heritage assets - exclusions that enable the very wealthiest to avoid a lot of tax in the first place. We need to ensure that the various schemes used to avoid IHT are stopped.\nIf the Tories genuinely want to reward ‘hard work’ then they would indeed reform IHT, but they certainly wouldn’t be raising the tax free limit. The Green policy of taxing individual inheritances instead of the estate would be a start (and I’ve never heard a decent argument against it), but if we really want a society where people ‘deserve’ their wealth and get on by their own efforts then we need to reduce inherited wealth, not increase it.\nClimate and Environment\nWe’ve already seen the Tories halting expansion of our cheapest source of renewable energy, onshore wind. Renewables have now been hit with a new cost, and it’s ridiculous - they will now be subject to the Climate Change Levy. This is a charge made on carbon- emitting energy production as an incentive to move to renewables. Well, it was until now. There is no logic behind the decision to apply it to renewables, other than to make them less attractive to investors. One can only assume this was done to please Tory donors in the fossil fuel industry as I honestly can’t see any other reason for it.\nWe’ve also seen a redefining of the way vehicle duty works and an earmarking of funds for road-building programmes. We know that building roads simply generates more traffic. If we want a sustainable transport policy we need to be investing in other modes of transport and infrastructure changes that reduce road use, not increase it.\nConclusion\nThe government billed this budget as one for ‘working people’, but again we’ve seen that actually the people who have done best from Tory policies aren’t those that ‘work hard and get on’, but those who are already wealthy or who don’t work for their wealth at all. We’ve seen not only the increase in the tax free IHT allowance, but also a tax free allowance for dividends. Unearned income has consistently been treated favourably to earned income - what does this tell us about the society the Conservatives want?\nTo be fair there were a couple of positives - the end of relief on buy to let mortgage interest for one. But its not much, and it was massively offset by attacks on the poorest and most vulnerable.\nHowever saddened we may be, we should not be surprised. Let’s ensure we use our anger as an energy for change.",

This is an opportunity for us all to celebrate and, importantly, promote small businesses - specifically (as it is a Saturday), shops.\nBath is incredibly fortunate in that is has a large number of independent shops. Some of them have prepared special gifts for customers tomorrow (first come first served!) - you can see a list of the shops involved here. I encourage you to pop along to as many as you can and make the most of the effort that our lovely local shops have gone to. Then, of course, continue to go to them next time you’re in town!\nThere are many good reasons to shop with independent businesses. Not only is money spent in the community more likely to stay in the community, but smaller businesses employ proportionately more staff, are more likely to buy from other local businesses, and are much more likely to pay all taxes due. It is also much better for the environment for people to shop close to where they live - the only way to create a sustainable society is for most goods to be available locally for most of the people.\nSustainable industries are most likely to be small businesses, not-for-profit enterprises, charity or community-based organisations, publically owned or mutuals. Scaling up might be through social franchises, with local ownership and control.\nOf course, it is a core philosophy of the Green Party to promote shopping locally and to prefer independents over large corporations with their dodgy tax practices and offshoring. We have always and will continue to campaign for tax relief for small businesses, and we have a significant number of policies designed to promote and help them. For example, small businesses in the UK find it difficult to get timely access to external funds and affordable interest rates. We would create Community Banks which would have funds available for local activities. They would give local firms and co-operatives access to funds managed locally and supplied at preferential rates. Community scale investment could also be supported through the creation of community currencies which could be supported by local councils.\nPromoting and using small business is something I try to do every time I need to buy anything, regardless of whether I am fighting an election or not. It’s easy for politicians to claim to ‘support local businesses’ but not actually do so, especially when they belong to parties with ties to huge corporations. We are the only party that does not receive funding from those large companies and therefore have not been compromised.",

First weren't running the bus from Bath this\nyear (boo!), so I got a train to Temple Meads and the shuttle bus from there. It all went\npretty smoothly, and even though it started pouring with rain just after I got on the bus,\nit was sunny by the time we arrived on-site about 40 minutes later. They've sorted-out the\ntraffic this year, so only buses could go through Pilton. I don't know where the cars were\nsent, but it made the bus a lot quicker not having to sit in all the plebby car traffic.\nHurrah!\nI'd sent my tent up and had a cup of tea by about 1:30pm, so I headed off to find some\nmusic. I spent a lot of time at the Small World Solar Stage\nwhere I caught Crystal Masters (sort of bluesy/country stuff),\nCeleste Lovick (who I thought was\nexcellent - I bought one of the CDs she was selling), and Cornelius. I spent the rest of\nmy Wednesday poking around the Green Fields and enjoying the site in its pre-mud state.\nShrek III was inexplicably cancelled in the evening, but hey ho.\nOn Thursday there was a big fire at a scrap-yard outside the site, but the huge amounts of\nblack smoke that hung\naround in the sky all day provoked some debate. I had discussions with random people\nabout everything from 'terrorist attacks on music' to 'Street is on fire', but thankfully\nall were false. I spent most of the day catching the bands playing on the Bandstand,\nincluding The Doubtful Guest,\nwho were as good as ever.\nFriday kicked-off with breakfast at Henry's Beard, then\nKate Nash on the Pyramid stage.\nI don't really know much about her, but she was ok. I stuck around for\nThe Subways\n(who were unimpressive) and Get Cape, Wear Cape, Fly,\nwho were ok. I then trundled off to the Other stage to catch\nVampire Weekend,\nmainly thanks to people going on about how good they are. They were ok, but I think they\nsuffered from the immediate downer that my brain adds to any Other Stage performance. I\nwandered-off to the Green Futures field to watch\nCaroline Lucas\nwipe the floor with some Tory in a debate entitled 'Can the Tories Deliver A Green\nAgenda?', one of a number of interesting events\nin that tent. I then strolled over to the Avalon stage to catch Hazel O'Conner, which was\nsuprisingly good. I then caught a strange act called 'Dancing On Your Grave' by\n'The Cholmondleys and the Featherstonehaughs',\nfollowed by a cute singer/songwriter called Hera from Iceland/New Zealand (another set I\nliked enough to buy the CD afterwards). There then followed a few hours of managing not to\nmeet-up with some friends, but I did catch the surprise Franz Ferdinand set on The Park\nstage.\nSaturday morning saw the site beginning to dry-up a bit after the rain on Friday, with the\nPyramid Stage not looking too bad.\nFirst up was Shakin' Stevens,\nwho was pretty poor actually. For some reason he now refuses to sing 'Green Door', which\nleaves 'This Old House' as the only song anyone cares about. Martha Wainwright was up\nnext, and she was suitably barmy. I didn't catch her whole set though as I had to be at\nthe Leftfield for 12:30 to catch\nSeize The Day, who\nwere as excellent as ever. Immediately after them came the mighty\nFlipron, who I've\nprobably seen almost as many times now as I've seen anyone. Then it was back to the\nPyramid to see the ever excellent Crowded House,\nfollowed by a bit of James Blunt\n(who really isn't that objectionable - I don't know why he gets so much stick). It was\nthen time for a comedy break, so I went to the Cabaret tent to see Simon Munnery, Jeremy\nHardy and Mitch Benn - all excellent as usual. Jeremy Hardy just doesn't do enough\nstand-up. Then it was off to the Jazz World stage to see\nImagined Village,\nwho had Billy Bragg on for a bit. I can't really remember the rest of the evening thanks\nto cider overload, but I think I saw Massive Attack. I definitely ignored Jay-Z.\nSunday morning brought another very pleasant breakfast at Henry's Beard in the\nGreen Fields, then\non to the Pyramid stage to see Marina Topley-Bird.\nI also caught Scouting For Girls\non the Other Stage, before heading to the Pyramid Stage to get a spot for Leonard Cohen.\nI caught the end of the unimpressive Neil Diamond\nand the better than expected Goldfrapp,\nbefore the highlight of the festival, Leonard Cohen.\nHe was blinding, as expected... and I've managed to see him live! I never thought I would.\nAll is well with the world.\n>Monday was lovely and sunny. I spent a good few hours strolling around and poking at the\n(now much quieter) markets. It really was a lovely, sunny day. After the nightmare of last\nyear's departure (thanks to See Tickets awful bus planning, the weather, early starts, and\nother rubbish), this year was about a million times better.

Alongside me were Tessa Munt (Lib Dem), Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con), Thangam Debbonaire (Labour) and Steve Stanbury (UKIP).\nIt was an interesting evening. The audience were probably the most vocal of any hustings or debate I’ve done. There was lots of shouting and booing (not at me, thankfully!) and it was difficult to hear the chair and other panellists sometimes, although it doesn’t sound as bad on the telly.\nWhile I was pleased to be invited, I felt that I wasn’t given as much time as the other panellists, plus I had to contend with assertions about our policies from the chair when I don’t think the others had to, as well as tiresome ‘how are you going to pay for that?’ questions that the others didn’t get. It wasn’t just me - that was the general feeling on Twitter too. Such is life I suppose, but it was disappointing as we have a lot of very different policies on things like the NHS that I didn’t have an opportunity to get across.\nHowever, I think it was a good opportunity for raising my profile and definitely worth doing overall. Rees-Mogg got a lot of stick but was his usual self, the UKIP chap was ‘very UKIP’, and Debbonaire was saying things that were popular but well to the left of what her party actually believes, as is increasingly common with Labour. I’ve always admired Tessa Munt for having firm principles on fracking etc, and in many ways it’s a shame that she’s going to lose her seat to a Tory who will obviously be very pro-fracking.\nIt was good to get some TV in and wider exposure. The BBC production team were all lovely and my only real regret was that it was so short - there was so little time that it was never likely that we’d all get enough time to get our points over. This is true in all hustings to some extent of course, but this was the shortest of all.\nYou can watch the ‘background’ video for me that the BBC broadcast here.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2013_03_20_budget_html/content_292.html": "Today George Osborne revealed his latest budget. There were no huge surprises - the economy is considerably worse than predicted yet again, and potentially positive-sounding news about borrowing not rising this year turned-out to be the same sort of ‘creative accounting’ that the government mocked the Brown government for. Basically, austerity has made the economy flat-line, and we’ll be lucky to avoid a triple-dip recession in this, the worst economic performance the UK has given for the last 100 years.\nBut it’s not all doom and gloom… or so the government would like us to think by making a few transparently crowd-pleasing announcements. There’s the unexpected drop of 1p on a pint of beer, and a more-or-less expected drop of the fuel escalator. The beer thing is a ridiculous move that doesn’t really benefit anyone individually (who will notice?), but as a nation will cost a good few nurses salaries. The 3p rise in fuel duty not only reduces money coming to the Treasury, but does nothing to combat congestion, pollution and climate change. While this is not surprising from our current government, it is an expensive, populist and pointless move however you look at it.\nThe rise in the personal allowance to 10,000 pounds earlier than planned is a good thing, as it reduces the tax burden on the poorest. However, this is really offset by mad policies such as giving money to households earning up to 300,000 a year for childcare but not giving it to the poorest.\nThen, of course, there’s the extension of the public sector pay cap of 1% for another year, along with a new provision to stop increases in pay when staff move up bands. It’s a sorry sign of how much this government values its nurses and teachers that by the next general election they will have received an effective 10% pay cut. To put this is perspective, today Barclays announced it was paying nine bankers a combined bonus of 39 million pounds. It seems that nursing the sick and educating our children deserves a pay cut, while fixing the Libor rate deserves more money than the average person receives in a lifetime.\nThere we also moves to provide interest-free loans for house purchasers, with purchasers only having to find a 5% deposit. Industry experts have pointed-out that this is likely to lead to an increase in property prices, making the problem of Britain’s massively over-valued housing supply even worse. Even so, you may think that this is government action aimed at helping people who can’t afford a house, but is this true? It seems that it applies to everyone, including landlords with existing property portfolios. So is this yet another bung for rich friends of the government? Let’s remember that there’s only a housing crisis for the poor because the Thatcher government sold-off all of our council housing for a knock-down price in the 80’s, and in some areas landlords own up to 40% of these houses we all paid for to help the poorest in society.\nThere are a few other items - a less publicised move to help the already wealthy was the cut in stamp duty on AIM trading. It’s good to know we’re all in this together. How many libraries will that cost? Schools and the NHS will ‘be protected’, even though they haven’t so far, with both receiving cuts in real terms throughout this parliament. Then there are tax allowances for shale gas investments, even though most experts agree that shale gas in the UK is a non-starter. This, and the failure to raise fuel duties, make this one of the most environmentally irresponsible budgets for a long time.\nGeorge Osborne already has the worst economic prediction accuracy of any chancellor in recent times. Who believes him now? Why does he think that the policies that have so spectacularly failed to achieve his aims so far are suddenly going to start working now? Meanwhile, the wealth continues to flow from the many to the few. A cynic might think that actually everything is going rather according to his plans.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2018_03_21_facebook-data-harvesting_html/content_233.html": "There are a lot of people who seem surprised that the data they have given Facebook might have been used for purposes they didn’t know about. Its not surprising, and while the current news is about an example that breached Facebook’s rules, there’s a lot of other stuff that even though it doesn’t, many people would probably still be upset about (and which they actually agreed to at some point).\nI’ve worked on applications that use the Internet and analysis of data gathered from Internet use and social media for over 25 years, in the private sector, the public sector and just for fun. It has always been about capturing user data, to a greater or lesser extent. Don’t think this will go away or change, and don’t think it’s all necessarily bad. Just be aware of it.\nThere is a simple rule on the Internet - if something is free to you but someone is making money out of it, you (or more accurately data about you) are the product. If you always remember that then you can’t go too wrong.\nIt’s not just basic Facebook functions that gather data - in fact they aren’t the thing people have got upset about here - it’s the apps and games people choose to play and which ask for additional permissions (‘The application blah wants to access your data - is this ok?’). It costs time and/or money for people to write those ‘personality type’ quizzes. What do they get out of it? Your data. What do they want to do with it? Who knows? And you might never know - they could be anywhere in the world, so they could well be somewhere where your data isn’t protected by law or what you agree to anyway. If you don’t like any of this then don’t think Facebook is your only problem. Almost everyone is tracking you and gathering data these days, but the more ‘free’ services you use from companies that make a profit the more exposed you will be. So what can you do?\nOnly used paid or non-profit services and products, for everything. Where there is no comparable paid service, use anonymising tools. For example, setting your search engine to DuckDuckGo will help. This is one of the default options on the iPhone, and probably Android too.\nSpeaking of phones, why do you think Google give Android away for free? They sell your data. It’s the same with email, from anyone. If it’s free then your email will be scanned and data harvested. Start using an email service you have to pay for. You probably already pay for at least one - the one from your ISP. There are many to choose from.\nYou can also lessen your exposure and still use free services. Use unique services like Facebook (which offer genuine utility) and only enter data you don’t mind being harvested (and perhaps stop doing suspect quizzes!). Stop using Facebook or Google to ‘log in’ to other services, etc - just create a new account on that site. Or you could simply stop caring too much. The upshot of the current kerfuffle is that companies are using personality categories to target ads and newsfeed items to try to change your mind. Even if you could somehow delete all of your data from the Internet (which you can’t), people will always try to target ads and news. Is it really any different to what newspaper editors do? Or TV news editors? Think critically.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2016_11_12_virgin-care_html/content_226.html": "On the 11th of November Virgin Care was finally confirmed as the successful bidder to run over 200 community healthcare services in Bath and NE Somerset. This was decided by unanimous vote by the local Clinical Commissioning Group and a majority vote (35 to 22) by the Conservative-led local authority.\nAs a Green Party member I am opposed to privatisation of our NHS and running NHS or other publicly-funded health services for profit. Indeed, this is very much the view of the population of Bath, which is why I was elected as a local hospital governor in 2012 on a platform of opposing such changes. However, regardless of whether one agrees with the private sector running our health services or not, this whole deal has been a farce.\nThere has been an apparent neutering of democracy in several stages of the bidding process. One of our Green Party councillors in Bath, Lin Patterson, sits on the council’s Health and Wellbeing Select Committee. She was asked to remove herself from discussions about the Virgin Care bid as a result of signing a petition against the services going to a private provider, and the council being concerned that this might be a basis for Virgin to sue.\nOf course, there is no legal basis at all for Virgin to do so, so either the Conservatives running the council considered it as a convenient way to remove a dissenting voice, or they genuinely do fear Virgin Care, in which case they should possibly not be handing them vital healthcare services. In either case, constituents who voted for our councillor at least partly on the basis of her views on private health providers had their voices ignored.\nDemocracy was also badly served in the closing stages of the bidding process. Members of the public were not allowed to ask questions at the meeting of the CCG where it was decided to give Virgin the contract. Later at the council meeting, two motions requesting for the decision to be delayed until details of the bid could be scrutinised by the council’s Select Committee were rejected with no decent explanation.\nWhile Virgin Care have won many services around the country, the deal in Bath would be the first time any adult social care services have been run for profit. Not to allow the Select Committee to examine the detail of the proposed deal seems foolhardy, at best. The 76 page business case recommending Virgin Care to the public was published less than a week before the decision was made - hardly a lot of time for careful examination.\nThe council and CCG put much weight on the fact that Virgin Care promised to ‘reinvest any profit’ back into local services. One must question how anyone who believes that this promise means anything is in a position to decide how to spend £700m of our money. Virgin Care, like many if not all companies that win NHS work, doesn’t make profits.\nIn 2015 Virgin Care made a loss of £9.1m, much as it has for each of the last five years. There are many instances of multinational companies using elaborate structures of holding companies and loans to ensure that no taxes are paid on profits. Indeed, the ultimate owner of Virgin Care is based in a tax haven.\nProfits are being made, and to assume that they aren’t and that Virgin Care wish to lose money for seven years as some sort of public service shows those awarding this work to them are either dangerously naive or manifestly underestimating the intelligence of the public. Or, more likely, they simply don’t care that the promises are worthless.\nThe largest opposition group on BaNES council is the Liberal Democrats. Recently they have been vocal in opposing the Virgin Care bid, but this position must presumably be on a technicality in the bidding process rather than an objection in principle. After all, the Liberal Democrats voted for the Health and Social Care Act while part of the coalition government, despite it being in no manifesto and against the wishes of both the public and the medical profession. Many of us warned at the time that it would lead to the fragmentation and forced privatisation of the NHS, and for them to object to this now doesn’t seem very convincing.\nOne must take both a long term forward view and a consideration of the past to separate convenient political opposition from genuine concern over the future of our NHS. When I ran for Parliament in Bath last year I was the only candidate warning of the dangers of allowing profit-making companies access to vital services. The profit motive leads to procurement processes like this where those assessing bids seem blinded by slick marketing and meaningless promises. Once these services are in the hands of people who profit from them it will be very difficult to get them back. It is immensely frustrating when the very events some of us predicted back in 2010, when we were dismissed as alarmist, are now coming to pass.",

Think how many hospitals, operations and drugs could be bought for that much money... money which has come from the taxpayer to help the NHS, yet finds its way into the pockets of shareholders and CEOs.\nWhile it is true that the current Labour government have increased NHS funding, most of the increase has been absorbed by private companies doing things much more expensively than they could have been done under a completely public NHS. PFI deals are great if you want to use figures from one particular year to impress voters, but they are much less impressive in the long term.

As such, they advise investors and private equity firms about promising opportunities. One of the things that they advise on is the British healthcare ‘industry’.\nSo, given the Coalition promise that their Health and Social Care Act was ‘absolutely not’ about privatisation, what do you think Catalyst are telling advisers? Let’s start with this opinion piece, which is interesting reading. The first line pretty much says it all: “It’s time to put the trials and tribulations of the Health and Social Care Act to one side and emphasise the opportunities for the private sector in healthcare services.” Yes, that’s right - it’s time to put aside the fact that the Tories and Lib Dems have managed to persuade the majority of the electorate that their ‘reforms’ aren’t about privatisation, and go ahead and talk about the privatisation.\nOf course, this privatisation has been going on for some time, but you probably haven’t heard much about it. Granted, you may have heard about Circle Healthcare’s takeover of Hinchingbrooke, or maternity services in the Wirral. You may also have heard about Virgin Care’s and CareUK’s contracts with the NHS - they happened to be mentioned in the Catalyst opinion piece too.\nWhat you probably haven’t heard is that these private providers have failed numerous inspections since they started providing services. CareUK have failed 9 inspections by the Care Quality Commission this year, and yet may take over the George Eliot Hospital in Nuneaton this year. I guess failing inspections might not stop such things happening when your old Executive Director has given more than a quarter of a million pounds to the Tories.\nVirgin Care’s Woking Community Hospital was also inspected. Among other things, the Care Quality Commission’s report found patients lying in their own urine, and Virgin were judged to have failed to treat patients with respect and involve them in discussions. Of course, you didn’t hear this on the news - you only hear about ‘NHS problems’.\nThis article is a rather good summary of what has happened so far. And we can look forward to a lot more privatisation. As this Catalyst ‘Healthcare Services Sector Report’ shows, investors are lining-up to pick the flesh from the bones of the NHS. You’ll notice that the report even includes a quote from the Chief Executive of Southern Cross (at the bottom of page 5) - you’ll remember how they are a great example of private care.\nOf course, some people might say that they don’t care if the NHS is run by private companies for profit, as long as it’s ‘free at the point of use’. This is what the Liberal Democrats cling to as an excuse for voting for the NHS break-up. Interestingly, ‘free at the point of use’ has already started to change - certain Trusts have ended the right for pregnant mothers to have a 12 week scan. Some Trusts have begun denying hernia operations and treatment for varicose veins to NHS patients. Stephen Dorrell MP, the Chairman of the Health Select Committee has said that some services will be charged for and some will not. As to which will be… well, that’s a ‘postcode lottery’, thanks to the Government’s break-up of the NHS into lots of tiny, easy-to-buy pieces. And don’t think that the private sector will be competing on merit - the coalition have mandated that NHS hospitals have to each sell six services to the likes of CareUK and Virgin by next year, whether it’s cheaper, better, or more efficient… or not.\nFinally, the government are keen to point out that other countries don’t operate healthcare like we do here (or did, until recently). Interestingly, doctors in the country that most closely resembles the system we’re moving to now don’t really like it at all and want to get rid of market forces. Fancy that.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2024_11_06_trump_html/content_140.html": "I set out today to discuss the Conservative Party leadership election here in the UK and the implications of our new Tory leader. However, as events have unfolded across the Atlantic, my initial plan feels a bit trivial in light of the bigger picture. Like many, I presumed—perhaps naively—that the American election would head in a different direction. Yet, here we are: Donald Trump has won.\nWhile the outcome of the Conservative leadership contest certainly holds significance within British politics, it pales in comparison to the potential ramifications of Trump’s return to power. The issues we face with certain Tory figures, however controversial or disagreeable they may be, cannot compare to the scale of dismay surrounding Trump. Unlike Conservative leaders, Trump openly denies climate change, has a history of convictions and accusations of sexual assault, and is embroiled in controversies ranging from mishandling state secrets to even more shocking accusations. Despite any criticism one might level at Kamala Harris or the American Democrats, the contrast in leadership styles and values between the two parties is stark.\nCertainly, I have my qualms with the American Democrats. They aren’t truly left-leaning, and their pro-Israel stance, particularly regarding the ongoing Gaza conflict, is far from something I align with. Nonetheless, whoever they put forward—whether it’s Biden, who many argue is too old, or Harris, with her policy positions that I can’t support—is fundamentally better for democracy than someone with Trump’s record. Here is a man who openly admits to behaviour many would find repulsive, has mused about using military force against his political opponents, and has even chosen a running mate who has questioned the voting rights of childless women. It’s a surreal scenario, almost like something out of a dark political satire.\nWhen Trump lost the last election, he didn’t just concede quietly; he attempted a coup. The images of him hoarding classified documents in his bathroom, allegedly sharing secrets with foreign powers, paint an astonishingly grim picture. Meanwhile, figures like Elon Musk and other so-called ‘crypto bros’ are aligning themselves with Trump, seeing in him an easily manipulable figure who could serve their interests. It brings to mind the oligarchs in 1990s Russia, only this time it’s in America, with the ultra-wealthy vying to consolidate power.\nSome might try to dismiss this outcome with the assurance that it’s only four years, and people will see reason in time. Yet, America’s political landscape doesn’t work that way. The politically appointed Supreme Court is already stacked in the Republicans’ favour, and within the next four years, Trump could appoint additional justices. This would likely solidify a hard-right majority, capable of dismantling rights and protections long held dear by many Americans. Even if something were to happen to Trump, his influence would remain entrenched in the judiciary and the Senate for years, shaping policy far beyond his own tenure.\nWhat’s particularly staggering is that this time, Trump might even have won the popular vote, a feat he didn’t achieve in his first election. It’s baffling to think that so many could support a figure who openly disregards democratic principles and exhibits disdain for so many groups within his own voter base—women, non-white citizens, and immigrants, to name a few. It’s enough to make Brexit seem like a minor hiccup in comparison.\nWhile I still hold the belief that people are generally decent, albeit sometimes misled, today has sorely tested that faith. Watching the outcome of this election unfold, I find myself deeply concerned about what lies ahead. America’s leadership doesn’t only impact its own citizens but has a ripple effect on global issues—especially the climate crisis and conflicts in places like Ukraine.\nIn any case, here we are on November 6th, faced with an unpredictable and turbulent path ahead. Perhaps, when the dust settles, I’ll muster the energy to revisit the topic of the Tory leadership.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2025_01_07_labour-nhs-privatisation_html/content_147.html": "Yesterday (6th January 2025) the Labour government announced of a significant increase in the use of private healthcare providers to address NHS waiting lists. While some may argue this is a pragmatic response to backlogs, the implications of this policy confirm a deeper, more troubling shift.\nA Pattern of Privatisation\nI have long pointed to the Labour Party’s pro-privatisation stance, but this warning has all too often fallen on deaf ears, both of Labour activists and some voters. I can’t tell you how many times I have been at hustings or meetings about the NHS where people simply don’t believe that Labour, the self-styled ‘party of the NHS’ has anything but the best of intentions for it and keeping it public.\nHowever, this is not the case. Even under Corbyn (who supported the Bill as a back bencher) the Labour Party was whipped to abstain on the NHS Reinstatement Bill, which would have put removing profits from NHS service into law.\nWes Streeting, the Shadow Health Secretary, has consistently shown sympathy towards private healthcare, and the Labour Party has received sizeable donations from private health companies. Yesterday’s announcement underscores a fundamental issue: the NHS is being incrementally handed over to private firms, under the guise of efficiency and backlog reduction.\nThis is not a short-term solution. Once private providers become even more entrenched in NHS operations, they are unlikely to leave. NHS money—already stretched to its limit—is being funnelled into private pockets, with no new funding in sight. For those who argue that private providers will simply vanish once waiting lists are cleared, the reality is far from it. Their presence will likely expand, creating a system where profit motives increasingly dictate healthcare provision.\nThe Staff Shortage Problem\nOne of the key flaws in this approach is the misconception that private hospitals can offer additional capacity. Private healthcare providers do not conjure up new staff; they largely rely on NHS-trained consultants, many of whom divide their time between public and private work. As private workloads increase, NHS capacity inevitably suffers. The problem isn’t a lack of facilities but a chronic shortage of staff—a situation exacerbated by diverting personnel to more lucrative private roles.\nSkimming Profits from Routine Procedures\nEven if we were to assume that private healthcare provides genuine extra capacity, this policy creates another financial burden for the NHS. Private providers typically focus on straightforward, high-volume procedures like hip and knee replacements—the very services where NHS hospitals can generate a modest surplus to offset the losses from more complex and costly treatments, such as emergency care or cancer therapies.\nBy outsourcing routine operations, the NHS loses this vital revenue stream, making it even harder to sustain essential but less ‘profitable’ services. The result? NHS hospitals will struggle even more, while private firms profit.\nShiny Private Facilities vs. Crumbling NHS Infrastructure\nIt’s easy to see why patients might prefer private hospitals, with their modern facilities. But this shouldn’t be a choice forced upon them due to the government’s neglect of NHS infrastructure.\nMy partner works in a typical, tired and crumbling NHS hospital where wards are sometimes closed because of plumbing disasters—a problem that could easily be resolved with proper investment in capital projects. Yet, funding for such improvements is sorely lacking.\nInstead of funnelling money into private hospitals, the government should be investing in NHS facilities, expanding capacity, and addressing the maintenance backlog. Shiny private hospitals might appear appealing in the short term, but they represent a long-term erosion of the NHS’s ability to provide universal, equitable care.\nA Solution: Nationalise Private Hospitals\nThe Labour government claims there is no alternative to private sector involvement, but history tells us otherwise. When the NHS was founded, private hospitals were brought into public ownership to ensure universal healthcare. If we truly want to expand NHS capacity, the solution is simple: nationalise private hospitals and integrate them into the public healthcare system.\nThis approach would immediately bolster NHS capacity without diverting funds to profit-driven providers. Anything less is a tacit admission that the government prioritises private profit over public health.\nWhat Can You Do?\nTo combat this privatisation agenda, take action now. Write to your Labour MP or local Labour Party and express your opposition to private sector outsourcing. Make it clear that their stance on this issue will influence your vote. Even if you’ve never voted Labour, they won’t know—what matters is the pressure from constituents.\nAdditionally, consider supporting a party that unequivocally opposes NHS privatisation. As a former Green Party candidate, I believe the Greens are the only party in England committed to removing private firms from the NHS and restoring it as a public service.\nYour vote is your voice—use it to demand a healthcare system that prioritises people over profit.\nThe future of the NHS depends on our collective action. If we fail to stand against these policies now, privatisation will continue, and the core principles of our healthcare system will be eroded beyond recognition.\nVote for what you believe in, and fight for a truly public NHS.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2022_10_03_spending-cuts_html/content_85.html": "As the Tories announce another £18bn in spending cuts, I look at their continuing war on everyone except the super-rich, and how this doesn’t just hurt the poorest.\n- [Listen on Apple Podcasts]\n- [Listen on Spotify]\n- [Watch on TikTok]\n- [Watch in Instagram]\n- [Watch on YouTube]\nTranscript:\nWell, I can’t really tell you how angry I am right now. Today we’ve had the news that the Chancellor has rolled back his 45p income tax band scrapping. That’s not a victory. I mean, it’s a sort of victory, but in the overall scheme of what’s happening it almost doesn’t matter. The costs to the country of bailing out the markets and buying government bonds and stuff after the disastrous mini budget the other day is 65 billion pounds, 65 billion pounds that obviously we are all going to pay for in one way or another.\nAnd that’s ignoring the upcoming cost of living crisis, or in fact ongoing. But it’s going to get worse. Well, what’s really infuriated me today is that they’ve just announced 18 billion in public sector cuts. Now these are real terms cuts because what they’re doing is basically not changing any funding based on the massively higher than expected rate of inflation.\nSo what that means is hospitals and schools and all these other things we all need - not just that, but every public service. Everything that the government does for us and for anyone else, it’s all going to have the same money that it would’ve got if inflation stuck at a rational sort of sensible amount, which wasn’t enough in the first place as anyone who has to wait 10 hours for an ambulance can tell you, or anyone who has to wait weeks to see a GP or anything, any kind of public service and even just dealing with, getting your driving license or your passport or anything else. All of these things are public services. They don’t just affect the poor. We’re not talking about benefits here. Not that attacking benefits is a good thing in any way, but these affect everyone, rich or poor.\nPublic services are vital for everyone. Now, of course, if you are very, very rich, you can get your way around them. With private healthcare or private schooling or whatever, but they’ll affect everyone else. And 18 billion so far has a cut. So what’s that mean? That means that schools that can’t really afford to get TAs or extra teachers or refurbished leaking classrooms will have even less money to do those things.\nThe obvious conclusion to that is that they’re going to have to sack people, hospitals who can’t afford to get bank staff into do operations or run clinics. What are they going to do? The obvious answer is they’re going to treat fewer people but they’re going to have to get that money somehow.\nThis isn’t money that is spare. This is money that’s not there right now. Public services have been crumbling for 10 years and this isn’t just rhetoric. I mean, we’ve gone from, as I’ve said in a previous recording, we’ve gone from a point in 2010 where the NHS was reaching the lowest waiting times in its history.\nSatisfaction was all time high. People forget that was just before the Tories got. What’s changed since then? Yes, it’s been coronavirus, but not till 10 years after the toys got in and the services have been degrading all that time. And what’s going to happen now, Now they’ve got even less money. This is a massive real terms cut and there’s no plans to change that a government’s so insistent on doubling down.\nIt’s a gender for just transferring wealth from all of us. To the super rich. It’s not going to change. It changed the 45 P tax rate because even the people who benefited from that cut actually said it’s ridiculous. So yeah, that was a relatively cost free, although made them look ridiculous. Cost free thing for the toys to do.\nBut this, this, don’t ever think this is anything except the war against ordinary people. Not just the poor, ordinary people, poor middle class, , people who might consider that. They’ve done quite. We’re all going to pay and all of this money is going to go to the super rich it’s gotta end because this is literally going to kill people. People not going to hospital or their doctors in time. It’s already killing people. It’s going get worse. People who don’t get the care they need, when they have issues, psychological issues or mental health issues, is going to get worse.\nSchools are going to get worse. There’ll be larger class sizes. There even fewer teachers. It’s just going to be an absolute nightmare. And as sooner these disaster capitalists are booted out, the better.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2007_01_02_2007-tech-predictions_html/content_151.html": "2007 Tech Predictions\nPredicting what may happen in the coming year is one of those entertaining traditions that lots of people like to maintain, so I felt I would join in! The danger of predicting technology trends is obvious of course, but I should be relatively safe with a 12 month timeframe! So, here goes...\nOK, there are my predictions. Let's see what the year brings!\n- On its UK launch the PS3 will sell fairly well, but by the end of the year the Nintendo Wii will have the most units shipped. XBox360 will be in second place.\n- The Zune won't sell well and will quietly be dropped. I mean... who owns one? The only one I've ever actually seen 'in the flesh' was owned by a Microsoft employee.\n- Vista will finally ship (what is it... 3 years late?) to generally underwhelmed consumers. The only people who will bother with it are those who will get it bundled with their new PCs, but of course it will become the dominant OS by default. Meanwhile, Apple will release Leopard so that MS will have something new to copy (badly) for their next version of Windows. To be fair, Vista looks better than XP and will probably make my life at work (where I have no choice but to use Windows) easier, but it's very little very late, and hardly 'innovative'\n- Consumer broadband connectivity will be high enough to really start eating into TV viewing. Channel 4 have their on-demand service already of course, and once the BBC service is running I predict that people will start to drop cable and satellite subscriptions. After all, these are mostly held for the convenience of 'something good being on' when you sit down to watch, rather than the number of channels.\n- The fullscreen video iPod will launch, with moderate success. Technogeeks will love it, but most people don't want to watch video on small devices. Much more successful will be the video downloads from the iTunes store though - people can use this and still watch video on their monitors (and TVs, thanks to things like the iTV), and that's what they want. The new video iPod will simply be a channel to enable this.\n- Hardware sales of desktops and laptops will rise, but more slowly than the last few years. Most people who want a computer already own one that is powerful enough for their needs. More gaming will take place on consoles, so the major driver for more powerful computers will be lessened. The MacOS will see a modest increase its overall percentage of OSs in use, as will Linux. Mac hardware will see a good boost since people can now run Windows on it, if they must. If Leopard really does run Windows apps seamlessly then that will help too since people won't have to install Parallels, or any other third-party software.\nOK, there are my predictions. Let's see what the year brings!",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2016_03_11_nhs-reinstatement-bill_html/content_32.html": "Today was the second reading of the NHS Reinstatement Bill in the Commons. This cross-party bill basically restores the NHS by reversing the ongoing privatisation, and undoing the disasterous changes made by the Tory and Lib Dem Health Social Care Act, such as removing the responsibility of the Health Secretary for even providing healthcare at all.\nAll in all, the Bill contained measures that healthcare professionals and analysts have been calling for for years and has the backing of a large number of campaigners and politicians.\nFast forward to today and the second reading. It was ‘talked out’ by a small number of Tory MPs. This is a well-known method that is used, especially on Fridays when a lot of MPs don’t bother turning up, to stop legislation even going to a vote. It’s massively undemocratic but sadly something that happens. Thankfully it can be stopped if 100 MPs make something called a ‘closure motion’.\nHowever, without worrying about the archaic nature of Parliament, the thing to take from this is that is was obvious that at least 100 non-Tory MPs had to be there today. Senior Labour figures such as Jeremy Corbyn had previously stated support for the bill, so you would have thought that this wouldn’t be a problem, right?\nOnly 18 Labour MPs turned up. The bill was, predictably, talked-out.\nNow we can blame the Tories for their undemocratic use of parliamentary time here, of course, but the fact that they would do this was completely predictable. Who we can be angry with, completely justifiably, is Labour. If Labour had ensured that enough MPs were present they could have stopped the filibustering and taken the bill to a vote. As it was, not even Corbyn turned up.\nWould the vote have been won? That’s not essential. If a proper debate was held then Tory MPs would have been forced to publicly state how they wanted NHS services privatised - something they desperately still denied against all evidence at the last election. It would have shown them for what they are. Equally, Labour MPs who may well be in government in 2020 would be on record stating a willingness to end privatisation. Would that have held them to it? No, but it would make it more likely.\nAs it is, none of this happened. Labour MPs didn’t feel it was worth their time to try to save the NHS.\nLabour has picked-up members and the support of progressives with the promise that they have changed - that they will now oppose austerity and support public services remaining public. They had the best opportunity yet to prove that today and almost completely failed to do so.\nWhat is the lesson we should take from this? If you want politicians who will actually stand-up for the NHS, you need real progressives like Greens, Plaid and the SNP. Labour is not fit for purpose.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2011_11_24_nhs-oecd-report_html/content_279.html": "h1. Government Document Admits to NHS Privatisation\np(meta). 24 November 2011\nThe Department of Health has recently published some draft guidelines outlining support for CCG’s called Developing Commissioning Support: Towards Service Excellence. This report makes interesting, and rather worrying, reading. In summary this document is a direct statement of NHS privatisation and how it will happen. But you don’t have to take my word for it - let’s look at the document.\nFirst one must get through the obvious pro-reform fluff and nonsense in the language used. The longer one works within government the more one realises that far from being neutral, evidence-based documents, reports such as this are basically party political propaganda dressed as fact. You can see this within the first few paragraphs of the first chapter - there’s plenty of talk of aspirations to make the NHS deliver “health outcomes among the best in the world” and how the new Clinical Commissioning Groups will help the NHS improve “best value for money”. All noble aims? Perhaps, but what it doesn’t mention is the fact that the NHS already provides these things.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently published its regular Health at a Glance report comparing healthcare in major economies. It shows that the NHS is performing exceptionally well with comparable statistics to the rest of Europe for life expectancy, but with less paid per capita than almost all other healthcare systems. These findings are in line with November’s Commonwealth Fund survey, which showed the NHS as one of the best healthcare systems in the world, the one that performed best of all on the co-ordination of care for patients, patient safety, and the way in which patients are engaged in their care.\nSo by all independent, international comparisons the NHS is doing very well. What does the government think its ideological shoehorning-in of the private sector, with no basis in evidence, will achieve? Perhaps someone charitable might think that even if it doesn’t help, it can’t really hurt? Think again. Mark Pearson, head of health at the OECD, told The Guardian “The UK is one of the best performers in the world. But outcomes are not what you expect because there is a big reform every five years. We calculate that each reform costs two years of improvements in quality. No country reforms its health service as frequently as the UK … But there’s no big reform that will improve it. Better to let it bed down and tinker rather than wondering about more or less competition. It is less the type of system that counts, but rather how it is managed.”\nWith the lack of any evidence that changes to the NHS will make it better, the only logical conclusion is that the changes are ideological. The government strenuously denies that it’s all about privatisation and favours to donors, but it obviously is. There’s the Circle takeover of Hinchingbrooke that I mentioned previously, where a hospital is being given to Circle Healthcare, a tax-haven based company run by Tory donors, and then there’s yet more evidence in these guidelines just published. Dr Jonathan Tomlinson, an east London GP and blogger, told Channel 4 News: “The document says that GPs who are wanting to design services from their patients will have to get support from private companies. However that support is so comprehensive as to include absolutely everything that commissioning involves … In other words, looking at the needs of their local population, choosing and designing the services that they need, managing the contracts, monitoring the quality. There’s almost nothing left for us to do. And it even goes so far as saying that they can see a role for GPs perhaps in managing learning difficulties or other small local community services but even then private companies will be doing the directing.”\nA Department of Health spokesman told Channel 4 News that it was wrong to claim the NHS was to be privatised and that document was quite simply about back office functions. But again, as with Circle, what is privatisation if it’s not taking something currently run by the State as a service (commissioning) and handing it to the private sector to run at a profit?\nThe government attempted to sell the changes to the NHS as a way to hand control of commissioning to GPs and ‘family doctors’. That didn’t really make sense (GPs are not necessarily good at management), but it was at least an attempt to explain the changes as something other than the outright privatisation that they actually are. Now, with GPs realising that they will effectively have no control with large multinational consultancies such as KPMG running commissioning, the truth has started to hit home.\nResponding to the OECD report, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said ““Improving patient results is a top priority for me. We need to allow the NHS to focus on what really matters to patients; things like survival rates, recovery rates and whether people can live independently and with dignity.”, conveniently ignoring the fact that the OECD thinks the changes will make healthcare worse and cost billions. He knows this, of course, but improving the NHS isn’t really his objective - it’s the carving-up of it into chunks that can be sold. It has started with ‘back-office functions’. It won’t stop there.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2023_02_23_15-minute-cities_html/content_184.html": "Why have the Right suddenly started attacking plans to create cities where people live close to essential services?\n@dominictristram 15 Minute Cities and Conspiracy Theories\n♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nSo on Tuesday evening, 21st of February, , there was a protest outside the Guildhall in Bath against cuts to subsidised bus routes. A lot of Northeast Somerset is fairly remote from Bath, but people need to go in for hospitals and that sort of thing.\nAnd a lot of them depend on the bus service, especially if they don’t have cars. And the council has decided to basically cut all of those, and keep all the ones in Bath itself. Now, within Bath, it’s a small city. You can pretty much walk everywhere. You might not like it, but you can.\nWhereas if you live in some of the smaller villages in Northeast Somerset, you can’t. So it’s basically cutting off people’s lifelines. Definitely non drivers. So it’s a valid thing , to protest about, so a protest was organised for that outside the Guild Hall, which coincided with the evening of the full council meeting.\nNow, unfortunately, this was slightly hijacked by anti 15 minute City protestors. And that brings me really onto my main point for this video, which is, 15 minute cities and the strange and very sudden campaign by the right to attack them . Now, in case you’re not aware, the 15 Minute City concept basically says that everyone who lives in a city or I guess large town, should have all of the services they need for day-to-day life within 15 minutes of where they live, by walking or cycling.\nSo , shops, schools, doctor’s surgery, dentist, that sort of thing. Pretty much what life used to be like, now this is, , brought some very odd people outta the woodwork. Looking at some of the protestors on Tuesday. You saw people with very much coordinated placards saying something like democracy now, it’s some sort of coordinated anti 15 minute movement and it’s suddenly been whipped up by the sort of people who went on anti-vax protests and, rather than anything rational.\nIt’s about some imagined kind of ‘locking them down’ in to where they’d live somehow. And then that’s mixed with a healthy dose of antisemitism. Bear in mind anything about George Soros is basically antisemitism. They’re just saying Jews, it’s another word for Jews.\nIt’s the usual kind of hard right conspiracy theory nonsense that we’re getting more and more in everyday life now. And I guess it has always been bubbling under the surface, but the difference now is there’s actually been Tory MPs standing up in parliament saying the same sort of stuff, that this is some sort of great conspiracy to get people to, I don’t know, what - stay at home?\nI dunno, who would benefit from that conspiracy of giving you shops and schools close to where you live, but apparently it’s communists or something. And then there’s all sorts of other things woven into it, like s ome sort of United Nations programme?. The more you dig into conspiracy theories and the madness around them, the more you just can’t really believe that anyone with any kind of sense of logic or intelligence could ever fall for them. It’s like the anti-vaxxers. You might have valid reasons to be concerned about any medicine. Of course you might. But when people start talking about Bill Gates putting microchips in vaccines, it’s so immediately obviously rubbish that you’re amazed that so many people somehow buy into it and it’s no surprise that you see anti-vaxxers are now largely the same people protesting against 15 minute cities - protesting against something that entirely and utterly is meant to help them and improve their lives, and they somehow think that’s some sort of attack on them. I’ve said to them, what don’t you like about the, , ability to live somewhere where you can access services?\nAnd I’ve had one guy say to me, “I prefer driving. I like my car. I don’t want things to be close to where I live”. And when you’re dealing with that kind of logic,\nIt’s gone beyond debate. People say to you, oh, you shouldn’t dismiss people with these concerns you should listen to their viewpoints. But at what point do we say as a society and certainly as someone in politics, it’s not something I want to listen to because it’s so clearly nonsense.\nWhy should I waste my time? Talking to somebody who thinks George Soros wants you not to drive to the shops, why? Why? Why is that something that I should even contemplate debating as if it’s a valid viewpoint and when you’ve got Tory mps. And I have to say, it’s not just mps, but the local Conservatives in Bath are happy to go to these protests like them on social media, spread them, encourage them.\nI don’t believe the local Tories believe this for one second. But again, they’re weaponizing people who are easily led. They’re weaponizing conspiracy theories, just like Trump did. Of course, Trump didn’t believe that Hillary Clinton was running a paedophile ring from Pizza Express or whatever it was.\nTrump might be a bit of a fool, but he’s not. Entirely a fool. He’s calculating and he knows how to run an army of fools for his benefit. And it’s the same here. Local Tories want you to forget what they do as a party and what they do nationally as a party, , they try and distance themselves locally.\nBut ultimately when everything is going so wrong, it suits them. Instead of people being on the street saying, “why is it taking eight hours for an ambulance to arrive?” If there’s people on the streets instead saying, “we don’t want this thing that will help us. And here’s this mad conspiracy theory” . If they’re on the street, saying that they’re not actually protesting about something that Tories have done.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2015_12_28_new-year-message_html/content_110.html": "2015 has been quite the year. These are dark times in many ways, and we are seeing the rights and protections that have been hard-won over generations being torn away by the forces of arrogance, ignorance and greed. Who would have thought, at the turn of the millenium, that Britain would see a million people depending on food banks to survive, and the architects of that destitution voted in again with a majority?\nThe government will continue its reckless destruction of our social safety net in 2016, and it also plans a fire-sale of a huge number of our assets, more than any government in history. Selling-off profit-making assets at a loss is, of course, yet more of the economic ineptitude that this government is renowned for, and yet a friendly media somehow spins the opposition as less credible. By the time the Tories are finished we will be forced to pay profit-making monopolies to do anything - buy a house, mint coins, take out student loans - and you can bet that a significant number of these companies won’t be paying taxes in the UK either.\nAlso, as I write this, huge swathes of the country are under water as we face yet more extreme weather, entirely as predicted for decades as the consequence of our emissions on the environment. This year has been the warmest on record by quite some way, and 13 of the 14 hottest years on record have taken place this century. Yet the voice of the science deniers still grows louder in the press, causing far too many people to doubt the need for action even as their homes are flooded. It is beyond belief that in 2015, with the effect of climate change ruining thousands of lives in the UK, our government is actually making things worse with its failure to tackle flood prevention and stop destructive farming practices, halting of renewable energy and pushing for even greater fossil fuel use, including fracking under our national parks and other important areas.\nMeanwhile, the main opposition party is in disarray, busier destroying itself than standing-up for our interests. Who knows what will happen to Labour, but fundamentally it’s a party of neoliberal free-marketers who have found themselves with a leader who is close to actually being socialist. Corbyn is a decent man, but he is in the wrong party, and sympathetic members who think that his selection as leader will change it are at best optimistic.\nIt would be so easy to get depressed about all of this and give up. That is what the Tories, Murdoch and the usual suspects are counting on. In 2016 they will hope that the EU referendum will keep us occupied while they dismantle the rest of the state. The reality is that the referendum is an irrelevance compared to what our own government is actually doing, but like Labour’s leadership battles it is a gift to them as they continue their work and quietly rig democracy so that they can never lose again.\nBut we can choose not to play their game. Let’s make 2016 the year we fight them. And win. Because hear this - we can win. We can refuse to let them continue to transfer the wealth of the country to the rich and powerful. We can refuse to let them run our NHS into the ground. We can refuse to let them take away our rights at work, in public places, in the law.\nWe can stand up to them, because together we have the only thing they really fear, the only thing they can’t control - numbers. We are the many and they are the few, and ultimately this counts for more than you can imagine. Because what the 1% have in power depends on the 99% listening to them and believing them. We will never have the resources they have: the money, the media barons, the power. But those resources mean nothing if people choose not to believe them, not to listen to them, and not to bow down to injustice.\nThat is the resolution I ask you to join me in making. Help us to make 2016 the year that we open the eyes of the people to what is happening. Help others to see what is being taken away from us all and the lies we are being told to keep us compliant. Help us to take this country back from the money men to whom people are purely a vehicle for personal gain.\nThere is hope. Where this message gets a fair hearing we can win. In Bath this General Election we got the largest increase in vote share despite having a tiny fraction of the resources of the other parties. In every hustings where a poll was taken we came first. When people hear the message of hope and fairness they respond. We will never have as much money as those that place it above all else, so the way we kick them out is on the streets, through word of mouth, through people power.\nSo please, make it your resolution to help spread the word, in whatever way you can. It’s no exaggeration to say that the country, and the world, depends on it. Join our party - you’re all welcome, and we’re the only party where everyone has an equal say - ordinary people like us who don’t act for power, but to help our families, our neighbours, strangers, and the world. Not through selfishness, but for the Common Good.\nI wish you, your friends and family all the best for the New Year.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2014_09_15_scottish-referendum_html/content_12.html": "This week the country faces a major change as Scotland votes in its independence referendum. Rarely can the result of a vote have such an immediate and significant result on a country or state, so whether Scottish or not, it is of interest to all.\nIt has been an interesting campaign. For a long time the ‘no’ campaign was well ahead in the polls, and the powers-that-be in Westminster remained relatively quiet, presumably safe in the knowledge that nothing would change. However, over the last month or so the ‘yes’ campaign started pulling ahead and recently has either had a small lead or is neck-and-neck with ‘no’.\nThis has sent the apparently previously presumptuous politicians into a panic. Having denied Alex Salmond a third option, ‘devo max’, on the ballot paper, David Cameron has changed his mind. Now he, Ed Milliband and Nick Clegg have said that they will give Scotland what was being asked for in ‘devo max’ if independence is rejected. A desperate move, the result of which means that whatever the result of the referendum, more power will move to the Scottish parliament.\nSo why are we now looking at the possible victory of the ‘yes’ campaign after it lagged for so long in the polls? Obviously there is an element of people not deciding until close to the ballot, but some blame has to lie with the ‘no’ campaign. Not only has it been relentlessly negative, attempting to scare people with stories of job losses, rising prices, or not allowing them to use the pound, but to do so it has been wheeling-out politicians hated by the Scots (and a lot of other people), George Osborne, Cameron, and other Tories that have little to do with anyone outside the wealthy metropolitan bubble.\nI’m no PR man, but anyone can see that this was not going to work, and indeed it was likely to backfire. Scotland does not generally vote for right-wing politicians, and being the most right-wing government in memory, the current government is not popular there. Having figures such as Osborne telling the population that if they dare to vote ‘no’ he won’t let them use the pound simply turns previously neutral people towards independence. This isn’t unique to the Scottish referendum - many elections are lost and won by the electorate deciding to do the thing that the people they hate most don’t want them to do.\nOf course, all of the main parties and UKIP, and almost all of the press are in the ‘no’ camp. This certainly makes ‘no’ the vote that the unpopular establishment are encouraging. Obviously the SNP are pushing for ‘yes’, but they are not the only ones. We Greens are pushing for a yes vote too. We believe that all decision-making and action throughout all levels of government, including international government, should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity: namely that nothing should be done centrally if it can be done equally well, or better, locally.\nBut my support for Scottish independence is about more than a belief in local decision making. The Scots are, in general, more concerned with social justice than almost any Westminster government that is elected. There is a mood for change, and an appetite for creating their own destiny. Doom and gloom predictions of big business and establishment politicians are nothing compared to achieving the freedom to have more of a say in your own future. And remember, that future is not an eternal Alex Salmond - we don’t know what future governments the Scots may choose to elect, but whatever government they choose will be theirs, and it will represent them - probably quite accurately as they’ll almost certainly choose some sort of proportional representation. They will sink or swim by their own decisions.\nThe last time part of the UK had a referendum there were similar nay-sayers who doubted it could work. That was of course in 1919, and Ireland has done pretty well since. They’ve had their problems of course, but then which country hasn’t? Nobody seriously questions their decision to become independent. After the initial shock (to some) of a Scottish ‘yes’ vote, people will adjust just as quickly.\nAnd what of the rest of the UK? My hope is that if Scotland votes yes then a few things will happen. Firstly it will create a momentum for devolution of power within the remaining parts of the UK - perhaps an English parliament and regional assemblies. Secondly it will show people that getting engaged with politics can change things. The ‘yes’ campaign had few resources and the establishment didn’t take them seriously until very near the vote - it shows that strength of will is worth as much as the combined might of media and the establishment. Lastly, people in the remaining UK will be able to look to Scotland and see a country that used to be the same as theirs but now offers something different - a stronger voice calling for justice and fairness than for profits for the rich. If Scotland succeeds then the public in the UK can demand the same from our government - no tuition fees, no privatisation of the NHS, no ‘need’ for the City elite to call the shots. The cosy neoliberal lie that we must accept cuts to our wages and rrights while inequality balloons because ‘that’s just the way it must be’ will be shattered.\nSo good luck, Scotland. You have a once in a lifetime chance to change the path you are taking. Grasp it and don’t let go.",

NIMBYs are usually more of a bother than a benefit, since bad things (out of town supermarkets, nuclear power stations, airport expansions, etc) get pushed through anyway while good things get blocked. Wind farms are a case in point.\nBeing anti-wind farm is the default Tory position, whatever David Cameron may say. I've seen this effect myself with my parents. While naturally quite green, being paid-up Conservative members and reading the Telegraph and Spectator have taken their toll. They now have the strange flat-Earth style faith in bad science that Polly describes in the article. I guess it's inevitable if you just believe the right-wing press, but it bothers me that the Conservatives pretty much brainwash their members. 'Group think' and all that. Of course, the power of the right does come from ignorance and fear, but allowing this to help destroy the planet is going too far.\nSo, what are we to do? As the article says, a firm hand from Westminster is a good idea. It saddens me to see that some LibDem councils are just as bad and block wind farms too - they should be slapped-down for it. However, discipline from parties themselves doesn't go far enough. I think that wind farms and green energy in general should be made almost impossible for local councils to block. This sounds quite draconian, but let's face it, most people won't want one on their doorstep. It doesn't matter that they wouldn't want a nuclear power station either - those are so universally unpopular that they get forced through anyway.

If they are forced through by the government then the council won't lose votes since they can't block them anyway. Problem solved.\nWhile people are dithering about with tiny numbers of wind farms we're still killing the planet. It's time to get serious about building them on a massive scale. In the end, who cares what they look like if it means we are getting clean energy?

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2013_07_04_nhs-charges-for-visitors_html/content_211.html": "Over the last couple of days you have probably heard Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been talking about introducing an ‘NHS fee’ for non-EU nationals. It has been suggested that this will be two hundred pounds per year, payable when visas are applied for or renewed. This is required, it is suggested, to help combat ‘health tourism’, or unpaid use of the NHS by those who are not entitled to free treatment.\nIs such a fee reasonable? The NHS does, of course, already have systems in place for charging those who are not entitled to free treatment, either by claiming the fees back from the health system of the country where the person is from, or from their insurer. Even so, because in GP surgeries and (especially) in hospitals there is not a culture of having to prove who you are before you get treatment, some of these people slip through without paying. The cost of this to the NHS is estimated to be between ten and thirty million pounds per year.\nThat sounds like a lot, but is it really? One must consider the cost of implementing some sort of identity checking system at all GP surgeries (there are 8,230 in England) and hospitals (there are 168 run by acute trusts in England, plus a few dozen more run by CCGs and other organisations). Let’s consider the GP surgeries first. Let’s say some sort of ID-checking system or contract costs the surgery 10,000 pounds a year, that’s 82,300,000 pounds. Woah! Suddenly we’re paying at least 2.5 times the ‘lost’ money. Let’s be generous to the government and say the system is a tenth of that - 1,000 pounds. That’s still 8,230,000 pounds. Let’s face it though, it’s certain to be more. Then there is someone’s time to run every new patient through the system. If that takes half an hour or so and that member of staff is earning the national average salary, that’s 8 pounds per new patient. That might not sound much, but it soon adds-up as this is all new patients, not just immigrants or people on visas. And then, of course, we have to add the cost of checks in hospitals.\nAll in all we can be fairly sure that the cost of implementing the checks will cost considerably more than the supposed savings we can make. But is the ‘health tourism’ cost real anyway? Anyone here on a visa is paying their taxes, just as a resident is. In fact, if they’re on a working or tourist visa they’ve probably paid more tax and claimed less in benefits during their time in the UK than many born-and-bred UK residents. Why shouldn’t they receive NHS care?\nOf course, even though Hunt’s sums are almost certainly wrong, that’s not really what he cares about. It’s nothing to do with charging immigrants, it’s about introducing a charging system full stop. Yes, it will start with immigrants, and the Tories will use the rise in UKIP-style xenophobia to justify spending more on stopping foreigner’s receiving NHS care than they can save by doing so. “It’s not about the money, it’s about fairness!” they’ll cry. And then there will be a charging system in place for NHS care. Before you know it, UK citizens will start to be expected to pay towards NHS treatment, or ‘top up’ certain payments. This isn’t speculation - we must always remember that Jeremy Hunt has put his name to a number of books and papers that advocate the end of the NHS being state funded and a move to it being a system of delivery run by private insurance. Then there are Tories such as Oliver Letwin, who is Minister of State remember, who famously said in 2004 that the NHS will “cease to exist within five years of a Conservative victory”.\nSo no, the charges for holders of visas don’t make sense, but then they are not really the objective. The real agenda here is the longstanding Tory ambition to charge us all for healthcare and end universal coverage, and this is simply a way they can use the xenophobia stoked-up by people like Farage to achieve this end without too much public outcry.\nI will leave you with the thoughts of Nye Bevan, creator of the NHS, on foreigners using the NHS. It’s as true today as it was then:\n“One of the consequences of the universality of the British Health Service is the free treatment of foreign visitors. This has given rise to a great deal of criticism, most of it ill-informed and some of it deliberately mischievous … The fact is, of course, that visitors to Britain subscribe to the national revenues as soon as they start consuming certain commodities … They make no direct contribution to the cost of the Health Service any more than does a British citizen. However, there are a number of more potent reasons why it would be unwise as well as mean to withhold the free service from the visitor to Britain. How do we distinguish a visitor from anybody else? Are British citizens to carry means of identification everywhere to prove that they are not visitors? For if the sheep are to be separated from the goats both must be classified. What began as an attempt to keep the Health Service for ourselves would end by being a nuisance to everybody. Happily, this is one of those occasions when generosity and convenience march together …” (In Place of Fear, 1952)",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2013_01_06_privatised-nhs-deaths_html/content_264.html": "As 2013 begins, the Tory and Lib Dem plan to privatise the NHS is on schedule. The schedule is, you will remember, to sell-off so much of it by the next general election that whatever the next government do it will be impossible to get the NHS back again. Always remember that end game. If nothing else it helps to explain the mad rush to sell, and the massive cock-ups along the way.\nAt the moment 105 healthcare firms, including InHealth, Specsavers, and Virgin Care, have been granted “any qualified provider” status, providing a number of NHS services. Of course, each time a private firm ‘wins’ these pieces of work, the corresponding NHS service is lost. If enough NHS services are lost then that’s when you lose your hospital. You may be tempted to think that these private companies have been awarded contracts based on some excellent offer, but sadly that isn’t necessarily the case. After all, the government has told PCTs that they must put three services out to AQP. Perhaps the local NHS provider does it best? The government doesn’t care - privatisation is the agenda, and patients be damned.\nYou may be bored of me going on about this. Perhaps you think I’m overreacting? Well, before the Health and Social Care Act was passed I stated that it would actually kill people. Right now, at the start of 2013, we can be reasonably confident that it has killed at least two people so far. Firstly there’s Anita Mansi who died at a clinic offering NHS services but run by Carillion last year. As you can see from the article, it’s not only fragmentation of care that results from a number of different providers, but the profit motive which, in this case, meant that Carillion didn’t bother buying enough ventilators. If Anita Mansi had been in an NHS hospital offering a large number of services, the chances of equipment and trained staff being available would have been much, much higher. This is obvious, yet the whole drive of the Coalition reforms is to split services across a large number of ‘suppliers’. Will they all have the equipment and/or staff that are required in unusual circumstances? No.\nIt’s not just clinical services, of course. Harmoni, the private company that runs out-of-hours GP cover for 8 million people, has faced criticism after a seven week old baby died due to long waits and minimal service. Again, the incentive for Harmoni is to reduce cover to a the minimum level they contractually can. Why? The less is costs them the more they can pocket and give to their shareholders.\nNobody is arguing that profit has a place in the world. However, consider how profits are made in NHS privatisation. The private provider pretty much has to say they’ll supply the service for less than the NHS provider to win the contract. How do you outbid an offer where no profit is made and still make a profit for your shareholders? You cut something. That something is almost always staff, whether in numbers or training. Harmoni did both, and Carillion did it by not buying the equipment they might need. Of course, they had everything they had to have to win the work, but when profit is your motivation, why would you buy more?\nI will leave you with the following piece of advice. Next time you are referred by your GP for anything, always choose the NHS provider. You may be spun a yarn about waiting lists (although there is rarely much in it), but your NHS provider will be in a large hospital with pretty much every piece of medical equipment going, and experts in pretty much anything that might go wrong, right there in the same building. Not only that, but you’ll be helping to keep our NHS in public hands. That advice may just save your life.",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2013_07_22_internet-censorship_html/content_242.html": "Today David Cameron has talked about his plans to introduce controls on Internet access and search, ostensibly to crack-down on child pornography, but with a fairly broad scope that encompasses child porn, ‘extreme’ porn, and porn in general.\nThe main proposal is to oblige anyone connecting to the Internet to ‘opt in’ to access to ‘online pornography’ by the end of next year. There are a number of problems with this. Firstly, exactly what will be filtered? This is not clear, but one might assume that it would be the same sort of filtering that is applied by similar filtering software one can install at home. No automatic filtering is perfect though, so it’s almost certain that along with the majority of ‘porn’ content some other content will also be removed, including subjects such as sex education, contraception advice, and possibly rape crisis and support services. This isn’t just speculation - the Internet is full of examples of over-zealous filters blocking inoffensive content.\nIt is important to realise that a filtered Internet service is not an Internet service. As such, UK ISPs will not really be able to claim to be ‘Internet Service Providers’ at all. This might seem like a slightly pedantic point, but it is important. If you’re happy for your provider to provide you with a filtered Internet, what else are they filtering? It is beyond your control. Up until now, it’s up to you (as an adult) to determine what content you want your family members to access and install filtering software appropriately. You have control. This change will mean that it’s no longer up to you. Happy to allow your teenage children to view nudity as part of artwork? Well, maybe the government isn’t - bad luck, it’s filtered. Happy to allow sex education videos? Well, it’s not up to you any more. Sure, you can ‘opt in’ to the unfiltered connection, but then you are in the same position you are in now anyway, except now you’re on a list.\nLet’s think about that list. When ISPs ask customers to ‘opt in’ to a proper Internet connection, how many people will be comfortable doing so? We know that ISPs share all sorts of data about their customers with the government, other companies, advertisers, etc, and this list will be no exception - in fact it will almost certainly be of interest. Do you want to be on such a list? Why should people who simply want unrestricted Internet access have to ‘opt in’ to anything when they know that they will be at risk of being judged?\nYou can picture the scenario - someone is in the frame for some crime, such as Christopher Jefferies (Joanna Yeates’ landlord that the press basically decided was guilty because he looked weird). It is revealed that they are on the ‘porn list’, and BAM! That’s all of the evidence that the ‘think of the children’ brigade will need.\nHow long will it be before I need to register with the government to be allowed access to books that they consider ‘vile’? Or films? Or art? Or ideas?\n“Oh well”, you may think, “if enough of the electorate wanted this maybe we should do it? That’s democracy.” Perhaps. But guess what? Last year the Department for Education held a consultation on “parental internet controls” to elicit views from parents. Most respondents indicated that parents were quite capable of taking responsibility for the online safety of their children. There is no call from the electorate for these measures.\nLet me be clear. In the West we rightly criticise other governments, such as China, for providing their citizens with a censored version of the Internet. Cameron is proposing the same for us. He might claim it’s just porn, and that may be how it starts, but the thing about a censored Internet is that you don’t know what you can’t see. Censorship is a tool of tyranny. It’s not about pornography, it’s about control. The moment you let your government decide what you may or may not read/watch/hear, you are encouraging fascism.\nAs well as having to opt-out of censorship, Cameron is also promoting another massively illiberal measure - outlawing possession of ‘extreme porn’. This “includes scenes of simulated rape”. ‘Includes’ is an interesting word there, since it shows that includes a bunch of other things too. One must wonder who defines what ‘extreme’ means exactly, since one man’s view of something as entirely harmless and mainstream might offend someone who is somewhat more conservative. The dangerous thing here is that Cameron is proposing legislating for morals rather than anything where there is any evidence it will reduce crime. There is no question that the ‘extreme porn’ being banned is created using consenting adults (any that isn’t is obviously illegal already). The proposal is that society is judging what some people do in the privacy of their own homes, harming no-one else, to be so ‘immoral’ that they should be locked-up at the taxpayer’s expense for three years, whether or not anyone else even sees the images.\nOnce possessing this ‘extreme porn’ is outlawed, what next? Logically one must also outlaw images of fake murders, since it’s almost certain that murderers have seen such images before going out to commit their crimes. Then what about simulated drug use? You could argue the same for that. This is the slippery slope that outlawing the depiction of anything must lead us down given the logic of creating the law in the first place. We would see the end of a lot of art and most films - certainly anything with more than a PG certificate. This law could already make possession of a lot of films illegal, i.e. basically anything that contains a rape scene. “But that’s not porn!”, you might say. Isn’t it? What’s the difference? Would you be happy to defend the depiction of rape in, say, Irreversible or I Spit On Your Grave as something that nobody could derive pleasure from? They’d be pretty sick, but of course they could, just as some people could from just about anything. That is why laws like this are so insidious.\nLet’s just hope that this is just another Coalition promise to ‘crack down’ that follows their previous attempts on such things as plain cigarette packaging and minimum alcohol prices.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2007_11_04_routemasters-and-shibboleth_html/content_190.html": "Routemasters and Shibboleth\nI was in London over the weekend for a birthday party. A friend was 30 and hired a Routemaster bus to take us (along with a large amount of champagne) to watch the fireworks at Blackheath, then back to Victoria again for a slap-up feed at a Mexican restaurant. Much fun was had, and I don't think I've had quite so much champagne for some time!\nThankfully champagne doesn't seem to give me much of a hangover, so I didn't feel too bad on Sunday. I took the opportunity to catch-up with some friends while at the same time check out Shibboleth by Doris Salcedo at the Tate Modern.

Still, it was pretty busy so lots of people were obviously interested. In fact the whole place was probably about the busiest I've seen it.\nAfter looking around at a few other things that were new since I was last there we headed off for lunch at Tas at The Cut. It's the second time that we've tried to get in to The Anchor And Hope (which is meant to be one of the best gastropubs in London) but had to go to Tas instead, but hopefully I'll get to try it one day...",

It is not, as Theresa May states, right to block it only because McKinnon has Asperger’s syndrome and is clinically depressed (although this in no way counts against him). Rather, this extradition should never have been considered in the first place, whatever his mental state.\nGary McKinnon has never been to the USA. He has never committed a crime in the USA. Technically he has committed a crime in the UK - unauthorised access to a computer network. Between 2001 and 2002, from his bedroom in his parents house, he accessed 97 computers in the US without authorisation. The maximum penalty for this in the UK is two years in prison. The CPS decided that in McKinnon’s case it was not in the public interest to prosecute.\nMcKinnon managed to break into the US computers because the US military hadn’t even implemented basic security precautions - the passwords on all of the systems involved had either been left blank or at their default settings. McKinnon left messages on the systems pointing-out the weak security, but, crucially, did not steal confidential information or sabotage the US systems in any way. The only real ‘damage’ to the US military was egg on their faces once it was revealed how appalling their security was.\nThis is a crucial point. The US military are claiming that McKinnon’s actions have resulted in $800,000 of damage, yet what this amount actually covers is the work securing the systems as they should have been secured in the first place if competent people had been running them. If anything, they were lucky it was harmless McKinnon who revealed their incompetence, rather than someone who had more malicious intentions. In the eyes of the US though, the offence is the same - they want to try McKinnon as a terrorist, and potentially lock him up for the rest of his life. And remember, this is for doing something that would result in a maximum of two years in prison under the jurisdiction of the UK, where he lives.\nSo Theresa May was right to refuse extradition, but not because he has Aspergers - she should refuse it because it is blatantly unjust. The extradition treaty with the US is completely one-sided, with the US not even having to provide any evidence to the UK courts. Just think about what that means for a moment. On the say-so of a foreign government, any one of us can in theory be shipped-off to a life in prison in another country for a ‘crime’ we didn’t even commit on their soil.\nCan you imagine the reaction of the US if we asked for one of their citizens on the same basis? Not that the treaty allows that, of course, but assuming it did, do you think they would say yes? The US is of course a country that refuses to recognise the International Criminal Court, putting it in the same boat as such paragons of virtue as Israel and Sudan. The map of countries who aren’t members of the ICC shows the sort of company that the US is in.\nThis isn’t just theoretical. US citizens accused of far worse than McKinnon are rapidly brought back to the US before they can face justice, and those are where they have actually committed the crime in the foreign country. A quick review of the 1998 Cavalese cable car disaster and various events in Iraq and Afghanistan might remind you of this.\nThe debate in the Commons after Theresa May’s announcement is also pretty shaming for Labour. It is their nasty authoritarian streak that resulted in the extradition arrangement in the first place (the Extradition Act of 2003), and they didn’t redeem themselves last week. Alan Johnson said “Gary McKinnon is accused of very serious offences. The US was perfectly within its rights, and it was extremely reasonable of them, to seek his extradition. We now do not know whether Gary McKinnon will ever have to face justice on those accusations … The home secretary has made a decision today that’s in her own party’s best interest; it is not in the best interests of the country.” Really? Who is being political here, opposing government actions purely for opposition’s sake?\nOn the contrary, this is perhaps May’s best action since becoming Home Secretary, and she’s done it using the Human Rights Act - something the Tories despise. Let’s hope that she can now look into the case of Richard O’Dwyer, who faces extradition to the US on copyright infringement charges. He ran the TVShack Web site which, despite the site containing no copyrighted material, is judged by US authorities to infringe since it contained links to places where people can watch TV online. Authorities in the US wish to imprison him for 10 years for something which isn’t even a crime in the UK. It’s time for this madness to end.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2022_10_10_solar-farms_html/content_154.html": "As the Tories announce a ban on new solar farms on agricultural land, we need to wonder why.\n- [Listen on Apple Podcasts]\n- [Watch/listen on Spotify]\n- [Watch on TikTok]\n- [Watch in Instagram]\n- [Watch on YouTube]\nTranscript:\nWell here we are in a lovely sunny day in October and the sun has rather reminded me of a story I heard today or yesterday that the government is seeking to ban solar farms on farmland or installing solar panels on farmland, with the excuse being that we should be prioritizing food production now.\nThere’s a couple of things about this. One is that at the same time they’re pushing to reopen and licence more North sea oil and gas exploration. Stopping solar and trying to encourage gas in a time of climate emergency is pretty stupid. But that aside, you have to remember why solar farms are appearing on farmland. There’s two things. One, you can actually farm underneath them. If you have certain crops or maybe poultry and other livestock, you can put them under soda panels. That’s fine. You can have dual use in a lot of these fields, so it’s absolutely efficient as a way of using the space.\nThat’s the first thing. So it’s not wasting space that for agriculture, it’s getting extra use out of space that would’ve had less use, and that’s an important point. Another thing is why farmers are leasing their land, or sometimes doing this themselves, for solar?\nWell, it’s because they can’t make the money on the agriculture because food is undervalued. Even though food prices are going up, they still don’t get paid enough to cover the cost of production, or the land is generally not suitable for the sort of agriculture that would make the money. So why not, they think, make some money from renewables and let’s face it, the country could do with the energy.\nSo why is the government saying that they can’t do that? Well, from broad perspective, placing solar panels on agricultural land doesn’t make sense. We should be putting them on land that’s otherwise used for buildings, for example, on roofs.\nThat would be the most sensible place to put them. But the government’s not doing that, is it? It’s not mandating solar panels on roofs for new buildings or existing buildings. It’s largely ignoring the fact that we’ve got all this space we could be generating energy from, and it’s up to private individuals whether they do or not, and of course of there is a cost to that.\nBut the government is not encouraging anyone to do it. In fact, it’s discouraging people from doing it by scrapping FIT payments. So farmers are choosing to do this because they’re not getting the money from the agriculture that they could be running on that land. The main reason they’re not getting the money is because of Brexit.\nIt’s now much harder for people to make money to cover the cost of production from farming because of the friction that has been introduced into selling our goods to our main customer, which is obviously also our closest customer, the EU - both Ireland and the rest of Europe. That’s now much harder, much more costly for farmers to do. What were already pretty tight margins are much tighter, so a lot of farmers have either decided to stop producing certain products, or in fact not be farmers at all any more, and others are diversifying. Now, whether that’s camp sites or solar farms or anything else like that, these are all way farmers can make money from their land when the land is not paying for itself with agriculture.\nNow we’ve seen also at the same time, if you remember, the government rolled back on their commitment to pay farmers for stewardship when Brexit happened. There was talk of ending subsidies for just growing loads of food we don’t need and pay farmers for looking after land. While you may not have noticed, that’s all been rolled back, There was some optimistic talk about it, and lots of farmers even applied for some of these grants, but they’ve all been shelled for the indefinite future. So what are farmers going to do? You tell them they can’t set up solar farms, they’re going to have to do something else.\nWhat? What could that something else be? I can tell you what it wouldn’t be - it wouldn’t be as useful for getting us out of the energy crisis because ultimately we need more renewable generation in this country. And if farmers are the people willing to allow their land to do it, and the consumers with roofs and the money to buy panels aren’t doing it, let the farmers do it and get us out of a hole. By stopping them you’re just going to increase reliance on gas and increase energy prices, which isn’t going to help anyone.",

Winter is a challenging time to stay green, and I'm finding it increasingly difficult to make it through all of 2007 while remaining carbon neutral. With this in mind I've started thinking about Christmas, and how I can green it up a bit.\nFirstly, trees. A few years back I read a vaguely convincing article about how the greenest choice of tree is an artificial one. This is based an several assumptions, the most important being that the tree is reused for several years and recycled at the end of its life. If this is done then the benefits supposedly outweigh the fact that it is made of petrochemicals in China. However, is this true? Having looking into it a bit it seems that artificial trees are very hard to recycle since they are mostly made of steel and PVC. PVC can't easily be burned due to the emissions given off, while it's difficult to remove the steel without doing this since most trees are made by twisting the steel and PVC strands very tightly. One must also be realistic about how long trees are kept. My parents are probably reasonably unusual in that we had the same (aluminium) tree for about twenty years and it never seemed to get more scrappy, but how many people lose bits, buy a different size, or whatever? The sheer amount of artificial trees sold before Christmas at DIY centres suggests that people don't keep them forever.\nSo what about real trees? Some of the bad press they have received about their green credentials has been based on historical figures of imports. There was a time when the majority of trees were imported, but most are now British-grown, thus reducing the fuel used in transport. However, fuel is still used - there are the carbon costs of preparing the fields, planting the trees, the pesticides/herbicides used for growing, then transporting the trees afterwards. If the trees are grown in place of an older wood then there's also the impact of destroying the existing trees, which as a worst case could be an ancient oak forest. Plantations of Christmas trees do not lend themselves well to biodiversity, although of course they provide more cover for animals than bare ground.\nSo the best choice for a new tree is still not clear. I think that in the worst case for the real tree, such as one that is imported, grown on cleared deciduous woodland, heavily sprayed, and so on, an artificial tree may still be the best option. This is even more true if you can find a PVC-free, easy to recycle tree that is made locally. That is if those exist, of course.\nIt goes without saying that the greenest option is not to get a new tree at all. Use a living tree, or just buy a second-hand artificial tree (an easy way to recycle them!). You could also consider one of the cute 'grow your own' kits. These are all zero-carbon options, and you end-up with a tree that's just as fine. It's also a little reduction on the mad consumerism of the season of course, which is something we should all take some time to think about.\nNow as for when to put the tree up... well, that's another kettle of fish!\nFirstly, trees.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2011_11_09_nhs-efficiency_html/content_312.html": "h1. NHS Efficiency\np(meta). 9 November 2011\nI hesitate to link the the Telegraph and pass advertising money its way, but it’s worth noting that even it, a Tory paper, is carrying today’s news that the NHS has yet again been found to be one of the best healthcare systems in the world.\nIt is worth reading the article. Healthcare in Britain has “among the fastest access to GPs, the best co-ordinated care, and … the fewest medical errors” of the countries surveyed, and yet it does this with “per capita health spending … the third lowest of the 11, at £2,170 per head, compared with £3,200 in Switzerland and £4,950 in the US”.\nSo the NHS provides some of the best healthcare at one of the lowest costs per person, and yet the Tories and the Liberal Democrats are busy telling us that it’s not good enough and moving us to a US-style system - a system which, it must be remembered, has worse care and costs more than twice as much per person.\nOf course, the government likes to say that they’re not privatising anything, but this is a lie so blatant that they should be ashamed. They have already paid American firm McKinsey and other private consultants nearly six million pounds for advice on how to carve the NHS up between competing private firms. Earlier this year McKinsey was revealed to have been working with German company Helios in taking over selected NHS hospitals.\nSo there is privatisation. How is it not? ‘Selected’ hospitals? Isn’t that the ‘cherry picking’ that the government promised us wouldn’t happen? How many operations could the money the government is paying to McKinsey and other American firms pay for? The sad fact is that evidence shows we can’t trust anything this government tells us about their NHS reforms at all, but then this is a party that promised us ‘no top-down reorganisation’ shortly before undertaking the largest reorganisation of the NHS in its history, and a cowardly coalition party that will be remembered for facilitating the destruction of this country’s best asset.\nFor now, let’s be thankful for the fact that here in the UK we’re more likely to get prompt specialist attention than in 16 other OECD countries.

Open Letter To Don Foster MP About The Health and Social Care Bill\np(meta). 6th September 2011\nHere’s a letter I sent to my MP Don Foster prompted by the return to parliament of the Health and Social Care bill (i.e. the NHS reforms). I have written to him before and received boiler-plate replies stating his support for the bill.\nDear Don Foster,\nAs you know, now is a crucial time for the future of the NHS. I have written to you about this previously and you said that you support the bill. I am writing to urge you to reconsider this.\nThe bill, even with the much-publicised amendments, will not achieve any of the goals that the government claims. It will massively increase bureaucracy and cost, replacing the current PCTs and SHAs with CCGs, HealthWatch, Monitor and more layers of paperwork. It will also increase costs - the NHS is known to be one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the world.\nThe following points summarise my main concerns:\n1 - Monitor retains sweeping powers to inveigle competition into the NHS. Overseas companies running Trusts is already on the agenda at the DH. Many ex-Ministers are already paid by the private sector and a German company is in talks to take over a hospital.\n2 - The Secretary of State divests himself of a direct duty to provide healthcare and transfers it to GPs to decide what is free on the NHS.\n3 - If GPs save money from buying patient care they will be given bonus payments that they can spend, personally.\n4 - GPs will be able to set-up private companies to treat their own patients and get paid, effectively, twice for the same person.\n5 - GPs are able to devise their own CCG constitution and make up their own governance rules.\n6 - Commissioning is too complex for GPs. They are already creating PCT-look-a-likes, many with private sector support that will deflect cash from care into fees.\n38 Degrees have also paid for some independent legal advice which contradicts some of the assurances from the government: http://www.38degrees.org.uk/NHS-legal-advice/\nPatients will no longer be assured that their GP is working in their best interests. GPs will go from having their patient’s best interests at heart to worrying about budgets. This is wrong. Also, GPs are not managers, they are doctors. It is absolutely right that much-maligned managers in the NHS do the managing - it’s a nonsense to claim that doctors will be better (or cheaper).\nIt is not the introduction of the private sector and ‘choice’ that will improve the NHS, it’s the elimination of the misguided internal market. Just doing that will save millions. These reforms will make the situation worse.\nFinally, the ‘change is required because the NHS is unsustainable’ is a nonsense. The proposed changes have no basis in evidence that they will be more efficient - it is simply expensive to treat people who live longer. It is not ‘unaffordable’, we can easily afford it. No government that continues to fund things like nuclear weapons can morally claim that healthcare is unaffordable. Perhaps the government should stop funding weapons of mass destruction before telling us we can’t afford to continue to invest in improving the NHS? That aside, spending on healthcare is something we can choose to do if we wish. Claiming the money is not there is simply dishonest - the UK spends less on healthcare as a percentage of GDP than most other Western countries. If they can afford it, so can we.\nPlease assure me that you will not support the bill while these serious flaws remain. Nobody voted for these changes, and there is no merit to them.\nYours sincerely,\nDominic Tristram\n–",

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2011_10_03_motorway-speed-limits_html/content_316.html": "h1. Motorway Speed Limits\np(meta). 3 October 2011\nThe Tories have announced a policy of increasing the speed limit on motorways and dual carriageways by 10mph, making the ‘default’ national speed limit 80mph. They are trumpeting this as a way to increase productivity and boost economic efficiency but, of course, it’s nothing to do with that somewhat bogus claim.\nThe increase in speed limits is really to serve one main purpose - to garner votes from angry ‘Clarkson-man’ voters who like nothing better than to claim that motoring laws are something it is funny to ignore. This is mostly because they impede their ability to drive as fast or as moronically as they would like to. To these people it is perfectly acceptable to tail-gate other drivers who are going ‘too slowly’ by sticking to the speed limit, flashing their lights and swearing as they go. They claim that speed cameras are some sort of evil ‘revenue generation’ by the government and laugh when they are vandalised (at great cost to the taxpayer). “Speed doesn’t kill” they scream, based on nothing other than their own nausiating ignorance.\nLet’s think about that for a moment. Of course speed kills. This is such an obvious truth that I say this to people who say it doesn’t - choose to sit in a stationery car and have another one drive at you head-on at either 30mph or 40mph. Which would you choose? I think we can all guess which one they would go for. The 10mph difference between 70 and 80 might seem insignificant but it isn’t.\nAt 80mph not only are impact energies significantly higher (thus making damage and injury much more likely on impact) but also thinking distances, stopping distances, chance of mechanical failures, and many other factors that make accidents more likely in the first place. Stopping distances in the dry go from 315 feet at 70 mph to 400 feet at 80. In the wet this changes to 560 and 720 feet (figures from Drive and Stay Alive, inc). These distances are for the best expected ‘thinking times’ too (about 2/3 of a second) - most people will be slower to react. The extra space required between cars grows enormously with the change in speed, as you can see. Do we really think that the sort of drivers pushing for increased speed limits are likely to leave a 2 second gap between themselves and the car in front?\nWe must also consider the impact on the environment, of course. Cars are typically designed to be most efficient (with minimal fuel consumption) at around 56mph. Going over this sees a drop in efficiency which is not linear with speed - the loss of efficiency at 80mph is more significant than at 70mph than you might think. The DfT uses fuel consumption figures based on WebTAG for its comparisons, but this is a bit underhand as WebTAG is not meant to calculate consumption at steady speeds. Going by the much more standard steady-state model, a car that typically achieves 41 mpg at 70 mph will achieve approximately 32mpg at 80mph - an increased consumption, and hence fuel bill, of around 25%.\nAccording to Jillian Anable of the University of Aberdeenm the 80mph limit will release an additional 1.3 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. Obviously there is a moral dimension to this in that we should all be doing our bit to combat climate change, but even for the scientifically deficient or just plain seflish who don’t care about such things, there’s another clear reason why this policy is bizarre - economics.\nThe government claims that an extra 10mph will generate money in the econonomy thanks to people getting where they are going more quickly. Hmm. Let’s think about that briefly, and we’ll start with the most generously government-favourable position. We should come-up with an example, typical journey, so let’s say my old enforced commute of Bath to Newport as this is a nicely convenient trip of 50 miles. I used to make this trip between 7 and 8am as after 8am the traffic was horrendous. Within my journey there were 37 motorway miles where, on a good day, I might have been able to reach the maximum allowed speed (in fact the two last juntions at the Newport end have a 50mph limit, but we will ignore this for now). If I could travelled an extra 10mph faster on these days I might have completed the journey in, at best, four fewer minutes. What would I have done with these minutes? Well, obviously I would have got up later, or spent longer over breakfast. Or just not really noticed what is, really, a very short amount of time. Net gain to the economy? Nothing, and I’d wager that this is a fairly typical bit of ‘business travel’.\nNow let’s think of the downsides. By travelling 37 miles at an extra 10mph I would have increased my fuel consumption by about 25% and generated correspondingly higher emissions. I would also have been more likely to be involved in an accident, and should I have been in an accident, obviously I’d be that much more likely to be injured or killed.\nBy the government’s own statement they claim that the speed increase might kill an extra ten people a year and injure hundreds more. The Parliamentary Transport Committee estimates that an increase in the speed limit from 70mph to 80mph would result in a 10% rise in casualties on those roads. Research shows that reducing the average speed on a road by just 1mph is likely to reduce the frequency of crashes by 5%. Germany, which is famous for lack of speed limits, has a motorway death rate that is 75% higher than in the UK. It’s hard to pin-down the cost to the economy of a death, and then there are the costs to the state for the response of the emergency services, treatment of the injured on the NHS, the insurance industry, and so on. It should also be remembered that most accidents will delay or even close motorways for a period, and what would the cumulative wasted time of the drivers in that queue be?\nOf course there are trips made by people on ‘company time’ where their driving is part of their working day. It could be argued that longer trips here do cost money. However, the government could gain far more productive time from these people if more of them caught the train. You can work on trains. Working in this time is clearly not a priority for these people. They may have to make some trips that are not easily served by the rail network. In the long term we obviously need to expand the rail network (which we should be doing now of course, and on an ongoing basis), but in the short term there are some simple ways we can improve productivity from these people.\nWhy are they travelling at all? A small percentage will have to physically travel, but a lot of them will be people doing the sort of job I do, where they could easily work remotely or video conference. Believe me, there are plenty of companies that are too old-fashioned to allow this sort of arragement, and they impose a much greater cost on the economy than the hundreds of pointless motorway miles that employees over the country are forced to make.</p>\nUltimately this policy makes no sense. It is a shallow and obvious ploy for votes from the wannabe-Clarksons in society. That’s fine in theory, but they should be more honest. Don’t wrap this up in ‘economic productivity’ - it’s a change that will cost the country far more than it may generate. And people will die as a direct result of it.",

Admittedly the magistrate could have handled it better than just walking out, but his point remains valid. You can't turn-up in court with your face covered - you could be anyone. Whose word do we have to take that this is actually the person who it should be?\nI don't know how the law stands on this.

We can't give special permission for people to be exempt from laws and conventions because of some belief they hold. Where would it stop?

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2018_03_21_facebook-data-harvesting_html/content_137.html": "There are a lot of people who seem surprised that the data they have given Facebook might have been used for purposes they didn’t know about. Its not surprising, and while the current news is about an example that breached Facebook’s rules, there’s a lot of other stuff that even though it doesn’t, many people would probably still be upset about (and which they actually agreed to at some point).\nI’ve worked on applications that use the Internet and analysis of data gathered from Internet use and social media for over 25 years, in the private sector, the public sector and just for fun. It has always been about capturing user data, to a greater or lesser extent. Don’t think this will go away or change, and don’t think it’s all necessarily bad. Just be aware of it.\nThere is a simple rule on the Internet - if something is free to you but someone is making money out of it, you (or more accurately data about you) are the product. If you always remember that then you can’t go too wrong.\nIt’s not just basic Facebook functions that gather data - in fact they aren’t the thing people have got upset about here - it’s the apps and games people choose to play and which ask for additional permissions (‘The application blah wants to access your data - is this ok?’). It costs time and/or money for people to write those ‘personality type’ quizzes. What do they get out of it? Your data. What do they want to do with it? Who knows? And you might never know - they could be anywhere in the world, so they could well be somewhere where your data isn’t protected by law or what you agree to anyway. If you don’t like any of this then don’t think Facebook is your only problem. Almost everyone is tracking you and gathering data these days, but the more ‘free’ services you use from companies that make a profit the more exposed you will be. So what can you do?\nOnly used paid or non-profit services and products, for everything. Where there is no comparable paid service, use anonymising tools. For example, setting your search engine to DuckDuckGo will help. This is one of the default options on the iPhone, and probably Android too.\nSpeaking of phones, why do you think Google give Android away for free? They sell your data. It’s the same with email, from anyone. If it’s free then your email will be scanned and data harvested. Start using an email service you have to pay for. You probably already pay for at least one - the one from your ISP. There are many to choose from.\nYou can also lessen your exposure and still use free services. Use unique services like Facebook (which offer genuine utility) and only enter data you don’t mind being harvested (and perhaps stop doing suspect quizzes!). Stop using Facebook or Google to ‘log in’ to other services, etc - just create a new account on that site. Or you could simply stop caring too much. The upshot of the current kerfuffle is that companies are using personality categories to target ads and newsfeed items to try to change your mind. Even if you could somehow delete all of your data from the Internet (which you can’t), people will always try to target ads and news. Is it really any different to what newspaper editors do? Or TV news editors? Think critically.",

They'd quite like to scrap our data protection laws. These are the laws that put restrictions on what businesses can do with your personal data, such as not selling it to people who send junk mail. Apparently this 'red tape' is annoying for businesses. Another annoying bit of 'red tape' is the Working Time Directive, which they also plan to scrap.\nMuch as I don't want the Tories to win, some of their moves are beyond belief.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2023_09_11_dangerous-dogs_html/content_82.html": "As the media concentrates on yet another attack by a dog breed intended to be agressive, what can be done about the problem to tackle it permanently?\n@dominictristram Should we ban #bullyxl #dogs? Yes, almost certainly. But we need to go further than that. #dangerousdogs ♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nLet’s talk about dangerous dogs. Now, there’s a very simple solution to a lot of the problem we have with dogs, in my mind: all dogs, literally every dog, should be licensed. Also if you have any kind of conviction for cruelty or irrresponsiblity keeping a dog, then you are banned from keeping any more dogs for life.\nThat’s it - end of. Minimum. After all, a pet is a responsibility, not a right. If you prove yourself cruel or irresponsible then why should you be allowed any more dogs? So that’s just off the bat - no dogs if you’re found cruel or irresponsible. Dog licensing was previously only used as a slight revenue generator in the past when we had dog licenses, but now with today’s technology we have a much better scope for using it to ensure that dogs are well treated and that owners are responsible.\nDogs are already microchipped, or should be. A licensing scheme can tie that microchip to the license. A vet could demand to see your license every time you take your dog in. If you buy or sell any dog, you should demand to see licenses. People might say “Oh, well, there’ll be a black market, people won’t bother with them.”\nAnd sure enough, when we had dog licenses it is estimated that about half the people with dogs didn’t have one. But technology has moved on and that’s not a good argument for not doing it again.\nIn my mind, in a world where people are regularly bitten by dogs there’s no excuse for not trying to do something about it. You can’t just shrug, and you can’t say equally, “Oh, but my freedom! Why shouldn’t I be allowed an enormous fighting dog?” Because why should you have one?\nWe should just use statistics. Look at all breeds, and if more than a certain percentage of dog attacks are by this particular breed, put restrictions on it. Start with just making sure that they are muzzled (ie it’s a legal requirement to muzzle them in public). If that doesn’t work then look at stronger measures. But there’s no point just sort of shrugging our shoulders and going “what can we do?”\nAt the moment Suella Breverman’s looking at banning ‘bully XL’ dogs. We’ll see where that goes. But let’s say she does. There’ll be another dog. There’ll be another large fighting dog that the sort of people who buy these things go for, so the only solution is to look over all dog breeds and come up with some sort of automatic ‘if X many attacks happen, then this is considered a dangerous dog’ calculation. Muzzle them by default and then ban them if it goes beyond a sudden higher percentage than that.\nI’ve got a dog. I love dogs. I love pets, but I’m not the sort of person who wants to buy a dog to look tough, a dog that looks dangerous. I think there is a certain psychology behind those people that we, as a country, shouldn’t really endorse or support. So sure, look dangerous if you want, but make sure that dog’s wearing a muzzle. And be ready to accept severe penalties if you willingly circumvent these attempts to keep your dog safe.",

We believe that in the sixth richest country in the world it shames us all that some people cannot afford to eat while others see their immense wealth grow ever larger. We are the only party to demand that the poorest are protected by asking the richest to pay a little more back to society. We will restore the public sector and bring back vital services.\nOnly the Green Party will give the NHS the £12bn extra it needs every year, halt and then push back privatisation, and ultimately scrap the failed ‘internal market’ ideological experiment that costs billions and helps no-one.\nOnly the Green Party believes that education should be free, and wealth no barrier to ambition. Only we will scrap tuition fees and write-off government held student debt.\nOnly the Green Party will ban fracking. Other parties might claim to care about the environment, but those are hollow words from any party that is willing to use ever more fossil fuels.\nThe system is clearly broken. There is only one real choice for change, and that choice is Green.\nFinally, I want to address tactical voting. As a party we don’t support it, since we think that nothing will change if people don’t vote for what they actually want. The columnist George Monbiot has written an excellent article on this in which he says “…do we keep voting for a diluted version of Tory politics, for fear of the concentrate? Or do we start to vote for what we want? Had the people of this nation heeded the noseholders a century ago, we would still be waiting for the Liberal party to deliver universal healthcare and the welfare state.”\nHowever, the local Lib Dem campaign seems to have exclusively consisted of telling people that it’s ‘either us or the Tories’ and some people might be tempted to believe them. It simply isn’t true, so if you are considering voting tactically to ‘keep the Tories out’, consider this:\n- No party is expected to get an outright majority\n- The Green Party beat the Lib Dems and Labour at the last election in Bath (the Euros)\n- The Liberal Democrats have already enabled five years of Tory government. They have said they’d do it again. Electing a Lib Dem MP is the same as electing a Tory MP, as far as enabling Tory government goes\n- UKIP have said many times that they will work with a Tory government\n- Labour have said they would rather see a Tory government than work with the SNP. The only way they could form a government is to work with the SNP\nSo you see, even using the tactical argument, a Green vote is the best ‘anti Tory’ vote you can make.\nAll I ask is that you consider everyone standing and vote for the one that you agree with most. That is the way democracy is meant to work, and this is the first election in Bath for a long time where it can indeed work that way, whatever the other parties say. You can read what we believe here, in our manifesto.\nOn Thursday you can vote for someone you don’t really agree with from fear of someone worse - a vote that will ensure that nothing really changes. Or you can vote for the policies we need for a fair, just and caring society - a vote for hope.\nWe can do this. We must do this. For the Common Good.",

After coming close to gaining an MEP in 2009, the Greens continue to grow as a party, both with voter share and members, and as a result we will be sending our first representative from the SW.\nThis election established the Green Party as the challengers to the right wing policies of Tories, UKIP and Liberal Democrats. Voters who support the Green Party at the General Election will be voting for the genuinely radical party, committed to social justice and opposing austerity. Locally within BaNES, Greens came third, beating Labour and the Liberal Democrats. With the largest number of votes for a progressive party, we are confident about the General Election next year.\nThe Greens have campaigned on a positive manifesto of a Europe working for the common good. We believe that this chimes with an increasing number of voters who are interested in a parliament working to improve the lives of everyone in the UK and Europe, rather than parties who campaign on negativity and fail to vote for our interests in the European Parliament.\nDominic Tristram, Green Party Perspective Parliamentary Candidate for Bath",

Where is the cross-over? As for 'damage to DVD sales', they are DVD sales that the BBC will lose!

I don't know what it is about countries that use different alphabets that makes my company send me there, but I'm not complaining. Actually Tokyo isn't too bad as most signs have the English on them as well, which is rather more user-friendly than China was.\nThe flight over here was ok. I caught Babel (not great), Flags Of Our Fathers (better than I thought it would be), and The Illusionist (really good), which took my mind off my increasingly cramped legs during the 12 hours. Tokyo airport is a model of efficiency and we were out of there literally 20 minutes after landing, and straight onto a bus that stopped at our hotel. The hotel itself (the Akasaka Prince) is nice enough - I've got a great view and a large amount of sofa space. The many restaurants in the hotel do seem to close bizarrely early though, which is inconvenient when we get back late from work. For example, on Monday night we went to the office after checking into the hotel around 2pm and ended-up getting back at 11. No food being available when you've not slept for 36 hours just makes you feel annoyed!\nGetting around Tokyo is pretty easy using their rather good underground system. It's not particularly cheap but it runs on time and is very clean. The famously crowded trains certainly exist but are very directional, so our train (heading out of the centre in the morning) is going against the main flow and is practically empty, while trains going on the same line the other way are absolutely rammed. A fair number of people (about 10% I'd guess) seem to wear surgical masks for some reason best known to themselves. There are also 'women only' carriages for the trains at busy times thanks (I assume) to groping men. On the outside everyone looks like they wouldn't step out of line at all, so the idea of this seems odd. I don't doubt it happens though.\nJapanese people seem very friendly and quite genuine about it. On the way back to the tube station today a girl bumped into me and apologised far more than she needed to. A few minutes later at the tube station she came up and apologised again before starting a conversation about where I'm from, her plans to visit Britain to improve her English, and so on. It says something about Britain that when she started talking to me I assumed she was after something or trying to con me or wind me up in some way. It's little things like that which give you a good impression of a place.\nThe work is hard and the hours long, but I'm looking forward to the weekend when I should be able to actually go out and see something. Even at this early stage I can forsee it being difficult not to automatically bow to people on returning to the UK. Not a bad thing though - I think all of this mutual respect thing is pretty great.\nThe flight over here was ok.

  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2007_08_15_festivals-ahoy_html/content_179.html": "On Saturday I was in London for the Field Day Festival.\nThe weather was perfect, and after a slightly delayed train journey I was still in London\nin good time. We met up and made our way to Bethnal Green, the nearest tube for Victoria\nPark.\nNone of us had been to Victoria Park before. It's actually quite nice and seems to be\ndivided into two by a road. One part has a nice lake with plenty of birdlife hanging\naround on it, and is quite nicely landscaped. Over the road is the part of the park where\nthe festival was being held, which was a much more straightforward green space with a few\ntrees, along with some big monument thing. The festival was close to this, enclosed in a 7 foot fence.\nThe queue to get in was minimal, although for some reason that was never quite clear they\ndivided people into male and female queues. I assumed that this was something to do with\nsearches, but nobody was being searched anyway. Weird. All that it meant was that there\nwas a lot of people hanging around just in the site waiting for their opposite-sexed\nfriends. The rather overly-keen security staff were also taking food and drink, including\nwater, away from people. This seemed a bit mean on such a hot day.\nThe site itself was quite small - apparently the capacity was 10,000, although I don't\nthink that it got close to that while we were there. We grabbed some food (no queues for\nthat) and had a wander around. This was fairly on in the day and the queues for beer were\nquite large, so we thought we'd wait and go later. That was our main mistake! As the day\nwent on, beer queues grew and grew. There were only two bars for all 10,000 people, and it\nwas taking literally hours to get served! Needless to say, we didn't bother. We stick with\nthe rather strange cider-based 'Sungria', which we manged to get without much queuing\nearly on. That was about the only alcohol we got all day though, thanks to the mad queues\n(which were nothing, compared to the toilets!). The lack of thought that had gone into\nbars and toilets was fairly amazing, and there were many disgruntled people. The music was\npretty cool though, if hampered by a weedy sound system, so the day was still good\noverall. I just hope that next time the organisers try to decide how many toilets 10,000\npeople need when drinking they come-up with a number greater than 30.\n>After the festival we went to the pub for a few drinks, then onto a new sushi place in\n(I think) Kensington High Street, that was pretty good. After another few pints in the pub\nwe called it a day.\nn Sunday we went to see The Walker,\nwhich was actually very good. Woody Harrelson is a great actor - has he ever been in a bad\nfilm? Anyway, he was very good in this as a gay 'society walker' in Washington. I must\nadmit that it's a career I have never really thought about, but it makes for an\ninteresting film, and it's interesting how his 'society ladies' react to the events. Worth\na go anyway. Now I just need to catch The Simpsons!\nV Festival this weekend -\nI hope it stops raining! I've had enough of muddy festivals this year!",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/https_dominictristram_com_2023_05_05_the-results-are-in_html/content_294.html": "The results are in, and the Greens and Tories have the same number of councillors in Bath and NE Somerset. That’s better news for one of us!\n@dominictristram Local #Election Results in #Bath and NE #Somerset\n♬ original sound - Dom Tristram\nGenerated transcript:\nSo it’s the day after the local elections. I’m feeling pretty tired because I was at the count last night and, um, haven’t slept. But yeah, we’ve got three councillors in Bath and Northeast Sunset, which is brilliant. Thank you, everyone who voted. Three councillors is tripling what we had before. It gives us the same number of councillors as the conservatives.\nAnd just to put that in some sort of perspective, the conservatives ran the council until 2019. Things can change very quickly. The conservative nationally have done appallingly, of course, but at a local level the Conservatives chose to make their entire campaign based around opposing efforts to reduce traffic.\nAnti-anything, to promote active travel and safer streets. So they put all their eggs in one basket and it didn’t pay off because the trouble with the bubble that Tories seem to live in is that they hear a lot about how it’s really terrible that people are trying to make the city livable without using a car. And actually, as was proven in the last local elections when all of the parties, including the Tories, had dealing with traffic in their manifestos and this election where all the parties except the Tories had it in their manifestos again… and lo and behold, the Tories have lost seven seats.\nSo they’re down to the same as the Greens, though obviously the Greens are on their way up, Tories on the way down. So that’s kind of interesting. The Lib Dems obviously still have a huge majority and even more huge majority now. Labour are now the official opposition in the council, so interesting times. So yeah, always worth voting in local elections, . The Tories telling people all the way through that it’s them all the lib dems and actually hardly anyone voted Tory really compared to what they expected.\nSo a good thing.",
  "https_dominictristram_com_/http_dominictristram_com_2022_10_10_solar-farms_html/content_44.html": "As the Tories announce a ban on new solar farms on agricultural land, we need to wonder why.\n- [Listen on Apple Podcasts]\n- [Watch/listen on Spotify]\n- [Watch on TikTok]\n- [Watch in Instagram]\n- [Watch on YouTube]\nTranscript:\nWell here we are in a lovely sunny day in October and the sun has rather reminded me of a story I heard today or yesterday that the government is seeking to ban solar farms on farmland or installing solar panels on farmland, with the excuse being that we should be prioritizing food production now.\nThere’s a couple of things about this. One is that at the same time they’re pushing to reopen and licence more North sea oil and gas exploration. Stopping solar and trying to encourage gas in a time of climate emergency is pretty stupid. But that aside, you have to remember why solar farms are appearing on farmland. There’s two things. One, you can actually farm underneath them. If you have certain crops or maybe poultry and other livestock, you can put them under soda panels. That’s fine. You can have dual use in a lot of these fields, so it’s absolutely efficient as a way of using the space.\nThat’s the first thing. So it’s not wasting space that for agriculture, it’s getting extra use out of space that would’ve had less use, and that’s an important point. Another thing is why farmers are leasing their land, or sometimes doing this themselves, for solar?\nWell, it’s because they can’t make the money on the agriculture because food is undervalued. Even though food prices are going up, they still don’t get paid enough to cover the cost of production, or the land is generally not suitable for the sort of agriculture that would make the money. So why not, they think, make some money from renewables and let’s face it, the country could do with the energy.\nSo why is the government saying that they can’t do that? Well, from broad perspective, placing solar panels on agricultural land doesn’t make sense. We should be putting them on land that’s otherwise used for buildings, for example, on roofs.\nThat would be the most sensible place to put them. But the government’s not doing that, is it? It’s not mandating solar panels on roofs for new buildings or existing buildings. It’s largely ignoring the fact that we’ve got all this space we could be generating energy from, and it’s up to private individuals whether they do or not, and of course of there is a cost to that.\nBut the government is not encouraging anyone to do it. In fact, it’s discouraging people from doing it by scrapping FIT payments. So farmers are choosing to do this because they’re not getting the money from the agriculture that they could be running on that land. The main reason they’re not getting the money is because of Brexit.\nIt’s now much harder for people to make money to cover the cost of production from farming because of the friction that has been introduced into selling our goods to our main customer, which is obviously also our closest customer, the EU - both Ireland and the rest of Europe. That’s now much harder, much more costly for farmers to do. What were already pretty tight margins are much tighter, so a lot of farmers have either decided to stop producing certain products, or in fact not be farmers at all any more, and others are diversifying. Now, whether that’s camp sites or solar farms or anything else like that, these are all way farmers can make money from their land when the land is not paying for itself with agriculture.\nNow we’ve seen also at the same time, if you remember, the government rolled back on their commitment to pay farmers for stewardship when Brexit happened. There was talk of ending subsidies for just growing loads of food we don’t need and pay farmers for looking after land. While you may not have noticed, that’s all been rolled back, There was some optimistic talk about it, and lots of farmers even applied for some of these grants, but they’ve all been shelled for the indefinite future. So what are farmers going to do? You tell them they can’t set up solar farms, they’re going to have to do something else.\nWhat? What could that something else be? I can tell you what it wouldn’t be - it wouldn’t be as useful for getting us out of the energy crisis because ultimately we need more renewable generation in this country. And if farmers are the people willing to allow their land to do it, and the consumers with roofs and the money to buy panels aren’t doing it, let the farmers do it and get us out of a hole. By stopping them you’re just going to increase reliance on gas and increase energy prices, which isn’t going to help anyone.",

He is wrong to follow the Labour and Liberal Democrat lead in confusing the issue with local taxation.\nSince the wealthiest people keep only about 10% of their total wealth in residential property a mansion tax simply misses the target. The wealth tax proposed by the Green Party would cost him £140,000 if charged at 2% and couldn’t be avoided by simply selling the mansion or leaving the country.\nThis is a national policy to address a national problem of inequality and unfairness since poor people currently pay a higher proportion of their income in tax. No doubt local taxation needs to be reformed, but a realistic reform of that will be based on the ability to pay.",
