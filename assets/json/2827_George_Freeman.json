It is simply unacceptable that, after so many years, platform 2 remains inaccessible for many – particularly the disabled and those in wheelchairs, but also those pushing wheelchairs or even just trying to take a bike.\nThe announcement last year that finally, as part of the successful Greater Norwich bid to the Government’s Transforming Cities Fund, £600,000 had been committed to making Platform 2 step-free was an incredibly positive one. However, I am acutely aware that, just over a year on, many remain anxious for some news about how things are coming along – understandably frustrated that progress continues to be slow.\nThat’s why I have recently spoken to Greater Anglia, who are responsible for Wymondham Station itself, who have reaffirmed their recognition that step-free access to Platform 2 is an urgent priority. Currently, they are in the process of completing the necessary delivery studies that will inform the planning application that will then follow. I’m told the delivery studies will be completed in the spring.\nI remain committed to seeing this one get over the line – and as rapidly as possible.

I understand they remain on course to publish that longer term strategy by Spring 2024.\nI believe the best people to drive forward progress are the local clinical and care sector leaders and professionals who are working on the frontline – and who have first-hand expertise of the issues being faced.

I have seen first-hand how mental health issues affect friends and family members and can destroy lives.\nMy own father sadly suffered a complete and tragic life collapse as a result of a toxic mix of head injuries, a career dependency on gambling and untreated mental illness including depression and alcoholism. Just ten years after winning the 1958 Grand National as the Queen Mother’s jockey, these issues meant he lost his marriage, livelihood and access to his children.\nI also saw the devastation that mental health can inflict upon the families of my friends – including the suicide of a late friend’s son after years of battling bipolar disorder.\nEach life lost is one too many.\nThat’s why I take mental health services so seriously – doing as much as I can in my role as a Member of Parliament to shine a light on the issue and help bring about the improved services, treatment and support we need.\nI believe strongly that the key to ending the “cinderella-ism” of mental health is a full and deep alignment of mental health into the NHS itself (through patient pathways, proper service planning and the like). The decision by the Government in 2012 to enshrine parity of esteem for physical and mental health in law was a great step forward, and we have seen a lot of positive progress being made to tackle this issue.\nMuch more must be done however to drive up standards in Norfolk – as proved by the situation at Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT) over recent years and the many patients that have died as a result of failings.\nThat’s why I have been clear that this has to stop – and again, in January 2024, raised the matter with ministers in the House (see here).\nIn March 2024, alongside Clive Lewis MP, I welcomed campaigners to Parliament to meet with Norfolk and Suffolk MPs and present to the Minister in person (see here).\nTogether, we are calling for the new leadership to be honest about the mistakes, learn the lessons, apologise and put the voices of patients and their loved ones at the heart of a serious program of reform – and have set out a clear set of actions for us to take forward (see my video below).\nRest assured, I am determined to do all I can.\nI also continue to work hard on mental health support through other initiatives, such as The Bridge of Hope charity I set up in memory of my late father in 2018 to help those suffering with poor mental health and/or a life collapse as they look for a route back into employment.\nTo stay up to date with much of my work on this vital issue, please check my updates below.\nFollowing the NSFT summit in Parliament convened by George Freeman MP and Clive Lewis MP the following actions were agreed:\n- Letter to Minister Caulfield to highlight need for reform and DHSC scrutiny of the Grant Thornton Report re 8000 deaths\n- Minister to meet NSFT next week\n- Letter to NSFT from Norfolk and Suffolk MPs highlighting scale and urgency of reform\n- MPs to cross examine NSFT leadership on; lessons learnt, reforms being implemented, and latest data - with Mark Harrison and Governors.\n- Request DHSC select committee launch an enquiry\n- Debates in Parliament\n- Research national Mental Health Trusts and identify best practise to inform options for NSFT reform\nIf we are to better tackle the underlying causes of mental health for children, we must have better data. See my intervention in the Children’s Mental Health Week debate in the House.\nGeorge Freeman intervenes in a debate on children's mental health to call for more research on the underlying causes driving the epidemic in mental ill health in children and highlights that poverty is not the only driver.\nThe silent suffering from undiagnosed and untreated Mental Health conditions is becoming an epidemic in hard-to-access rural areas, made worse here in Norfolk by the longstanding difficulties at the Norfolk & Suffolk Mental Health Foundation Trust.",

The Post Office is a crucial facility in a rural community and many, especially the elderly, immobile and vulnerable, depend on the service that it provides. Those in Norfolk who care about local communities care about the Post Office and this was evidenced by the huge turnout of over 200 people when I held a meeting with concerned residents in Gressenhall when the Post Office first suspended the service there.\nThis was over 6 months ago and whilst I have been assured that the closure remains temporary and despite numerous discussions between myself and the Post Office there has been little progress to report.\nAs local residents will be aware, recently a service has been run in Gressenhall for 2 hours per week by the Post Master from Mattishall. Whilst this is a welcome temporary reprieve, it is clear that the limited service is not sufficient to meet the demands of the village and I am continuing to put pressure on the Post Office to determine what efforts they are putting into a longer term solution.\nResidents can be assured that I will continue to fight for this vital local service to be reinstated and will be reporting back on all progress.",

Our frontline public services are fragmented, with NHS England addressing Health whilst the County Council works on Care and the District Councils plan housing development. We need far more joined up thinking and planning of services.\nWith a growing elderly population needing more healthcare, and Councils building more houses, we must ensure that infrastructure is being properly planned to cope with these additional population pressures. Crucial to addressing this demand is the better integration of NHS and Social Care services. Put simply, if we enable more people to be seen and treated in the community rather than in the most specialist and expensive places in our healthcare system (hospitals) we can create a more cost effective system, improve patient care and create a better patient experience.\nI believe the best people to drive these changes are the NHS clinical and Care sector leaders and professionals who are on the frontline every day and have first-hand experience of the issues faced by our NHS and care services. I think it’s time to look at whether having 8 Councils, a Clinical Commissioning Group, NHS England and a separate Mental Health Trust all organising Healthcare is really the best way to plan and deliver a properly organised local Health and Care system.\nWhile important strides have been made in recent years, I believe we can, and should, go further. The 3 key changes I am calling for are:\n1. Greater integration of NHS and Council Social Care;\n2. Better integration of (District) Council planning of new housing and (County) Council planning of care services and NHS planning of health services;\n3. More back office efficiency savings across Norfolk to protect front line services.\nPlease do get in touch (george@georgefreeman.co.uk) to let me know if you have any particular views on our local health and care services in Mid Norfolk and any suggestions you may have as a user or a provider on how to improve our services.",

Friend will know more than most, having had this brief previously. Of course, we are out there sourcing investment for the UK and, as I mentioned, we are already beating France and Germany. Further afield, the UK is the third country, behind the US and China, to reach the landmark of $1 trillion in value. We have the concierge service with the Office for Investment. We have also recently secured £4.5 billion through the advanced manufacturing plan. That, coupled with the research and development budget of around £39.8 billion between 2022-25, shows that we are ready to enable investment in the UK and to manufacture products in this area.",

With the world needing to double food production in 25 years using the same land but less water and energy, the UK—home to 10 of the top 30 research institutes—could lead this effort. However, he warns that current policies could abruptly shrink the UK market for these innovations, threatening an emerging industry poised to become a global leader.\nFollowing the Prime Minister’s statement on securing a lasting peace in Ukraine, George Freeman commends the PM’s efforts to rally international support and to strengthen our military capability. He asks when a business plan will be put forward to fund the likely £60 to £70 billion needed over the next five to ten years, to ensure our military is credible, serious, and affordable.\nGeorge Freeman highlights the impact of the cost of living crisis and the Government’s taxes attack on jobs and small businesses on rural Mid Norfolk. He calls on the Government to diverting money from rural areas to cities and instead allow rural councils to keep the proceeds of their growth and incentivise them to support rural businesses.\nGeorge Freeman raises the increasing problem of flooding in inland Norfolk as a result of climate change, aging infrastructure struggling to cope with modern demands, and the fragmentation of responsibility for water management.

(See more here and here)\nToo few policy makers in Whitehall are aware of the breadth of this expertise and enterprise driving huge economic opportunities in our part of the world.\nThat’s why as Minister for Innovation at the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, I have launched a major reform of the way HMG supports innovation to focus more on the PLACES – the “Clusters” in which the Innovation economy flourishes – and why I was so pleased to lead the latest HMG Cluster Visit here to our part of the world to champion and showcase the Norfolk and New Anglia Agri/Bio/Cleantech Cluster.\nBy better connecting the hubs in Suffolk:\n- Freeport East: An incredible project that is already transforming Harwich and Felixstowe and acting as a facilitator for great strides in Green Hydrogen, AI and Robotics.\n- Adastral Park: The heart of the UK’s digital ecosystem, Adastral Park is home to high-tech telecommunication and technology companies including BT.\nwith Norfolk – and Cambridge – we can drive a seriously exciting era of prosperity in our area which does NOT require vast housing estates everywhere, and instead encourages small businesses and business parks to set up in our vibrant villages and thriving, revived Towns.\nWe need to be better at telling the world that there is more to East Anglia than Cambridge.

We will only do it through smart regulations, digital emissions ranking and incentives to help consumers reward genuinely green, Net Zero products. By harnessing the market, we can attract billions of private investment into the Green Economy to drive up standards and support high growth CleanTech businesses – of which Norfolk already has a high number.\nThat’s why, as Minister of State at the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, I recently brought a senior delegation from across Government on one of my cluster visits (see above) to see the opportunities in the Norfolk and wider New Anglia Cluster first-hand.\nChanging attitudes and stereotypes to Drive a ‘Rural Renaissance’\nI believe we stand on the cusp of something special in our area: a once-in-a-generation chance to drive a new cycle of growth, investment, high skill jobs and prosperity in a way which ENHANCES our quality of life without requiring the “industrialisation” of rural Norfolk.\nThrough my Norfolk Way project (a not for profit social enterprise to promote a more entrepreneurial rural economy here in rural Mid Norfolk ), I have worked with businesses, councillors and public sector figures to promote this “Rural Renaissance’ – one that sees more and more small and medium sized companies (particularly those ‘spinning-out’ from the key growth hubs like the NRP and Hethel) setting themselves up in our local towns and villages, breathing fresh life into our communities, creating thousands of well-paid jobs, levelling up local skills and generating the prosperity that makes all of our lives better and boosts public service funding.\nNorfolk Enterprise Festival\nThat’s why I put together the first Norfolk Enterprise Festival with local entrepreneurs and the New Anglia LEP to provide a forum for the 30,000 small businesses in Norfolk to come together and promote our local innovation economy (see more here, here, here and here)\nPromoting business, enterprise and innovation in local schools\nThe key to our long term prosperity is the skills, training and ambition of our school children, school leavers and young people (as well as those who are older and looking to retrain or pursue an exciting new career).\nThat’s why I continue to do all I can to champion the Norfolk Innovation and Enterprise Economy in my weekly visits to at least one of the 40 local schools across the Mid Norfolk Constituency.\nFor all the obvious difficulties of the current cost-of-living and energy crisis, for which I continue to push for relief for local businesses, this is an exciting period of opportunity for our area and for our young people entering the world of work.\nI’m determined to continue working – as local MP and a Minister – to change attitudes in Whitehall to the Norfolk economy and help secure the investment and infrastructure we need.\nTo learn more about both my historic and ongoing work on this campaign, please visit my campaign page here\nIt was a special honour to welcome the H.M.

However, as I visit High Street shops and local businesses across the 5 towns and 114 villages of the Mid Norfolk constituency - from pubs to light manufacturing companies, and having run my own small business here in Norfolk before standing for Parliament, it’s clear to me that the cost of living crisis is hitting our local small businesses especially hard.\nA key reason for that is the extra costs of doing business in a rural area like ours where the necessity of extra heating and travel affect both customers and businesses in a “double whammy” with consumers having less disposable income and businesses facing higher costs.\n(That’s why every Friday / Saturday I try and make sure I visit a local business to keep up to date – and why I highlight local businesses via my ‘Backing Local Businesses’ page on my website here)\n------\nIt’s why I campaigned hard in the run-up to the Autumn Statement for the Chancellor to focus the November budget measures on:\n- Business Tax Cuts focussed on businesses and lower paid workers, rather than the rich\n- Relief for the hospitality sector. Specific support that has been announced for the retail, hospitality and leisure sector, which provides a lifeline for rural areas reliant on tourism, with relief rates raised from 50% to 75% up to £110,000, and for small businesses losing eligibility for relief whose increase in annual bills will be capped at £600.\n- Relief for employer’s NI contributions (a major cost for employers and potentially prohibitive for small businesses)\n- Ongoing welfare reforms to reduce (and now STOP) benefits for those who CAN work but choose not to accept job offers available at the Job Centre\n- Protection of the capital budget, meaning no change to current plans to continue the rollout of the better broadband and 5G connections that are so vital for rural businesses and households\n- The continuation of levelling-up funding that I, along with countryside groups, have consistently argued must account fully for rural needs.\n- The increase in energy bill support for households not connected to the gas grid, with the payment to those reliant on alternative fuels doubling to £200 and additional payments made available for the most vulnerable.\n- The energy price guarantee continuing beyond April, although with the level increased from £2,500 to £3,000, offers some further respite from escalating costs. Energy efficiency is a particular headache in rural areas, which often suffer from an older, draughtier housing stock. I would expect the newly announced Energy Efficiency Taskforce to pay particular attention to these dwellings and the Government to prioritise them when allocating grants.\n- The announcement of a 5-year, £13.6 billion transition fund and in the freezing of the rates multiplier in 2023-24.\nBut with the war in Ukraine causing ongoing energy and fuel price pressure and inflation, and ongoing labour shortages and low disposable incomes in rural areas like ours, I think we are going to have to go further.\nToo often rural areas get overlooked in Whitehall with too many policies designed for cities and urban communities.\nOur villages, towns, high streets and local businesses face far higher costs.\nSo in the run up to the Spring Budget, I will be launching a Fair Funding Relief for Rural Areas campaign to push the Chancellor and Treasury to go further to help hard-hit local businesses and self-employed who are the backbone of the long term prosperity of rural areas like ours.\nIf YOU would be interested to hear more and/or are happy to support me in this work, please simply reply “YES” and I’ll make sure you receive further direct updates on this campaign in the new year.",

I have always been clear that how we take care of, and educate, some of our most vulnerable people is a measure of us as a society – firmly believing that EVERYONE has the right to proper support and a good education.\nThat’s why, since becoming the MP for Mid Norfolk back in 2010, SEND support has been one of my central focusses – with the campaign to support Chapel Road School in Attleborough becoming one of my very first campaigns.\nA wonderful school struggling in an old, cramped, unfit-for-purpose building, Chapel Road sought to relocate to a brand, new, state-of-the-art premises in nearby Old Buckenham and had long been working with Norfolk County Council, the Department for Education and other key stakeholders to try and make that happen. Upon becoming the local MP, I was delighted to take a lead role, alongside the then headteacher Karin Heap, to help get that campaign over the line and I was delighted when that finally came to fruition – with the school moving to its new home, Chapel Green School, in 2017. Since then, I have kept in regular contact (most recently visiting the school last month – see here) and continue to support their vitally important work.\nFollowing a visit to Fred Nicholson School in Dereham in the autumn of 2019, I also committed to supporting their own inspirational headteacher, Jane Hayman, and her team as they went about bringing about a long term solution to the rapidly deteriorating and cramped premises that they currently occupy – helping to convene meetings with the key figures, raising awareness of the importance of the campaign and writing letters of support. Earlier this month, I welcomed the news that NCC’s Cabinet have given the greenlight for the purchase of some land in nearby Swaffham which is intended to be the location of Fred Nich’s new home. (See more here). I look forward to continuing to support that project in the months and years ahead.\nMore widely, I have consistently lobbied ministers and officials over the years for greater SEND funding for our rural schools – speaking in the House, in addition to speaking with and writing directly to key figures in the Department for Education.\nThat’s why I am delighted to see today the DfE’s announcement of a new SEND funding agreement for Norfolk – one that will provide substantial additional funding for education services and support for children and young people with SEND needs, especially through Norfolk County Council’s new six-year ‘Local First Inclusion’ SEND improvement initiative.\nThrough 79 projects across five different workstreams, ‘Local First Inclusion’ will provide significantly more advice, support and funding for mainstream schools. It will introduce 15 new school and community teams to give early help and support for both parents and schools, and will also see the council develop dozens more special education classrooms known as specialist resource bases (SRBs), as well as alternative provision at mainstream schools. Two more special schools will be built too.\nI am told that the first school and community teams are due to start work in June this year, with most established by September. Recruitment for more than 100 additional advice and support roles for schools is already underway and a team of school leaders is already in place to work with NCC leaders.\nNCC will be investing a further £5.5 million a year for six years into SEND support (totalling £33 million) and the DfE, as part of this funding agreement, has agreed to invest £28 million this year, followed by £6 million a year for four years (provided NCC meets progress targets) and £12 million in the final year of the programme (totalling £70 million overall).\nThis is a hugely positive step and forms a key part of NCC’s strategy to ensure that our county has the right mix of mainstream and special school places to best support the needs of children and young people with SEND. It will strongly complement the ‘High Needs Block’ grant that Norfolk receives from the Government each year to provide funding for special schools, mainstream ‘top up’ and commissioned services such as speech and language therapy – worth £135 million in 2023/24 alone.\nRest assured, I will continue to do everything I can to speak up for this key group in our society. There is still more that can be done and I am committed to working with NCC, schools and partners to ensure Mid Norfolk families get the support they deserve.\nTo find out more about my historic work on SEND support in our local schools, please visit my website campaign page here.",

The event was well attended and I am pleased to report that stakeholders have been following up on a number of the points and concerns raised – with additional site visits undertaken to the culvert and watercourse on Mill Lane (as well as the culvert in Briar Gardens). Meetings with developers to assess drainage on their building sites have also taken place and I am aware that a series of additional measures, along with further clearing of drains and ditches, are already being implemented – with anecdotal reports of additional blockages being addressed. I will continue to monitor progress closely.\nFurther to the emergency meeting I held last week (see here), an urgent meeting took place on Tuesday between Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council and Anglian Water to discuss in greater depth the specific issues that caused flooding at the Mill Lane culvert and connected watercourse.\nAs many are aware, the culvert and watercourse were divested to riparian ownership many years ago. While that question of who will take on the long term ownership remains (and rest assured that I continue to push very hard on that and have challenged all stakeholders to work collaboratively to develop a proper strategic plan and solution for the issue), I welcome the collective recognition that something needs to be done as soon as possible, with agreement that the inadequate and unsafe trash screen that caused many of the recent problemsneeds to be replaced.\nOn a without prejudice basis (of who will assume long term responsibility for the culvert and watercourse) and as a gesture of goodwill, Anglian Water have agreed to have their contractors assess the trash screen and culvert and work up the design for a much safer, more effective replacement. All stakeholders will then jointly fund the improved screen and Anglian Water will install it.\nIn the meantime (and again on a without prejudice basis and as a gesture of goodwill), Anglian Water will endeavour to send staff every couple of weeks to keep the existing trash screen clear.

Deposits of gravel and silt have been found in parts and NCC are pressing ahead with arrangements to have these cleared – with the necessary contractors set to carry out works in early March.\nIn addition to this, I can share news that:\n- I continue to support NCC’s Flood and Water Management team and local councillors as they engage with landowners upstream to explore potential flood prevention and mitigation measures on their land.\n- NCC sent riparian ownership reminder letters to landowners and homeowners along the problem watercourse in mid-January to remind them of their riparian responsibilities and make clear what they must not throw into the stream.\n- NCC are working with the Internal Drainage Board to lobby Network Rail to inspect and, if necessary, clear the culvert they are responsible for downstream under the A11.\n- Stakeholders continue to look at what more can be done to protect the most at risk properties this winter.\nOnce again, I’ve reiterated the importance of looking at the longer term issue of responsibility and maintenance of the culverts and watercourses – and I will be involved in the next Mill Lane culvert stakeholder meeting next week as these vital conversations continue.\nI am also arranging the next wider multi-agency meeting on the Attleborough flooding too.\nRest assured, I will continue to work with local councillors and residents to hold the key stakeholders to account on this to drive forward the solutions Attleborough needs to see.\nTo learn more on the Attleborough Flooding campaign to date, please scroll down and read the updates below.\nTo learn more about my wider ‘Flooding and the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership’ campaign, please click the link here.\nUPDATE 17 January 2024\nStorm Babet flooded over 100 homes in Attleborough back in October and local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been affected) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership and Flooding Campaign work, I continue to take an active role in supporting those affected and holding the key stakeholders to account – both here in Mid Norfolk, but also in Westminster.\nWhile a number of short and medium term measures have already been carried out or are underway (see here), the incredibly high water levels at the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse at the start of the new year, and the serious risk residents are having to take in order to protect their homes, shows more must be done.\nLast week, I convened a multi-agency meeting with representatives from Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council, the local Internal Drainage Board, Anglian Water, Natural England, the Environment Agency – as well as local Town, Parish, District and County Councillors and representatives of local landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse – to emphasise again the importance of tackling these serious issues and explore in greater depth the short, medium and long term work required to significantly reduce future flood risk.\nI drew particular attention to those homeowners most at risk of flooding on Mill Lane – many of whom feel helpless and desperate, believing they have no choice but to seriously risk their own safety to try and keep the trash screen across the Mill Lane culvert clear each time it rains.\nThe key discussion points from the meeting were:\n- A shared acknowledgement that residents are seriously risking their own safety to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear of debris – and of the fact that conditions and circumstances at the culvert can change rapidly during periods of heavy rain.\n- Agreement that the existing Mill Lane culvert trash screen should not be removed until the new replacement has been installed (work currently underway – see here) – as the culvert has a 90 degree bend that, were it to become blocked, would be extremely difficult and costly to clear – and significantly worsen the current flood risk to the area.\n- NCC Flood and Water Management officials met with Anglian Water contractors on-site (the day prior the meeting) to verify the new trash screen designs ahead of pricing the work – with a multi-agency agreement already in place to fund it.\n- The installation of the new trash screen will likely not be possible prior to the summer. This is because the watercourse will need to be de-watered so that a new concrete base can be constructed and the trash screen fitted.\n- Further measures are therefore required in the short term to try and reduce flood risk along the watercourse and at the Mill Lane culvert.\n- NCC are going to work with local landowners and other stakeholders to explore installing an additional, temporary screen somewhere upstream that can catch debris and prevent it becoming a problem in Attleborough itself.\n- The Mill Lane culvert, and others along the watercourse, cannot be expanded – nor the watercourse itself deepened or widened – due to the amount of development and road access around and across it. The enormous cost and disruption, and lack of space, make it impossible.\n- Given concerns over residents and local councillors risking their safety by entering the watercourse to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear, a suggestion was made to appoint a jointly funded contractor to be on 24/7 call out to clear debris and blockages at the culvert trash screen when required. This suggestion was dismissed on the basis that no organisation would allow their staff to entering the water in storm flow conditions (when they would be most needed) – especially if Norfolk Fire and Rescue themselves have said the risk would be too great for even their own teams.\n- A suggestion was made to explore how the watercourse may, long term, be diverted to another course away from the town. Flooding Officers explained this would probably not be possible given local topography.\n- It is therefore not possible to immediately remove all flood risk. Instead, agencies must work with the properties most at risk to do as much as possible to improve their flood resilience.\n- NCC have also submitted a bid to the Natural Flood Management Fund, supported by myself and others, and I am working with them and local landowners upstream to explore how we might deliver a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme that could drastically reduce the long term flood risk to homeowners and businesses in Attleborough (see more here)\n- Everyone affected in the area by flooding in October must formally report their cases via the Norfolk County Council website to enable the Flood Investigations underway to be as accurate as possible – which in turn will strengthen the hand of local stakeholders to lobby for additional funding and support.\n- NCC are to look at monitoring water volumes and storm flows on the watercourse – again to strengthen their hand when lobbying for resources.\n- Local councillors asked what more could be done to improve safety for those homeowners currently taking risks to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear. It was asked if lighting and cameras could be installed.\n- I reiterated my ongoing support for all the efforts to tackle these flooding issues – and highlighted my efforts in Westminster to bring about the national reform needed also (see more here)\nAs is clear, this isn’t an easy fix – with multiple challenges faced. However, I am determined to all I can to support the community.\nThe key focusses/timescales moving forward are:\nShort Term (Now-next few weeks)\n- Doing as much as possible to improve the flood resilience of the most at risk properties\n- Explore what more can be done to improve safety for those putting themselves at risk to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear\n- Find a suitable location for an additional, temporary screen upstream to collect debris – and explore additional short term measures upstream that can reduce flood risk\nMedium Term (Summer)\n- Replacement of the existing trash screen with a new one that is designed specifically for the challenges being faced.\n- Continue to explore what measures can be introduced to reduce flood risk.\nLonger Term\n- Deliver a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme upstream that can significantly reduce flood risk\n- Deliver legislative changes and reform in the House to better empower local communities so that they can protect themselves from flooding, while also holding developers to account when new housing exacerbates local problems.\nRest assured, I will keep working tirelessly on this issue.\nTo stay up to date, please visit my flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 4 December 2023\nOver 100 homes in Attleborough were flooded in Storm Babet at the end of October.\nWe cannot allow this to happen again. Local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why earlier today, as part of my ongoing campaign (and having recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership that I established back in early 2021 – see here), I met with Norfolk County Council’s Flood and Water Management team, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance and representatives for some of the landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse.\nIt’s clear that that we need a proper long term strategic plan that addresses problem watercourse pinch points AND looks to better control the flow of water downstream during heavy rainfall events. While some positive progress is already being made at the Mill Lane culvert itself (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), today’s call focused on what can be done further upstream – and I am committed to actively supporting NCC/the NSFA and partners as they work with landowners and other agencies to explore what flood mitigation and water storage scheme measures might work best for Attleborough.\nTo see all of my recent work supporting Attleborough residents, please click here or see below.\nFor full details on all of my flooding campaign work, please visit my website here.\nUDPATE 29 November 2023\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted by recent flooding.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing campaign, I visited Mill Lane with Cllrs Samantha and Taila Taylor this past Friday to see the problem culvert/watercourse first hand and meet with some of the worst affected residents.\nPlease see my video above.\nLocal residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious – and I continue to hold the key stakeholders to account to ensure everything that can be done is indeed being done to provide affected residents with the support they need, as well as to put in place a short, medium and long term plan that looks to try and prevent future such flooding again in future.\nSome positive progress is already being made (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), but there still remains much more to do.\nThat’s why, as highlighted in my recent update here, I recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership to give our communities the strongest possible voice on these issues. Attleborough had strong representation on that call and I am determined to do everything I can, alongside local councillors, to ensure residents like those on Mill Lane and surrounding streets are heard.\nI will be involved in more meetings in the coming days and am also writing to ministers and officials in Westminster to re-emphasise again the need to put greater emphasis on flooding and drainage matters in the planning process – including putting increased responsibility on developers who’s developments subsequently flood and/or impact the existing community.\nTo stay up to date with all my work on these issues, please visit my Flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 3 November 2023\nFurther to my webstory update last week (see here), I can now provide more information on the work being done by multiple parties to address the terrible flooding that has recently affected many households and businesses in Attleborough.\nOn Monday, the Town Council and local district and county councillors held a public meeting in the town for local residents to speak with key stakeholders. The event was well attended and I am pleased to report that stakeholders have been following up on a number of the points and concerns raised – with additional site visits undertaken to the culvert and watercourse on Mill Lane (as well as the culvert in Briar Gardens). Meetings with developers to assess drainage on their building sites have also taken place and I am aware that a series of additional measures, along with further clearing of drains and ditches, are already being implemented – with anecdotal reports of additional blockages being addressed. I will continue to monitor progress closely.\nFurther to the emergency meeting I held last week (see here), an urgent meeting took place on Tuesday between Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council and Anglian Water to discuss in greater depth the specific issues that caused flooding at the Mill Lane culvert and connected watercourse.\nAs many are aware, the culvert and watercourse were divested to riparian ownership many years ago. While that question of who will take on the long term ownership remains (and rest assured that I continue to push very hard on that and have challenged all stakeholders to work collaboratively to develop a proper strategic plan and solution for the issue), I welcome the collective recognition that something needs to be done as soon as possible, with agreement that the inadequate and unsafe trash screen that caused many of the recent problemsneeds to be replaced.\nOn a without prejudice basis (of who will assume long term responsibility for the culvert and watercourse) and as a gesture of goodwill, Anglian Water have agreed to have their contractors assess the trash screen and culvert and work up the design for a much safer, more effective replacement. All stakeholders will then jointly fund the improved screen and Anglian Water will install it.\nIn the meantime (and again on a without prejudice basis and as a gesture of goodwill), Anglian Water will endeavour to send staff every couple of weeks to keep the existing trash screen clear. (Breckland, NCC and Anglian Water are also discussing a longer term plan for removing any debris collected from the culvert and watercourse)\nI would like to reiterate however that I will keep on the critical question of who will assume the long term responsibility and ownership of the culvert and watercourse – and am already liaising with the key stakeholders on the date for a follow-up meeting to discuss that matter further.\nNCC have also confirmed that the gulleys around Mill Lane have been cleared (with additional review taking place of gulleys on surrounding streets) and I understand that an assessment is taking place as to whether the trash screen at the Briar Gardens culvert should be removed.\nA full flood investigation is now being led by NCC in line with their statutory processes. Although their Flood and Water Management team had already been working on proposals to better mitigate flooding in this area (as a result of the December 23rd-24th 2020 flooding event), there is recognition that their Flood Plan for the area, and its associated work, now needs accelerating and upscaling. I have committed to supporting NCC as they seek to secure the additional funding required to implement any recommended measures, as well as to engage with key local landowners.\nI am also in the process of reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I previously established – and will ensure Attleborough is represented in those vital conversations.\nRest assured, I am determined to do everything I can to speak up for those affected in Attleborough, as well as those across Mid Norfolk.\nUPDATE 25 October 2023\nStorm Babet has reminded us again why we must continue to take flooding seriously.\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted, with severe flooding on Mill Lane, Norwich Road, Ferguson Way and other nearby streets. For some, it was the fourth time they had been flooded in 30 years – and the second time in just under three years. I appreciate, and share, the immense anger and frustration felt by those that have been forced to leave their homes as a result of the damage suffered this past weekend.\nThat’s why I held an emergency meeting today with Norfolk County Council and their Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Anglian Water and Breckland District Council to get to the bottom of what is causing the flooding at the watercourse and culvert on Mill Lane, as well as ensure that those with statutory flooding responsibilities come together and develop an urgent action plan.\nWhile NCC began working on proposals to address flooding at this location in light of the December 2020 flooding, Storm Babet has brought into sharper focus the need to upscale and accelerate those proposals, and address other issues such as questions around which authority is responsible for the culvert and watercourse and therefore who should be maintaining them.\nI had made clear that there needs to be:\n- A proper plan for ensuring affected residents (and the wider community) are protected from further flooding this winter.\n- An acceleration and upscaling of efforts to put in place a long term solution.\n- A proper plan for who is going to be responsible for this culvert and watercourse in due course.\n- Agreement on who is going to keep the culvert and watercourse clear NOW – while the longer term plan is being developed and implemented.\nI am in close contact with local district councillors and a number of those worst affected by the flooding and am determined to help them work with key stakeholders to develop a solution.\nWe must see action. This must not be allowed to happen again. And residents should not be risking their own safety to try and keep this culvert clear during storms and heavy rainfall.\nMore widely, I will be reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I established as a result of the Winter 2020/21 flooding to help support those affected by Storm Babet and ensure our communities have the strongest possible voice heading into this autumn/winter.\nRest assured, I will continue to support councillors and residents in the days, weeks and months ahead.\nTo see my Flooding Update earlier this week, please click here\nTo find out more about my historic campaign work on flooding, please visit my campaign page here",

Not only had this held back businesses and families for too long, it had also proved dangerous for thousands of commuters travelling down unsafe single-carriage roads.\nThat’s why I vowed to get this sorted and, having worked closely with other Norfolk MPs, local councillors, the A47 Alliance, Norfolk Chamber of Commerce, businesses and community groups over the last thirteen years, I am delighted that we have dualled the A11 and secured £300 million of funding for the North Tuddenham-Easton stretch of the A47 (with early works having now begun, and full works finally due to commence in the coming months – see more here).\nThe A47 is a major transport artery into, and across, our great county. It has a crucial role to play if we are to unlock our region’s economic potential – delivering thousands of jobs, as well as the growth and prosperity needed, to help us ‘Build Back Better’ and ‘Level Up’. With the A47 dualled between Dereham and Norwich, and the A11 already fully dualled, we will have a chance to make Norfolk a hub of innovation with quick links to the Norwich Research Park and other local science and innovation growth hubs. We will also make our roads much safer for commuters.\nI do however remain committed to working with fellow parliamentary colleagues, the A47 Alliance and key stakeholders to make the case for full dualling of the A47 (all the way from Lowestoft in the East to the A1 in Cambridgeshire in the West). Only with full dualling of the entire A47 will we be able to unlock Norfolk (and the East)’s full economic potential.\nNevertheless, in the meantime, there are still urgent priority improvements that need to be made to support local communities and improve safety on routes across our area – at blackspot locations like the Necton/Dunham Junction, the Draytonhall Lane Junction at Scarning on the A47, as well as at locations on other routes like the A1067 at Guist. I am determined to do all I can to hold the likes of National Highways to account and ensure they deliver improvements to these sites.\nMaking sure our area has proper 21stC transport infrastructure is vital to us all. Rest assured, I will continue fighting for investment and upgrades to make sure we have the safe, modern transport links we need.\nFor updates on my work on this project, please do regularly check this page.\nFor 30 years, Norfolk has campaigned for A47 dualling. I have personally been on the case for the last 15 years, working with fellow Norfolk MPs, the A47 Alliance and the EDP – and was delighted to get the then Prime Minister to Mid Norfolk back in 2014 to agree the next phase of A47 improvements.\nOnly with full dualling of the entire A47 will we be able to unlock Norfolk (and the East)’s full economic potential – and make the most improvement to safety along the route.

He seeks Government support for measures in his Private Member’s Bill which includes clauses on defining responsibilities, funding, liabilities and monitoring.\nThe inaugural Norfolk Flood Summit held on 31 January 2025 at County Hall marked a significant step forward in addressing the pressing issue of flooding that has in recent years affected many towns and villages across Mid Norfolk. During the summit I presented my plans for a parliamentary bill that will tackle some of the challenges faced with inland flooding; the current framework for flood prevention, mitigation and compensation is a mess and needs radical reform.\nI called for this summit after witnessing first hand the terrible devastation that flood waters and overwhelmed sewage systems can wreak on homes and businesses in communities like Mill Lane in Attleborough. The heavy rainfall of December 23rd-24th 2020, and again in the early part of 2021, resulted in a record number of call outs for Anglian Water, the Environment Agency and Norfolk County Council alike. Further severe storms in late 2023 reminded us that we need effective flood mitigation measures in place.\nMany households saw their gardens and homes flooded with surface rain water and in some cases, raw sewage. Many more reported being unable to use toilets and showers as drainage systems and nearby pumping stations were overloaded. Sadly for some, it was the second/third/fourth time this had happened in the previous year (following similar flooding in previous years) and, quite understandably, people are at the end of their tether – feeling hopeless, and angry and distrustful of the local agencies that take their money, but provide a service well below the standard promised and which would be reasonably considered acceptable.\nThat is why I was pleased to see the summit bring together key stakeholders, including fellow MPs, local authorities, environmental agencies, water companies and community representatives. I very much welcome the support from the county council and Norfolk Strategic Flood Alliance led by Henry Cator in helping convene the event. There are currently around 30 organisations involved when a flood occurs; this needs to be streamlined and increased accountability, as well as resources, allocated to the appropriate bodies. Current legislation is not addressing the needs of our communities, so action must be taken which is why I am introducing my Private Member's Bill - Inland Flooding and Prevention (Responsibilities and Liabilities) in parliament that address four key areas-\n1) Responsibility - who does what. Sort out the chaotic duplication of responsibilities, strength statutory accountability from Whitehall to local flood authorities including IDBs.\n2) Funding - ensure adequate funding goes to the organisations that can deliver effective measures on the ground.\n3) Liabilities - provision to impose serious liabilities on developers, water companies and other statutory bodies who fail to make adequate provision for flood prevention and mitigation.\n4) Data collection and reporting - ensure proper collection and mapping on flood risk, incidence and costs, nationally, regionally and locally.\nTackling the impact of flooding has always remained a key priority for me and in 2021 I joined together with local councillors, community groups and officials of NCC, Anglian Water and the Environment Agency to form a Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership. This is an open forum in which specific flooding issues, historic wider issues and how the system for responding to and mitigating flooding events needs improving.\nThe MNFP pulled together a 14 point letter that was among the very first submissions to Lord Dannatt (then Chair of the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance) and we have continued to lobby hard for assistance and reform, which led to the first Norfolk wide flood summit.\nWe were delighted when the NSFA’s first recommendations included most of the 14 points that we had ourselves suggested in our letter to Lord Dannatt. The NSFA’s news that they would tackle ‘tranches’ of the worst affected communities was also greatly welcomed – with the first tranche including 16 towns and villages hit especially hard (of which 6 were located in Mid Norfolk). This came as a tremendous relief – and, following Lord Dannatt’s assurance that further tranches would follow, I have welcomed subsequent announcements of targeted support for other communities with specific issues in the years since (including additional targeted support packages for towns like Dereham).\nThe next steps post the flood summit will be to follow up with the relevant agencies to ensure accountability and action, to further develop my private member's bill in consultation with the key stakeholders for presentation to parliament, and to ensure that the state delivers on its responsibilities for households and businesses.",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_upgrading-norwich-cambridge-railway-line/content_33.html": "Proper transport links are vital to our prosperity. In order to develop our local economy and promote local businesses and opportunities for the next generation, we need to be connected to the rest of the world.\nWhile I helped secure the dualling of the A11 and North Tuddenham-Easton stretch of the A47 (with early works having now begun, and full works finally due to commence in the coming months – see more here), and continue to push for full A47 dualling and a number of other more local improvement works (see more here), I also believe upgraded rail links are a vital part of that better connection.\nThat’s why the improvement of our region’s rail has been one of my key missions since 2008 (when I first became a parliamentary candidate here in Mid Norfolk) – delivering tangible success.\nI launched a campaign for ‘The Innovation Express’ between Norwich and Cambridge. Despite being only 50 miles apart, travelling between the two places is difficult and takes too long. By linking them better together with a half-hourly, much improved service with first class Wifi, we can unlock a world class “innovation corridor” linking Cambridge with Ely, Brandon, Thetford, Attleborough, Wymondham and Norwich, to the benefit of the local communities, local business and the regional economy.\nThis ‘Innovation Express’ has the potential to help drive growth and prosperity in our region for the next generation, playing a key role as Norfolk leads the Green Revolution that the UK must embrace if it is to become the ‘Science Superpower’ it can and should be. I was proud therefore to announce, during my time as Minister of State for the Future of Transport, that the East-West Rail project I had long lobbied for would eventually be extended beyond Cambridge – out east to Norwich and Ipswich.\nFurthermore, as part of the efforts to create the ‘Innovation Express’, I successfully helped launch the East Anglian Rail Prospectus; successfully lobbied that responsibility for station upgrades and improvements should be moved to the train operating companies that actually use/have a direct interest in their prospering; secured a requirement for the new rail franchise to include a fleet of new, state of the art trains; and clinched the commitment of a new, East-West Rail station to the south of Cambridge – in order to bring about improved direct links from Norwich to Stansted Airport.\nI also helped launch the campaign to secure improvements at Ely North Junction and Trowse Bridge, which are vital if we are to achieve an ‘Innovation Express’ with half-hourly services. Throughout my time as MP for Mid Norfolk, I have continued to push these projects, convening Secretaries of State and Ministers for meetings with our regions MPs and key stakeholders, as well as supporting parliamentary colleagues and the likes of the APPG for the East of England, Transport East and Eastern Powerhouse as they have also driven forward efforts to highlight the importance of unblocking the “bottleneck” at this key strategic rail.\nI was therefore delighted when the Government announced it would be funding Ely North Junction improvements in October 2023. (See more)\nLonger term, I want to see the railway become the central spoke of the A11 Tech Corridor initiative which aims to nurture companies, particularly those in science, research and technology, all along the route between Norwich and Cambridge – in turn creating thousands of new jobs for local people and spreading prosperity and cleaner, greener growth to our local communities. As part of that work, I am encouraging our local councils to turn their railway stations into 21st century community meeting places and business incubators with 5G and fast access to our region’s two main growth hubs.\nIt is therefore vital that EVERYONE can access our local stations – which is why I have been such a vocal advocate for improved access and why I have actively worked on the campaign for step-free access at Platform 2 of Wymondham Station. (Full details on that campaign can be found below – and on my dedicated campaign page here)\nI also continue to lobby for an East Anglian Railway Development Corporation – one that can build the number and type of homes our region needs in a way that doesn’t destroy our rural way of life, while then channelling the funds raised back into improving the railway and reopening old Beeching lines. Ideally, an elected East Anglian Mayor would have responsibility for this corporation – working to ensure our region is “Levelled Up” and can unlock its maximum potential.\nThere remains much work to do, but please rest assured, I remain firmly committed to pursuing this in the months ahead with all of the passion and energy I have brought to it over the past 10-15 years.\nTo see more on my historic work, please do take a look at my page below.\nI was very concerned to hear reports yesterday of an FOI request made to Network Rail which suggested that the sidings beside Platform 2 of Wymondham Station had been signed out of use back in 2020 due to them requiring “a large amount of work (beyond maintenance) to get [them] back in order.”\nI met again with key stakeholders for progress updates and set the next stage of actions that aim to ensure access improvements are delivered for Platform 2 as quickly as possible – and as stage one of a wider regeneration plan for the entire station site.\nOur local rail network has a vitally important role to play if we are to turbocharge a ‘Rural Renaissance’ of local business and enterprise, as well as spread jobs, opportunities and prosperity to EVERYONE living in our local Mid Norfolk communities.\nI welcomed the opportunity to ask ministers a question at Transport OPQs last week – highlighting the importance of our rural stations as much needed hubs of rural enterprise and regeneration, and specifically the importance of addressing access issues such as those that STILL affect Platform 2 of Wymondham Station.",
  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_nhs-dentists-update-1/content_340.html": "One of the top issues in my in-tray over recent weeks and months has been NHS dentistry and the inability of so many in our area to get an appointment, even in cases of urgent care.\nThat’s why I have been campaigning hard on this issue – both locally and in Westminster. Dental health is a crucial part of NHS services and it is vital that EVERYONE can access the support they need.\nAs part of my ongoing efforts to speak up on behalf of Mid Norfolk, I welcomed the chance to be involved in a call with NHS England and the Norfolk and Waveney Integrated Care Board yesterday. With every Norfolk constituency represented, we heard more about the news that the commissioning of NHS dentistry will be delegated by NHS England to the local ICB from the beginning of April – and what that could mean for services in the future.\nFor years I have made the case that the best way to improve local NHS services is via stronger local integration (see more here). I am pleased therefore that there is broad agreement that this step will mark a positive move in that direction, allowing local NHS providers to better coordinate dental support alongside other related and/or important healthcare provision.\nI also welcomed the news that NHS England have been working with the local ICB for a year to best manage the transition of commissioning, and that they remain committed to working closely with the ICB to support their leadership, but also to address some of the wider policy issues that need addressing – such as how best we can attract and retain NHs dentists in our region.\nNHS England also indicated a willingness to engage proactively with local MPs as we drive forward calls for a new Dental School here in Norfolk (to learn more, click here), recognising the value such an institution would provide.\nAs explained in my update back in January (see here), the Government published its Our Plan for Patients in September, setting out the steps being taken to incentivise dentists to do more NHS work (not just private), as well as to take on some of the more difficult cases. In the weeks and months that followed, the Government worked at pace to begin implementing that plan and, on 25th November, introduced legislation to amend the NHS dental contract, again to better incentivise dentists to deliver care to high-need patients through fairer remuneration and improve the NHS dental sector’s resilience – for example, by allowing greater flexibility around commission so that NHS dentists can provide extra are where they are able to.\nYesterday, my fellow Norfolk MPs and I learned what, in practice, some of that will mean for services on the frontline in the short-medium term.\nDental practices will now be able to better utilise the likes of hygienists and high skilled practice staff and therapists. Moving forward, they will be able to perform a role similar to that which we’ve grown accustomed of expecting from a practice nurse in a GP surgery, being able to carry out basic check-ups and lower level care. In turn, this will increase the number of patients many of our local NHS dental practices can see, while freeing up our NHS dentists themselves to focus on the more specialist and urgent treatments that some patients require. (Having specifically called for this step to taken in my letters to the dental minister last year, I am delighted to see the Government is clearly listening to the advice being given by MPs – based on the feedback they are themselves receiving from experienced professionals in the sector).\nIn addition, NHS dental practices will have greater freedom to personalise the recall period for patients. As we know, traditionally, patients receive six monthly check ups. However, if a patient has healthy teeth and a history of good oral care, there is no need for such regular check ups. Instead, moving forward, dental practices will be able to recall patients with healthy teeth over larger timescales – for example eighteen months. This will, again, free up much needed capacity for our local NHS dentists to see patients with dental issues and, crucially, children – who are at greater risk of tooth decay in their development years.\nThe ICB will also have stronger powers to make NHS dental practices update their availability more regularly. I know from my correspondence with constituents that one of the major frustrations they have is the lack of up to date information provided by local practices.\nDespite this positive news however, I know that there remains much to be done. My fellow parliamentary colleagues and I made it clear to NHS England and the ICB that YOU, our constituents, need to see progress quickly.\nWe impressed upon them the importance of tackling the longer term structural issues to our NHS dental sector that need addressing (again, around recruitment and retention) and requested more information as to how the ICB, with NHS England support, will better monitor the performances of registered NHS dentists. We also asked them to consider what more can be done to encourage private dentists to take on more NHS dental work.\nRest assured, this remains a central focus of mine – and I will continue to lobby hard on behalf of Mid Norfolk.\nTo learn more about my NHS dental campaign to date, please click here.",

I, myself, have been on the case for 15 years, working with fellow Norfolk MPs, the A47 Alliance and the EDP – and was delighted to get the then Prime Minister to Mid Norfolk back in 2014 to agree the next phase of A47 improvements.\nSo, why has it then taken over 10 years to deliver these vital works?\nBecause Dr Andrew Boswell and a small group of eco-campaigners keep holding up these crucial projects through endless legal wranglings – while we are forced to suffer the terrible consequences of wholly inadequate safety and deadly accidents, as well as face regular flooding disruption and sitting in pollution caused by constant congestion.\nAnd who is paying for this?

However, there is much more to be done – and we need to see EVERYONE upscaling and accelerating their ongoing efforts.\nAs was the case in 2021 (when the MNFP compiled a list of 14 recommendations that formed the basis of much of the NSFA’s subsequent work and saw me, along with former NSFA Chair Lord Dannatt, lobby ministers and officials in Government for greater support), a number of actions were agreed and I look forward to working with MNFP members, as well as wider partners, to work on those and to drive forward our collective campaign – both here in Norfolk and down in Westminster.\nTo find out more about my ongoing flooding work, and stay up to date with further updates, please visit my campaign page here.",

While we have done much as a country to reach out to people with disabilities, we need to go further when it comes to access to transport.

Whilst car use is obviously essential in rural areas like this, it is clear that levels of congestion and delay from ever rising car use are not sustainable or desirable, and that a genuinely sustainable model of development needs to make great use of public transport, and in particular the fast growing Norwich- Cambridge line.\nThe upgrading of our stations is central to the improvement of our local rail infrastructure.

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_parliament_george-freeman-responds-debate-large-solar-farms/content_354.html": "George Freeman, Minister for Science, Research and Innovation, responds on behalf of the Government to a debate on the planning issues around large solar farms and the impact on the rural environment.\nThe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (George Freeman)\nIt is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. May I start by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Brendan Clarke-Smith)? The scale of attendance and the passion with which colleagues have spoken speaks to the importance of his advocacy and the issue.\nI am standing in today for my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy, Clean Growth and Climate Change, but I am absolutely delighted to be doing so, for a number of reasons. First, I come from a rural, agricultural constituency that is itself facing the introduction of substantial, industrial-scale infrastructure connected to offshore wind energy. The industrialisation of rural constituencies in pursuit of the noble aims of net zero is a local issue. It is very important and we have to get that planning process right. I have seen that for myself. I also drive through the Cambridgeshire-Suffolk border on my way to my constituency and see the Sunnica proposal, the signs in every field around the area and the concern locally.\nAs the former Minister for agritech, I am passionate about the importance of this country leading the world in net zero farming and showing how we can pioneer the technologies for and approaches to net zero agriculture. Nobody in this Chamber needs to be reminded that agriculture is the next dirty industry on the block. We are cleaning the energy system, but we will then have to decarbonise agriculture and transport globally. That is a big opportunity for this country.\nAs the Minister for Science, Research and Innovation, including for fusion, I see it as fundamental to my role to ensure that we turbocharge our drive towards the technological solutions that will allow the planet to grow and develop sustainably in the longer term. I am also committed to the science of the data metrics of sustainable development, by which I mean both agrimetrics, so that when consumers pick up a pint of milk or a piece of British food they are clear about its environmental footprint—that is the best way to reward advanced, progressive farming—and carbon metrics, so that consumers can be harnessed on the journey to net zero, confident that they are making enlightened choices. That requires good science, which a number of colleagues have touched on.\nAlicia Kearns\nI know that my hon. Friend the Minister is a strong advocate of human rights. He mentions enlightened consumers wanting to know what they are purchasing and what is in their community. Does he agree that we should not install solar panels when we know for a fact that they are being produced in genocidal camps where people are being exterminated? I am talking about the Uyghur in China.\nGeorge Freeman\nMy hon. Friend makes her point powerfully. I absolutely agree that we should not be supplying to consumers and citizens goods whose production involves torture and illegal practices. I am not the consumer affairs Minister, but I will raise that point with those who have that responsibility.\nIn the time available, I will set out the Government’s policy on solar, acknowledge the 16 very important points made today by colleagues from across the House, summarise the process in terms of disapplication and more broadly, and then make what I hope will be some important and helpful undertakings.\nIt is striking that, for all the concerns raised today, there is unanimity in the Chamber about the urgency of tackling the climate emergency. I think that everyone present supports the commitment, as enshrined at COP26, to reduce global temperature increase to 1.5°. There is good science behind that, and I think that many comments were made in that spirit. That is why the Government have adopted carbon budget 6, which is the world’s most ambitious climate change goal, to reduce emissions by 77% by 2035—that might sound a long way away, but it is rapidly drawing near—compared with 1990 levels. With limited time until that date, the UK’s electricity supply is in urgent need of decarbonisation. That is why, in the net zero strategy that was published in 2021, the Government committed that all UK electricity will be from low-carbon sources by 2035, subject to security of supply. At the end of my comments, I will come back to some of the changes relating to the global markets, the Ukraine emergency and the Prime Minister’s announcement of a review of energy policy.\nI want to touch on the benefits of solar, which merit highlighting. It is a very flexible technology. As my right hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Matt Hancock) has pointed out, we can be proud that we have deployed 99% of solar at huge scale, quite small scale and high scale across the country. Solar generates large amounts of electricity even on cloudy days, and from indirect sunlight. Solar also works at cooler temperatures, so its carbon footprint is normally much lower than that of coal or gas. Most solar panel components can be recycled.\nSolar can complement other variable generation sources, such as wind, to balance the grid on summer days when wind speeds tend to be lower. We see solar as key to the Government’s strategy for low-cost energy and decarbonisation, and large-scale solar is one of the UK’s cheapest renewable generation technologies; I will come in my closing comments to where the externalities of cost may lie. That is why in the net zero strategy, the Government committed to a sustained increase in deploying solar in the 2020s and beyond, embedded through the contract for difference scheme.\nI want to pick up the points that several colleagues have made, because those points are hugely important and need to be acknowledged seriously. The first was about the scale of what is being proposed. As the equivalent of 4,000 football pitches, this is not a small-scale development or even, by most people’s standards, a medium-scale one. This is huge, industrial-scale development in the countryside. There were fears about a wild west and a solar rush, and about precedent in the planning system—if one of these developments gets approved, it may be a signal that we are locked into precedent. There were concerns, which I share, about the use of good agricultural land and, particularly in the light of the Ukraine situation, about food security.\nConcerns were raised about the solar supply chain—both the human rights point that my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns) made, and the carbon footprint point. There were concerns about the lack of metrics of sustainability, and about taking into account the full externalities of the carbon footprint of developments. There were concerns about the abuse of the local planning system. I have been very struck in my constituency by the fact that because this is critical national infrastructure, the views of local people and local MPs—frankly, anybody locally—are very downgraded. The planning advice states that those local views are important, so I think that there is a real issue there.\nThere were specific concerns about Rutland and habitat impact, and calls for a clearer national policy on tackling these policy tensions. Points were made about the impact of the Ukraine emergency on food supplies, food security and food prices. Points were also made about the link to surreptitious approvals of, effectively, battery farms in inappropriate locations, about fire risk, about the impact on rural tourism and about the need for better co-location of generation, where possible, with use. My right hon. Friend the Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Sir John Hayes) made a point about beauty, identity and character, which is not just a magnificent ethereal concept; it also underpins tourism in the countryside. Some very important points have been made, and they deserve to be repeated and acknowledged. Forgive me; I am not going to list everybody, but Hansard will report what has been set out.\nMatt Hancock\nI am grateful to the Minister for giving way, because I have made several interventions. On the point about fire safety, will he take on board, and comment on, the need for transparency about past fires? I should also have mentioned in my speech that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Lucy Frazer), cannot speak because she is a member of the Government, but she wholeheartedly endorses my views and is a great campaigner for her constituency when it comes to the Sunnica plant—and more broadly.\nGeorge Freeman\nI will happily pick that point up. My right hon. Friend invites me—wisely, perhaps, given the time—to clarify that at the end of this debate, I will raise all the points that have been made today with the relevant Ministers, including, perhaps, the Minister for fire safety. When such a number of colleagues meet in the Chamber, their points deserve to be heard and passed through.\nI want to pick up on the planning point. Colleagues will be aware, but those listening may not be, that planning applications for projects below 50 MW are determined by the local planning system. Many hundreds of them around the country have been approved satisfactorily. Projects up to 350 MW in Wales are devolved, with decisions made either by local authorities or the Welsh Government. Planning in Scotland and Northern Ireland is fully devolved. For projects over 50 MW in England and over 350 MW in Wales, planning decisions are made by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\nKevin Hollinrake (Thirsk and Malton) (Con)\nLocal authorities’ declaration of a climate emergency seems to be overriding the requirement to avoid developments on best and most versatile land. Should there not be an absolute prohibition of solar farm developments on BMVL?\nGeorge Freeman\nMy hon. Friend makes his point well. Let me come to the point I was going to make about planning, which tries to deal with that.\nIn 2021, the Government set up a national infrastructure planning reform programme, bringing several Government Departments together with the aim of refreshing how the nationally significant infrastructure project regime works to make it faster, better and greener. The Government will shortly consult on reform proposals—we will do so later this year. As a part of that, the Government are reviewing the national policy statements for energy. It seems to me that quite a lot of what has been said today is a call for a clearer national policy statement, and colleagues might want to raise that with the Minister for Energy and the Planning Minister. The draft revised national policy statement for renewables includes a new section on solar projects, providing clear and specific guidance to decision makers on the impact on, for example, local amenities, biodiversity, landscape, wildlife and land use, which must be considered when assessing planning applications. The Government plan to publish a response to the consultation on the revised national policy statement shortly.\nUnder both local and NSIP planning systems, developers must complete proper community engagement as part of the application process. Communities should and must be able to participate in the formal examination process run by the Planning Inspectorate. All large solar developers under the NSIP must complete an environmental statement for any application, to consider all potential impacts. Planning guidance is also clear that the effective use of land should be prioritised by focusing large-scale solar farms on previously developed and non-greenfield land. It seeks to minimise the impact on the best and most versatile agricultural land. It requires developers to justify using any such land and to design their projects to avoid, mitigate and, where necessary, compensate for impacts.\nI am conscious of the time—I think I have one minute left—but I want to highlight that in relation to the planning process colleagues will understand that I cannot comment on the specifics of this individual case, because I do not want to prejudice it in any way. However, we anticipate that once an application is submitted to the planning inspector, it will be 15 to 18 months before it comes back to the Secretary of State after all the various consultations. Interestingly, in terms of precedent —all-important in planning—only one large-scale solar application has been approved, in Kent. One in Wales, Strawberry Hill—devolved, of course—was turned down on the agricultural land use point. I understand that one in Scunthorpe is imminent, and that Sunnica and one or two others are in the pipeline. The point about precedent is important: we all know that when a big decision is made it can trigger a wave of subsequent applications.\nLet me close by congratulating and thanking colleagues for coming today. They have raised important points that I will undertake to pass on to Ministers who have responsibility for energy, planning, farming, tourism and fire safety. Colleagues have made a very important case for a stronger and clearer national policy statement, reflecting the situation in Ukraine and the Prime Minister’s emphasis on food and energy security. I will undertake to make sure that the points raised today are picked up by all the relevant Ministers.",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_attcare/content_421.html": "Throughout my time as a local MP, I have consistently stated my belief that new developments in our rural towns and villages must be sustainable, accompanied by the necessary infrastructure and services required to support both it and the pre-existing community.\nThat’s why, through my not-for-profit organisation The Norfolk Way, I have worked with local community groups and councillors to promote a more local and organic model of development – one that gives local councils and communities much more local control and greater freedoms and incentives to plan and build better: reducing avoidable and wasteful commuting by car, while promoting better public transport links, more recreational facilities for children, increased use of local design codes, and supporting the vibrant villages and thriving towns that are the backbone of Norfolk.\nHealth provision is an important part of this discussion. Local communities, as well as those moving into new developments, need to know that they can access the local health services they need, when they need them.\nStrangely however, unlike like education, health provision does not receive upfront investment as new developments are granted permission and begun. Instead, investment comes further down the line and, while smaller settlements may be able to cope with such growth, larger towns and villages (especially those experiencing rapid growth) may not.\nThat’s why local groups like ATTCARE are so vital. ATTCARE is a local organisation that was set up as part of the Attleborough Town Plan to shine a light on the town’s health and social care needs. Its volunteers speak up for local residents and, with the significant amount of growth coming the town, recently reached out and asked me to help convene a meeting of key local stakeholders, including local councillors, GP surgery representatives and local council officials.\nThis past Friday, we discussed the pressures already facing the local NHS in Attleborough and the need to unite and speak to senior NHS, local Council and Government officials with a strong voice about what the town needs if it is to be able to meet the health needs of its increasing population over the short, medium and long term. It was a very constructive discussion and, having previously made representations on behalf of our other Mid Norfolk towns with regards to the lack of logic involved when health provision does not get upfront investment in growing communities, I am delighted to now be working with the ATTCARE team to convene a larger roundtable in the not too distant future, where we will make the case for greater support, investment and action in Attleborough.\nWith the growth coming to the town, the local health services must be supported.

Through better integration and by embracing new technologies.\nFor too long our area has suffered from a lack of properly joined up planning by a wide variety of bodies; and nowhere more so than in health and care. While important strides have been made to strengthen service integration in recent years (notably via the creation of the Norfolk and Waveney NHS Integrated Care Board, as well as the work being driven forward by Norfolk County Council), I believe we can, and should, go further.\nThat’s why, as part of my regular schedule of constituency visits, I was delighted to visit White’s Training in Watton this past Friday – meeting with Jack and the team to find out about the company’s pioneering work in the health and social care sector.\nFormed in 2017, the company delivers innovative training to staff and companies working across health and social care – increasingly utilising VR products and other exciting technologies to develop new, more efficient methods of training.\nThe company has also been working tirelessly to develop a new AI software solution that could serve as a tool for digitalising these key sectors – seamlessly integrating and improving communication between the likes of patients, their families, care providers and the various levels of the NHS and in turn driving forward standards and efficiency.

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_parliament_george-freeman-welcomes-budget/content_298.html": "George Freeman welcomes the Budget and, in particular, the emphasis on public sector enterprise and innovation and the focus of wage increases and tax cuts for those on lowest incomes.\nGeorge Freeman (Mid Norfolk) (Con)\nLast year, after the disappointment of the general election manifesto process, I left the Government in order to make the case that we needed to make this a moment of much bolder national renewal, that we needed to move on from the first phase of reducing the deficit through a programme of austerity and that we needed to set a trajectory of higher growth, more public sector enterprise and innovation, and wage increases and tax cuts focused on the poorest—those on the lowest incomes—in our society. Let me start by saying that I strongly welcome the Chancellor’s Budget for all those reasons. He managed to square an almost impossible circle in a clever Budget that has done something important for some of the most vulnerable in our society.\nAs a constituency MP, I wish to mention in particular the measures to support the high street. In Mid Norfolk, as in many other rural constituencies, we have seen our high streets hit hard by a big transfer to online retail without the digital giants paying tax in return, and I welcome the measures that the Government have taken to support our high streets. In particular, in health and care day of the Budget debate, I want to highlight the £10 billion put aside for social care; the extraordinary announcement, which I strongly welcome, of the launch of the first mental health emergency service; the £10,000 for every primary school and £50,000 for every secondary school; the £400 million a year for our schools; and the £2 billion to make sure that universal credit is properly funded. These, I suggest, are compassionate steps taken by a Government still paying off the legacy of the appalling inheritance from the Labour party, but doing so in a way that tries to put the needs of the most vulnerable in society first.\nAll of that is made possible because of the extraordinary economic success over which we have managed to preside. It pains Opposition Members, which is why they are all looking away, that the rate of real income growth has been rising. In the next five years, the OBR forecasts that there will be a bigger real-terms rise in real incomes for the lowest paid than for anybody else, and 3 million new jobs. This is a success story, and nothing tells us how important it is more than the howls of derision from the Opposition, so upset are they that more and more people in this country are not in need of Labour party support. People are coming to us because they know that ours is the party that supports growth.\nI want to acknowledge that after eight very painful years, there is a weariness afoot among both those on the frontline of public services, who have tightened their belts, and the lowest-paid people in work. Those two groups have tightened their belts far more than those in plum jobs in government, in Whitehall, or even in local government. We need, as a House, to say to them that they have earned it and to send a very sincere thank you. The British people have tightened their belts far harder than the Government have in the past eight years.\nTalking of public sector workers and the need for public sector leadership, I want to thank the Chancellor for announcing the new public sector leadership academy—an academy to support those on the frontline of public services, who have one of the hardest jobs in our society. [Interruption.] The hon. Member for Dewsbury (Paula Sherriff) might say that is rubbish, but that is because she has never had to run anything. The people on the frontline of our public services are actually running very complex public services. They, alongside the lowest-paid people in work, are the people to we need to support in the next five years in tightening the belt and delivering the innovation and efficiency that the public want to see.\nPaula Sherriff (Dewsbury) (Lab)\nI note that the hon. Gentleman said that I have never had to run anything. I wonder whether he would like to change his mind given that I ran a crime management centre in a police station and two incredibly busy departments in a busy hospital. Perhaps he would like to correct the record.\nGeorge Freeman\nI will happily correct that bit of the record, as long as the hon. Lady welcomes the public sector leadership academy, because, given her experience, she will know how important it is.\nIf we are really to tackle the structural legacy of the 13 years of a Labour Government that led to the biggest economic crisis in this country’s peacetime history—[Interruption.] That is a reality that Labour Members now shout down because it is inconvenient. The crisis that a new generation of voters needs to be consistently reminded of was the legacy of 13 years of a Labour Government. If we are to tackle that, we will have to do two important things: yes, we must continue to drive the modernisation of public service, but we must also increase the rate of growth and revenue generation in the economy by the Government. Even more powerfully, over the next five years we need somehow to make those two ambitions work together. I would like to share some thoughts on how we might do that.\nThe truth is that our growth rate has dropped since the EU referendum, from 3% to 1.5%. Therefore the first thing that we need to do is to get a good Brexit deal for business confidence. I hope that the Opposition will take the opportunity of the forthcoming Brexit votes to put the needs of business, prosperity and the economy ahead of ideology or party politics. We also need to create an environment in which we can unlock business investment in this country. There is £600 billion tied up on businesses’ balance sheets, and we need to trigger the confidence needed to unlock that money in the post-Brexit dividend. We will not get it unless the Brexit deal gives business the certainty that it needs in the years ahead.\nWe also need to go much faster on infrastructure. I am delighted that, at this point, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has entered the Chamber, because for eight years she and I have been holding meetings to try to accelerate funding for the Ely rail junction. I want the Treasury now to recognise that, across the country, there are infrastructure schemes that could be funded by private finance. I am talking not about PFI, but about giving local authorities and mayors powers to set up infrastructure bonds to create more innovative ways of driving investment into our public services. If we regenerated rail links and rail lines, gave planning permission for stations and developed innovative schemes for capturing the value increase around those lines, we could harness that growth to fund new models of infrastructure.\nI particularly welcome the Government’s continued emphasis, through the industrial strategy, on fields such as life sciences, robotics and artificial intelligence so that we can create in this country the research platform needed to support the creation of the jobs and businesses of tomorrow. But if we are to be more than just a research economy—if we are to be a genuine innovation nation that pulls innovation through into practice—we need an economy that uses innovation in the private and public sectors. The great trick is to harness the power of innovation in our public services, and nowhere more than in the NHS. If we are really to lead the world in digital health and digital medicine, and the extraordinary revolution that that offers, we will not do it with an NHS running on paper and cardboard. We need to make the NHS a genuine catalyst for UK leadership in digital health. It is the same in genomics. When I set up the UK genomics programme, the idea was not only that we would launch the world’s first genomic medicines service in the NHS, which we have, but crucially that, in so doing, we would make this country a leader in genomic research and life science investment.\nThis, in the end, is the key to getting out of the debt that we inherited from the Labour party—the high-debt, low-growth model that yesterday’s Budget acknowledged. We have to somehow unlock innovation in our public services and drive much higher rates of growth in the private sector. With Brexit coming to its resolution here in this House in the next few weeks, we have to make it a catalyst for the renaissance of innovation and enterprise, and the moment at which we set out a vision for public services in the 21st century.\nEarlier intervention in the same debate\nGeorge Freeman (Mid Norfolk) (Con)\nI am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for mentioning suicide. I wonder whether there is anything in this Budget that he can welcome, even though I appreciate that we may differ. Does he not welcome the announcement on mental health or the announcement of a £21 million centre of excellence for public sector leaders?\nJohn McDonnell\nOf course we welcome more money for mental health, but what was required was £4 billion, not £2 billion; and that £2 billion was contained within the £20 billion that had already been announced, so it is not additional money. There are some things that we can work on on a cross-party basis in this House, but we have to be honest about the needs and the requirements, and we have to be straightforward in saying how they can be funded.",
  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_post-office-ltd-horizon-software-scandal/content_92.html": "The mistreatment of sub-postmasters by the Post Office as a result of the Horizon software scandal was a massive miscarriage of justice, in which the legitimate complaints of innocent sub-postmasters were treated with appalling institutional contempt – even long after it had become clear that there was a serious failure in the software.\nThe resulting hounding of innocent sub-postmasters – treated as guilty until they could prove their innocence – made to pay huge amounts in respect of non-existent “losses” to the Post Office, resulting in unfair dismissals, bankruptcies and many cases of imprisonment and in several cases sub-postmasters taking their own lives is a national scandal.\nI first became aware of the issue here in Mid Norfolk when several postmasters around the constituency contacted me during my time as a parliamentary candidate before 2010. After 2010 as the MP, when working to save our 3 rural Post Offices threatened by the Post Office with closure, during which several postmasters mentioned the software issues. At first I suspected it was part of a financial campaign by the Post Office to close rural post offices on the grounds of low financial viability. But it soon became clear from my constituency inbox that the problem was widespread which is why, over the years, I have taken their cases extremely seriously and provided support – meeting with them at constituency surgeries, making representations to ministers, raising in the House and as a Minister.\nAs so many of us know, local post offices play a crucial role in our local towns and villages. They are a hub in so many of our communities, bringing people together and providing vital services to households and businesses – services particularly depended upon by our most vulnerable and elderly. That’s why over the years, I’ve been such a supporter of local post office branches across Mid Norfolk – from fighting for the SubPostmaster and continued services at Gressenhall Post Office (see here and here) to helping Watton secure a new home for its High Street branch at Edwards Newsagents (see and here and here), and from opening the community shop and post office in Rocklands (see here) to now working with Attleborough councillors as efforts to return a branch to the town High Street continue.\nThe importance of the service our local branches provide in a rural area like ours cannot be overstated – and I will continue to do all I can to stand up for and support them.\nThe inquiry into the Horizon scandal – and now this TV and film exposé exposing the full story of the cover-up – has rightly shocked and appalled the nation. This should never have happened - and it should have been resolved properly years ago when it first became clear that there was a software problem. The fact that it’s been dragged out for years with innocent SubPostmasters put through hell long after the point at which senior management and officials in the relevant Government departments knew that the software was faulty is a disgrace.\nThe story has connected with the public because it seems to represent the seemingly deepening trend in our country of unaccountable management and officials in comfy jobs hiding behind software & bureaucratic technical excuses whilst the public increasingly suffer in frustrated silence, and a lack of political scrutiny and accountability of too many in senior positions.\nI’m therefore delighted that the full scale of the scandal is finally getting the public scrutiny and attention it deserves and why I welcomed the opportunity to be present in the House on the first day of the new Parliamentary session for the urgent debate secured on the scandal and why I will continue to ensure my affected constituents, as well as my constituents who are more widely (and rightly) concerned, are heard.\nI am delighted that following pressure from the Honours Committee and PM Paula Vennells CBE is being withdrawn.\nAlan Bates, the SubPostmaster who led the campaign, should have it instead in honour of all those who have been so appalling treated.\nBut the size and scale of this miscarriage of justice demands more than just an apology and promises of “never again”.\nPublic trust in the very fabric of our structure and culture of public administration, law, democratic accountability, Parliamentary scrutiny and justice demands Ministers act with the urgency and boldness that the scale of this saga demands.\nThat’s why I’m calling for:\n- an Act of Parliament to\n- absolve all of the sub-postmasters\n- expedite compensation for ALL those affected - including the invented “losses” that SubPostmasters were forced to pay to the Post Office\n- criminal convictions against the Post Office and other senior officials responsible for this injustice\n- full recommendation of the reforms proposed by Sir Wyn Williams’ Horizon IT Public Inquiry to ensure the right lessons are learned - about public accountability for HMG owned bodies, the contractual failings in the procurement of the software, the failings in the legal system and the inexcusable delays with compensation once it became clear that the Sub Postmasters had been wrongfully treated.\nThis is a story of deep and systemic failure at the heart of our system of public administration which demands more than just an apology.\nIt is incumbent on all those who have been involved over the last 20yrs to make sure not just that justice is done - vital though that is - but that the political establishment as a whole can show it is capable of confronting its palpaple failures and learning the lessons and making the necessary reforms. Because this is ultimately about public trust in our systems of government, Parliament, public administration, law and justice.\nWhich is precisely why it’s connected so deeply with the public: it’s a story of establishment cover-up by the governing elites in public administration at the expense of the law abiding “little guy” who has all too little voice or power.\nIt’s this crisis of “unaccountable elites” which I - and others - have been writing and speaking and warning about for over 20yrs. And which in the public’s view has actually worsened in recent years. As I have said often I believe the EU Referendum was as much about this - the failure of our own political economy - as it was about the EU. It’s partly why the call to “Take Back Control” resonated so strongly.\n—-\nThat’s why on my only personal exposure to the case as a Minister on the one occasion when I was required by the Department to deputise in a House of Commons debate for the absent Minister for postal affairs I refused to simply read out the speech prepared by departmental officials and insisted on a half day of full briefing meetings from all the officials and Post Office management involved so that I could be confident of the facts before accounting to Parliament for the Department. I remember specifically asking to speak to Paula Vennells but her refusing to meet me without her lawyer present.\nAlthough it was not my Ministerial portfolio responsibility I flagged with the Secretary of State at the time that it felt like the Post Office and officials were actively doing everything possible to avoid any acceptance of any responsibility and support the PO managenent line that the responsibility was all on the Sub Postmasters.\nCredit is due to my Colleagues Paul Scully MP and Kevin Hollinrake MP who as Post Office Ministers *did* grip it and insist on culpability being accepted by the Post Office and compensation paid.\nLater in 2021, then as Minister of State for Science, Research and Innovation, I was again required to deputise at a subsequent debate on this crucial issue (see the Hansard record here) I made a point of stressing the importance of righting the appalling injustice sub-postmasters had faced – emphasising the impact on a number here in Mid Norfolk and specifically mentioning Gressenhall where I had seen the profound impact and misery this scandal had inflicted upon the family that had run the post office there (see that specific point recorded on Hansard here).\nvideo clip here\nThis scandal is about so many things - but at its heart it’s about a systemic failure over many years of scrutiny, responsibility and accountability.\nThat’s what makes this such a scandal. And why it demands such a serious response.\nI’ve always believed very strongly that one of the key strengths of our Parliamentary democracy is that Ministers of the Crown are accountable to their peers in an elected Parliament and to their sovereign and their constituents over and above their collective responsibility to the particular Government of the day. That’s how we ensure Government serves the people rather than the other way around.\nHaving Ministers who owe a primary loyalty of sworn allegiance to the Crown, Law, and Parliament before becoming Ministers of the Crown is one of the key pillars of our constitutional system of democratic defence against tyranny.\nWhen the instinct of the Whitehall or bureaucratic or corporate machine is to defend itself at all costs and admit no possibility of culpability or responsibility, as sometimes happens, the primary duty of Ministers not to mislead Parliament means they MUST test and cross-examine all official Departmental briefings and be sure that they are personally comfortable to put their career on the line defending the Government position at the Despatch Box. That is the responsibility that goes with the privilege of holding Office.\nIn my 13 years in Parliament as a Minister across several Departments, I’ve seen the standards and conventions of Parliamentary accountability and sovereignty eroded in a number of ways.\nIt urgently needs repairing and restoring.\nBoth to avoid miscarriages of justice and lack of transparency in Whitehall in cases like the Post Office Horizon scandal and to repair public trust in our Parliamentary democracy.",

It was a pleasure to visit the brilliant Thomas Bullock Primary in Shipdham last week.\nMid Norfolk is home to dozens of much loved schools that play a vital role in our local communities.\nAs we know however, rural schools have higher costs compared to those in urban areas and, for decades, were very often underfunded in comparison to their urban counterparts. They also face a wide variety of different, acute challenges compared to urban schools that need different solutions and support.\nThat’s why, throughout my time as the local MP, I have been one of our local education sector’s biggest advocates (especially with regards to SEND support in our mainstream and specialist schools – see more on my campaign page here). I have always made a point of regularly visiting local schools as part of my programme of Mid Norfolk constituency visits, as well as maintaining frequent and open dialogue with headteachers, staff and governors in order to best speak up on their behalf and provide support.\nIt's also why I have so actively lobbied in Westminster over the years for greater funding, support and resources to ensure schools in rural areas like Mid Norfolk are not left behind – instead receiving the assistance they require to ensure our local youngsters, whatever their background, get the education and opportunities they need and deserve.\nBack in 2010, there was a widespread appreciation that, after over a decade of Labour Government, the country needed to tighten its belts and work hard to erase the deficit (the highest in the United Kingdom’s peacetime history) and begin reducing the national debt.\nOver the past thirteen years, I have been struck by how many local teachers, heads, governors and parents shared that appreciation and urgency – and I have watched with great admiration as rural schools in Mid Norfolk have worked tirelessly to deliver “more for less”. Rarely, if ever, have they complained of the greater financial constraints within which they have had to operate during this time.\nI am acutely aware however that rising costs and pressures over the past couple of years are presenting a very significant challenge to many schools in our area – compounded by challenges with SEND provision and the demands placed upon them by OFSTED.\nIt’s for that reason why I continue to campaign hard for greater support and funding for rural schools, and why I also continue to place great importance on my engagement with local staff.\nOn this campaign page, you will find more information on my historic and ongoing campaign efforts – with regular updates being posted.\nRest assured, I am determined to speak up on behalf of our local Mid Norfolk schools to ensure their voices are being heard at the highest levels.",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_frustration-mounts-over-closure-much-demand-health-facility/content_165.html": "Concern has been raised with medical bosses over the closure of Toftwood Surgery, Dereham by Mid Norfolk MP George Freeman.\nThe surgery closed its doors for the final time on the 31 March 2025 after the NHS said it could not agree terms for a lease extension with the landlord and North Elmham GP Practice who run the facility. For several months George has been working to try and broker an agreement with the Integrated Care Board and the landlord of the GP's premises to secure the long term future of the practice.\nThe move to close the surgery has also been opposed by the Norfolk Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee. The surgery, which had been rated 'good' by the Care Quality Commission, first alerted patients of the impending closure in October 2024. A public consultation followed with hundreds of patients citing concerns about access to appointments and waiting times that the closure could create.\nCommenting on the current situation, local MP George Freeman said\n“This is incredibly frustrating and I know is causing real concern for local residents, especially the many elderly residents who rely on Toftwood Surgery and struggle to get across town to other surgeries. These surgeries are both already under significant pressure from the increase in demand. I have tried to help NHS managers and the landlord of Toftwood surgery to negotiate a deal to secure the long-term viability of the medical centre - but regrettably they could not agree terms.\n“My immediate priority now is to ensure that there is a smooth transition for Toftwood registered patients to the two surgeries in Dereham. I have contacted Toftwood residents and if they have not received notification from the ICB of their new surgery, I will follow up as a matter of priority. I have made clear to the NHS ICB that this must be a temporary arrangement and that Toftwood needs a new community health hub.\n“With the new government increasing housing allocation in Breckland by 50 percent, and the growing demand for local healthcare rising steadily, it is madness to be closing local health facilities. I am therefore calling on all parties to work together, at pace, to develop a South Dereham Community Health Hub.\n“I will also be pressing ministers to ensure Mid Norfolk has the necessary infrastructure to accommodate patient needs.\n“Having secured the funding for the renovation of the Fred Nicholas SEND school site - perfectly positioned in the middle of Toftwood - this would be an ideal site for a community health centre - with GP, Community surgery, nurses and a dentistry clinic for the new dentists coming out of the new UEA Dental Training hub. I am also urging the Town Council and Breckland Council to adopt this as part of the Dereham Town Plan. When new houses are built, they must come with proper facilities.”",

This is of course not acceptable.\nNeither I nor the communities concerned are opposed to the principle of offshore wind energy or accommodating the necessary infrastructure to bring it onshore. However, we believe that locals should have a greater say in how it is delivered – where it is situated and how the effects of it are mitigated. Why place a huge substation on some of the highest land in Norfolk when the local community are suggesting it be placed in lower-lying land only a very short distance away?\nI welcome the country’s move towards sustainable/renewable energy sources, and the East could be at the forefront of these efforts – bringing valuable skills and investment to our area.

There will be colder weather, and many of my houses are not on the gas grid, while rural areas traditionally have lower incomes and we have an elderly population.\nThe Treasury, very helpfully—it is a shame Ministers did not read it—did a piece of work last year looking at the risks of rural poverty and the higher risk of rural areas falling into real poverty. The Treasury’s own figures showed that the average household at risk of poverty in rural areas needs an extra £800; or in layman’s terms, there is a two and a half times—or 250%—higher risk of rural houses falling into rural poverty. So I find it completely extraordinary that Labour, which in government professes to care about poverty and berated my party when in government about the risks of rural poverty and of pensioner poverty, has decided as their first act to punish people in rural areas.\nIt is because of those rural risks that, earlier this year, I and a number of colleagues set up a fair funding alliance, supported by Action with Communities in Rural England, the Countryside Alliance and rural bodies. Higher fuel and energy prices are hitting rural areas, and we would have hoped that this Government might have listened. I am proud that the Conservative party in government upgraded pensions, protected the triple lock and took 200,000 pensioners out of poverty.\nBen Maguire (North Cornwall) (LD)\nThe former Member for Thornbury and Yate introduced the triple lock, which was actually a Liberal Democrat policy. Would the hon. Member care to correct the record on that point?\nGeorge Freeman\nIt was my good friend the now noble Lord Willetts in a coalition Government with the Liberal Democrats, and I will happily debate with the hon. Member some of the brave decisions we took.\nThe point is that this party, the Conservative party, protected pensioners, protected the triple lock and lifted 200,000 people out of poverty, but we see this Labour Government make this decision. The Minister put it very clearly earlier. This is an attack on people who own their own homes, people who have retired in rural areas and those just over the threshold, and in Labour world they are millionaires. This will not be forgotten by people in my constituency, the low-income rural pensioners who have saved up to be able to afford their own home and are now being clobbered. It is unfair, it is unjust, it is unjustifiable, it is unprecedented, and I urge and beg Ministers to think again.",

Present were the Chief Fire Officer for Norfolk Ceri Sumner, the Leader of Norfolk County Council Kay Mason Billig, and local councillors Margaret Dewsbury and Phillip Duigan. It was a pleasure to learn more about the work of the Urban Search and Rescue(USAR) team. Initially set up in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, this highly trained team can be deployed to a range of situations including road traffic accidents, wildfires, floods, building collapses, and more.\nThey form part of the national USAR response forces, with their location in Dereham giving them important coverage of the East of England, and ensuring that a USAR team can reach anywhere across the UK within an appropriate timescale.\nTheir demonstration on Friday highlighted the important skillsets which USAR has, from confined space searches and at-height rescues to rapid and effective area searches using sniffer dogs. To maintain and utilise their skills they have special equipment such as drones, and train intensively. It was a privilege to be able to see examples of this training on Friday.\nAs skilled as USAR and the wider Norfolk Fire Service are, it is CRITICAL that we ALL remain vigilant – both in preventing fires and emergencies, and knowing what information to provide when reporting one. This means that the Fire Service can allocate resources to where they are needed most, helping keep us all safer. Whilst we have experienced some recent rain, items as innocuous as a piece of broken glass remain enough to start potentially devastating fires. Please see the graphics and read the advice at the bottom of this article, so that you know how to help keep our Mid Norfolk community safe.\nPlease rest assured that I remain fully committed to ensuring that USAR has a long-term future here in Norfolk, alongside the wider Norfolk Fire Service, and have the support they need to continue their life-saving work.\nNORFOLK FIRE AND RESCUE GUIDANCE\n1. Prevent wildfires\nResidents and visitors can help prevent wildfires in Norfolk by following four simple steps:\n1. Dispose of cigarette butts responsibly rather than throwing them on the ground\n2. Do not have BBQs in parks and public spaces other than designated areas. Portable BBQs pose the greatest risk, especially when they are placed directly on the ground - avoid using them altogether\n3. Do not have campfires or bonfires except in carefully managed and designated areas. You must never leave them unattended and always have the ability toextinguish them if you need to\n4. Do not drop glass bottles because they can magnify the sun's rays and cause fires\nRemember, if you see any signs of smoke or wildfire report it immediately to 999\n2. Protect your home\nAll residents should take steps to protect their home from wildfire\n1. Trim back shrubs or trees that are close to / touching your home and dispose of cuttings responsibly. Piles of cuttings are fuel for fire.\n2. Clear away any build-up of flammable material in and around your garden such as leaves, compost heaps, log piles, dry grass etc.\n3. Check for spaces between roof tiles or within your home where burning embers could become lodged such as rain gutters.\n4. Position sheds and outbuilding away from your home and make sure that flammable substances (including fertilisers and pesticides) are stored safely\n5.

Together with Greater Anglia, they developed initial plans and drawings for delivering a step-free access solution ‘preferred option’ – with South Norfolk Council, vocally supported by myself and many others, successfully securing £600,000 to go towards the works as part of the Greater Norwich Transforming Cities Fund bid.\nUnfortunately however, Network Rail subsequently had to reject that ‘preferred option’ – informing the Taskforce that they now needed to retain slightly more of the sidings than had originally been thought. This change made the ‘preferred option’ untenable and therefore alternative options are having to be explored.\nConcerned by the reports that the sidings may have in fact been signed out of use (contrary to the information Network Rail had previously provided), I directly contacted the Senior Public Affairs Manager for the Anglia Route at Network Rail who has today reassured me that this is not the case.\nNetwork Rail have confirmed that there were sidings beside Platform 1 which have been signed out of use, but that the sidings beside Platform 2 remain in use. They have reiterated that they remain committed to working with local stakeholders on the campaign working to deliver step-free access to Platform 2, recognising the importance of the campaign to so many in the local community.\nWhile still happy to shorten their sidings beside Platform 2, Network Rail must retain enough of the sidings so that they can be used by their engineering trains. Unfortunately, this means that the previously agreed ‘preferred option’ remains unfeasible – but I continue to work closely with key stakeholders to explore alternative options and remain committed to doing all I can to help get this campaign over the line.\nFull details of the campaign, including the progress made in recent months, can be found on my campaign page here.",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_parliament_george-freeman-calls-bold-action-tackle-flooding-challenges-norfolk/content_49.html": "George Freeman raises the increasing problem of flooding in inland Norfolk as a result of climate change, aging infrastructure struggling to cope with modern demands, and the fragmentation of responsibility for water management. He seeks Government support for measures in his Private Member’s Bill which includes clauses on defining responsibilities, funding, liabilities and monitoring.\nGeorge Freeman (Mid Norfolk) (Con)\nIt is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Christopher. I congratulate the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Steff Aquarone) on bringing this debate to the House. It is great to see so many colleagues from all parties. If ever there was an issue that unites us all, it is this. At the beginning of my fifth Parliament, I have never seen so many all-party parliamentary groups set up or seen them so well attended—most struggle to find enough Members to be quorate. I have been to four, each with about 30 people from all parties in the room. I welcome what the Minister has said about properly reviewing and getting to grips with this issue and wish her well. She will find a lot of parliamentary support for bold reforming action, which is long overdue.\nFor me, this began in the inland constituency of Mid Norfolk—the clue is in the name. It has no coast and is largely Breckland; it should be dry. So why am I leading the charge on flooding? It is because in 2020, I and many of my constituents spent the Christmas period using mops and buckets in our houses as great rains swept through. In so many parts of the country, areas that have not traditionally been affected by flooding suddenly are. We set up the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership with 13 villages, and we set up the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance. I pay tribute to Lord Dannatt, who set up the alliance, and Henry Cator, who now runs it very well. We were in the process of convening Norfolk’s first inland flood summit, which was postponed because of the election. It is very important.\nThere are 36 organisations in Norfolk alone tasked with and sharing responsibility for dealing with flooding. None of them are able to take responsibility properly. I will be kind, but the buck gets passed. People have had enough. We need a summit in which we, the representatives of the people of Norfolk, can gather with those agencies and get on top of where the flooding is happening, where it is becoming more intense, what is being done about it and prioritised for our county, and the short, medium and long-term plan.\nI have prepared a private Member’s Bill to support the Minister; I will be introducing it shortly and I hope it will contribute to the reforms that she is considering. I hope it will be good enough that she decides to incorporate it into her reforms. I will speak in a moment about what that Bill sets out to do but, as with so many public policy problems, it is worth being clear about what the problem is and what is causing it.\nFirst, I want to suggest climate change. Earlier this year, we had the wettest seven months on record, and we have had the wettest past few years on record. That is what is driving the problem.\nSecondly, in my part of the world, that problem is compounded by a huge amount of housing. The boundaries changed because about 10,000 extra houses have been built in Mid Norfolk in the past 14 years. Many of them are built on the outskirts of villages, without proper drainage infrastructure, which has meant plugging modern drains into Victorian village drain infrastructure. When there is intense rain, it all merges and sewage starts rising through people’s gardens and lavatories.\nThirdly, I mention riparian rights: we have seen huge confusion about who is actually responsible for maintaining ditches. Fourthly, there is contract farming, or an increase in outsourcing farming to contractors. In the old days on our family farm, in quiet months we would clear the ditches and mend the fences. These days, that kind of stuff is not always in the contract. Ditches are being neglected because of the reality of modern contract farming.\nFifthly, Anglian Water has been focusing—and I will be kind—on supplying water to the east and on mitigating leakage. It is investing billions. Ten years ago, the problem was loss of water, and that is still the case in the summer months. However, in winter, we have a massive problem. We need to make sure that our water companies are investing in the problem in the latter half of the year, as well as dealing with the shortages in the summer. Of course, catchment geography, habitat, and water maintenance and retention link those two issues.\nSixthly, there is huge confusion about responsibilities. Nationally, the responsibility sits with the Environment Agency, and I think its budget is just over £2 billion a year. However, try ringing the Environment Agency about a problem in Norfolk—or, I dare say, in Suffolk; it is lovely to see the hon. Member for Lowestoft (Jess Asato) sneaking into a Norfolk debate to support us. I am talking about organisational responsibility at the top, in an agency that has many other responsibilities, some of which directly go against the interests of getting water off the land and down rivers fast. I am also talking about the situation on the ground. Responsibility for dealing with, mitigating and handling flooding is unfunded, so the local flood authority really has no budget in Norfolk. It has a few powers, which it cannot enforce, and no budget to do it properly.\nSeventhly, the real heroes of flood management in this country are the internal drainage boards, who—as you will know, Sir Christopher—have been successfully doing proper local watercourse management since about the 15th century. They have seen their powers reduced and their funding removed. As is so often the way in modern Governments, powers go upstream, to higher and higher levels, with less and less real, practical support on the ground. Those 15 or 16 areas—district councils that are most on the frontline of flooding—are now having massively to support internal drainage board infrastructure investments. We are charging taxpayers hugely in the high flood areas to pay for infrastructure that we are all funding. An Association of District Councils special interest group has been set up to tackle that, and it is helping me with my Bill.\nEighthly, the IDBs are funded by precepts, which is not appropriate for the scale of infrastructure that we need today. Ninthly, there is a huge lack of proper monitoring: one of the things that we will find at the first Norfolk flood summit is that we do not have a map—or certainly no live digital map. Where are the flood hotspots in our county? We are not properly capturing the data, which means that the Minister will not have proper data to support her policy making and the Cabinet Office resilience unit does not have proper data on where that growing inland flood risk is.\nThere is then flooding on the ground, as we had last year; I will cite one example, at Mill lane in Attleborough. Four people who live next to a culvert have been flooded every year for the past 10 years, and their lives are misery. Last year, for the first time, 100 other houses were flooded because the culvert has been allowed to silt up gradually. Anglian Water handed over its riparian rights when no one was looking about 12 or 15 years ago, and no one was aware that those rights now sat locally in the town. The land-use practice upstream meant that the water was not being captured properly on the farm, and with a whole lot of new housing and climate change, there was then a big problem. It has taken a huge amount of work to set up the local Mill lane flood prevention group, and the community has cleaned out the ditches and dredged the river, with 70 tonnes of stuff taken out. It has been a huge project, for which I pay tribute to the local councillor, Taila Taylor, and others.\nWe cannot afford to do that in every single place around the country; far better to invest in prevention in the first place. Of course, people who have suffered flooding then hit the next problems: how do they insure their houses? How will we compensate people who cannot sell their houses? How will we ensure that, as others have said, the Flood Re scheme is fit for purpose? This is a huge issue and I know the Minister has gripped it. My Bill sets out four main clauses and four main reforms—I believe I have sent the Minister an early draft, but I will send her a better one. I thank all those colleagues who are helping with it.\nClause 1 sets out responsibilities and makes clear that we need to cascade them down to the ground, as well as making it clearer who is actually responsible for prevention and mitigation. Clause 2 looks at funding and says that some of that £2 billion-odd with the Environment Agency has to cascade down, and we have to support the IDBs and the local flood authorities properly. Controversially, clause 3 looks at liabilities. I want to suggest that, when house builders dump large quantities of housing on the outskirts of villages, it is not good enough just to pipe the drains into the old Victorian architecture. They have to upgrade it, and I think the only way they will do so is if they are on the hook for any downstream flooding that might occur. Clause 4 looks at data monitoring and accountability.\nI close by sincerely welcoming the Minister’s very quickly committing to reviewing this issue properly. As well as listening to her officials, who I know will have 101 reasons to take it gently and to be cautious and steady, I urge the Minister to listen to colleagues across this House. I think she will be a hero—there will be culverts named after her for decades to come. I hesitate to suggest this, but it will be one of the biggest issues of this Parliament for our constituents, and the Minister has the chance to grip it right at the beginning and put right something that has been neglected for several decades.",

Friend on securing this debate, which is well attended for a Thursday. He knows my family’s interest— I am about the only one who is not involved in racing; my father was a national hunt jockey. Does he agree that from the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby down to the small trainers, small tracks, point-to-points—Fakenham is just outside my constituency—the rural economy and pony clubs, there is an equine economy right across this country, but it relies on money trickling down from the top? Does he further agree that racing’s finances are not just unhealthy, but in crisis? The problem goes across a lot of Labour constituencies as well, so I support him in asking the Government—we will hear from the Minister—for a strong steer to prevent the further decline of racing’s finances.\nNick Timothy (West Suffolk) (Con)\nI agree emphatically with my hon. Friend. I do not think this is a party political matter at all. We are all in this room regardless of our party badges because we know the importance of horseracing to our constituents and to our local economies and the country. A lot of the beneficiaries of the British horseracing industry reside in rural and semi-rural areas and regional towns. We spend a lot of time talking in this House about how we are going to improve the regional economy and racing is a really important part of that economy. To return to my point, we do not have time to go backwards.\nGeorge Freeman\nMy hon. Friend is making a powerful and important point. Does he agree that if we do not support the UK racing industry, including supporting prize money, we will not only drive the betting revenues away but see more and more money going into other racing? Last year’s Hennessy, a big race in the autumn which I watch, had four runners, and on television all the racing that was being shown was from Ireland, where their horses had 20 entries. If we are not careful, we will end up killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Does he agree?\nJack Rankin (Windsor) (Con)\nMy hon. Friend is quite correct to say that. I am a big cricket fan and effectively we have seen what big money overseas can do to the heart of a sport that originated in this country and gives us a lot of power, and we must be really careful about what we do. Obviously, we should also acknowledge that if people are pushed to the black market, there will be even fewer barriers to entry there, which might have a bad effect on problem gambling overall.",

While AI has the potential to enhance creativity and streamline production processes, the lack of sufficient legislative safeguards could cause significant harm to the very fabric of the UK’s hugely valuable creative industries.\nIn 2022, as the minister for AI in the then Department for Business and the Intellectual Property Office, I was lobbied by the AI industry and urged to wave through text and data mining freedoms for the sector. I refused.\nI and my fellow minister for AI in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport felt that the AI industry wasn’t taking the concerns of our creative arts sector seriously enough. My message was that it needed to provide a set of self-regulatory protections, guarantees and fair reimbursement mechanisms to reassure the creative industries.\nBritain is home to a vibrant creative economy, contributing over £130 billion annually to GDP, employing millions and delivering vast soft power. From music and film to literature and the visual arts, these industries thrive on originality and the unique perspectives of human creators.\nHowever, as AI technologies become more integrated into the creative process, we need to protect against the potential for misuse, intellectual property infringement and the dilution of human creativity. Without a clear regulatory framework we risk creating a legal grey area that could undermine the rights of human creators and undermine the UK as a creative industry powerhouse.\nInnovative regulatory leadership in new sectors such as AI has the potential to be a huge commercial opportunity for the UK. We are globally respected as a leader in setting standards, fair regulation and the settlement of disputes through our legal services sector. Being a global hub of AI regulation could be a bigger business than hosting AI companies themselves.\nMinisters need to be clear-eyed in identifying the biggest long-term gains for UK plc. Giving AI companies carte blanche is the wrong approach. We should instead be leading the way in insisting on a framework for AI that is fair to our creative industries and embeds the UK as a hub in smart regulation and AI laws.\nWe do not have to choose between AI and the creative industries. We need both. And we can show the world how to do it. With smart, thoughtful and fair regulatory leadership from ministers, this is achievable, and would be a big win for the UK. It’s an opportunity to seize.",
  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_attleborough-flooding-update-3/content_408.html": "With Storm Babet still fresh in the memories of the 100+ Attleborough households and businesses flooded back in October, I am very aware of the ongoing pressure and stress heavy rainfall is putting upon many of my constituents in the town.\nThat’s why, since the multi-agency meeting I convened last month to strengthen coordination between stakeholders at all levels, I have continued to take a close interest with local councillors.\nI recently joined a stakeholder conversation to discuss the Mill Lane culvert and receive an update on progress, and can confirm that:\n- The design for the new Mill Lane culvert trash screen has now been approved and costed – with Norfolk County Council, Breckland Council and Anglian Water all reaffirming their commitment to share those costs and proceed as quickly as possible.\n(As highlighted previously however, the new trash screen may not be in place for several months – with the screen itself taking up to a month to construct and then stakeholders having to wait until the water level has dropped sufficiently and the watercourse can be dewatered for the construction of the screen’s concrete base).\n- NCC have had the culverts at Mill Lane and Briar Gardens inspected again. Deposits of gravel and silt have been found in parts and NCC are pressing ahead with arrangements to have these cleared – with the necessary contractors set to carry out works in early March.\nIn addition to this, I can share news that:\n- I continue to support NCC’s Flood and Water Management team and local councillors as they engage with landowners upstream to explore potential flood prevention and mitigation measures on their land.\n- NCC sent riparian ownership reminder letters to landowners and homeowners along the problem watercourse in mid-January to remind them of their riparian responsibilities and make clear what they must not throw into the stream.\n- NCC are working with the Internal Drainage Board to lobby Network Rail to inspect and, if necessary, clear the culvert they are responsible for downstream under the A11.\n- Stakeholders continue to look at what more can be done to protect the most at risk properties this winter.\nOnce again, I’ve reiterated the importance of looking at the longer term issue of responsibility and maintenance of the culverts and watercourses – and I will be involved in the next Mill Lane culvert stakeholder meeting next week as these vital conversations continue.\nI am also arranging the next wider multi-agency meeting on the Attleborough flooding too.\nRest assured, I will continue to work with local councillors and residents to hold the key stakeholders to account on this to drive forward the solutions Attleborough needs to see.\nTo learn more on the Attleborough Flooding campaign to date, please scroll down and read the updates below.\nTo learn more about my wider ‘Flooding and the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership’ campaign, please click the link here.\nUPDATE 17 January 2024\nStorm Babet flooded over 100 homes in Attleborough back in October and local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been affected) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership and Flooding Campaign work, I continue to take an active role in supporting those affected and holding the key stakeholders to account – both here in Mid Norfolk, but also in Westminster.\nWhile a number of short and medium term measures have already been carried out or are underway (see here), the incredibly high water levels at the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse at the start of the new year, and the serious risk residents are having to take in order to protect their homes, shows more must be done.\nLast week, I convened a multi-agency meeting with representatives from Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council, the local Internal Drainage Board, Anglian Water, Natural England, the Environment Agency – as well as local Town, Parish, District and County Councillors and representatives of local landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse – to emphasise again the importance of tackling these serious issues and explore in greater depth the short, medium and long term work required to significantly reduce future flood risk.\nI drew particular attention to those homeowners most at risk of flooding on Mill Lane – many of whom feel helpless and desperate, believing they have no choice but to seriously risk their own safety to try and keep the trash screen across the Mill Lane culvert clear each time it rains.\nThe key discussion points from the meeting were:\n- A shared acknowledgement that residents are seriously risking their own safety to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear of debris – and of the fact that conditions and circumstances at the culvert can change rapidly during periods of heavy rain.\n- Agreement that the existing Mill Lane culvert trash screen should not be removed until the new replacement has been installed (work currently underway – see here) – as the culvert has a 90 degree bend that, were it to become blocked, would be extremely difficult and costly to clear – and significantly worsen the current flood risk to the area.\n- NCC Flood and Water Management officials met with Anglian Water contractors on-site (the day prior the meeting) to verify the new trash screen designs ahead of pricing the work – with a multi-agency agreement already in place to fund it.\n- The installation of the new trash screen will likely not be possible prior to the summer. This is because the watercourse will need to be de-watered so that a new concrete base can be constructed and the trash screen fitted.\n- Further measures are therefore required in the short term to try and reduce flood risk along the watercourse and at the Mill Lane culvert.\n- NCC are going to work with local landowners and other stakeholders to explore installing an additional, temporary screen somewhere upstream that can catch debris and prevent it becoming a problem in Attleborough itself.\n- The Mill Lane culvert, and others along the watercourse, cannot be expanded – nor the watercourse itself deepened or widened – due to the amount of development and road access around and across it. The enormous cost and disruption, and lack of space, make it impossible.\n- Given concerns over residents and local councillors risking their safety by entering the watercourse to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear, a suggestion was made to appoint a jointly funded contractor to be on 24/7 call out to clear debris and blockages at the culvert trash screen when required. This suggestion was dismissed on the basis that no organisation would allow their staff to entering the water in storm flow conditions (when they would be most needed) – especially if Norfolk Fire and Rescue themselves have said the risk would be too great for even their own teams.\n- A suggestion was made to explore how the watercourse may, long term, be diverted to another course away from the town. Flooding Officers explained this would probably not be possible given local topography.\n- It is therefore not possible to immediately remove all flood risk. Instead, agencies must work with the properties most at risk to do as much as possible to improve their flood resilience.\n- NCC have also submitted a bid to the Natural Flood Management Fund, supported by myself and others, and I am working with them and local landowners upstream to explore how we might deliver a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme that could drastically reduce the long term flood risk to homeowners and businesses in Attleborough (see more here)\n- Everyone affected in the area by flooding in October must formally report their cases via the Norfolk County Council website to enable the Flood Investigations underway to be as accurate as possible – which in turn will strengthen the hand of local stakeholders to lobby for additional funding and support.\n- NCC are to look at monitoring water volumes and storm flows on the watercourse – again to strengthen their hand when lobbying for resources.\n- Local councillors asked what more could be done to improve safety for those homeowners currently taking risks to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear. It was asked if lighting and cameras could be installed.\n- I reiterated my ongoing support for all the efforts to tackle these flooding issues – and highlighted my efforts in Westminster to bring about the national reform needed also (see more here)\nAs is clear, this isn’t an easy fix – with multiple challenges faced. However, I am determined to all I can to support the community.\nThe key focusses/timescales moving forward are:\nShort Term (Now-next few weeks)\n- Doing as much as possible to improve the flood resilience of the most at risk properties\n- Explore what more can be done to improve safety for those putting themselves at risk to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear\n- Find a suitable location for an additional, temporary screen upstream to collect debris – and explore additional short term measures upstream that can reduce flood risk\nMedium Term (Summer)\n- Replacement of the existing trash screen with a new one that is designed specifically for the challenges being faced.\n- Continue to explore what measures can be introduced to reduce flood risk.\nLonger Term\n- Deliver a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme upstream that can significantly reduce flood risk\n- Deliver legislative changes and reform in the House to better empower local communities so that they can protect themselves from flooding, while also holding developers to account when new housing exacerbates local problems.\nRest assured, I will keep working tirelessly on this issue.\nTo stay up to date, please visit my flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 4 December 2023\nOver 100 homes in Attleborough were flooded in Storm Babet at the end of October.\nWe cannot allow this to happen again. Local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why earlier today, as part of my ongoing campaign (and having recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership that I established back in early 2021 – see here), I met with Norfolk County Council’s Flood and Water Management team, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance and representatives for some of the landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse.\nIt’s clear that that we need a proper long term strategic plan that addresses problem watercourse pinch points AND looks to better control the flow of water downstream during heavy rainfall events. While some positive progress is already being made at the Mill Lane culvert itself (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), today’s call focused on what can be done further upstream – and I am committed to actively supporting NCC/the NSFA and partners as they work with landowners and other agencies to explore what flood mitigation and water storage scheme measures might work best for Attleborough.\nTo see all of my recent work supporting Attleborough residents, please click here or see below.\nFor full details on all of my flooding campaign work, please visit my website here.\nUDPATE 29 November 2023\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted by recent flooding.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing campaign, I visited Mill Lane with Cllrs Samantha and Taila Taylor this past Friday to see the problem culvert/watercourse first hand and meet with some of the worst affected residents.\nPlease see my video above.\nLocal residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious – and I continue to hold the key stakeholders to account to ensure everything that can be done is indeed being done to provide affected residents with the support they need, as well as to put in place a short, medium and long term plan that looks to try and prevent future such flooding again in future.\nSome positive progress is already being made (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), but there still remains much more to do.\nThat’s why, as highlighted in my recent update here, I recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership to give our communities the strongest possible voice on these issues. Attleborough had strong representation on that call and I am determined to do everything I can, alongside local councillors, to ensure residents like those on Mill Lane and surrounding streets are heard.\nI will be involved in more meetings in the coming days and am also writing to ministers and officials in Westminster to re-emphasise again the need to put greater emphasis on flooding and drainage matters in the planning process – including putting increased responsibility on developers who’s developments subsequently flood and/or impact the existing community.\nTo stay up to date with all my work on these issues, please visit my Flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 3 November 2023\nFurther to my webstory update last week (see here), I can now provide more information on the work being done by multiple parties to address the terrible flooding that has recently affected many households and businesses in Attleborough.\nOn Monday, the Town Council and local district and county councillors held a public meeting in the town for local residents to speak with key stakeholders. The event was well attended and I am pleased to report that stakeholders have been following up on a number of the points and concerns raised – with additional site visits undertaken to the culvert and watercourse on Mill Lane (as well as the culvert in Briar Gardens). Meetings with developers to assess drainage on their building sites have also taken place and I am aware that a series of additional measures, along with further clearing of drains and ditches, are already being implemented – with anecdotal reports of additional blockages being addressed. I will continue to monitor progress closely.\nFurther to the emergency meeting I held last week (see here), an urgent meeting took place on Tuesday between Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council and Anglian Water to discuss in greater depth the specific issues that caused flooding at the Mill Lane culvert and connected watercourse.\nAs many are aware, the culvert and watercourse were divested to riparian ownership many years ago. While that question of who will take on the long term ownership remains (and rest assured that I continue to push very hard on that and have challenged all stakeholders to work collaboratively to develop a proper strategic plan and solution for the issue), I welcome the collective recognition that something needs to be done as soon as possible, with agreement that the inadequate and unsafe trash screen that caused many of the recent problemsneeds to be replaced.\nOn a without prejudice basis (of who will assume long term responsibility for the culvert and watercourse) and as a gesture of goodwill, Anglian Water have agreed to have their contractors assess the trash screen and culvert and work up the design for a much safer, more effective replacement. All stakeholders will then jointly fund the improved screen and Anglian Water will install it.\nIn the meantime (and again on a without prejudice basis and as a gesture of goodwill), Anglian Water will endeavour to send staff every couple of weeks to keep the existing trash screen clear. (Breckland, NCC and Anglian Water are also discussing a longer term plan for removing any debris collected from the culvert and watercourse)\nI would like to reiterate however that I will keep on the critical question of who will assume the long term responsibility and ownership of the culvert and watercourse – and am already liaising with the key stakeholders on the date for a follow-up meeting to discuss that matter further.\nNCC have also confirmed that the gulleys around Mill Lane have been cleared (with additional review taking place of gulleys on surrounding streets) and I understand that an assessment is taking place as to whether the trash screen at the Briar Gardens culvert should be removed.\nA full flood investigation is now being led by NCC in line with their statutory processes. Although their Flood and Water Management team had already been working on proposals to better mitigate flooding in this area (as a result of the December 23rd-24th 2020 flooding event), there is recognition that their Flood Plan for the area, and its associated work, now needs accelerating and upscaling. I have committed to supporting NCC as they seek to secure the additional funding required to implement any recommended measures, as well as to engage with key local landowners.\nI am also in the process of reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I previously established – and will ensure Attleborough is represented in those vital conversations.\nRest assured, I am determined to do everything I can to speak up for those affected in Attleborough, as well as those across Mid Norfolk.\nUPDATE 25 October 2023\nStorm Babet has reminded us again why we must continue to take flooding seriously.\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted, with severe flooding on Mill Lane, Norwich Road, Ferguson Way and other nearby streets. For some, it was the fourth time they had been flooded in 30 years – and the second time in just under three years. I appreciate, and share, the immense anger and frustration felt by those that have been forced to leave their homes as a result of the damage suffered this past weekend.\nThat’s why I held an emergency meeting today with Norfolk County Council and their Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Anglian Water and Breckland District Council to get to the bottom of what is causing the flooding at the watercourse and culvert on Mill Lane, as well as ensure that those with statutory flooding responsibilities come together and develop an urgent action plan.\nWhile NCC began working on proposals to address flooding at this location in light of the December 2020 flooding, Storm Babet has brought into sharper focus the need to upscale and accelerate those proposals, and address other issues such as questions around which authority is responsible for the culvert and watercourse and therefore who should be maintaining them.\nI had made clear that there needs to be:\n- A proper plan for ensuring affected residents (and the wider community) are protected from further flooding this winter.\n- An acceleration and upscaling of efforts to put in place a long term solution.\n- A proper plan for who is going to be responsible for this culvert and watercourse in due course.\n- Agreement on who is going to keep the culvert and watercourse clear NOW – while the longer term plan is being developed and implemented.\nI am in close contact with local district councillors and a number of those worst affected by the flooding and am determined to help them work with key stakeholders to develop a solution.\nWe must see action. This must not be allowed to happen again. And residents should not be risking their own safety to try and keep this culvert clear during storms and heavy rainfall.\nMore widely, I will be reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I established as a result of the Winter 2020/21 flooding to help support those affected by Storm Babet and ensure our communities have the strongest possible voice heading into this autumn/winter.\nRest assured, I will continue to support councillors and residents in the days, weeks and months ahead.\nTo see my Flooding Update earlier this week, please click here\nTo find out more about my historic campaign work on flooding, please visit my campaign page here",

Member on securing the debate and her passionate advocacy. Many of us across the House share a deep understanding of the need for it. Does she agree that, if we are to tackle the causes, we need better data? We need to understand what is driving this epidemic. I particularly want to draw attention to the children of alcoholics and the great work done by the National Association for Children of Alcoholics; the children of divorce and conflict; and those children badly affected during the pandemic. Does the hon. Member agree that we need better data to understand the causes, then we can start to prevent it, as well as, importantly, treating it when it occurs. We could prevent a lot more of this.\nDr Rosena Allin-Khan (Tooting) (Lab)\nI thank the hon. Member for that intervention. Yes, I wholeheartedly agree that there is definitely space for more research. Adverse childhood experiences are the single biggest driver of mental ill health in children and, later on, in adults. I will touch on that later.\nGeorge Freeman\nThe hon. Lady is making a powerful case, and I am keen to hear as much of it as I can. To the point I was trying to make earlier, extreme poverty is one cause of childhood trauma, but there are many others. Like many people in this House—I put my own hand up—I experienced childhood trauma, but I was in a materially privileged family. Poverty can provide a lot of those drivers that the hon. Lady has talked about, but I was taken out of the arms of my father by the police at 11 months, and I was a child carer of an alcoholic parent. Poverty has a part to play, but does the hon. Lady agree that we need to make sure we frame this in the context of the real causes, some of which are not related to poverty but to other chronic problems, such as alcohol, addiction or domestic violence? If we view the matter simply through the prism of a poverty attack, we are in danger of missing out some of the causes that are really embedded in repeated patterns of trauma within families.\nWera Hobhouse (Bath) (LD)\nFirst of all, it is brave that the hon. Gentleman is sharing his experiences of trauma. I think we need more people to do that. He is also absolutely right that not all of this is directly linked to poverty. Poverty or extreme poverty is one ACE among many others, and these things can happen in any family. Those who are doing research into ACEs would always recognise that trauma is not just suffered in a particular type of household but across socioeconomic backgrounds. The hon. Gentleman will know how difficult it is to overcome the traumas of early childhood and deal with them.",

Then, when the new Secretary of State entered his post in the autumn, I wrote again to share that letter and emphasise the scale of local frustrations on this matter.\nI was delighted therefore to receive a response earlier this week from the new dental minister outlining some of the work the Department of Health and Social Care are doing to bring about improvements.\nIn September, the Government published its Our Plan for Patients, which sets out the steps being taken to incentivise dentists to do more NHS work (not just private), as well as to take on some of the more difficult cases. Since then, the Government has been working at pace to implement that Plan and, on 25th November, it has introduced legislation to amend the NHS dental contract, again to better incentivise dentists to deliver care to high-need patients through fairer remuneration and improve the NHS dental sector’s resilience – for example, by allowing greater flexibility around commission so that NHS dentists can provide extra are where they are able to.\nHaving included much of this in my previous letters, I’m delighted to see the Government are listening.\nI also welcome news that DHSC is working with Health Education England, and others, to ensure that the Government has the necessary data to better support future workforce planning and address shortages of dental professionals in some areas and clinical specialities, through local sustainability and transformation partnerships and integrated care systems. Having added my voice to calls for a new dental school here in Norfolk so as to better provide our region with the skilled dentists it needs, this news from the Government is a positive first step.\nHowever, more can still be done and, while I am delighted that the Government is indeed listening and taking this seriously, I remain committed to doing all I can for Mid Norfolk by raising this issue both with the local NHS and in Westminster.\nTo learn more about my campaign, please visit my website here.",

He especially welcomes measures to support innovation-led growth which drives up productivity, creates new industries and drives global inward investment.\nGeorge Freeman (Mid Norfolk) (Con)\nIt is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Gerald Jones), not least to inject a little context into this afternoon’s debate. The truth is that this country is reeling, but it is not reeling from 14 years of Tory cuts. It is reeling from the most extraordinary period of economic shocks that this country has ever seen.\nI remind Opposition Members that the City crash in 2007-08 cost us £875 billion in quantitative easing under the then right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. Brexit cost us £70 billion in QE, the pandemic cost us £400 billion and the support that the Government put in place to help hard-pressed families with the energy crisis following the war in Ukraine cost £40 billion. This country has been through a perfect storm of unprecedented, once in 400-year or 500-year events with which we are all struggling.\nI welcome this Budget. I will say something about the cost of living relief for rural areas such as Mid Norfolk, and something about growth and how we can get this country out of the huge risk of stagflation arising from the sequence of events that I have just described. In a global race for science and technology investment, we have to move faster and be bolder to unlock that investment.\nThe pandemic and the Ukraine war have been unprecedented shocks, particularly to the rural economy. Unbelievable cost of living inflation has hit rural areas particularly hard. How much harder? The Treasury calculates that the differential cost impact is about 150% harder in rural areas because of higher transport costs; higher heating costs; higher dependence on agriculture, food processing and high-energy industries; lower incomes; marginality and rurality; a very high proportion of retired pensioners on fixed incomes; and rural councils that have been structurally underfunded for decades by a Whitehall that does not understand rural areas. We put up with it for years during an era of cheap energy, but high energy costs have hit our public services, our charities, our businesses and our households hard.\nI am very grateful for the support that the Chancellor has provided, but I will continue to make the case that rural areas deserve more support and more targeted support for a very particular set of rural problems. In this Budget, I welcome the fuel duty freeze, the household support fund, the cost of childcare relief, the child benefit measures, the alcohol duty freeze, the national insurance cut worth £800 for the average worker—including the self-employed—the SME recovery loan scheme, the SME VAT threshold move and the pension triple lock being fixed at 8.6%, which is four times the forecast rate of inflation. This is a Chancellor doing everything he possibly can to help the most vulnerable and the most deserving in our society.\nIn Norfolk, I particularly welcome the investment in new special free schools for children with special educational needs and disabilities—that cause is close to my heart—the accelerated east-west rail delivery that is crucial to unlocking our region’s potential, and the 10 sports facilities in rural Mid Norfolk. There was good news in a very tough Budget.\nMost of all, I welcome the Chancellor’s measures to support growth in the innovation economy, including the £2.5 billion for the NHS, in addition to the £3.4 billion productivity plan, that will unlock an extra £30 billion according to the NHS. There is funding for the Faraday discovery fellowships; this country’s low Earth orbit leadership; the expert advisory group on R&D tax relief; the £100 million for the Alan Turing Institute; the £45 million for our life science research charities; the £5 million for the agrifood launchpad; and the £10 million for the Cambridge cluster. That is investment in the long-term growth of tomorrow, on which we all depend in order to get out of this extraordinary 15-year triple whammy of crises that this country has gone through.\nOpposition Members do not seem to understand that we cannot tax our way to prosperity and we cannot spend our way to it. [Interruption.] I know they do not want to hear it, but it is the truth. For prosperity, we need to do two big things, the first of which is reform our public sector to tackle the productivity crisis properly. I am proud to say that this Government, in the 14 years I have been here, have increased health spending by a third, but we cannot see that outcome on the ground. That is because the healthcare system is structurally geared—it is not any one party’s fault—in a way that says, “If you deliver more for less, we give you less from the Treasury.” We punish innovation and we reward inefficiency, and that has to change. I welcome quite a lot that the shadow Health Secretary has said about reforming it.\nThe real key, however, is growth. As I have consistently argued for 14 years, we have to do more to support innovation-led growth, as that is the only form of growth that drives up productivity, creates new industries and drives global inward investment. With stubborn debt and the risk from all of the shocks that I have outlined still with us, that is more urgent than ever. We will never get out of this crisis by short-term house price booms, short-term consumer booms and booms in the City. We have to do it by attracting private sector investment into the high-growth sectors of life science, agritech, bioengineering, clean tech, fusion energy, semiconductors, robotics, tidal energy, satellite manufacturing and quantum computing. We are a powerhouse in science and research, but we are not yet a powerhouse in attracting the global billions into those sectors and turning them into solutions around the world. That innovation is the key, both to private sector recovery and, of course, to public sector reform, particularly in health, which is the biggest public service driving the structural deficit. We need to introduce a much faster wave of innovation in artificial intelligence and all sorts of digital health, with earlier prevention and better diagnosis. In that way, we can reduce the appalling problem of pouring money in and getting less out on the ground.",

Not only has it been trained to respond to terror attacks, it has also been trained to provide specialist assistance to local emergency services in the event of chemical leaks, flooding, water rescues, traffic accidents, coastal erosion, building collapses, body recovery and more.\nOver the years, the Dereham team has become a highly respected and effective local asset, and it is for that reason that I shared local shock at the news that it may be one of five urban search and rescue team cut in the not too distant future.\nThat’s why I have written to ministers to highlight the strategic importance and value of the Dereham team, asking for clarification about any decisions that may have been made and asking that they look again to ensure everything that can be done to safeguard this service is done.\nThe loss of this service in Dereham would significantly increase the response times of such specialist support and, at a time when Norfolk’s “risk” is increasing (for example, through the addition and expansion of key infrastructure locations like Bacton, Necton, Dunstone and Walpole), I agree with local councillors that we should be doing all we can to ensure our local emergency services have the best possible support in the event of a critical incident.\nRest assured, I will continue to work with local authorities to do all I can to help protect the long term future of our Dereham team.",

The reality is far more complex though.\nMany of our most vulnerable, fellow citizens also rely on the social care system – those with disabilities, acute learning difficulties and a range of conditions that make living at home in a normal environment highly challenging or even impossible. Many others are not in residential care at all, instead living and being supported in their own homes or the homes of their families.\nIn largely rural areas like our own, too many of these people, along with their families, have had to suffer in often invisible silence – struggling against or falling through the system, unable to get the level of support they need and deserve.\nThroughout my time as the MP for Mid Norfolk, I have always been clear that I believe how we take care of some of our most vulnerable people is a measure of us as a society. I firmly believe that a fair, just and civilised society means those with the privilege of able bodied freedom and responsibility do their bit to help those who don’t.\nThat’s why I have worked so hard to speak up for social care in our county – and why I remain so committed to continuing that work as we move forward.\nFor too long, our care sector has been the poor relation to the NHS in funding and recognition. This is grossly unfair and a source of huge problems in our local healthcare system, letting down many vulnerable people and costing us, as a county and country, far more money that it should. We should be getting it right and reinvesting more of the savings into delivering even better care.\nThat’s why I have always been a strong advocate for properly integrating Health and Social Care (see my campaign page here) – especially here in Norfolk. While we have seen our five CCGs merged into one, we still have multiple hospital trusts, as well as separate ambulance, mental health and community care trusts, in addition to an ICS! We need less costly administrative bureaucracy and more investment into an integrated local system, led by dedicated local leaders with the vision and local knowledge required to get things right.\nI also believe that we need to ensure the funding models are correct so that the needs of patients and care recipients, and the heroic care workers that do so much to support them (whether they be working in residential homes, family carers or those working out in the community), come before the administrative convenience of Whitehall officials.\nRest assured, I will continue to speak up on behalf of social care here in the East.\nTo stay up to date with all of my work on this crucial issue, please do regularly check my campaign page here.\nI welcomed the chance to join a call this afternoon with Andrew Proctor (Leader of Norfolk County Council), NCC officials and Chloe Smith MP (the new Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work) to hear how HMG is delivering the National Disability Strategy.",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_science-minister-speech-keio-university-japan/content_403.html": "UK Minister for Science, Research and Innovation, George Freeman, spoke at a Times Higher Education Live! event in Tokyo on 13 December 2022.\nThank you, Ambassador, for that kind introduction.\nGood morning, everyone.\nIt is a pleasure to be here today, representing the United Kingdom in Japan as Minister for Science, Research, Technology and Innovation.\nThank you to the Times Higher Education for inviting me here to speak and to Keio University for so kindly hosting us.\nIt’s a particular personal pleasure for me to be here on behalf of UK with our longstanding global ally Japan in one of the great R+D Powerhouse nations in this great university (especially given the leading role which this university has played in the human genome project, one of the world’s greatest science success stories) at this event with so many distinguished leaders to make some important announcements about UK global science and diplomacy and our Science Superpower mission.\nBut it’s also a particular pleasure having had a 15-year career in the UK bioscience venture capital sector before coming to Parliament.\nIn the UK we have a longstanding joke that if you come to Parliament with any particular expertise the Whips will ensure you end up doing something unrelated!\nI seem to be the exception that proves the rule!\nElected after a 15-year career in science, research, technology and innovation founding, financing and managing technology start-up companies, I’ve somehow managed to spend 12 years in Parliament on this agenda.\nAs the first UK Minister for Life Science (launching our ground-breaking 100k Genomics program and Accelerated Access Reforms).\nAs the first Minister for Agri-tech launching our Agri-tech Industrial Strategy.\nAs the first UK Minister for the Future of Transport and Transport Tech.\nNow as UK Minister for Science, Research, Technology and Innovation.\nBut in each role and all the time persuading Prime Ministers through the tumultuous last decade that science, research, technology and innovation is key to both UK economic prosperity, global sustainability and security.\nSecurity?\nYes. I want to suggest that science is as key to long term global and national security as our military hardware.\nBecause in a world where lack of food, energy and water represent such massive global challenges - and geopolitical tensions - our security is increasingly shaped as much by our ability to prevent and cure disease, feed 9 billion mouths, prevent the famine and poverty driving the mass population dislocation in Africa, help lessen our dependence on Russia and China for energy and strengthen global commitment to our values as by our military might.\n—\nBut, of course, soft and hard security and soft and hard power go together.\nAs we have seen in Ukraine with the appalling attack by a brutal Kremlin war machine determined to flex its muscles, divide the world and test the resolve of the “West”.\nIt’s a test for all of us and one that our 2 nations have made very clear we will stand up to and pass - with our recent announcement of the new UK Japan Italy next generation fighter technology project.\nBut I’m here today to focus on the other: the soft power and security that comes from science and technology leadership.\nUK mission\nThe UK has taken the opportunity of the last decade (the Crash, Austerity, Brexit, Pandemic and War) to reset out global economic and geopolitical vision, mission and strategy.\nOur recent Integrated Review sets out a clear analysis of the UK’s place in an increasingly dangerous world.\nAt its heart is a strategic commitment to science, research, technology and innovation.\nIt’s reflected in a series of important policy reforms:\nFirst, our strategic commitment to significantly increase the level and role of science, research, technology and innovation in our economy for improved economic growth, productivity, international competitiveness, inward investment, technological sovereignty, industrial resilience, global security and geopolitical soft power.\nSecond, the establishment alongside the National Security Council of the National Science and Technology Council, (NSTC) chaired by the Prime Minister, with the top half of Cabinet, myself as Science Minister and our National Science and Technology Adviser my good friend Patrick Vallance, to whom I’d like to pay tribute and put on record my personal thanks for all he has done for UK Science and Technology in his years as UK Chief Science and Technology Adviser as he comes to the end of his term this spring.\nThird, our 30% increase in public R+D over 3 years announced by the Prime Minister when Chancellor twelve months ago and now protected by Chancellor Hunt last month in a necessarily difficult budget.\nAlongside our 30% increase between 2022 and 2027 - to be matched by private sector, pension reforms in the City of London to boost scale-up finance and use of post-Brexit freedoms in Procurement and Regulation to support the UK Technology sector.\nAs Minister for Science, Research, Technology and Innovation I’m responsible for 75% of the UK budget. That’s £11 billion per annum and £40 billion over CSR.\nBut I’ve set up an Inter-Ministerial Group of the other key Ministers across other Delts with big R+D budgets.\nI’ve framed the Mission in 2 parts.\nScience Superpower\nOur Science Superpower mission isn’t about a militarisation or aggressive sovereignty in science - it’s about delivering 6 key objectives:\nOne: world class science in an increasingly competitive world\nTwo: Global Impact for global good\nThree: attracting much more global R+D inward investment\nFour: recognising science demands global career and talent paths\nFive: insisting on the values of scientia: free speech, critical thinking, challenge.\nSix: harnessing demonstrable UK commitment to these for geopolitical soft power.\nThis means reforming our research funding and career ecosystem to ensure we continue to punch above our weight in world class research.\nDeepening our collaborations with R+D powerhouses, like Japan.\nImproving the global impact of and inward investment into UK R+D.\nWidening global talent pathways and international research collaboration.\nAnd maximising UK science, technology and innovation leadership for global geopolitical soft power influence in tackling the big challenges facing our planet.\nInnovation Nation\nTo be a Science Superpower (as opposed to an academic powerhouse) you have to also be an Innovation Economy linking our R to D: Research AND Development.\nBetter connecting our science base to the City, using our post-Brexit Regulatory and Procurement freedoms to help make the UK a global test-bed and scale-up hub for innovation.\nWidening the regional R+D footprint by nurturing the clusters of innovation around our whole country using our global leverage to help technology transfer and inward Investment in R+D.\nThis means improving the depth and breadth of the innovation economy across the UK through supporting the regional clusters of STI excellence around the UK.\nIncreasing investment in the Catapult network and improving successful commercialisation of UK innovation through better industry partnerships and spin/out and scale-up financing and more strategic use of HMG levers through regulation, procurement and global technology transfer.\nFundamentally this is about Britain’s role in the world.\nThe urgency of post-pandemic economic recovery and the growing geopolitical importance of strategic UK science, research, technology and innovation leadership in an increasingly competitive, and in places hostile, global landscape make these missions increasingly central to the UK’s role in the world.\nIn all the defining global grand challenges, science is playing an increasingly pivotal role in Food, Medicine, Energy, Global warming, Net Zero and Cleantech, Oceans, Space, Quantum and Compound semiconductors.\nThe pace of technology is driving the new dawn of a new era in global development.\nThe prize is huge.\nFood security through Agri-tech (that means doubling world food production on the same land area with half as much energy and water by 2050).\nEnergy security through new energy technologies. Climate security through Cleantech. Biosecurity and public health through Life science and med-tech. Clean oceans. Safe space. Secure data, research and IP.\nWe are the generation who have to deliver.\nFor our children and their children.\nBut it will require all who share the same commitment to science for global good to stand for it.\nIn a world in which the global race for science, research, technology and innovation is increasingly dominated by China (£240 billion pa), the USA (£180 billion pa + defense = £300 billion pa).\nThe rest us are going to have to work increasingly closely together.\nThe EU programs impasse\nThe European Union has rightly spotted this as an opportunity and makes much of its destiny as the “3rd global bloc”.\nIn our Brexit negotiations we carefully negotiated to stay in the EU research programs: Horizon, Euratom and Copernicus.\nSadly, the EU has decided to punish the UK for Brexit by weaponizing science for political pressure.\nAssociation to Horizon Europe remains the UK’s aim and we are continuing to push actively for Association with Science Ministers across Europe - most recently in Paris last week (where you will have seen we made a £1.75bn commitment to a range of missions and programs key to UK Space science and industry).\nBut whilst we push for Association, I am clear that we cannot allow UK researchers to be “benched” indefinitely while we wait.\nIf we cannot play in the European Cup of science, we must play in the World Cup of science.\nSo we have made clear that we will provide the interim and “in-flight” funding guarantee to honour the commitment at CSR21 that the money earmarked for Horizon would be invested in UK and international research if and while association continues to be blocked.\nBut we simply cannot allow the Horizon block to hold back UK research any longer. Our priority is to invest in the UK’s R&D sector, if necessary through alternative programmes.\nThat’s why the Chancellor announced the £480 million research support package of additional research spending that is targeted at those institutions most affected by the Horizon impasse.\nThe new ISPF\nBut we plan to go further. Today I’m announcing the first part of a package of additional funding for international research through the International Science Partnership Fund (ISPF).\nThis is alongside our commitment to deploy, if necessary, the £15 billion ringfenced funds for Horizon for alternative programs to further support strong international UK research.\nAs set out in July, this package of funding is structured around 4 key pillars.\nThe Flagship Fellowships (Early, Mid and Late-Stage Career).\nThe Technologies of Tomorrow and Industrial Innovation Challenges.\nGlobal Challenge Collaborations.\nAnd world class research infrastructure.\nI want to stress that in pursuing these we are not closing the door on the Horizon negotiations. But simply honouring the commitment we made to UK researchers that we will ensure the money that we would have received through Horizon will not be lost to UK research.\nThe ISPF is designed to support research programs in themes and countries which align well with the UK’S Integrated Review.\nThat’s why, today, I am delighted to announce the launch of phase one of our International Science Partnerships Fund.\nWe will use this initial £119 million ISPF funding to support our scientists, researchers, and innovators to collaborate with colleagues around the world in tackling the great global research challenges of our time.\nNo country better fits that profile than Japan which is why I’ve come here today to announce it.\nJapan\nFew countries can match Japan when it comes to R+D.\nTotal expenditure (in 2020) on R+D £128 billion, 3.59% of GDP, 72% (£92 billion) from the private sector.\n951,000 researchers, 5th in 2021 Nature Index (UK 4th!), 13th in Global Innovation Index (UK 4th).\nWorld class universities, the second most Nobel Prizes in natural sciences including Manabe (modelling of earth’s climate) 2021, Yoshino (Lithium Ion Batteries) 2019, Honjo (Cancer) 2018, Ohsumi (autophage) 2016, Kajita (neutrinos) 2015, Omura (parasites) 2015, Amano and Akasaki (blue LED) 2014.\nNine Moonshot Programmes, £1 billion Strategic Innovation Program and WPI Centres.\nAnd the UK and Japan have a long and distinguished history of research.\nThe UK is Japan’s fourth biggest research collaborator.\nJapan is UK’s fourteenth biggest research collaborator.\nUK / Japan research quality is 3.5 times the world average. That’s higher than our average with USA, Germany or China.\nIn medicine – it’s over 6.5 times the average!\nIn 2019 UK researchers are the fourth largest group of visiting researchers\nThe UK is the second most popular destination for Japanese researchers on mid to long term placements.\nAnd we have a range of joint projects including Ai (recently agreed with my Colleague and co-chair of Council for Ai – Secretary of State Michelle Donellan). The next generation fighter platform. CoVID 19. Space Situational Awareness. Nuclear decommissioning. Regenerative medicine. And Marine sensor technology.\nIn the past two decades alone, we’ve seen the likes of Tim Peake and Yamazaki Naoko working together in the International Space Centre in the ice beneath Japanese barley sitting securely alongside British brassicas in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault…\n…and, given where we are, it would be remiss of me not to mention again the human genome project, which we’ve seen complete its sequencing of the DNA shared by each and every one of us here today.\nDNA science which was the key to discovering the Covid vaccine and stopping the coronavirus pandemic which threatened to put a stop to so much scientific collaboration, doing real damage to research, but also highlighted just how vital this collaboration is, as the foundation for a future where security and prosperity can be enjoyed by all.\nScientific collaboration between our two countries goes back centuries. Almost 160 years ago, the Choshu five arrived in London after a 135-day journey.\nEnrolling at University College London, under the mentorship of Alexander Williamson, these men embraced life in Victorian Britain and Bloomsbury’s burgeoning scientific scene.\nWhen they returned to Japan, each of these ‘five fathers’ drew on what they learnt to transform their country with technology.\nInoue Masaru used his civil engineering education to become the founding president of the Japanese Board of Railways.\nYamao Yozo established the Imperial College of Engineering, Japan’s first institute of technology.\nAnd Ito Hirobumi as the first Prime Minister of Japan, shaped the constitution of the Meiji era and remodelled the political, social, and economic life of a nation newly open to the world around it.\nFor much of the century and a half since, Japan has led the way… and the UK has benefitted.\nOn rail, the same transformative technology that powers the Shinkansen is driving forward change in Britain’s high-speed rail network.\nOn road, the lithium-ion battery brought to Japanese markets over three decades ago is now the cornerstone of our expanding electric vehicle industry.\nOn screen, Japanese calculators, cameras, and computers kick-started our digital revolution – and continue to represent the cutting edge in our tech market today.\nAnd in our ears, digital recording has changed the way generations of British citizens listen to one another, whether with turntables, Walkmans, CDs, Blue Ray or the revival of cassettes.\nIn the past century, we’ve each succeeded in large part thanks to the strength of our collaboration…\n…underpinned by our common commitment to academic freedom and a shared belief in the value of bottom up, peer-reviewed, and foundational research, supported by state-of-the-art facilities and adopted by excellent industries.\nJust take our first-class universities.\nFrom Cambridge to Kyoto, we are working together to lead top quality research in regenerative medicine, following our joint research call in 2020.\nThis year, we’re celebrating the 10th anniversary of RENKEI, a consortium of universities who are improving collaboration between our young academics.\nThe RENKEI winter school, hosted by Kyoto University, will establish a new UK-Japan network of climate change early career researchers.\nBut we both know that it’s not just about what goes on inside academia – it’s about getting research out there in the world, driving up growth and unlocking new sectors, industries, jobs, and skills.\nBoth through established industries leading and embracing innovation, and venture-backed start-ups and spin-outs.\nBecause it’s our innovative enterprises who are leading the way in quantum, in Ai, in biotechnology and in fusion.\nI am looking forward to meeting Kyoto Fusioneering later this week, an exciting spinout who are leading the development of advanced fusion reactor technologies here in Japan – technologies which could completely transform the way we generate our energy in future.\nIn the UK, we have launched our own fusion strategy, with a world-first pro-innovation regulatory framework published in summer 2022 and plans for the world’s first Industrial fusion plant via UKAEA Spherical Topomak.\nAnd – like our universities – our enterprises are joining up, too.\nJust take Amphibio and Azul Energy, who – with funding from UKRI and NEDO – are partnering to combine zero-waste, automated digital 3D knitting technology and metal-air batteries to manufacture seamless, safe, and sustainable waterproof clothing.\nNowhere is this story of collaboration stronger than in space.\nLast year UKSA and JAXA marked a milestone moment by signing a Memorandum of Cooperation.\nBut we haven’t just heard words; we’ve seen action, too.\nWhether it’s our universities and agencies getting together to tackle space junk…\n…or our businesses like Astroscale, a Japan-UK collaboration whose ELSA-d mission has done truly pioneering work to demonstrate the core technologies necessary for debris docking and removal.\nI have no doubt, then, that ISPF funding will be a game-changer for scientific collaboration between our countries.\nBut ISPF is only part of the picture for the UK and Japan.\nWe hope to announce more research calls to come.\nAnd we’ve agreed to work together on open joint research programmes…\n…to develop targeted strategic research programmes exploring our space, marine, and polar environments, providing a critical boost to our shared decarbonisation efforts…\n…and to improve our collaboration in digital and aerospace…\nHyper-K announcement\nAnd it’s not just our researchers. We’re also committed to supporting the shared infrastructure which they need to succeed.\nI’m proud today to announce that we’re investing £15.5 million for the construction of the Hyper-K neutrino project, on top of the £4.2 million we invested during the research and development phase.\nThis is a pioneering project, the likes of which the world has never seen.\nBuried under a mountain to avoid interference from cosmic rays, Hyper-K will be a ‘microscope’ to unveil the mysteries of the elusive neutrino, the most abundant (but perhaps the least understood) matter particle in the universe.\nBut it will also be a ‘telescope’ for observing the sources of these neutrinos, from the Sun and supernovas to black holes and dark matter.\nHyper-K could help us to answer the fundamental questions which remain for the Standard Model of Particle Physics, the way we understand the basic building blocks of our universe.\nAnd we know that it will support scientific research at every level, and in every participating country, including the UK, where our very own Professors Francesca Di Lodovico and Dave Wark are leading ground-breaking neutrino research.\nAnd I am delighted that we in the UK are doing our bit to get it up and running.\nNew British Council grants program called Reconnect to help boost Indo -Asia Pacific academic collaborations\nThat’s why – with the legacy of the Choshu five still with us - I am also delighted to announce a new grants programme called ‘Reconnect’, funded by the British Council, to help teams of academics across the Indo-Pacific region to join up following the disruption of the Coronavirus pandemic.\nToday, the British Council is opening a call for proposals structured around our shared priorities, across Synthetic Biology, Ocean science, Healthy ageing, Clean Energy, Advanced materials and Quantum computing.\nThis visit\nOver the next 3 days I’m honoured and delighted to be visiting and meeting some of the top people and research institutes across this R+D powerhouse economy: Keio University, Presidents and Executives of Japanese Universities, JAXA Tsukuba Space Centre, J-PARC Japan Proton Accelerator Complex, JAEA Naraha Center for Remote Control / Nuclear Robotics Technology Development, Kyoto Fusioneering, Minister Takaichi, Prof Ueyama, State Minister Nakatani, Minister Nagaoka, Prof Hashimoto and Tokyo Uni Edge Capital Partners.\nOver these 23 visits and meetings I hope we can deepen our two nations’ longstanding history of science and research collaboration, identify ways we can extend our work for mutual benefit and promote greater academic and investment collaborations and exchange.\nBut something else too. To send a clear message that global science, research, technology and innovation can’t be dominated by just China (or the USA) but requires international partnerships rooted in shared values and a shared commitment to “scientia” as a force for good in the world.\nInternational scientific collaboration demands mutual respect for some key frameworks that underpin science free speech, the rule of law, open science, respect for intellectual property, research security and integrity which I’m delighted and grateful Japan has agreed to prioritise in the G7 Science Summit in Sendai in Japan in May.\nThat just as our two great nations deepen our collaboration for military defence and security, so we will also deepen our collaboration in science, research, technology and innovation for peaceful, sustainable geopolitical development and soft power.\nBy working together in robust defence of our shared commitment to the values of democracy, peace, freedom and mutuality which underpin our shared humanity we can both make the world a safer place for our children, and our countries more prosperous and secure.",

How we treat our most vulnerable children is a sign of the health of our society\nAs a parent I’ve been lucky enough not to experience SEND in our family, but as a teacher earlier in my career I did. As the MP for Mid Norfolk I’ve been proud to have been able to work closely with the teachers and parents in securing £7m funding in 2011 for the fantastic Chapel Green School, and funding from Norfolk County Council for the renovation of the brilliant Fred Nicholson school in Dereham.\nThe people of Mid Norfolk rightly care deeply for - and are proud to support - Our most vulnerable children with special needs. However, in the last 5-10yrs we have seen a massive growth in the demand for SEND provision which has overwhelmed our traditional mechanisms of provision\nOn every one of my Constituency Friday school gate visits SEND is the no1 issue raised by parents and teachers. More and more parents are battling the EHCP assessment and Tribunals system and forced to home school and watch their children suffer. More and more teachers tell me that the surge in SEND demand has accelerated as a result of better awareness and diagnosis, the Pandemic lockdown, the cost of energy crisis which has hit rural schools budget’s especially hard, and pressure on early years support as more and more parents find themselves both having to work to pay the bills.\nWhilst successive Governments have increased SEND spending with 18% / 1.2m now receiving SEND support - that leaves half a million children NOT receiving support. I would like to see the data but I strongly suspect the majority of those missing half a million are in RURAL areas.\nThis is another reason for my Fair Rural Funding Campaign to tackle the structural underfunding of rural areas. See my campaign by clicking here.\nWhatever the reasons the facts are that far too many rural schools & parents are overwhelmed and the national funding formula needs urgent reviewing. I’ve urged the Minister to look at the geographic location of the missing 500,000 children and the specific problem of RURAL under provision.\nSEND remains one of my key Top 3 Constituency campaigns as Mid Norfolk MP and will remain so until we get this right.\n- Click here for my SEND Campaign Page with regular updates on my work.\n- And here link ? for my speech in Westminster Hall this week.",

That requires ongoing interaction and engagement - digitally and face to face - as well as high impact one-off events.\nTo make “sustainable growth” and Net Zero real, inspiring and challenging goals which mean something tangible to local people, the Mag 7 believe it is KEY to set out at the beginning some properly evidenced Data and Heatmaps showing the scale of the local Net Zero challenge i.e:\nHow the New Anglia LEP ranks on Net Carbon Emissions and Sustainability\nWhat the Best and Worst practices are that we need to build our plan around\nSimple Comparative metrics which allow different LA areas, Towns, Parishes and Businesses to actually track, compare and be incentivised by progress and success\nThe Mag 7 sees digitalisation as KEY to this whole Vision and Plan: without reliable digital connectivity and data we haven’t a chance of delivering success: from mapping emissions to introducing on-demand buses to car share to smart energy to eco-tourism to digital health and decentralised growth - digitalisation is a fundamental necessity.\nI am proud to work with the NEF team to support this truly wonderful group of local, innovative entrepreneurs.\nMembers of the Mag 7 include:\nRosie Begg\nAli Clabburn\nJuliana Meyer\nGenevieve Christie\nLouise Jopling\nRobert Ashton\nRob Field",

Fast, reliable broadband access, and strong, reliable mobile signal, is essential for homes, schools and businesses if we are to ensure that our part of Norfolk does not get left behind.\nDespite considerable progress in the efforts to deliver 100% superfast broadband and mobile signal coverage (with approximately 95% of Norfolk now covered – up significantly since 2010), there remains work to be done however.\nThat’s why I have taken so seriously the concerns a sizeable group of residents and businesses in Mid Norfolk, and elsewhere, have about BT’s ‘Digital Voice’ switch over – which would see old copper landlines removed and internet providers setting up customers with alternative broadband and mobile (digital) services if they do not already have them.\nAs we modernise aging and increasingly costly and difficult to maintain communication systems, we must ensure NO ONE is left behind. The switch to digital services requires a stable supply of electricity and/or adequate signal coverage and, as we know too well, those are two things that cannot always be depended on in some of the more rural parts of our area. Many people, especially the elderly, are therefore rightly concerned about being cut off following the switch. They must be able to contact essential lifesaving services, as well as family and friends.\nHaving written to BT, along with the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture Media Support and her team of ministers and officials, on behalf of several worried local constituents, I am delighted to see that BT have recognised the concerns of thousands of people and agreed to pause the project until such time that they have the key products and infrastructure in place to ensure far more resilient ‘digital’ connectivity. It is clear that they had underestimated the impact that their upgrades could have on those living in power-cut prone areas or areas without good mobile signal.\nOf course, over the longer term, this switch is an essential part of updating our communications networks and bringing us into the 21st century. The fact that BT have listened to feedback and responded is positive news though and, aware of just how concerned many of my constituents were, I will continue to monitor the progress of the ‘Digital Voice’ initiative closely.\nPlease be assured that I will continue to build on my ‘Digital Divide’ campaign to get that final 5% of Norfolk connected to superfast broadband, as well as access to stable mobile coverage.

For too long, the system appears to have been driven by the national volume house builders who too often make their money from land banking and high density commuter housing estates on the edge of existing developments – rather than through a proper planning system run to deliver for the people who need planning to work for them, instead of being done TO them.\nI’ve long been concerned by the amount of development coming to areas like our own in rural Mid Norfolk – which is often inappropriate, “industrial” in scale and unsustainable. While most of our villages can take and are indeed up for (when properly asked) taking some additional new housing (without which our communities will gradually fade away), I fundamentally believe that more needs to be done to give local communities a greater say in how they develop in the years to come (with greater protections), which is why I have been so vocal in my opposition to the way so many large national developers abuse and take advantage of the planning system to dump such inappropriate and unsustainable developments on our towns and villages.\nThat’s why, through The Norfolk Way project I set up before I became an MP, I have been so vocal in advocating for a better model of growth and development that places greater emphasis on delivering small pockets of housing of the type and aesthetic desired by local communities, and in the places they earmark. I truly believe the spirit of Localism enshrined in the 2011 Localism Act should be enhanced, with the Act itself strengthened to remove some of the loopholes we’ve seen exploited. (To read more about my views in full, please visit my ‘Planning and Protecting Our Rural Heritage and Landscape’ campaign page here) I was delighted to see the NPPF reformed in the autumn by Michael Gove to give more power to local planners.\nI continue to make the case I have long made that the right way to plan housing is to give local councils, democratically accountable to the local residents they serve, the freedoms and incentives to plan properly for the right sort of housing and growth where it is needed ie:\n- around hotspots of economic growth\n- on brownfield sites in areas needing regeneration\n- around growth towns with the infrastructure and services available to sustain further growth\n- in villages with a Neighbourhood Plan setting out the amount of housing they are happy/able to take and which ensures affordable & appropriate local housing for local workers and residents\nThat’s what the Breckland and South Norfolk Council Local Plans rightly aim to do. What we don’t need in rural Norfolk is massive commuter estate “New Towns” dumped in the middle of rural mud Norfolk without proper infrastructure, facilities, sustainable transport links or fit with the existing pattern of development.\nThe North Elmham New Town\nThe North Elmham New Town would also represent massive development of the precious River Wensum chalk stream habitats (not to mention a Site of Specific Scientific Interest).\nThat’s why I was delighted to chair a meeting on Friday in North Elmham with local parish councils and local councillors Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge to make clear that the idea of a new town in the area will NOT be supported by ourselves as elected local representatives.\nBill and Gordon confirmed that Breckland Council are NOT zoning this area for major housebuilding, and will oppose a re-application of the New Town as we did successfully last time it was proposed.\nNew Towns and Garden Villages\nWhilst there are places in the UK where there may be a strong case for a new generation of garden towns and villages, with all of the necessary infrastructure and transport links (either to drive regeneration as in parts of the post-industrial North, or to alleviate the pressure around major growth hits spots like Cambridge), North Elmham is not a sustainable location.\nI can think of several possible sites in East Anglia that could perhaps take such a garden town or village: specifically the dilapidated station sites on the Cambridge-Ely-Brandon-Thetford-Attleborough-Wymondham-Norwich railway line – as part of the Oxford-Cambridge East-West Railway Development Company I have championed over the years, and especially during my time as Minister for the Future of Transport at the DfT.\nHowever, I’ve also been very clear that, for any such development, we need to be sure that:\n- Any such developments must avoid the loss of ancient woodland and high quality farmland\n- We see a serious commitment to Net Zero and building into the plans a higher quality, cleaner, greener standard of life – not continuing to same old, lazy model of house dumping that sees thousands of additional vehicles tearing through old country lanes and causing more congestion and rat-running\n- There is serious investment into public and private infrastructure – with proper road, rail, cycle and walking routes\n- Any such development is planned appropriately and sustainably, and that it makes sense in the wider community context.\nI have not seen any evidence to suggest that a garden town or village would be appropriate in this part of Mid Norfolk, and given the rural and inaccessible nature of North Elmham and the surrounding villages, the already serious congestion on the nearby road network and the nationally significant environmental and habitat importance of the Wensum Valley, I cannot envisage any circumstances in which this idea could be taken seriously.\nTo my mind, it would make far more sense for such a significant level of growth to be focussed down closer to the A11 Corridor – which Breckland Council themselves have, rightly, recognised is the key growth artery in our region and have tried to focus the bulk of the district’s future growth. I know the Leader of Breckland Council, Cllr Sam Chapman-Allen, and both Cllr Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge strongly support this.\nThat’s why I was delighted to join the c12 local parish councils representing the areas that would be affected by this idea to make clear my opposition.\nNext Steps\nAt the meeting we agreed some important Next Steps:\n- To reconvene a meeting of ALL the parish councils in the affected area after the forthcoming local elections on May 4th to make sure all write to Breckland Council formally to express their concerns.\n- Bill and Gordon and I will liaise to ensure all the local residents who object have their objections properly acknowledged by BDC.\n- I will invite my neighbouring MP, Jerome Mayhew, to join that follow-up meeting given a number of his Broadland communities are in close proximity to the site around North Elmham and would also be affected.\n- I will write to Michael Gove (Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) and the Minister for Housing to make clear why any New Towns and Garden Villages should only be delivered in the right locations with the associated connectivity, infrastructure and services required) and not in inappropriate locations with the obvious environmental, sustainability and transport issues this scale of development would inevitably threaten.\nPlease be assured that I will keep on this in the weeks and months ahead.",

Unfortunately, too many of our villages in Norfolk have become dormitories because of this.\nThat’s why I was delighted to visit Rocklands again last week to see the tremendous ongoing efforts to keep this community vibrant.\nI began the afternoon at the thriving Rocklands Primary School, meeting with Julie Dekker (the Executive Headteacher), Steven Ginn (the Deputy Headteacher) and all of the children – who were impeccably polite. It was fantastic to see how this rural village school has become such a prominent part of village life, providing high quality education without sacrificing the community spirit that make village schools so special.\nAfterwards, as part of my new #VillageVoice tour, I travelled around the village with the Parish Council Chairman, David Howie, and the Chair of the School Governors, Dave Jones, to visit a number of sites.\nWe stopped at the Rocklands Community Shop, which I helped to re-open four years ago, and which is going from strength to strength. The work of the outstanding team of over forty volunteers must be given high praise, and because of their commitment and endeavour the shop is taking on ever more responsibilities at its post office and providing more and more services to the village – including a tea room/meeting space.\nWe later visited the two historic churches in the village, All Saints and St Peter’s (which both get good weekly attendances), before heading on to the White Hart Public House, which is run by a local family from the village. Despite the rainy weather, it was great to see the pub packed and full of life and laughter.\nFinally, I attended a small event at the Playing Field Pavilion, meeting with local residents, community leaders and councillors from both Rocklands and surrounding villages. What was evident in abundance was the passion and commitment that those living in Rocklands, and also Great Ellingham and Little Ellingham, and I look forward to continuing to work with them all on a number of local campaigns in the area.\nRocklands is on a roll.

But with the Environment Agency now putting habitats ahead of drainage, and agencies like Anglian Water giving up riparian rights to maintain ditches and culverts, and councils powerless to force big developers to install proper drainage, we have a perfect storm – leading to the floods we have seen in the last few years, and last month in Attleborough where c100 homes were flooded and a handful are now flooding regularly.\nThat’s why, after the 2020 Christmas floods in Mid Norfolk – when many of us spent Christmas bailing out neighbours and on the phone to Anglian Water and the Fire Brigade, I set up the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership with the 30 villages most affected to set out a simple set of practical actions required to stop flooding (see here and here).\nI’m delighted Norfolk County Council adopted our recommendations in full and set up the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance (see here), now chaired by Henry Cator, to implement the changes we need.\nBut we need to go further: we need a clearer set of legal obligations – with fines if necessary to fund compensation and remedial work – on large scale developers, on the Environment Agency, on water companies and any negligent landowners to maintain drain infrastructure.\nThat’s why I am writing to ministers again to highlight the need for greater emphasis on flooding and drainage in the planning system, requesting a meeting with them and their officials to discuss reforms of the riparian ownership legislation and this's vital point about holding developers, the EA, water companies and negligent landowners to account.\nOne of the reasons for stepping back from the Government frontbench was to have more time here in Mid Norfolk to help tackle this.

I continue to actively engage with Fred Nichs and Norfolk County Council as we explore how best we can preserve and enhance that legacy – and I remain a vocal supporter of NCC’s efforts to expand SEND provision across the county, as well as to develop a stronger ‘Hub and Spoke’ approach for SEND support across our Mid Norfolk schools.\nTo find out more about my work over the years with Fred Nichs, please scroll below.\nTo see more about my wider campaign for ‘SEND Support in our local schools’, please visit my campaign page here\nUPDATE 12 June 2023\nDereham Times Article – Fred Nicholson School\nEvery few weeks, I am fortunate enough to have the opportunity to write a few words in the Dereham Times on an important local matter of my choosing.\nHaving previously written a piece on the campaign on my opposition to a potential 5,000 house new village/town near North Elmham/Bintree/Billingford (see here and here), I was delighted to be able to focus on Fred Nicholson School this time – highlighting the great strides that have recently been made to secure the school’s long term future.\nSee the article below.\nRest assured, I remain firmly committed to supporting Fred Nichs – and continue to be one of the SEND sector’s biggest advocates here in the East.\nTo stay up to date on all my work supporting SEND provision in our local schools (both specialist and mainstream), please click here.\nUPDATE 7 March 2023\nFred Nicholson School\nFollowing my webstory update last week, I am delighted to hear that NCC’s Cabinet have indeed given the greenlight for the purchasing of the necessary land in Swaffham required for the construction of a new home for Fred Nicholson School.\nThis is great news! And sends the clearest possible signal to the SEND community that NCC are committed to doing all they can to ensure Norfolk has the support it needs.\nWhile there is much work still to be done, this is a huge step forwards locally – and I commend Jane Hayman and her wonderful team at Fred Nichs for all the hard work they’ve put into this campaign to date. I remain firmly committed to doing all I can to help them drive it forward – and look forward to the day (not in the too distant future) when I can visit in person the brand new, fit-for-purpose home of this truly inspiring and much valued school.\nUPDATE 28 February 2023\nFred Nicholson School\nHow we take care of, and educate, some of our most vulnerable people is a measure of us as a society. EVERYONE has the right to a good education.\nThat’s why, having previously helped the campaign to move Chapel Road School in Attleborough to its new state-of-the-art home at Chapel Green in nearby Old Buckenham (read more here) and called for greater SEN funding for rural schools, I have also been working with Fred Nicholson School in Dereham over the past few years to try and help them secure a long-term solution to their future.\nWhen I visited the school back in 2019, I was struck by the tremendous spirit of the teachers and pupils, and the love that the wider community has for the school. However, the buildings were visibly falling into disrepair around them and short-term repairs were no longer sustainable. (Learn more here).\nWhile Norfolk County Council have worked closely with Jane Hayman and her dedicated team of staff at Fred Nichs to provide all the support that they can, it has long been clear that a proper long term solution is needed. I have therefore helped convene meetings between Fred Nichs and NCC (including with the leader of the council, Andrew Proctor – who has been a big support) in order to bring about the necessary conversations regarding what can be done to ensure the school has the fit-for-purpose facilities it needs.\nNCC takes SEND provision incredibly seriously indeed and, as part of their overall strategy to expand and strengthen the support they provide, have actively participated in discussions with the school to explore whether they should relocate to a new building on the existing site or to an alternative one nearby.\nI am delighted to hear the news therefore that NCC’s Cabinet will be meeting on Monday to discuss giving the greenlight to the purchase of some land near Swaffham – which it is hoped could be the location of Fred Nichs’ new home. (My understanding is that, should the land indeed be purchased, a planning application could be made as early as the spring).\nAs part of my ongoing efforts to support the Fred Nichs community, I have today written to Andrew Proctor to formally reiterate my support of the school and place on record my hope that the NCC Cabinet will sanction the purchase of this key piece of land. By doing so, NCC would not only allow Fred Nichs to move on to the next stage of securing the home they need and deserve, they would also send the clearest possible signal to the SEND community that they are committed to doing all they can to ensure Norfolk has the support it needs.\nI will be following Monday’s meeting closely and will continue to do all I can to support Fred Nichs, as well as the wider SEND community.\nUPDATE 22 March 2022\nVisit to Fred Nicholson School\nHow we take care of, and educate, some of our most vulnerable people is a measure of us as a society. EVERYONE has the right to a good education.\nAs part of my work as an MP I have been helping campaign to find new premises for the Fred Nicholson school in Dereham to try and help them secure a long-term solution to their future.\nThat’s why I met up with Jane Hayman and her incredible team again this past Friday to discuss updates on how its progressing, what more I can do to help and how the school is getting on post-pandemic.\nWorking with the Leader of Norfolk County Council, Andrew Proctor, and others, we aim to move the school to new premises that ensure Jane Hayman and her incredible team can provide the care and support they truly want, and which the children deserve.\nUPDATE 17 December 2020\nFred Nicholson School\nHow we take care of, and educate, some of our most vulnerable people is a measure of us as a society.

(For full details, please visit my website here).\nHowever, planning doesn’t just mean houses. It can also mean local businesses, industry and even infrastructure. While we want to see our local economy thriving (especially those traditional sectors that our area is so closely tied to), we need to ensure that growth is done positively, rather than at the expense of the rural way of life that we all hold so dear – and which makes Mid Norfolk such a wonderful place to live, work and visit!\nThat’s why I have been following closely the news that a solar farm application is being proposed near both Little Dunham and Great Dunham.\nAs a local Member of Parliament, I do not have the power to directly intervene in or influence individual planning applications – which are, rightly, the responsibility of the local district councils and their democratically elected councillors. However, it is within my remit to help constituents ensure their views are being recorded, considered and heard – and that’s something I have always taken extremely seriously throughout my years working on behalf of Mid Norfolk.\nHaving received correspondence from a number of constituents, as well as taken the time to read through the feedback documented on the Breckland Planning portal, it is clear to me that there are particularly strong views amongst many in Little Dunham and Great Dunham. It is also clear though that those views are divided, with many in favour of the solar farm application and many also against it.\nSuch is the strength of those local opinions, I have therefore written to the Leader of Breckland Council to highlight some of the key points that have been raised with me by those on both sides of the debate – to ensure that the Planning Committee members are aware of them when the time comes for them to consider whether or not permission should be granted for the application.\nSee a copy of my letter below.\nWhile I am unable to take a firm view on this application (given the lack of an overwhelming view from one side or the other, as well as my ministerial role), I am determined to do what I can to ensure ALL of Mid Norfolk is heard.\nI will continue to follow developments around this application closely.",

For too long, the system appears to have been driven by the national volume house builders who too often make their money from land banking and high density commuter housing estates on the edge of existing developments – rather than through a proper planning system run to deliver for the people who need planning to work for them, instead of being done TO them.\nI’ve long been concerned by the amount of development coming to areas like our own in rural Mid Norfolk – which is often inappropriate, “industrial” in scale and unsustainable. While most of our villages can take and are indeed up for (when properly asked) taking some additional new housing (without which our communities will gradually fade away), I fundamentally believe that more needs to be done to give local communities a greater say in how they develop in the years to come (with greater protections), which is why I have been so vocal in my opposition to the way so many large national developers abuse and take advantage of the planning system to dump such inappropriate and unsustainable developments on our towns and villages.\nThat’s why, through The Norfolk Way project I set up before I became an MP, I have been so vocal in advocating for a better model of growth and development that places greater emphasis on delivering small pockets of housing of the type and aesthetic desired by local communities, and in the places they earmark. I truly believe the spirit of Localism enshrined in the 2011 Localism Act should be enhanced, with the Act itself strengthened to remove some of the loopholes we’ve seen exploited. (To read more about my views in full, please visit my ‘Planning and Protecting Our Rural Heritage and Landscape’ campaign page here) I was delighted to see the NPPF reformed in the autumn by Michael Gove to give more power to local planners.\nI continue to make the case I have long made that the right way to plan housing is to give local councils, democratically accountable to the local residents they serve, the freedoms and incentives to plan properly for the right sort of housing and growth where it is needed ie:\n- around hotspots of economic growth\n- on brownfield sites in areas needing regeneration\n- around growth towns with the infrastructure and services available to sustain further growth\n- in villages with a Neighbourhood Plan setting out the amount of housing they are happy/able to take and which ensures affordable & appropriate local housing for local workers and residents\nThat’s what the Breckland and South Norfolk Council Local Plans rightly aim to do. What we don’t need in rural Norfolk is massive commuter estate “New Towns” dumped in the middle of rural mud Norfolk without proper infrastructure, facilities, sustainable transport links or fit with the existing pattern of development.\nThe North Elmham New Town\nThe North Elmham New Town would also represent massive development of the precious River Wensum chalk stream habitats (not to mention a Site of Specific Scientific Interest).\nThat’s why I was delighted to chair a meeting on Friday in North Elmham with local parish councils and local councillors Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge to make clear that the idea of a new town in the area will NOT be supported by ourselves as elected local representatives.\nBill and Gordon confirmed that Breckland Council are NOT zoning this area for major housebuilding, and will oppose a re-application of the New Town as we did successfully last time it was proposed.\nNew Towns and Garden Villages\nWhilst there are places in the UK where there may be a strong case for a new generation of garden towns and villages, with all of the necessary infrastructure and transport links (either to drive regeneration as in parts of the post-industrial North, or to alleviate the pressure around major growth hits spots like Cambridge), North Elmham is not a sustainable location.\nI can think of several possible sites in East Anglia that could perhaps take such a garden town or village: specifically the dilapidated station sites on the Cambridge-Ely-Brandon-Thetford-Attleborough-Wymondham-Norwich railway line – as part of the Oxford-Cambridge East-West Railway Development Company I have championed over the years, and especially during my time as Minister for the Future of Transport at the DfT.\nHowever, I’ve also been very clear that, for any such development, we need to be sure that:\n- Any such developments must avoid the loss of ancient woodland and high quality farmland\n- We see a serious commitment to Net Zero and building into the plans a higher quality, cleaner, greener standard of life – not continuing to same old, lazy model of house dumping that sees thousands of additional vehicles tearing through old country lanes and causing more congestion and rat-running\n- There is serious investment into public and private infrastructure – with proper road, rail, cycle and walking routes\n- Any such development is planned appropriately and sustainably, and that it makes sense in the wider community context.\nI have not seen any evidence to suggest that a garden town or village would be appropriate in this part of Mid Norfolk, and given the rural and inaccessible nature of North Elmham and the surrounding villages, the already serious congestion on the nearby road network and the nationally significant environmental and habitat importance of the Wensum Valley, I cannot envisage any circumstances in which this idea could be taken seriously.\nTo my mind, it would make far more sense for such a significant level of growth to be focussed down closer to the A11 Corridor – which Breckland Council themselves have, rightly, recognised is the key growth artery in our region and have tried to focus the bulk of the district’s future growth. I know the Leader of Breckland Council, Cllr Sam Chapman-Allen, and both Cllr Bill Borrett and Cllr Gordon Bambridge strongly support this.\nThat’s why I was delighted to join the c12 local parish councils representing the areas that would be affected by this idea to make clear my opposition.\nNext Steps\nAt the meeting we agreed some important Next Steps:\n- To reconvene a meeting of ALL the parish councils in the affected area after the forthcoming local elections on May 4th to make sure all write to Breckland Council formally to express their concerns.\n- Bill and Gordon and I will liaise to ensure all the local residents who object have their objections properly acknowledged by BDC.\n- I will invite my neighbouring MP, Jerome Mayhew, to join that follow-up meeting given a number of his Broadland communities are in close proximity to the site around North Elmham and would also be affected.\n- I will write to Michael Gove (Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities) and the Minister for Housing to make clear why any New Towns and Garden Villages should only be delivered in the right locations with the associated connectivity, infrastructure and services required) and not in inappropriate locations with the obvious environmental, sustainability and transport issues this scale of development would inevitably threaten.\nPlease be assured that I will keep on this in the weeks and months ahead.",

For some, it was the fourth time they had been flooded in 30 years – and the second time in just under three years. I appreciate, and share, the immense anger and frustration felt by those that have been forced to leave their homes as a result of the damage suffered this past weekend.\nThat’s why I held an emergency meeting today with Norfolk County Council and their Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Anglian Water and Breckland District Council to get to the bottom of what is causing the flooding at the watercourse and culvert on Mill Lane, as well as ensure that those with statutory flooding responsibilities come together and develop an urgent action plan.\nWhile NCC began working on proposals to address flooding at this location in light of the December 2020 flooding, Storm Babet has brought into sharper focus the need to upscale and accelerate those proposals, and address other issues such as questions around which authority is responsible for the culvert and watercourse and therefore who should be maintaining them.\nI had made clear that there needs to be:\n- A proper plan for ensuring affected residents (and the wider community) are protected from further flooding this winter.\n- An acceleration and upscaling of efforts to put in place a long term solution.\n- A proper plan for who is going to be responsible for this culvert and watercourse in due course.\n- Agreement on who is going to keep the culvert and watercourse clear NOW – while the longer term plan is being developed and implemented.\nI am in close contact with local district councillors and a number of those worst affected by the flooding and am determined to help them work with key stakeholders to develop a solution.\nWe must see action.

I have committed to doing all I can to add weight to those efforts.\n- Norfolk County Council are working with local landowners and the Norfolk Rivers Trust as they continue to develop plans for the proposed upstream Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme. As we know, we have secured £150,000 from Government for that work (see here) and, while the full scheme could take some time to develop and implement, positive conversations are ongoing with the aim of introducing earlier measures, such as “leaky dams”, as soon as this summer.\nI will be catching up with the stakeholder group again in a couple of weeks’ time – and joining a subsequent conversation between stakeholders and local councillors.

Deposits of gravel and silt have been found in parts and NCC are pressing ahead with arrangements to have these cleared – with the necessary contractors set to carry out works in early March.\nIn addition to this, I can share news that:\n- I continue to support NCC’s Flood and Water Management team and local councillors as they engage with landowners upstream to explore potential flood prevention and mitigation measures on their land.\n- NCC sent riparian ownership reminder letters to landowners and homeowners along the problem watercourse in mid-January to remind them of their riparian responsibilities and make clear what they must not throw into the stream.\n- NCC are working with the Internal Drainage Board to lobby Network Rail to inspect and, if necessary, clear the culvert they are responsible for downstream under the A11.\n- Stakeholders continue to look at what more can be done to protect the most at risk properties this winter.\nOnce again, I’ve reiterated the importance of looking at the longer term issue of responsibility and maintenance of the culverts and watercourses – and I will be involved in the next Mill Lane culvert stakeholder meeting next week as these vital conversations continue.\nI am also arranging the next wider multi-agency meeting on the Attleborough flooding too.\nRest assured, I will continue to work with local councillors and residents to hold the key stakeholders to account on this to drive forward the solutions Attleborough needs to see.\nTo learn more on the Attleborough Flooding campaign to date, please scroll down and read the updates below.\nTo learn more about my wider ‘Flooding and the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership’ campaign, please click the link here.\nUPDATE 17 January 2024\nStorm Babet flooded over 100 homes in Attleborough back in October and local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been affected) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership and Flooding Campaign work, I continue to take an active role in supporting those affected and holding the key stakeholders to account – both here in Mid Norfolk, but also in Westminster.\nWhile a number of short and medium term measures have already been carried out or are underway (see here), the incredibly high water levels at the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse at the start of the new year, and the serious risk residents are having to take in order to protect their homes, shows more must be done.\nLast week, I convened a multi-agency meeting with representatives from Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council, the local Internal Drainage Board, Anglian Water, Natural England, the Environment Agency – as well as local Town, Parish, District and County Councillors and representatives of local landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse – to emphasise again the importance of tackling these serious issues and explore in greater depth the short, medium and long term work required to significantly reduce future flood risk.\nI drew particular attention to those homeowners most at risk of flooding on Mill Lane – many of whom feel helpless and desperate, believing they have no choice but to seriously risk their own safety to try and keep the trash screen across the Mill Lane culvert clear each time it rains.\nThe key discussion points from the meeting were:\n- A shared acknowledgement that residents are seriously risking their own safety to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear of debris – and of the fact that conditions and circumstances at the culvert can change rapidly during periods of heavy rain.\n- Agreement that the existing Mill Lane culvert trash screen should not be removed until the new replacement has been installed (work currently underway – see here) – as the culvert has a 90 degree bend that, were it to become blocked, would be extremely difficult and costly to clear – and significantly worsen the current flood risk to the area.\n- NCC Flood and Water Management officials met with Anglian Water contractors on-site (the day prior the meeting) to verify the new trash screen designs ahead of pricing the work – with a multi-agency agreement already in place to fund it.\n- The installation of the new trash screen will likely not be possible prior to the summer. This is because the watercourse will need to be de-watered so that a new concrete base can be constructed and the trash screen fitted.\n- Further measures are therefore required in the short term to try and reduce flood risk along the watercourse and at the Mill Lane culvert.\n- NCC are going to work with local landowners and other stakeholders to explore installing an additional, temporary screen somewhere upstream that can catch debris and prevent it becoming a problem in Attleborough itself.\n- The Mill Lane culvert, and others along the watercourse, cannot be expanded – nor the watercourse itself deepened or widened – due to the amount of development and road access around and across it. The enormous cost and disruption, and lack of space, make it impossible.\n- Given concerns over residents and local councillors risking their safety by entering the watercourse to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear, a suggestion was made to appoint a jointly funded contractor to be on 24/7 call out to clear debris and blockages at the culvert trash screen when required. This suggestion was dismissed on the basis that no organisation would allow their staff to entering the water in storm flow conditions (when they would be most needed) – especially if Norfolk Fire and Rescue themselves have said the risk would be too great for even their own teams.\n- A suggestion was made to explore how the watercourse may, long term, be diverted to another course away from the town. Flooding Officers explained this would probably not be possible given local topography.\n- It is therefore not possible to immediately remove all flood risk. Instead, agencies must work with the properties most at risk to do as much as possible to improve their flood resilience.\n- NCC have also submitted a bid to the Natural Flood Management Fund, supported by myself and others, and I am working with them and local landowners upstream to explore how we might deliver a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme that could drastically reduce the long term flood risk to homeowners and businesses in Attleborough (see more here)\n- Everyone affected in the area by flooding in October must formally report their cases via the Norfolk County Council website to enable the Flood Investigations underway to be as accurate as possible – which in turn will strengthen the hand of local stakeholders to lobby for additional funding and support.\n- NCC are to look at monitoring water volumes and storm flows on the watercourse – again to strengthen their hand when lobbying for resources.\n- Local councillors asked what more could be done to improve safety for those homeowners currently taking risks to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear. It was asked if lighting and cameras could be installed.\n- I reiterated my ongoing support for all the efforts to tackle these flooding issues – and highlighted my efforts in Westminster to bring about the national reform needed also (see more here)\nAs is clear, this isn’t an easy fix – with multiple challenges faced. However, I am determined to all I can to support the community.\nThe key focusses/timescales moving forward are:\nShort Term (Now-next few weeks)\n- Doing as much as possible to improve the flood resilience of the most at risk properties\n- Explore what more can be done to improve safety for those putting themselves at risk to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear\n- Find a suitable location for an additional, temporary screen upstream to collect debris – and explore additional short term measures upstream that can reduce flood risk\nMedium Term (Summer)\n- Replacement of the existing trash screen with a new one that is designed specifically for the challenges being faced.\n- Continue to explore what measures can be introduced to reduce flood risk.\nLonger Term\n- Deliver a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme upstream that can significantly reduce flood risk\n- Deliver legislative changes and reform in the House to better empower local communities so that they can protect themselves from flooding, while also holding developers to account when new housing exacerbates local problems.\nRest assured, I will keep working tirelessly on this issue.\nTo stay up to date, please visit my flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 4 December 2023\nOver 100 homes in Attleborough were flooded in Storm Babet at the end of October.\nWe cannot allow this to happen again. Local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why earlier today, as part of my ongoing campaign (and having recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership that I established back in early 2021 – see here), I met with Norfolk County Council’s Flood and Water Management team, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance and representatives for some of the landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse.\nIt’s clear that that we need a proper long term strategic plan that addresses problem watercourse pinch points AND looks to better control the flow of water downstream during heavy rainfall events. While some positive progress is already being made at the Mill Lane culvert itself (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), today’s call focused on what can be done further upstream – and I am committed to actively supporting NCC/the NSFA and partners as they work with landowners and other agencies to explore what flood mitigation and water storage scheme measures might work best for Attleborough.\nTo see all of my recent work supporting Attleborough residents, please click here or see below.\nFor full details on all of my flooding campaign work, please visit my website here.\nUDPATE 29 November 2023\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted by recent flooding.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing campaign, I visited Mill Lane with Cllrs Samantha and Taila Taylor this past Friday to see the problem culvert/watercourse first hand and meet with some of the worst affected residents.\nPlease see my video above.\nLocal residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious – and I continue to hold the key stakeholders to account to ensure everything that can be done is indeed being done to provide affected residents with the support they need, as well as to put in place a short, medium and long term plan that looks to try and prevent future such flooding again in future.\nSome positive progress is already being made (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), but there still remains much more to do.\nThat’s why, as highlighted in my recent update here, I recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership to give our communities the strongest possible voice on these issues. Attleborough had strong representation on that call and I am determined to do everything I can, alongside local councillors, to ensure residents like those on Mill Lane and surrounding streets are heard.\nI will be involved in more meetings in the coming days and am also writing to ministers and officials in Westminster to re-emphasise again the need to put greater emphasis on flooding and drainage matters in the planning process – including putting increased responsibility on developers who’s developments subsequently flood and/or impact the existing community.\nTo stay up to date with all my work on these issues, please visit my Flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 3 November 2023\nFurther to my webstory update last week (see here), I can now provide more information on the work being done by multiple parties to address the terrible flooding that has recently affected many households and businesses in Attleborough.\nOn Monday, the Town Council and local district and county councillors held a public meeting in the town for local residents to speak with key stakeholders. The event was well attended and I am pleased to report that stakeholders have been following up on a number of the points and concerns raised – with additional site visits undertaken to the culvert and watercourse on Mill Lane (as well as the culvert in Briar Gardens). Meetings with developers to assess drainage on their building sites have also taken place and I am aware that a series of additional measures, along with further clearing of drains and ditches, are already being implemented – with anecdotal reports of additional blockages being addressed. I will continue to monitor progress closely.\nFurther to the emergency meeting I held last week (see here), an urgent meeting took place on Tuesday between Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council and Anglian Water to discuss in greater depth the specific issues that caused flooding at the Mill Lane culvert and connected watercourse.\nAs many are aware, the culvert and watercourse were divested to riparian ownership many years ago. While that question of who will take on the long term ownership remains (and rest assured that I continue to push very hard on that and have challenged all stakeholders to work collaboratively to develop a proper strategic plan and solution for the issue), I welcome the collective recognition that something needs to be done as soon as possible, with agreement that the inadequate and unsafe trash screen that caused many of the recent problemsneeds to be replaced.\nOn a without prejudice basis (of who will assume long term responsibility for the culvert and watercourse) and as a gesture of goodwill, Anglian Water have agreed to have their contractors assess the trash screen and culvert and work up the design for a much safer, more effective replacement. All stakeholders will then jointly fund the improved screen and Anglian Water will install it.\nIn the meantime (and again on a without prejudice basis and as a gesture of goodwill), Anglian Water will endeavour to send staff every couple of weeks to keep the existing trash screen clear. (Breckland, NCC and Anglian Water are also discussing a longer term plan for removing any debris collected from the culvert and watercourse)\nI would like to reiterate however that I will keep on the critical question of who will assume the long term responsibility and ownership of the culvert and watercourse – and am already liaising with the key stakeholders on the date for a follow-up meeting to discuss that matter further.\nNCC have also confirmed that the gulleys around Mill Lane have been cleared (with additional review taking place of gulleys on surrounding streets) and I understand that an assessment is taking place as to whether the trash screen at the Briar Gardens culvert should be removed.\nA full flood investigation is now being led by NCC in line with their statutory processes. Although their Flood and Water Management team had already been working on proposals to better mitigate flooding in this area (as a result of the December 23rd-24th 2020 flooding event), there is recognition that their Flood Plan for the area, and its associated work, now needs accelerating and upscaling. I have committed to supporting NCC as they seek to secure the additional funding required to implement any recommended measures, as well as to engage with key local landowners.\nI am also in the process of reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I previously established – and will ensure Attleborough is represented in those vital conversations.\nRest assured, I am determined to do everything I can to speak up for those affected in Attleborough, as well as those across Mid Norfolk.\nUPDATE 25 October 2023\nStorm Babet has reminded us again why we must continue to take flooding seriously.\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted, with severe flooding on Mill Lane, Norwich Road, Ferguson Way and other nearby streets. For some, it was the fourth time they had been flooded in 30 years – and the second time in just under three years. I appreciate, and share, the immense anger and frustration felt by those that have been forced to leave their homes as a result of the damage suffered this past weekend.\nThat’s why I held an emergency meeting today with Norfolk County Council and their Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Anglian Water and Breckland District Council to get to the bottom of what is causing the flooding at the watercourse and culvert on Mill Lane, as well as ensure that those with statutory flooding responsibilities come together and develop an urgent action plan.\nWhile NCC began working on proposals to address flooding at this location in light of the December 2020 flooding, Storm Babet has brought into sharper focus the need to upscale and accelerate those proposals, and address other issues such as questions around which authority is responsible for the culvert and watercourse and therefore who should be maintaining them.\nI had made clear that there needs to be:\n- A proper plan for ensuring affected residents (and the wider community) are protected from further flooding this winter.\n- An acceleration and upscaling of efforts to put in place a long term solution.\n- A proper plan for who is going to be responsible for this culvert and watercourse in due course.\n- Agreement on who is going to keep the culvert and watercourse clear NOW – while the longer term plan is being developed and implemented.\nI am in close contact with local district councillors and a number of those worst affected by the flooding and am determined to help them work with key stakeholders to develop a solution.\nWe must see action. This must not be allowed to happen again. And residents should not be risking their own safety to try and keep this culvert clear during storms and heavy rainfall.\nMore widely, I will be reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I established as a result of the Winter 2020/21 flooding to help support those affected by Storm Babet and ensure our communities have the strongest possible voice heading into this autumn/winter.\nRest assured, I will continue to support councillors and residents in the days, weeks and months ahead.\nTo see my Flooding Update earlier this week, please click here\nTo find out more about my historic campaign work on flooding, please visit my campaign page here",

SEND provision is the number one issue for both parents and teachers and staff. Contrary to the party political broadcast opposite, in the last 14 years, I was lucky to secure £7 million from the Conservative coalition for a new school and Conservative County Council funding for a new school in Swaffham. Officials in the Department for Education have also been very constructive in working on a pathfinder for rural hub and spoke support.\nParents in rural areas really struggle. Can I ask what ministers are doing to take that forward to support small rural schools so they can access the specialist help in hubs?\nThe Minister for School Standards (Catherine McKinnell)\nI know the honourable gentleman raises his concern in all sincerity, which is why we will continue to work with all partners, parents, teachers, local authorities and indeed the NHS also in how we reform our SEND system and ensure that the support that is needed reaches every part in every community and our ambition is for a more inclusive, mainstream school system that draws on the right education and health specialists to make sure that every child receives the support that they deserve.",

As a sometimes lonely voice on the Conservative Benches advocating for industrial strategy, I signal support for his intention. I am sure that he agrees that the big challenge is to convert our phenomenal science and technology leadership into sovereign industrial supply chain leadership around this country. Having led the strategy for life sciences—quantum, engineering biology, fusion—may I ask whether he agrees that the key to this is cross-departmental Whitehall work, and ensuring that we do not end up with endless earnest, well-intended committees, but actually engage the small businesses, entrepreneurs and investors who are driving these sectors of tomorrow?\nThe Secretary of State for Business and Trade (Jonathan Reynolds)\nI genuinely thank the hon. Member for those comments, because I am serious when I say that I believe that industrial strategy should command support across the political spectrum. That is the norm in a lot of comparable countries to ours. I recognise not just the work that he did, but the number of times he did it; he was called back repeatedly by the last Government to do that work. I am often struck by the comments that Lord Willetts made in the Policy Exchange pamphlet about the lack of a supply chain for offshore wind really benefiting Scandinavian economies, rather than ours.\nThere are common areas of interest, and to make this industrial strategy more successful than the very credible approach taken by the Conservative Government when Theresa May was Prime Minister, we need it to last longer, and for it to have consistency and permanence. I know that the advocates and designers of that policy wanted the chance to do that. The strategy must also be cross-departmental. It will be led by my Department, but it cannot be solely my Department that is engaged. I can tell the hon. Member that all my Cabinet colleagues share our objectives and a keenness to make this work. We do not just want strategies put on the shelf for the short or long term; we want the strategy to make a difference in the communities that everyone in the Chamber represents.

The campaign also shone a light on the lack of mobile phone signal in many parts and encouraged partners to embrace new ways of tackling the issue.\nA lot of great work has been done over the years – with superfast broadband coverage now over 95% across Norfolk and many of the local “not-spots” now able to receive good quality mobile signal.

Member for Keighley (Robbie Moore). I come from a farming family; it is nice to know that we are in such strong hands, and to hear such cross-party support for this key industry. The sector will be grateful to know how strongly it is represented across this House.\nI do not have an interest to declare, except that as I come from a farming family, I narrowly escaped a career in farm management. I worked for Greens of Soham and used to be a director of Elsoms Seeds. I also worked for the National Farmers Union back when there was a thing called the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and I used to chair the all-party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture. I take this opportunity to thank Minette Batters for her extraordinary leadership of an organisation that is at times not given to agility and clarity. She has brought clarity to the sector. I wish Tom Bradshaw, her successor, all the very best.\nI think the House knows that I was not a great believer that the Brexit referendum would be immediately and easily implementable—I thought it would cause some difficulties and problems—but the one thing that I was very excited about was the opportunity to replace the appalling common agricultural policy, and all its mess, bureaucracy and chaos, with a UK farm and agriculture support framework. That remains an exciting opportunity. Such a framework would give this great industry—that is what it is—security in the long term. History shows that when we give that to farmers, they give us back exactly what we want. We need a long-term, secure policy, that has enough support and flexibility to allow marginal hill farmers to protect the uplands and the beautiful countryside that we love; that supports small family holdings, whose economic marginality requires diversification; and that supports all those other activities that we want to support. In my part of the world, East Anglia, global, world-class, competitive agriculture can lead the way in growing the food that the world needs. There is a huge opportunity.\nI observe that in my 14 years in the House, agriculture has gone from not being properly recognised as an industry, and almost being seen by the Government as an activity of park keeping, to being, after the pandemic and Ukraine, a hugely important strategic sector that is key to food security and an opportunity for us globally. We need to double world food production by 2050 on the same land area, with half as much water and energy. That is a global grand challenge. This country is a powerhouse in agricultural science, research and technology, and can help make that possible. The opportunity is for us to set out a framework that unlocks the genius of our agricultural sector, so that we can show the world how it is done. If we get that right, we will invigorate the rural economy.\nOf course, Brexit was eight years ago. I pay tribute to the Government’s various commitments: the £2.4 billion ringfenced commitment, the sustainable farming incentive, countryside stewardship, the food innovation programme, the food strategy, the animal health and welfare pathway, ELMS, and the Prime Minister’s commitment at the recent NFU conference. The real key is ensuring that the farming community feel and see long-term, clear, sustainable support.\nI want to highlight one or two things that the farmers of Mid Norfolk say we have still to get right. First, they highlight the importance of a really reliable, long-term policy framework for the commercial sector, as well as an environmental framework for skills and for innovation. For 40 years after the war, the sector knew what we wanted it to do. It needs to know that we know what we want it to do, and that we will not change our mind every five, three or two years.\nSecondly, agriculture must be recognised as a strategic industry that is key to our balance of payments, food security and ability to connect to those huge global markets. Public support figures show that the public are with us now—they were not 20 or 30 years ago; they did not think of it as a great industry that they wanted to support, but they do now.\nThirdly, we must understand that farmers are, first and foremost, mainly small businesses. They are not sophisticated; generally, they are not people with degrees or MBAs in business management. They are people who love what they do. We need to give them a framework that works for them as small businesses. Farming is a very unusual business, which invests most of its costs up front in the hopeful pursuit of revenue and profit downstream. Not many businesses do that. We need to understand that reality, as that is partly why farms need such security.\nA number of colleagues have talked about food security. We are not destined only to grow the root crops, potatoes and traditional crops here, and to import the salad crops. Incredible innovations in vertical farming mean that we are now able to produce salad crops in this country. I have visited vertical farms—we have a great one in Norfolk at Fischer Farms. They use a fraction of the land area, with a fraction of the energy and chemicals used in traditional farming. There is no reason why that food security target could not be a lot higher.\nOf course we all want environmental agriculture. I pay tribute to Kevin Bowes, the Breckland farmers, the Upper Wensum farmers group and the farmers at Wendling Beck. Farmers in Mid Norfolk are shaping best practice for agri-environment schemes. I recently visited a flagship project with Natural England: 20 or 30 people had come up from London, having bought their wellies at the garage; and Tony Juniper was preaching rewilding. I went to look at some land that, as a farmer’s boy, I would think you could probably get two hectares or an acre out of—and the finest minds in the land were trying to work out how to get nothing out of it, at a time when we really need food production. I am worried that the E in DEFRA sometimes triumphs over the F, the R and the A. Food needs to be right back at the heart of the Department; I know that the Secretary of State and the Minister are committed to that.\nI make the point about the environment because we all know that, traditionally, agriculture has been a very high emitting industry. We need to show the world how to move to a low-emission agricultural sector. We are well positioned to do that, not least in agricultural genetics and breeding science at the Norwich Research Park, where we are pioneering drought-resistant crops that do not need highly carbon-intensive chemicals, and disease-resistant and drought-resistant crops for the rest of the world. In our chase for net zero, the left hand and the right hand need to be co-ordinated. We are not doing anything for net zero if we are disrupting farming in East Anglia with endless solar farms, cables and pylons.\nSir Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) (Con)\nThere is a simple thing that the Department can do, which I have asked it to do again and again: not put solar farms on 3b land. We put them on warehouses or inferior land, but not on good agricultural land in Lincolnshire and Norfolk.\nGeorge Freeman\nI agree. If we are to lead the world in net zero agriculture, it is all about metrics and data. It is about picking up a pint of milk, a potato or a loaf of bread and knowing its environmental footprint. With that, we can start to give the sector incentives and rewards for driving down the environmental footprint. Without it, we are condemned to follow environmental policies that are emotional and not connected to proper science and research. If we get that right, the UK could be a leader in setting those environmental metrics.\nThat brings me to water quality. I commend the fact that UK agriculture has achieved a 75% reduction in pollution—that is very right. In our part of the world, the nutrient neutrality muddle has been a serious blow to farmers who are taking water quality seriously by reducing pig effluent and trying to get the balance right. Clunky, bureaucratic, big schemes in Whitehall that were not thought through properly are causing chaos in our part of the world in both agriculture and housing.\nThat brings me to flooding, on which I agree with the hon. Member for Selby and Ainsty (Keir Mather)—it is good to hear colleagues from all corners of this House getting the problem. Large parts of Mid Norfolk are currently under water. That is not good for agricultural productivity. Farms are holding water, for which they receive no support. There has been a lot of talk recently of “from the river to the sea.” The basics of drainage are that rivers are there to drain water off the land into the sea, and we could do with the Environment Agency putting dredging and the clearing of rivers at the top of the priority list to ensure that we get the water off the land properly.\nMark Menzies (Fylde) (Con)\nMy hon. Friend is making a powerful point. That issue is not just limited to Norfolk. The Secretary of State will know, being a Fylde lad, that it is affecting my farmers. We are crying out for water draining off land and letting farmers farm.\nGeorge Freeman\nI could not agree more. The Secretary of State, whose constituency is North East Cambridgeshire, has lived the reality of getting water off the land as much as anybody.\nThat brings me to labour shortages. We have had real problems in the last few years: post Brexit, post pandemic and with the minimum wage, farmers are struggling. When a horticultural grower of the calibre of Andy Allen has to plough his prime English asparagus crop back into the land because he cannot find anyone to cut it, we are in real trouble. Some of our agricultural colleges are fantastic—I think I still have a place at Harper Adams if this career does not work out—but I worry that Easton College in Mid Norfolk is not properly anticipating the future needs of a high technology agricultural industry. We need to nurture the skills of tomorrow. Our young farmers get it, but we need to give them the courses.\nI echo the comments that a number of Members have made about the difference between landowners and farmers. They are not the same thing. Many farmers I see are contract farmers—they are working 24/7, covering huge amounts of land and operating with higher and higher costs. The environmental payments tend to go to the landowners. We need to look after the farmers: the people who are developing those skills and inspiring the next generation to come into this great industry. If we end up with an industry where the hedge funds own all the land and no one is able to farm it, we will have done ourselves no favours. Quite a lot of those pressures explain why we have such a problem with mental health in agriculture. One farmer a week is taking their life. We need to think about what is driving that.\nI applaud the Government’s work on production standards. We have a great opportunity in free trade deals to set the higher standards and to show the world how the UK produces more with less. I would offer a zero tariff only to those who are using the world’s very best technologies for zero-emission agriculture, and create a market for the exporting of our net zero technologies. Sustainable intensification—delivering more with less—is not just a strapline. The world desperately needs us to help deliver that. In our sector we have huge strength: the John Innes Centre at the Norwich Research Park, the Sainsbury Laboratory in Aberystwyth, and at Roslin and Wellesbourne. We are a global powerhouse in science research. We spend about half a billion a year on it, but it does not yet feel like the agricultural sector is underpinned by a half a billion of research. I know that the Secretary of State is thinking hard about how that science and research is better pulled through.\nThat brings me to agritech—a huge global sector. I was proud to set up our first agritech industrial strategy, the catalyst fund and the centres with my noble Friend Lord Willetts. We have some amazing agritech companies, but the key is to adopt the technologies they are producing. I pay tribute to companies such as Tropic Biosciences and to the work going on at Rothamsted. But when a company like the Small Robot Company develops brilliant technology but cannot find a market here to use it, I think that tells us as policymakers that we have to create a market in which those technologies are commercially viable and adoptable—otherwise we will end up incubating the rest of the world’s agritech sectors and not actually deploying the technologies here.\nI will close by mentioning gene editing, which is a huge strength here in the UK—not just in disease resistance and drought-resistant crops, and shifting from chemical to biological control systems, but in nutraceuticals, functional foods and novel foods. We could lead the world in a whole new sector of agriculture, but that regulatory leadership is key.\nThe opportunity that people voted for eight years ago is still there. It is being born slowly and there have been many disruptions, but it is exciting. If we get this right, we could trigger and be the crucible of a new agricultural revolution in which we show the world how to deliver high-quality, safe, highly productive, low-input agriculture based on innovation with science, data and metrics. The UK could export that around the world. The alternative is that we create a jungle of well-intended green tape that gets in the way of a fundamentally commercial sector leading us into that new dawn. I know that DEFRA Ministers understand that. My job is to speak for the people of Mid Norfolk, and to ensure that we in this House show that we get it and that we are there for a new generation, who want to do the right thing for this country and for the globe.",

The group also made clear it was vitally important that people and local communities are properly included in, and given a say in, consultations about how electricity infrastructure is delivered both onshore and offshore – most notably in the case of East Anglia Green.\nWhile the news that the ESO have opened a new public consultation on East Anglia Green is very positive indeed (see more here), there remains much more to be done. The Minister himself acknowledged that, praising the work of the OffSET team and local campaigners thus far – making clear that it has focussed the minds of the key stakeholders, who are taking the points being raised very seriously indeed.\nThe Minister also reassured us that, while there will always be a need for a certain amount of electricity infrastructure onshore, the Government is committed to the Offshore Transmission Network concept it has agreed to (see more here) and believes that the work to achieve that is moving forward positively. He also emphasised his belief that the communities hosting major pieces of Nationally Significant Infrastructure should also be fairly recompensed in terms of community benefits by the relevant developers.\nRest assured, this remains a key campaign for me here in Norfolk – and I will also continue to do all I can to support local communities now engaging in the community benefit discussions being held by Vattenfall.\nTo read more about my ongoing campaign on this, please visit my website here.",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_parliament_george-freeman-responds-budget/content_326.html": "George Freeman emphasises the depth of the financial crisis facing the UK, particularly with regard to the structural deficit, and he highlights the importance of an innovation-driven economy as the path out of this crisis. The Government needs a tax regime and policies that will retain talent and attract innovators and investors rather than deter them as he fears this Budget will do. Finally, George raises concerns about the Budget's impact on small businesses and agriculture in rural areas such as Mid Norfolk.\nGeorge Freeman (Mid Norfolk) (Con)\nIt is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Birmingham Edgbaston (Preet Kaur Gill). It is also an honour and a pleasure, after 14 years, to be able to rise as a free man—free to speak on the Opposition Benches liberated from the tyranny of the Whips’ handouts that are being so beautifully read from the Labour Benches, and from the tyranny of desperate ambition to get on to the Front Bench. I want to speak today, after 14 years on and off the Front Bench, about the state of the public finances. I shall speak much more in sorrow than in anger, not to score party political points but to share reflections on the real depth of the crisis this country faces in our structural deficits and the challenge that this Chancellor, this country and this Parliament face in tackling it.\nAs a former Minister for life science, for fusion, for quantum and for space, I am delighted to have been elected by, I think, the House to the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee. I am also chair of the parliamentary and scientific committee—the oldest all-party group—and chair of the APPG on science and technology in agriculture. I am also proudly and gladly pleased to declare my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests. I am trying to repair my finances—I carry too much debt, like this country—by working with some great British companies to help them to raise money in the international markets and to grow. That is what this country has to do to get itself out of debt as well.\nI want to say three things this afternoon: something about the real nature of the crisis in our public finances; something about why I so deeply believe the innovation economy is the only way to get us out of this doom loop spiral of structural deficit and debt; and something about my poor constituents in Mid Norfolk and the effect of this Budget on them. Tempting though it is to stand up and accuse the Labour Government of causing all the ills of the world, and to take no responsibility for them, I want to do the opposite and suggest that this Parliament and this country have for the last 25 years been failing to grapple seriously enough with the deep nature of structural deficit in our broken public finances.\nI remember, when I was newly elected in 2010, having a brilliant briefing from Robert Chote and Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and having the structural deficit properly explained to me. That has stayed with me, and it is worth sharing for the benefit of those listening to this debate. Traditionally, all Governments in this country tax and spend. They earn money every year from tax revenues and then spend it. In some years, the economic cycle turns down, so we do not cut spending; we borrow a bit to maintain our spending and then repay it when the economic cycle turns. Occasionally in the cycle, we run deficits. The structural deficit is that bit of the public finances that means that, even when the economy is growing—even when it is growing at 2% or 3%—we are running a deficit, because there are bits of the economy that are constantly swallowing more money than we are capable of earning.\nWhen we took office in 2010, debt interest was effectively the fourth biggest Department of state. We had a serious crisis on our hands. Looking back, if we are honest, new Labour did not pay enough attention to deep reform of our public finances during the “Cool Britannia” years of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. In the 2007-08 crash, that Government unleashed £700 billion of borrowing and quantitative easing. We can argue about whether that was the right thing to do, but it drove huge asset price inflation and left us with huge debts.\nThe coalition tried to get us out of that debt with austerity, on which I think the country was with us for the first two or three years before feeling that we had overdone it. Yes, we had that crash, the disruption of Brexit, a terrible once-in-a-century pandemic and a war in Ukraine—we had £700 billion of QE, £400 billion of pandemic relief and £40 billion of cost of living relief—but we have effectively come back to where we were in 2010, facing a structural deficit and flashing red lights in the public finances. I call it the bonfire in the basement of the British economy. Even when the economy is growing, even when we see Canary Wharf on the drive from Norfolk, the unseen bonfire in the basement eats away at the economy’s resilience and sustainability. That should worry all of us involved in public policy, and I have a sneaking feeling that the public understand this.\nThe people I spoke to on the doorstep during the election were not economists or seasoned political observers but, after observing successive Governments fail, their common sense told them that there is a deep problem in the state. I suggest that much of the political volatility in recent years comes from an inability, including in my own party, to be honest about the scale of the problem. I think the Brexit revolution was driven by deep anger and resentment not just at Brussels, but at the failure of this country’s political economy. People outside the golden triangle felt left behind by their own Government, their own country and their own model of growth.\nThe lecture I received in 2010 from Robert Chote and Paul Johnson is just as relevant today. Four things drive the structural deficit. The first is debt interest. There was an inflation surge because of the war in Ukraine, but we have been lucky that the markets have generally not punished us for borrowing too much. Second is welfare bills. The coalition implemented very painful reforms to stop the rise of the welfare bill. We did not cut the welfare budget; we just stopped its rise. Third is public sector pensions. Again, there were some very painful reforms, not to cut the costs but to prevent them from booming and bankrupting the public finances.\nThose are all significant issues, but the biggest one, by far, is healthcare. The structural cost of healthcare in our ageing economy, with increasingly expensive medicines and an NHS designed for the 1940s rather than the 21st century, is in danger of bankrupting itself and the public finances. I am on record as saying, and I will repeat it, that the Health Secretary’s honesty is a breath of fresh air. The NHS has not been broken by a lack of Tory funding—we have all poured money into the NHS—but the problem is that the model is not fit for the 21st century.\nMuch more in sorrow than in anger, I suggest that we need to start this debate by being profoundly honest about the real nature of the problem. The truth is that we cannot cut, borrow, tax or spend our way out of a debt crisis, and successive Governments have tried and failed.\nI speak as a card-carrying supporter of industrial strategy, of increased R&D spending and of getting the country out of its current spiral and into a higher-growth model. I want to cheer much of this Budget, and perhaps there will be more to cheer when we read the Red Book tomorrow, but I am worried.\nChi Onwurah (Newcastle upon Tyne Central and West) (Lab)\nI thank the hon. Gentleman, my fellow member of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, for giving way. He knows that R&D funding is vital to driving innovation, productivity and future growth and prosperity. Does he agree that we should welcome the commitment to protecting core R&D funding, as well as the specific investment in high-tech areas such as automotive, aerospace and clean energy? Does he agree that the Committee looks forward to examining the detail of the Budget to see its impact on science and technology in every Department and across the country?\nGeorge Freeman\nI thank the hon. Lady for her intervention and for her chairmanship of our Select Committee. I welcome bits of the Budget, including the £20 billion commitment. My right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Northallerton (Rishi Sunak), the former Prime Minister, and I secured an historic commitment to raise R&D investment to £20 billion when he was Chancellor, and I heard the Government ringfencing that amount today. I support the notion of an industrial strategy, as long as that does not involve earnest committees of Whitehall mandarins far away from the innovators, entrepreneurs and people on the ground. I support the wealth fund and the Mansion House reforms, but I have sincere concerns about the message that today’s Budget sends about innovators, entrepreneurs, wealth creators and businesses. They are the people who turn great science into great businesses that drive growth.\nLet me talk about why the innovation economy is key. If we want to get out of debt, the innovation economy provides the only model of growth that will deliver the productivity increases we so urgently need. It will reduce our reliance on the low-wage labour that has been completely built into the service economy, which has dominated this country since the 1980s and since the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years of “Cool Britannia”. That model was based on letting London boom and pulling in cheap labour, which drove an immigration crisis that my party got itself twisted up about and that put huge pressure on our public services. We have to get away from that model of growth, and move to a model of growth led by innovation, with higher skilled jobs, much greater efficiency and productivity.\nSectors are growing in this country that could attract billions of pounds of investment from all over the world. There is a wall of capital to invest in agritech, clean tech, fusion energy, satellite manufacturing—I could go on—and all the sectors where we are strong. That is the part of the economy that we should focus on, and it is the only bit of the economy that drives genuine regeneration. The sustainable levelling up is happening in Glasgow through the satellite manufacturing economy, in Edinburgh through quantum computing, in Newcastle through data, in Leeds through digital health and in Norwich through agritech. The R&D economy is the best mechanism for driving that levelling up and regeneration, and creating the opportunity society we all need. We cannot have an innovation economy without an opportunity society. I would go as far as saying that we cannot have an opportunity society without an innovation economy. That is key if we want to tackle the problem of debt.\nNesil Caliskan (Barking) (Lab)\nDoes the hon. Gentleman agree that supporting skills and employment is key to creating the sort of economic growth he talks about? Getting young people on a pathway to training and receiving the skills they need to secure jobs is critical.\nGeorge Freeman\nI completely agree and the hon. Lady makes an important point. I was the Minister that covered that agenda. The science superpower piece is about our being a bigger player in the world, attracting billions into the country and using our science and research to solve global challenges. Our science ecosystem is not yet set up to do that—that is not even what it thinks it is there to do. The innovation economy piece is about using the science engine to drive economic advantage in this country through the catapult network, greater industrial R&D, investment in skills, ensuring we train the workforce for tomorrow’s industries, procurement and regulation, and supporting innovation clusters. Skills are key to that.\nIn that context, a Budget is an opportunity, but the Chancellor has missed the fact that to drive the innovation economy, we need entrepreneurs, innovators, and people who will take a risk and create a business. That does not happen in the Treasury or, dare I say it, in my beloved old Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. It does not happen in Whitehall. Our job is to create the conditions for innovation to flourish.\nI fear that the signal that has gone out from today’s Budget is that although we have had a change of Government, we have not had a change in the core narrative. It feels to me as though Treasury orthodoxy has been reasserted. We will balance the books by making cuts, taxing existing wealth and chasing harder and harder after growth, but what we will see is growth down, inflation up, borrowing up, mortgages up and taxes up. We need to send a big signal that this country is open for business.\nThe hon. Member for Birmingham Edgbaston (Preet Kaur Gill) made an interesting point about the global investment summit, which we set up and which is now called the international investment summit. It is good news that that money is coming in, but I have to say that, in 30 years in the innovation economy, I have never seen so many people decide that they are going to sell their businesses and leave the country than I have over the past three or four months. The Government thought that they were playing a clever political trick of rolling the pitch, so that, on Budget day, the news would not be so politically damaging. However, they have misunderstood how mobile capital and talent are in the global economy.\nWe need people to want to come to this country. Often they want—I did not—to put their children into independent schools. They want to make money here. They want to build businesses here. We need to attract them. We have no right to just assume that they will come. If we are to build an innovation economy, we need a tax regime that is fair. No one wants this to be the home of Russian money-laundering, international criminals and abuse of the non-dom system, but we have to build an economy that is attractive for innovators.\nWe also need to better connect the City to our science, research, technology and innovation sector. It is shocking to me, and it should be to this House, that, in 1997, 73% of the £3 trillion-odd held in the City—our money that is invested in pensions—went into equities, 53% of which went into UK equities. That figure today is just under 4%. In the past 25 years, we have seen the most extraordinary globalisation, digitalisation and indexation of the City. The City has not been encouraged by successive Governments, and has not itself been investing actively in the productive businesses of this country. We have seen a hollowing out in the City of its commitment to support British industry and British companies, and it is an accelerating model. In every month over the past four years, we have seen a net outflow of investment in UK equities.\nI hugely support the work that the fantastic Parliamentary Secretary, His Majesty's Treasury, the hon. Member for Wycombe (Emma Reynolds) is doing on taking forward our Mansion House reforms. We must better connect our capital in the City of London to our productive innovation economy. I am not for a minute suggesting that everyone’s pension should go into one biotech company—quite the opposite—but if we connect some of that money with our innovation economy, we will unlock tens of billions of private money—our money—to drive growth in this country. At the moment, we incubate world-class businesses and then watch the Australian and Canadian pension funds buy them, or American investors buy them out and float them.\nI worry about today’s inheritance tax and capital gains tax announcements. We will find that the devil is in the detail when we read the Red Book tomorrow. If we kill the engine that drives the people who create the companies of tomorrow, we will end up with a big science investment and not enough actual innovation in the economy.\nTo close, I want speak briefly about the issues in Mid Norfolk. It is a rural, sparse, disconnected place—it is something of a backwater—in the middle of East Anglia with poor traditional access. I am afraid that today’s Budget will hit the two key groups in my constituency. Many pensioners have been hit by the winter fuel changes, and huge damage has been inflicted on the small businesses on the high street, including the hospitality businesses and the pubs. They were looking for relief—not just a penny off beer duty but real relief for businesses out in rural areas. The agricultural property relief hit will damage the rural economy of Mid Norfolk. I hope that when we read the Red Book we will see some better news, but my fear is that we have a change in Government, but all too little change in our economic orthodoxy. Just like a company, this country is running out of cash. We need to unlock much more innovative and enterprising models of economic growth.",

However, improved connectivity must not come at the cost of our rural heritage and way of life, or if it reduces safety.\nThat’s why I helped establish the South of the A47 Taskforce back in 2019 to look at tackling rat-running in the key Corridor between the Wood Lane/Berry’s Lane junction at Honingham and the A11 at Wymondham, and why I welcomed the opportunity to convene the latest meeting yesterday – bringing together Taskforce representatives, NCC officers and NCC councillors and leaders to review progress to date and explore what further actions are required.\nAlthough much progress has been made on the development of a package of mitigation measures aimed at alleviating existing rat-running while also preparing in advance for any likely impacts of the A47 dualling between North Tuddenham and Easton (as well as the Norwich Western Link), I am pleased that all parties yesterday acknowledged that there still remains more work to be done – with some residents (for example, in Carleton Forehoe) concerned that their roads have been missed in the work to date.\nThe commitment of NCC officers to continue working with the parishes involved in the Taskforce was very much appreciated – and the hope is that, by September, the mitigation package will be further advanced, with the Taskforce, NCC team and I able to meet on location to raise awareness of the additional progress made.\nRest assured, this remains a key campaign of mine – and I look forward to offering my continued support to the key stakeholders as we drive this work forward.\nTo learn more about all of my work on this campaign, please visit my website here.",

May I start by thanking the hon. Member for Lowestoft (Jess Asato) for bringing colleagues from both sides of the House together? How we treat our vulnerable children seems to me to be one of those things that goes completely above and beyond party politics; we all see its importance.\nMy family has never experienced this issue—our two young children were very lucky—but, as the Member of Parliament for Mid-Norfolk, I am lucky to have two great special educational needs schools in my constituency. Chapel Green school and Fred Nicholson school are both institutions the community hugely values and supports and is very proud to have. Under the coalition Government, I was very pleased—and rather surprised, I have to say—that I managed to secure £7 million to relocate Chapel Green into a world-class facility.\nOver the past five to 10 years, I have seen a huge rise in demand across rural mid-Norfolk. Data produced by the House of Commons Library shows that 18% of all pupils have serious special educational needs. We are providing support to 1.2 million of those 1.7 million, so half a million children around this country are not getting the support they need. I would suggest that quite a lot of them are in the east and in rural areas because, as one or two colleagues have mentioned, rural areas face a particular challenge.\nEvery day during the election campaign, I did a school gate visit. Every month I do a heads’ forum. Scarning school, Dereham school, Toftwood school and Yaxham school—all my schools—have reported an increasing surge that is causing chaos. Parents are having to stop work, we see hugely difficult legal processes and the EHCP system is broken. When I talk to teachers, they also highlight that in the past few years we have seen a huge surge in demand caused by the pandemic, by rural poverty and the cost of living crisis, which has hit us hard, by diet—I know the Government have made some announcements about children’s diets—and by the wider challenge of mental health.\nI particularly want to highlight the rural aspect. I am sure that, at the heart of it, part of the problem is that the formula does not properly compensate for rural costs, or how the cost of living crisis has particularly hit rural families. The Minister is nodding—I know she understands this—and I ask her to put the needs of rural SEN at the heart of her work.",

The park offers a blend of modern infrastructure, high-tech facilities, and a vibrant business community, making it the perfect environment for innovation and growth.\nWith a range of flexible commercial spaces tailored to meet the needs of various industries.\nI was delighted to meet its CFO to discuss their future plans and how we can work together to achieve:- Norfolk-Cambridge A11 Tech Corridor\n- Business Forum\n- Norfolk Way Enterprise Festival & Awards\n- Stow Bedon re factory farm\nStow Bedon is a new village in the Mid Norfolk constituency as per the boundary changes. Residents requested a meeting with me to tell me of the issues they are living with. Residents described to me that they currently live with a haze of ammonia, a pungent gas by-product of manure and urine, emanating from the farm.

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_nhs-dentists/content_194.html": "I’m delighted that today the new Minister Stephen Kinnock made clear his support for the UEA Norfolk Dental School bid.\nWhen we think of our health, too often, as a society, we neglect to consider the importance of our teeth. Dental health is a crucial part of NHS services and it is vital that EVERYONE can access the support they need.\nHowever, as I am sure many in Mid Norfolk will be unsurprised to hear, access to NHS dentistry (or rather the lack of access) is now the single, most commonly raised issue in my constituency Casework and Correspondence. Whether it be via email, letter, telephone or even at one of my regular Supermarket Surgeries that I hold around the constituency, no other issue is raised as often as this one.\nThat’s why I continue my work to raise the scale of the problem with the NHS, DHSC and relevant Ministers, and to try and find local solutions here in Mid Norfolk.\nOver the last 3 years, I’ve continued to speak with NHS professionals and the teams in local dental practices to understand the causes of the current crisis.\nIt’s clear that a mix of problems have coalesced; principally:\n- Lack of dentists (part of the overall healthcare staffing crisis, as well as many trainees moving overseas to warmer climes and better pay)\n- Problems with the historically low NHS Tariff which means dental surgeries aren’t reimbursed fully for the usual cost of seeing someone\n- A thriving private dental sector with those who can afford it seeing dentistry more like a High Street optician service\n- The cost of living crisis meaning many more people can’t afford to pay for private dental care\n- The pandemic backlog which, despite the tireless efforts of NHS dentists, continues to be a big problem for our local NHS dental sector\nLobbying DHSC / NHS\nSince the current crisis began, I have written regularly and spoken on numerous occasion to Dental Ministers and the Health Secretary to request action on the specific measures that local dental leaders here in Norfolk have flagged would deliver the short term benefits and improvements we desperately need to see, in addition to the more long term reforms needed to properly grasp the problems being faced and ensure they don’t occur again a few years down the line.\nNew Measures announced in ‘Our Plan for Patients’\nI was delighted therefore that the Government listened, publishing and working at pace to enact its ‘Our Plan for Patients’ which:\n- Introduced legislation to amend the NHS Dental Contract and better incentivise dentists through fairer remuneration to do more NHS work (not just private), as well as to take on more difficult cases.\n- Seeks to improve the NHS dental sector’s capacity and resilience by allowing greater flexibility around local commissioning so that dentists can take on more work where they are able to.\n- Allows dental practices to better deploy the skills of hygienists, high skilled practice staff and therapists in a way similar to that in which GP surgeries now deploy nurses – so as to increase capacity for check-ups and basic treatment while freeing up dentists to do more specialist and urgent treatments.\n- Allows dental practices greater freedom to personalise recall periods for patients in order to further free up capacity and allow patients with more urgent needs to be seen more regularly.\nMore information can be found here and here\nThe Government also announced the ‘NHS Long Term Workforce Plan’, which includes a commitment to increasing the number of training places for dental therapy and hygiene professionals across the UK by 28% by 2028/29. See more here\nThis is real progress, but I remain committed to doing all I can to lobby hard for further local support and improvements to help tackle the scale of the problem here in Norfolk.\nI understand that further discussions are taking place between NHS England, the British Dental Association and other stakeholders with a view to reforming the NHS dental contract so that dentists are better incentivised to take on more NHS work. I also understand that the Government is due to publicise more information about additional measures it wants to see taken to improve access to NHS dentistry. Rest assured, I will be monitoring those developments very closely indeed.\nStronger LOCAL INTEGRATION with mainstream NHS\nOver the last 14 years, we have increased NHS spending by c30% - from c30% of all HMG expenditure to >40%.\nFor years, I have made the case that the best way to improve local NHS services is via stronger local integration (see more here).\nThat’s why I welcome the news that commissioning of NHS dentistry moved from NHS England to the Norfolk and Waveney NHS Integrated Care Board (ICB) at the start of April 2023– and am pleased there is broad agreement that this step will allow local NHS providers to better coordinate dental support alongside other related and/or important healthcare provision.\nBack in March 2023, I met NHS England and the ICB and was reassured that they had been working together for a year to best manage the transition of commissioning – with NHS England committed to working closely with the ICB to support their leadership for the foreseeable future.\nMore information can be found here.\nI believe the best people to drive forward progress are the local clinical and care sector leaders and professionals who are working on the frontline – and who have first-hand expertise of the issues being faced.\nI therefore welcomed the ICB’s recent Short Term Plan announcement (see more here) which, having been developed following extensive engagement with local dental providers and stakeholders like Healthwatch, aims to address the most urgent priorities in dental provision and look for quick methods by which the local sector can be stabilised and access to services for patients can be improved, has been developed following\nAlthough it will not solve all of the challenges facing NHS dental provision in our region, the Short Term Plan does intend to deliver tangible short term benefits, while giving the ICB time to develop the Long Term Plan that will ensure Norfolk has the first class dental provision it needs for years to come. I understand they remain on course to publish that longer term strategy by Spring 2024.\nI am determined to do all I can to support the ICB’s efforts and am pleased to see the new powers they inherited in April 2023 being used to put in place locally led plans that will deliver tangible benefits for all of us who rely on local dental services. I continue to actively engage with the ICB and ensure the views of local people are being heard both by them AND ministers and officials in Westminster.\nA Norfolk Dental School to improve levels of local dentists\nWe need to be training more dentists.\nThat’s why I have also been working alongside fellow Norfolk MPs to highlight the importance of securing a new undergraduate training School of Dentistry at the University of East Anglia (UEA).\nFor the past two years, I’ve joined debates in the House of Commons and lobbied ministers and officials to ensure they know it is crucial that the UEA proposals are taken seriously by the Government and supported.\n(See more here, including clips of my specific interventions in the debate)\nWhile the recent announcement of the new Dental Development Centre at UEA is very positive indeed (see more here), it must be the first step towards a full undergraduate training School of Dentistry – one that also enables qualified dentists to specialise in more expert treatments too.\nAs we know, statistically, students that study at the likes of UEA and the University of the Arts are far more likely to settle locally than students elsewhere in the country. I believe we would see the same occurring were a dental school established here and, with a full School of Dentistry, more would be incentivised to stay – no longer needing to move to major cities like London in order to progress their skills.\nI welcomed NHS England’s commitment in Spring 2023 that they would engage proactively with local MPs as we develop the campaign for a new Dental School here in Norfolk, recognising the value such an institution would provide. That work continues with them now. I have also continued to work closely with fellow MPs, NHS officials and Norfolk partners to emphasise the importance of such a school if we are to properly grapple and solve the challenges being faced by our dental sector – most recently in joint-Norfolk MP letters to both the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Chancellor (see more here).\n---\nWhile positive progress has been and continues to be made, there is still much more to be done. I do not shy away from that fact.\nRest assured however, I am determined to do all I can to speak up and work for improvements for all my Mid Norfolk constituents.\nTo stay up to date with my campaign work on this issue, please do check back in regularly to view my my campaign page here – including the webstories below.\nGeorge Freeman secures a Ministerial meeting to discuss the dentistry crisis in Norfolk, where rural public services have been hit hard by the surge in energy costs, and cross-party efforts to push for a new dental training school at the University of East Anglia.\nGeorge Freeman highlights the dentistry crisis in rural Norfolk and, whilst supportive of the dental recovery plan as a long-term solution, calls on the Government to work with the NHS Norfolk and Waveney integrated care board to find a way to get more money to help dentistry in Norfolk now.",

It is imperative that when the Planning Inspectorate consider whether or not to allow these proposals to go ahead, they are aware of all of the facts regarding the plane crash. If there is any chance that hazardous material could be disturbed, putting residents at risk, the application must not be allowed to proceed.\nRest assured, I remain firmly committed to following this situation closely – and to ensuring that the relevant Ministers are also made aware.\nTo read my comments to the EDP, please click here",

With the world needing to double food production in 25 years using the same land but less water and energy, the UK—home to 10 of the top 30 research institutes—could lead this effort. However, he warns that current policies could abruptly shrink the UK market for these innovations, threatening an emerging industry poised to become a global leader.\nGeorge Freeman (Mid Norfolk) (Con)\nI rise as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture, the deputy Chair of the Science, Innovation and Technology Committee, and a former Minister for agritech and UK trade envoy. I am also from a farming family and I have no interests to declare other than a deep interest in my family’s ability to continue farming their farm in Suffolk.\nMost of all, I am the Member of Parliament for Mid Norfolk, a fabulously rural constituency. I do not need to tell the Minister that, because he had the privilege of being the Labour party’s parliamentary candidate there three times. He knows what the House needs to know, which is that it is magnificently rural, with 130 villages and three towns. It is the absolute engine room of food, farming and food processing. From Banham Poultry to Cranswick, right through to the Goat Shed, Rosie and Alex Begg growing blackcurrants for Ribena, Carrick Farms, which supplies all the food to Darbys pub, and Novo Farina developing gluten-free flour, it is an engine of some of the most exciting activities and technologies in UK agriculture. It is that engine because for 50 or 60 years it has enjoyed a relatively stable framework of support. But history shows us, friends and colleagues, that if agriculture does not have that support, it is vulnerable. We had agricultural depressions at the end of the 19th century, in the 1920s and 1930s, and in the 1940s and 1950s.\nWe are at a most extraordinary moment for UK agriculture. We could be incubating a fabulous agritech industry. Across the world, there is a wall of money to invest in agricultural science and research. The world has to double food production in the next 25 years on the same land area, with half as much water and energy. We are home to 10 of the world’s top 30 research institutes—we are an engine room for those technologies. I say to the Minister that current policy will, overnight, massively reduce the market in the UK for those innovations. It will remove a great industry which is beginning to get off its feet and tackle the opportunity it has to be a global engine of innovation.\nIf we are not careful, we will sleepwalk into it, despite the warnings of the pandemic, global supply chain shocks, the Ukraine war and now President Trump’s trade wars, as others have said. In the interests of food security, affordability and sustainability, we need to support our UK agricultural industry and show the world how to deliver more from less. That is why the all-party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture, of which I am chair, has called for a tyre-screeching 180° U-turn to support the sustainable intensification of agricultural productivity. We need to produce more.\nI can tell the Minister that in my beloved constituency, which he knows well, with the impact of the farm tax, the small business attack, the abolition of SFI and the massive subsidies for solar farms, it is beginning to look as though the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, with its 50% increase in housing targets, are trying to get farmers off the land to make way for solar farms and badly designed housing. This is a disaster for one of our most exciting industries—UK agritech—and I beg the Minister to take a stand for it.",

Based on what was said, the discussions were positive, productive and if both parties get their heads together then there is every chance.\nI have arranged another meeting next week, which I again have offered to chair – to see where both parties are at.\nIt is essential that Toftwood and Dereham South have access to a local doctor’s surgery. As the town continues to grow with new housing coming – we need more GP practices – not less. If an agreement cannot be reached – then it will be my focus as your Member of Parliament to ensure that an alternative site is found in the south of the town as soon as possible.\nThank you to all of you who have written to me on this matter – it helps me make the case on your behalf. I have made clear to the ICB that they must listen to all of you who fed into the consultation and who attended the recent events in Toftwood and at Dereham Memorial Hall.\nI hope to update you later next week.",
  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_hsbc-safe-spaces/content_278.html": "Domestic abuse skyrocketed in Norfolk during the Covid lockdowns – affecting men and women alike, and people of all ages. Having seen the effects of domestic abuse in my own family as a youngster, I know first-hand that it doesn’t just scar the immediate victims: it triggers a cycle of downstream PTSD, child trauma and emotional damage for many of their family and friends.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing efforts to speak out against the awful scourge that is domestic violence and abuse in our society, and support local charities and support groups, I am delighted to see HSBC are rolling out their ‘Safe Spaces’ programme at their Wymondham and Dereham branches.\nLaunched by the charity Hestia and its ‘UK SAYS NO MORE campaign’, with support from the People’s Postcard Lottery Recovery Fund, ‘Safe Spaces’ allows men and women suffering from domestic abuse to walk into a HSBC branch and immediately access specialist advice and support. Those in need of help can engage with at least one of over 4,000 HSBC staff trained nationally to assist domestic abuse victims – in a safe space where they can seek the support they need.\nThis is an incredible helpful initiative now operating in Mid Norfolk and I look forward to offering my support and visiting the local branches to learn more.\nTo see more on my work around domestic violence and abuse, please regularly visit my website …",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_a47-rat-running-campaign-and-taskforce/content_19.html": "I have long campaigned for much needed improvements to Norfolk (and the East)’s infrastructure.\nWith the exciting growth of the nearby Norwich Research Park, A11 Tech Corridor and countless businesses (small, medium and large) in our area, I believe that the area between Dereham-Norwich-Wymondham, in particular, has the potential to become the “Norwich Research Triangle” – an area with a bright future based on lots of small start-up companies that creates exciting jobs and opportunities and spreads the prosperity further to the likes of Watton and other “left behind” towns which need a boost. Norfolk in general though has the chance to unlock its full economic potential.\nThat’s why I (along with my fellow parliamentary colleagues, local councils, community groups and the business community) have been so vocal about improving our region’s digital and transport networks. Good connectivity is key if we are to grasp this wonderful opportunity properly and ensure vibrant communities for ourselves and future generations to come.\nWe’ve already made some excellent achievements – the dualling of the A11 and the roll-out of superfast broadband to, now, just over 95% of Norfolk to name just two! However, a big part of this vision going forward is achieving full dualling of the A47, as well as securing the Norwich Western Link (to connect the NDR to the A47 west of Norwich).\nWhile I am pleased that Highways England will finally be getting on with the £300 million A47 improvements between North Tuddenham and Easton that I helped to secure, and am delighted to see Norfolk County Council driving forward positive work on the campaign to deliver the Norwich Western Link, I share the profound local concerns that the delivery of these projects could lead to a surge in rat-running through many of the communities between the proposed Berry’s Lane/Wood Lane junction at Honingham and Wymondham/even further afield (including the likes of Honingham, East Tuddenham, Barnham Broom, Kimberley, Carleton Forehoe, Coston, Welborne, Brandon Parva, Runhall, Wicklewood and Wymondham).\nAlthough these infrastructure improvements will represent massive progress for our area, it is vital that we ensure that a proper strategic plan is put in place to prevent these likely rat-running problems. We cannot sacrifice some of our most picturesque villages to ever more congestion, as well as greater levels of pollution and environmental damage, simply because we have not thought to look at the likely challenges ahead. It’s the quality of life, beautiful landscape and community spirit that makes Norfolk so special!\nBack in October 2019, at the request of a number of local Parish Councils, I attended a public meeting at St Peter’s Church in Kimberley to hear in greater detail their concerns about this potential increase in rat-running through our rural communities. It was decided that a local Taskforce would be created to co-ordinate the villages affected and work with local councillors, county and district officers, Highways England (now National Highways) officials, the A47 Alliance and countryside groups to oversee the development of a proper Plan around the works – aimed at mitigating any likely rat-running and minimising the impact on local communities.\nI was thrilled that, at a meeting in 2020, the Taskforce received confirmation from Norfolk County Council that they were looking to expand their traffic survey work in Mid Norfolk – to better understand the possible traffic impacts both during and after the construction works for both projects.\nSince that meeting in 2020, National Highways have carried out several rounds of public consultation for the North Tuddenham-Easton project, analysing the findings and ensuring they informed the next stages of the process. The local Taskforce encouraged local residents and communities to submit their views both to that consultation and directly to themselves as the Taskforce – then used the feedback obtained to make a formal submission to National Highways on how they would like to see the plans, including the new Wood Lane/Berry’s Lane junction, designed.\nAt various stages, National Highways have shared how their public consultations has been going – highlighting certain alterations that they intended to make to their plans in response to local feedback.\nI welcomed a subsequent commitment by National Highways and Norfolk County Council Highways to develop a proper plan for community engagement – one that would allow them to ensure the views of local people form the basis of the mitigation measures that will be required, and add to the consultation work that will hopefully allow them to get their plans, especially those for the Wood Lane/Berry’s Lane junction, correct. I was delighted to follow the progress of that community engagement plan closely, providing support where necessary and helping to convene additional key stakeholders where required.\nMy team and I have supported the Taskforce, National Highways and Norfolk County Council Highways throughout the process of engaging with local parishes to build a comprehensive picture of the traffic problems they are facing now and how they fear they may get worse in due course – and once the North Tuddenham-Easton stretch and the Norwich Western Link have been built. Once that picture was formed, Norfolk County Council Highways actively worked with those parishes to assess which traffic mitigation methods may be required for the entire area to limit any potential negative impacts that these hugely beneficial infrastructure projects for our region may cause for this localised area. When done, those proposals were included in the next round of public consultation with the hope that they would be broadly accepted and able to move forwards as the works approach.\nMore work lies ahead, but I am firmly commitment to providing my ongoing support to the local communities concerned on this issue.\nIf you have any points you would like to raise, please do send them to me directly and to the A47 Taskforce group at A47taskforce@outlook.com.\nI welcomed the opportunity to convene the latest meeting yesterday of the South of the A47 Taskforce – bringing together Taskforce representatives, NCC officers and NCC councillors and leaders to review progress to date and explore what further actions are required.",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_george-freeman-calls-bold-action-tackle-flooding-challenges-norfolk/content_363.html": "George Freeman raises the increasing problem of flooding in inland Norfolk as a result of climate change, aging infrastructure struggling to cope with modern demands, and the fragmentation of responsibility for water management. He seeks Government support for measures in his Private Member’s Bill which includes clauses on defining responsibilities, funding, liabilities and monitoring.\nGeorge Freeman (Mid Norfolk) (Con)\nIt is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Christopher. I congratulate the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Steff Aquarone) on bringing this debate to the House. It is great to see so many colleagues from all parties. If ever there was an issue that unites us all, it is this. At the beginning of my fifth Parliament, I have never seen so many all-party parliamentary groups set up or seen them so well attended—most struggle to find enough Members to be quorate. I have been to four, each with about 30 people from all parties in the room. I welcome what the Minister has said about properly reviewing and getting to grips with this issue and wish her well. She will find a lot of parliamentary support for bold reforming action, which is long overdue.\nFor me, this began in the inland constituency of Mid Norfolk—the clue is in the name. It has no coast and is largely Breckland; it should be dry. So why am I leading the charge on flooding? It is because in 2020, I and many of my constituents spent the Christmas period using mops and buckets in our houses as great rains swept through. In so many parts of the country, areas that have not traditionally been affected by flooding suddenly are. We set up the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership with 13 villages, and we set up the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance. I pay tribute to Lord Dannatt, who set up the alliance, and Henry Cator, who now runs it very well. We were in the process of convening Norfolk’s first inland flood summit, which was postponed because of the election. It is very important.\nThere are 36 organisations in Norfolk alone tasked with and sharing responsibility for dealing with flooding. None of them are able to take responsibility properly. I will be kind, but the buck gets passed. People have had enough. We need a summit in which we, the representatives of the people of Norfolk, can gather with those agencies and get on top of where the flooding is happening, where it is becoming more intense, what is being done about it and prioritised for our county, and the short, medium and long-term plan.\nI have prepared a private Member’s Bill to support the Minister; I will be introducing it shortly and I hope it will contribute to the reforms that she is considering. I hope it will be good enough that she decides to incorporate it into her reforms. I will speak in a moment about what that Bill sets out to do but, as with so many public policy problems, it is worth being clear about what the problem is and what is causing it.\nFirst, I want to suggest climate change. Earlier this year, we had the wettest seven months on record, and we have had the wettest past few years on record. That is what is driving the problem.\nSecondly, in my part of the world, that problem is compounded by a huge amount of housing. The boundaries changed because about 10,000 extra houses have been built in Mid Norfolk in the past 14 years. Many of them are built on the outskirts of villages, without proper drainage infrastructure, which has meant plugging modern drains into Victorian village drain infrastructure. When there is intense rain, it all merges and sewage starts rising through people’s gardens and lavatories.\nThirdly, I mention riparian rights: we have seen huge confusion about who is actually responsible for maintaining ditches. Fourthly, there is contract farming, or an increase in outsourcing farming to contractors. In the old days on our family farm, in quiet months we would clear the ditches and mend the fences. These days, that kind of stuff is not always in the contract. Ditches are being neglected because of the reality of modern contract farming.\nFifthly, Anglian Water has been focusing—and I will be kind—on supplying water to the east and on mitigating leakage. It is investing billions. Ten years ago, the problem was loss of water, and that is still the case in the summer months. However, in winter, we have a massive problem. We need to make sure that our water companies are investing in the problem in the latter half of the year, as well as dealing with the shortages in the summer. Of course, catchment geography, habitat, and water maintenance and retention link those two issues.\nSixthly, there is huge confusion about responsibilities. Nationally, the responsibility sits with the Environment Agency, and I think its budget is just over £2 billion a year. However, try ringing the Environment Agency about a problem in Norfolk—or, I dare say, in Suffolk; it is lovely to see the hon. Member for Lowestoft (Jess Asato) sneaking into a Norfolk debate to support us. I am talking about organisational responsibility at the top, in an agency that has many other responsibilities, some of which directly go against the interests of getting water off the land and down rivers fast. I am also talking about the situation on the ground. Responsibility for dealing with, mitigating and handling flooding is unfunded, so the local flood authority really has no budget in Norfolk. It has a few powers, which it cannot enforce, and no budget to do it properly.\nSeventhly, the real heroes of flood management in this country are the internal drainage boards, who—as you will know, Sir Christopher—have been successfully doing proper local watercourse management since about the 15th century. They have seen their powers reduced and their funding removed. As is so often the way in modern Governments, powers go upstream, to higher and higher levels, with less and less real, practical support on the ground. Those 15 or 16 areas—district councils that are most on the frontline of flooding—are now having massively to support internal drainage board infrastructure investments. We are charging taxpayers hugely in the high flood areas to pay for infrastructure that we are all funding. An Association of District Councils special interest group has been set up to tackle that, and it is helping me with my Bill.\nEighthly, the IDBs are funded by precepts, which is not appropriate for the scale of infrastructure that we need today. Ninthly, there is a huge lack of proper monitoring: one of the things that we will find at the first Norfolk flood summit is that we do not have a map—or certainly no live digital map. Where are the flood hotspots in our county? We are not properly capturing the data, which means that the Minister will not have proper data to support her policy making and the Cabinet Office resilience unit does not have proper data on where that growing inland flood risk is.\nThere is then flooding on the ground, as we had last year; I will cite one example, at Mill lane in Attleborough. Four people who live next to a culvert have been flooded every year for the past 10 years, and their lives are misery. Last year, for the first time, 100 other houses were flooded because the culvert has been allowed to silt up gradually. Anglian Water handed over its riparian rights when no one was looking about 12 or 15 years ago, and no one was aware that those rights now sat locally in the town. The land-use practice upstream meant that the water was not being captured properly on the farm, and with a whole lot of new housing and climate change, there was then a big problem. It has taken a huge amount of work to set up the local Mill lane flood prevention group, and the community has cleaned out the ditches and dredged the river, with 70 tonnes of stuff taken out. It has been a huge project, for which I pay tribute to the local councillor, Taila Taylor, and others.\nWe cannot afford to do that in every single place around the country; far better to invest in prevention in the first place. Of course, people who have suffered flooding then hit the next problems: how do they insure their houses? How will we compensate people who cannot sell their houses? How will we ensure that, as others have said, the Flood Re scheme is fit for purpose? This is a huge issue and I know the Minister has gripped it. My Bill sets out four main clauses and four main reforms—I believe I have sent the Minister an early draft, but I will send her a better one. I thank all those colleagues who are helping with it.\nClause 1 sets out responsibilities and makes clear that we need to cascade them down to the ground, as well as making it clearer who is actually responsible for prevention and mitigation. Clause 2 looks at funding and says that some of that £2 billion-odd with the Environment Agency has to cascade down, and we have to support the IDBs and the local flood authorities properly. Controversially, clause 3 looks at liabilities. I want to suggest that, when house builders dump large quantities of housing on the outskirts of villages, it is not good enough just to pipe the drains into the old Victorian architecture. They have to upgrade it, and I think the only way they will do so is if they are on the hook for any downstream flooding that might occur. Clause 4 looks at data monitoring and accountability.\nI close by sincerely welcoming the Minister’s very quickly committing to reviewing this issue properly. As well as listening to her officials, who I know will have 101 reasons to take it gently and to be cautious and steady, I urge the Minister to listen to colleagues across this House. I think she will be a hero—there will be culverts named after her for decades to come. I hesitate to suggest this, but it will be one of the biggest issues of this Parliament for our constituents, and the Minister has the chance to grip it right at the beginning and put right something that has been neglected for several decades.",

Only with full dualling of the entire A47 will we be able to unlock Norfolk (and the East)’s full economic potential – and make the most improvement to safety along the route.\nThat’s why I welcomed the latest A47 Alliance summit update this past Friday and remain a vocal advocate of getting on and delivering these vital works.\nHaving publicly called for Dr Andrew Boswell to end his constant blocking of the improvement works already committed (see here), I continue to work hard with the Alliance, my fellow Eastern MPs and other key stakeholders to make the case for further, and full, A47 dualling and improvements.\nOf course, we cannot go on covering our country in commuter housing estates and continuing to build new roads anywhere. However, the A47 has been a vital, blocked artery across our county for decades – lethal in so many places and stifling Norfolk’s economic potential.\nThere is nothing “green” about the flooding, pollution, congestion and deadly accidents that the A47 in its current form entails.\nWe must get on and deliver improvements.\nRest assured, I am committed to doing everything I can on this.\nTo find out more about my work ‘Making Our Roads Fit for the 21st Century’, please visit my campaign page here",

Rarely, if ever, have they complained of the greater financial constraints within which they have had to operate during this time.\nHowever, this patience and understanding can only go on for so long – and it has become increasingly clear that the funding pressures our rural schools have been facing has been ever more challenging (particularly in the field of SEND provision).\nIt is for this reason that I have written to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Rt Hon Elizabeth Truss MP, ahead of the Comprehensive Spending Review to strongly urge that additional funding is made available for our rural schools – on the basis of the abundance of feedback I have received during my many visits to local schools, and to a letter that I recently wrote to every Headteacher in Mid Norfolk to invite their views.\nHaving raised this issue in the House in recent months, and actively lobbied Ministers and their civil servants, I am committed to continuing my pursuit of this matter going forward.\nAs a country, we must do more to ensure that every pupil gets the education they deserve so that they can unlock their full potential – for the betterment of themselves, but also our county and country as wholes.\nI look forward to providing further updates in due course – and to read my letter to the Chief Secretary, please see below.",

Not only had this held back businesses and families for too long, it had also proved dangerous for thousands of commuters travelling down unsafe single-carriage roads.\nThat’s why I vowed to get this sorted and was delighted to work alongside my fellow parliamentary colleagues, local councillors, businesses and community groups to secure the dualling of the A11 – a key first step.\nHowever, while the current A11 improvement works close to Wymondham are to be welcomed, I am acutely aware that many local communities are suffering from a spike of “rat-running” by motorists aiming to quickly move around Wymondham to continue their journey, or who instead wish to cut through the Wymondham-Kimberley/Carleton Forehoe-Barnham Broom-Honingham corridor to join the A47.\nHaving previously helped convene the South of the A47 Taskforce with a number of these communities to tackle increased rat-running in recent years (see more here), I am keen to ensure that the good work that has been done with them and the likes of NCC Highways and National Highways (and which is still ongoing) is not undermined.\nThat’s why I have reached out to local councillors to better understand the feedback they are receiving from residents and businesses in their area, and why I have also raised the issue with NCC Highways and National Highways to see what more can be done.\nWhile we’ve seen extensive consideration as to how rat-running can be mitigated during (and after) the upcoming North Tuddenham-Easton A47 dualling works and the NWL extension to the Wood Lane/Berry’s Lane junction at Honingham, we need to ensure that the A11 improvement works, as well as the much bigger Thickthorn Roundabout improvements that are also to come, do not inadvertently exacerbate rat-running anyway – even if only on a temporary basis. I am committed to working with key stakeholders to make sure there is a temporary strategy while these works are being carried out, and a more permanent strategy that mitigates long term rat-running too.\nRest assured, I will continue to actively work on this in the weeks and months ahead.\nTo stay up to date, please keep checking my website for further updates.",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_freeman-leads-fair-rural-funding-campaign-and-writes-chancellor/content_241.html": "In advance of the upcoming Budget, I have re-launched my fairer rural funding campaign which is specifically about the disproportionate energy costs in rural areas – which is driving rural poverty.\nRural areas have always suffered from disproportionately high energy and fuel costs - BUT the sudden energy price inflation caused by Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine has led to a massive increase in energy costs in the last two years which have disproportionately hit rural households, businesses, and public services.\nThe disproportionate exposure of rural areas to high fuel costs is due to a number of key factors which are well chronicled and understood by HMG:\n- Rural homes are more exposed to cold weather & less energy efficient. Many rural properties are off the gas grid and rely on buying one-off tanks of heating fuel.\n- The rurality and scarcity of public transport in rural areas increases rural dependence on cars for transport, and therefore higher exposure to fuel costs for all activities in rural areas.\n- The average wage in rural areas is 7.5% lower than in urban areas - leaving households even more vulnerable to rising fuel costs. In many areas like Mid Norfolk that figure is even lower with pensioners on fixed incomes (with interest rates very low for the past decade) and low-income workers in the public sector and food processing industry now spending a huge % of their income on fuel costs.\nWhat this “triple whammy” means in practice is that the unprecedented surge in energy costs in the last 2 years has caused a cripplingly disproportionate spike in the rural cost of living which is hitting:\n- Rural Public Services - Every unit of public service delivery (whether an ambulance trip or a school bus place or an NHS Community nurse visit) is costing more. Without relief that’s a rural public service tax.\n- Rural Businesses - Every business in rural areas is paying more compared to its urban competitors. Pubs. Cafes. Shops. All are being hit. And with the VAT threshold at £85k it’s driving many small businesses - the backbone of our local rural economy - out of business. All of which will undermine the post-Ukraine post-Pandemic economic recovery.\n- Rural Households - Every household in rural areas is paying this extra - effectively a “rural energy tax” surcharge compared to urban equivalents. This is tipping an increasing number of rural households in low-income areas into fuel poverty, increased benefits and for many a crisis of affordability and homelessness - putting further additional pressure on already stretched local councils.\nThe full extent of the disparity between urban and rural areas is verified by recent Government data which shows that the reduction in fuel bills needed to take rural households out of fuel poverty is £677, c2.5x more than compared to urban households, (which is £265). So, on the Governments own figures the differential impact of fuel costs on low income households in rural areas is c.2.5x or 150% higher.\nThis is effectively a ‘Rural Energy Tax’ - which has been exacerbated by the Ukraine war energy cost spike, crippling the rural economy, rural communities, and public services in rural Mid Norfolk. And many other low-income rural areas.\nAcross rural constituencies we are seeing the effects as rural high streets, pubs and businesses face energy cost inflation and commensurate economic hardship which is crippling the rural economy.\nAction with Communities in Rural England (ACRE) the national charity representing and supporting rural communities, is calling for continued assistance from the public purse to support rural communities by:\n- Targeting support for local households that are not on mains gas by bringing the price of electricity per kWh down to the same as that for mains gas.\n- Supporting households that are not on mains gas to improve the insulation of their property and prioritise these properties.\nI have therefore written to the new Chancellor, along with other MPs who also represent rural constituencies to ask that she considers providing additional targeted one-off assistance for those being hit by this in rural communities as she finalises her Budget proposals.\nWithout some targeted relief, I fear we will see a continuing run of rural bankruptcies, home repossessions, rising benefit claims for low income households, as well as continued pressure on rural schools, GPs, pharmacies, care homes and all other services which are required to operate in the higher cost rural areas and have no way of avoiding cutting local outreach to be able to pay this rural energy tax.\nWithout some one-off help I fear serious long term economic scarring of the private and public sector in rural communities which will cost far more in long term damage than short term relief now.\nTo keep up-to-date with the campaign please visit my website: www.georgefreeman.co.uk.

This situation needs resolving FAST. There cannot be any more delay. Especially when, as part of the Greater Norwich bid to the Government’s Transforming Cities Fund, there is £600,000 committed for such improvement works.\nThat’s why I am working closely with the brilliant team at South Norfolk Council, why I am pressing Network Rail and others hard for an urgent update and why I am prepared to raise this issue with Ministers and convene an urgent meeting if necessary to try and unlock this latest “log-jam”.\nTo see more on my work on this issue, please see below.\nWymondham Station Access Campaign\nWith a proper plan for Wymondham Station, this wonderfully historic site could be transformed into a stunning gateway for tourists and residents, as well as for companies and investors on their way to the nearby Research Park, but who don’t want to travel all the way to Norwich Station and then fight their way through the city’s terrible traffic.\nProper access for ALL to both platforms of Wymondham Station MUST be an early step in that process however and that’s why, back in 2018, I helped re-energise the campaign to finally address the access issues around Platform 2. It is simply unacceptable that, after so many years, platform 2 remains inaccessible for many – particularly the disabled and those in wheelchairs, but also those pushing wheelchairs or even just trying to take a bike.\nThe announcement last year that finally, as part of the successful Greater Norwich bid to the Government’s Transforming Cities Fund, £600,000 had been committed to making Platform 2 step-free was an incredibly positive one. However, I am acutely aware that, just over a year on, many remain anxious for some news about how things are coming along – understandably frustrated that progress continues to be slow.\nThat’s why I have recently spoken to Greater Anglia, who are responsible for Wymondham Station itself, who have reaffirmed their recognition that step-free access to Platform 2 is an urgent priority.

That’s why I joined OffSET MPs in meeting OFGEM today as part of our ongoing campaign.\nCampaign Overview - Background\nAs a long-time advocate of the move towards renewable energy, I am a major supporter of Offshore Wind Energy – and have previously worked with local communities to ensure that the associated onshore infrastructure is located in the right place.\nBetween 2010-2013, I attended a number of public meetings in Little Dunham to listen to local concerns about Dudgeon’s proposals to build a new substation on top of a hill in the village – a location that would have meant it was an eyesore for several other communities in the area. By working tirelessly together, we managed to agree with Dudgeon that the substation would instead be located at a low-lying site in nearby Necton and, therefore, avoided any long term disillusionment with offshore wind energy in the area. (To read more click here, here and here).\nThat’s why, when I became aware back in 2017 that Vattenfall UK were hoping to build the two substations for their proposed Norfolk Vanguard and Norfolk Boreas offshore wind farms in Necton also, I was optimistic about working with them to negotiate a compromise with the community that would see the substations situated in the right place, and in return for substantial community benefits to compensate the local villages for the massive impact and disruption that they would face. (Read more here)\n(From my conversations with residents and councillors in the village, the number one issue that always comes up is the horrendous A47 Necton/Dunham junction and the urgent need for improvements to be made there.

Despite a willingness by the local community to engage in conversations on the appropriate siting of the substations in the village, Vattenfall continued to respond to any such overtures by simply stating that their choice is based on the extensive consultation that has been carried out.\nHaving attended the site myself on several occasions over the past few years (see here), I can firmly understand the widespread confusion as to how Vattenfall have come to the decision to choose this location. Again, it is situated on top of some of the highest land in the area and will see two structures each about the size of Wembley Stadium constructed, if approval is granted by the Secretary of State. This means they would not just be visible to Necton, but five other villages too! It makes no sense!\nCompounded by Vattenfall’s poor response to queries from the public, their decision not to engage at this time with local representatives regarding community benefits (on the basis of Scottish guidance) and their decision to stop attending the meetings I regularly convene with local community representatives, this has created a consensus in Necton and the surrounding villages that Vattenfall have deliberately designed their consultation to be a sham “tick-box” exercise that, while meeting the Planning Inspectorate/Secretary of State’s required standards, manages to largely ignore the opinions of local people.\nVattenfall’s actions made it hard not to believe they felt they could bulldoze through their proposals by exploiting the fact that Nationally Significant Infrastructure bypasses the typical local planning processes.\nThat’s why I continue to actively support the local communities in their opposition to Vattenfall’s proposals in their current form by encouraging them to set up a Taskforce that could liaise with me, and coordinate the efforts of local people.\n(To read more on some of the representations that I have submitted to the Planning Inspectorate, and others, on behalf of the local community, please see links here with regards to their Norfolk Vanguard application: Relevant Representation, Letter to Breckland concerning Plane Crash site, Written Representation, Further Plane Crash concerns, Post-Hearing Submission and Concerns regarding Vattenfall's conduct. Please see links here with regards to their Norfolk Boreas application: Relevant Representation and Written Representation.)\nIt is also why I committed to securing debate in Westminster to highlight the wider policy matter in question.\nUnfortunately, the initial date I had secured for a debate had to be postponed in order so that I could personally voice my concerns with the current proposals being put forward by Vattenfall at the Planning Inspectorate’s Open Floor Hearing in Norwich. (Read more here)\nI was delighted, however, to be able to secure a rearranged date for the debate in March – at which the then Minister of State for Energy and Clean Growth responded to the points being raised. (You can watch the full debate here).\nWith at least another dozen offshore wind farms likely to be built off the Norfolk/Suffolk coastline, the East of England is to become the “epicentre” of this industry in our country and I was pleased the debate received the support of a number of other MP’s from across Norfolk and Suffolk.\nTo bring the electricity produced onshore, National Grid are proposing that each one has its own cabling and its own substation. This is bonkers. It is obvious to just about everyone who has looked at this that there ought to be an Offshore Ring Main with one or two connections onshore to the Grid - paid for by the consortia behind the farms (which are all heavily subsidised by taxpayers).\nI am delighted that the local press has been looking at this idea in further depth. (See here)\nWhilst I support offshore renewable wind energy and recognise the huge boost it will represent to our economy here in the Eastern region, it is vital that the cabling and connectivity infrastructure is properly planned: to maximise efficiency, reduce waste and cost, and to avoid unnecessary landscape, environmental and economic disruption across our county.\nThat’s why I backed a petition that was launched in August 2019 calling for all offshore windfarms to be made to connect to the Grid via an Offshore Ring Main. (To read more and to sign this, a link to the petition can be found here).\nIt’s also why I met with the then Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Affairs, the Rt Hon Andrea Leadsom MP, in the Autumn to make the strong case for an urgent Review of the options for delivery offshore wind infrastructure in the East – particularly the option of an ORM. I was very pleased that she agreed to look at such a Review and subsequently engaged in conversations with the then Energy Minister and now Secretary of State himself, the Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP, too. (To read more about this meeting, please see the EDP coverage here)\nDespite the calling of a General Election and the busy period that followed as the Government secured a Brexit deal and carried out a reshuffle, I have continued to tirelessly drive forward this campaign in Westminster.\nAt the start of March 2020, I convened a meeting in Westminster with fellow Norfolk and Suffolk MPs, as well as representatives from a host of local councils and campaign groups from the East, to re-energise the campaign – asking, again, that Government Ministers prevent the laying of thousands of miles of offshore wind cabling, and the construction of these massive substations across the region, by backing the ORM option.\nIt was agreed that all parties would jointly lobby the then new Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Rt Hon Alok Sharma MP, as well as the Rt Hon Kwasi Kwarteng MP, for a new approach to Grid connection with a view to developing a feasible ORM solution. The MPs present also agreed to raise Parliamentary Questions in the House and secure a Westminster Hall debate. Talks with National Grid, OFGEM and the Crown Estates were arranged too.\nI was delighted, therefore, that in June 2020, the Energy Minister invited Duncan Baker MP, Jerome Mayhew MP and myself to discuss with him this campaign and the issues within it in a Zoom Conference Call with him. The Minister expressed great sympathies with our views and committed to asking OFGEM to undertake on his behalf a full feasibility study into the option of an Offshore Ring Main. That Review was publicly announced (details of which can be found here) and a Report was released – highlighting that offshore wind farms should be integrated, rather than a new connection being created onshore for each one (exactly what those of us campaigning on this issue have been calling for). The report also suggested UK consumers would save 18% or roughly £6 billion too if this integrated approach is adopted – with the East of England benefitting more than any other region: with savings of 30% = £2.3 billion. This was huge news and a massive step forward for our campaign.\nConsultation on the report began soon after its release and my parliamentary colleagues and I lobbied National GridESO and OFGEM (and Government further) to ensure this was completed as swiftly and thoroughly as possible. Having chaired a roundtable in July 2020 to get the official Review underway, the Energy Minister a similar such roundtable in November 2020 with myself, fellow MPs, BEIS officials, National Grid, OFGEM and developers in the sector to go over the consultation feedback. This followed countless other meetings that my parliamentary colleagues and I had with scientists and experts in this field (from the UK and globally) and a formal submission that our core group of MPs made to the Energy Minister – re-emphasising the importance of our campaign and the adoption of an integrated offshore solution.\nIn November 2020, our campaign group secured an Adjournment debate in the House to lobby Government even more. The Energy Minister himself responded and commented: “The argument for some form of offshore network system has been won.” Success!\nWith the argument won, we then undertook to work hard to lobby Government on the urgency of looking at the regulatory change that will be required to bring this offshore solution to fruition. The campaign formally organised itself as the OffSET group and continues to work tirelessly lobbying Secretary of States, Department for Energy Security and Net Zero ministers and officials, as well as other key stakeholders, on the need to press ahead as quickly as possible with the proper strategic offshore wind solution committed to. We have written collectively and engaged in many meetings – also highlighting the need for any solution to be as comprehensive as possible (including as many existing proposed windfarms as possible).\nThis isn’t just about moving the UK away from the current approach that damages so much land and countryside, and brings so much economic and social disruption, it’s also about ensuring the Government can achieve, and exceed, its Net Zero commitments – in fact accelerating the introduction and production of offshore wind energy.\nAs part of OffSET’s work, since 2022, the team has been vocal in raising concerns about National Grid’s East Anglia Green proposals – which would see new, overland pylons constructed from Norwich to Tilbury in order to transport future power generated by offshore wind off the East coast to where it’s most needed. We believe this makes no sense. IF an Offshore Transmission Network IS Government policy, why are National Grid not looking to move this infrastructure offshore and incorporate it into that solution?\nI was delighted therefore to add my name to a letter, support a Westminster Hall debate secured by our OffSET team and have been involved in a number of meetings with the likes of OFGEM, National Grid and National GridESO in order to make precisely those points (and highlight the inadequate consultation process that has been conducted for East Anglia Green). Although East Anglia Green does not directly affect Mid Norfolk, it is a key part of the overall issue and emphasises yet again that we need to accelerate the delivery of an Offshore Transmission Network.\nRest assured, the campaign remains very active and continues to do all it can to deliver the change we need. I am determined to do all I can, alongside parliamentary colleagues, to ensure the East’s voice is being heard – and that the right outcomes are being delivered.\nMeanwhile, here in Mid Norfolk, I continue to work with the local communities that are likely to be most affected in my role as a constituency MP.\nWhen news broke that Vattenfall may be looking at their community benefit fund ‘in the round’ of Norfolk, I responded to local concerns and teamed up with Jerome Mayhew MP and Duncan Baker MP to write to Vattenfall and make that case that, while Norfolk-wide community benefits were definitely positive, those communities that will be most affected by the construction, and then operation, of the proposed substations and associated cable corridors IF they secure permission must the focus of any community benefit – receiving a substantial, and proportionate, amount of the pot.\nAfter a subsequent meeting with the Vattenfall team, we welcomed their agreement that community benefits in the communities that would likely be most affected should be investigated more thoroughly. Vattenfall agreed to the suggestion of Necton Parish Council and I to host a series of workshops as part of a much larger package of engagement with Necton and the surrounding villages in Mid Norfolk. They also confirmed they’d do the same in other parts of Norfolk and are working with parliamentary colleagues to deliver that.\nThe first such workshop took place in Necton in January 2022 and I was delighted to open the event, framing the conversation and emphasising again that Vattenfall cannot just at community benefits “in the round” of Norfolk: the most affected communities must get the most community benefits AND have the biggest say in what form they take.\nSince then, I have continued to emphasise the importance of community benefits for the most affected villages to Vattenfall – both virtually and by attending their drop-in consultation events. I’ve also encouraged local residents and businesses to fully engage with the consultation processes too.\nThere is a long way to go but I look forward to supporting the communities as they do all they can to ensure they are fairly treated and receive their proportionate share of the community benefit fund available\nIf YOU are a local campaigner, or just someone with an interest in this area, please do take the time to get in touch – and please do write to Government to lobby them with your views.\nTogether – we CAN make a difference. We owe it to the generations who will come after us to get this right and leave our county as beautiful as we found it.\nTo be kept informed of this campaign, do check back on the page as it is updated regularly to reflect my ongoing work.\nAs has been widely publicised in recent years, the East is at the forefront of the offshore wind revolution that is already strengthening our UK energy resilience and driving forward the decarbonisation of our energy network.\nYesterday, I sought a briefing from Vattenfall, who confirmed that, while they remain committed to the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone, they are indeed stopping the current development track for the Norfolk Boreas project due to rapidly rising costs since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine last year.\nHave an interest in the Vattenfall onshore substation works at Necton?\nVattenfall will be holding their next Norfolk Zone Community Drop-In at Necton Community Centre on Friday 21st July 2023 between 9am and 8pm to share more information about their construction plans in the village.\nFrom day one, I have always been clear that IF Necton and other affected villages accommodate this Nationally Significant Infrastructure, Vattenfall must provide substantial compensation to them in the form of community benefits.",
  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_offshore-wind-energy-debate-0/content_130.html": "Last month, I was forced to cancel a previous debate I had secured in Parliament on the issue of major energy companies seeking to locate the infrastructure in Norfolk and Suffolk (at landfall, the length of their cabling route and their onshore substation connections to the National Grid) in order to speak at an Open Floor Hearing concerning one of the major offshore wind farm applications already in the pipeline – Vattenfall UK’s Norfolk Vanguard Offshore Windfarm.\nThis week I secured and led a debate in Parliament to highlight the important issues raised by the planned development, at which the Minister gave some important undertakings and received the support of a number of other MP’s from across Norfolk and Suffolk.\nWhile I am a major advocate for offshore renewable energy (and previously helped to negotiate with Dudgeon to move their substation away from the deeply unpopular site on the top of a hill in Little Dunham to a lower lying location that was broadly supported by the public in nearby Necton), it is clear that with at least another 10 offshore wind farm projects on the way we need a proper strategic plan for the necessary infrastructure to connect them all to the National Grid onshore to maximise efficiency, reduce waste and cost, and avoid unnecessary landscape, environmental and economic disruption across our county.\nWe now have two more substations (these are the size of Wembley Stadium!) coming to Necton, with 150km of high voltage cabling being buried in trenches across the county). As before, the developer, in this case Vattenfall, have proposed putting the structures on top of a hill - affecting over 5 villages. Local views aren't being heard and the developer is not prepared to discuss putting the station in low lying land, relying on the special planning rules for nationally significant infrastructure to override local concerns.\nAfter 3 years of working with many villages and Parish Councils, this week I raised the issues in a debate in Parliament. The Minister gave a number of important undertakings - including supporting the call for a proper Offshore Ring Main - and has agreed to meet with me, other MPs, Councillors and organisations concerned at the impact on our countryside and communities and I am now convening an Offshore Energy Connection Plan Alliance (OECPA) to pursue this.\nTo watch the debate in full, this can be viewed below:\nIf you would prefer to read The Hansard text from the debate, you can find this here.\nI am also delighted to support the petition to make offshore windfarms connect to the grid via an Offshore Ring Main. I am firmly committed to continuing the fight for a proper strategic plan both locally and nationally and will work to push this in Parliament. The petition can be viewed and signed here: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/240822\nFor all of those of us that love and appreciate our beautiful landscape here in the East, it is clear that the chaotic “free for all” approach currently being taken cannot be allowed to continue. With proper debate and an overall strategic plan, we can ensure that the huge environmental and planning impacts currently being faced are significantly reduced – all the while delivering the much needed offshore renewable wind energy that our future economy and society will need.\nWe owe it to the generations who will come after us to get this right and leave our county as beautiful as we found it.\nIf you - or anyone you know would like to be kept informed or have any feedback or comments, then please do feel free to share them with me via george.freeman.mp@parliament.uk\nMedia Coverage Following Adjournment Debate:\nMP calls for debate to avoid ‘major environmental impact’ of offshore windfarm projects:\nCommunities left ‘cut out’ by plans for windfarms which include substation the size of Wembley stadium – MP:\nhttps://www.eadt.co.uk/news/george-freeman-in-debate-over-norfolk-and-suffolk-windfarms-1-5932011\nMP's concerns over power cables and substations:\nhttps://www.itv.com/news/anglia/update/2019-03-12/mps-concerns-over-power-cables-and-substations/",

No one should live in fear each time it rains.\nThat’s why I followed progress at today’s latest stakeholder meeting closely – reviewing progress over the past few weeks and continuing to give my firm support to the efforts to install a new trash screen at the Mill Lane culvert, clear the Mill Lane and Norwich Road culverts and implement a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme upstream.\nThe latest key updates are:\n- The specification and costings for the new trash screen have been updated – with the stakeholders keen to ‘greenlight’ progress as soon as possible. Everything remains on track for the removal of the existing trash screen and installation of the new one in the summer (when water flow is low enough for the works to be completed).\n- Conversations around the long term maintenance and ownership of the new trash screen and associated culvert remain ongoing – with Norfolk County Council and the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance working together to try and find a positive resolution. I hope to hear more soon.\n- Culvert clearance work remains a priority, and all parties continue to work together to overcome the logistical complications that have delayed progress to date. I am supporting them with that.\n- Following further site inspections, additional culvert clearance works have been identified as necessary for the culvert going under the A11. I’ve committed to supporting Breckland, NCC and the NSFA as they push National Highways to get on and carry out works this year.\n- Norfolk County Council’s work with local landowners and the Norfolk Rivers Trust to develop plans for a proposed upstream Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme continues. Plans for the “leaky dams” I highlighted in my previous update (see here) are hoped to be ready by the end of the month – with the intention of installing them in the summer. Early funds from the £150,000 secured from the Government’s Natural Flood Management Scheme will likely be put towards the installation of water gauges along the watercourse – which will help shape the larger, longer term Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme that the remainder of the £150,000 will be spent on. I’m assured that work on that longer term scheme remains actively ongoing.\nI will be meeting with the stakeholder group again in the coming weeks. Rest assured, I will keep on this and use all of my power as local MP to speak up for those affected – and to help drive forward progress.\nIn the meantime, I continue to support residents in other parts of the town that have been affected by flooding over recent months – as well as households and businesses more widely across Mid Norfolk. I am in regular contact with stakeholders on their behalf – and continue to drive forward efforts to establish the first annual Norfolk Flood Prevention Summit before the summer.\nIn Westminster, I am finalising the drafting of the Flooding Bill I intend to bring to Parliament progresses.

I have committed to doing all I can to add weight to those efforts.\n- Norfolk County Council are working with local landowners and the Norfolk Rivers Trust as they continue to develop plans for the proposed upstream Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme. As we know, we have secured £150,000 from Government for that work (see here) and, while the full scheme could take some time to develop and implement, positive conversations are ongoing with the aim of introducing earlier measures, such as “leaky dams”, as soon as this summer.\nI will be catching up with the stakeholder group again in a couple of weeks’ time – and joining a subsequent conversation between stakeholders and local councillors. Rest assured, I will keep on this.\nIn the meantime, I continue to work on bringing my Flooding Bill to Parliament – and am also working with NCC and the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance as we look to establish the first annual Norfolk Flood Prevention Summit before the summer.\nTo see full details on my work regarding the Attleborough Flooding, please scroll below.\nTo find out more about my wider Mid Norfolk Flooding campaign, please click here\nUPDATE 26 February 2024\nThe latest serious flooding in Attleborough is a further reminder of the importance of properly tackling the problems in the town.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing work to hold stakeholders to account and help bring about the solutions my constituents desperately need, I was back in Attleborough on Friday to meet with local councillors, as well as representatives of both Norfolk County Council’s Flood and Water Management team and Anglian Water.\nTogether, we visited the New North Road residents flooded last week – before heading over to the Mill Lane culvert to receive an update there too.\nI was delighted to hear therefore that:\n- The Natural Flood Management Fund bid I supported Norfolk County Council with has been successful – securing £150,000 towards work to deliver a proper water storage and flooding mitigation scheme upstream of the Mill Lane culvert.\n- Anglian Water have listened to NCC and I and have appointed a Mid Norfolk Flooding Liaison, who was present at Friday’s meeting and who will be working closely with our communities moving forward.\nTwo very positive steps.\nHowever, there is much more to do. No one should have to live in fear each time it rains.

Deposits of gravel and silt have been found in parts and NCC are pressing ahead with arrangements to have these cleared – with the necessary contractors set to carry out works in early March.\nIn addition to this, I can share news that:\n- I continue to support NCC’s Flood and Water Management team and local councillors as they engage with landowners upstream to explore potential flood prevention and mitigation measures on their land.\n- NCC sent riparian ownership reminder letters to landowners and homeowners along the problem watercourse in mid-January to remind them of their riparian responsibilities and make clear what they must not throw into the stream.\n- NCC are working with the Internal Drainage Board to lobby Network Rail to inspect and, if necessary, clear the culvert they are responsible for downstream under the A11.\n- Stakeholders continue to look at what more can be done to protect the most at risk properties this winter.\nOnce again, I’ve reiterated the importance of looking at the longer term issue of responsibility and maintenance of the culverts and watercourses – and I will be involved in the next Mill Lane culvert stakeholder meeting next week as these vital conversations continue.\nI am also arranging the next wider multi-agency meeting on the Attleborough flooding too.\nRest assured, I will continue to work with local councillors and residents to hold the key stakeholders to account on this to drive forward the solutions Attleborough needs to see.\nTo learn more on the Attleborough Flooding campaign to date, please scroll down and read the updates below.\nTo learn more about my wider ‘Flooding and the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership’ campaign, please click the link here.\nUPDATE 17 January 2024\nStorm Babet flooded over 100 homes in Attleborough back in October and local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been affected) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership and Flooding Campaign work, I continue to take an active role in supporting those affected and holding the key stakeholders to account – both here in Mid Norfolk, but also in Westminster.\nWhile a number of short and medium term measures have already been carried out or are underway (see here), the incredibly high water levels at the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse at the start of the new year, and the serious risk residents are having to take in order to protect their homes, shows more must be done.\nLast week, I convened a multi-agency meeting with representatives from Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council, the local Internal Drainage Board, Anglian Water, Natural England, the Environment Agency – as well as local Town, Parish, District and County Councillors and representatives of local landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse – to emphasise again the importance of tackling these serious issues and explore in greater depth the short, medium and long term work required to significantly reduce future flood risk.\nI drew particular attention to those homeowners most at risk of flooding on Mill Lane – many of whom feel helpless and desperate, believing they have no choice but to seriously risk their own safety to try and keep the trash screen across the Mill Lane culvert clear each time it rains.\nThe key discussion points from the meeting were:\n- A shared acknowledgement that residents are seriously risking their own safety to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear of debris – and of the fact that conditions and circumstances at the culvert can change rapidly during periods of heavy rain.\n- Agreement that the existing Mill Lane culvert trash screen should not be removed until the new replacement has been installed (work currently underway – see here) – as the culvert has a 90 degree bend that, were it to become blocked, would be extremely difficult and costly to clear – and significantly worsen the current flood risk to the area.\n- NCC Flood and Water Management officials met with Anglian Water contractors on-site (the day prior the meeting) to verify the new trash screen designs ahead of pricing the work – with a multi-agency agreement already in place to fund it.\n- The installation of the new trash screen will likely not be possible prior to the summer. This is because the watercourse will need to be de-watered so that a new concrete base can be constructed and the trash screen fitted.\n- Further measures are therefore required in the short term to try and reduce flood risk along the watercourse and at the Mill Lane culvert.\n- NCC are going to work with local landowners and other stakeholders to explore installing an additional, temporary screen somewhere upstream that can catch debris and prevent it becoming a problem in Attleborough itself.\n- The Mill Lane culvert, and others along the watercourse, cannot be expanded – nor the watercourse itself deepened or widened – due to the amount of development and road access around and across it. The enormous cost and disruption, and lack of space, make it impossible.\n- Given concerns over residents and local councillors risking their safety by entering the watercourse to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear, a suggestion was made to appoint a jointly funded contractor to be on 24/7 call out to clear debris and blockages at the culvert trash screen when required. This suggestion was dismissed on the basis that no organisation would allow their staff to entering the water in storm flow conditions (when they would be most needed) – especially if Norfolk Fire and Rescue themselves have said the risk would be too great for even their own teams.\n- A suggestion was made to explore how the watercourse may, long term, be diverted to another course away from the town. Flooding Officers explained this would probably not be possible given local topography.\n- It is therefore not possible to immediately remove all flood risk. Instead, agencies must work with the properties most at risk to do as much as possible to improve their flood resilience.\n- NCC have also submitted a bid to the Natural Flood Management Fund, supported by myself and others, and I am working with them and local landowners upstream to explore how we might deliver a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme that could drastically reduce the long term flood risk to homeowners and businesses in Attleborough (see more here)\n- Everyone affected in the area by flooding in October must formally report their cases via the Norfolk County Council website to enable the Flood Investigations underway to be as accurate as possible – which in turn will strengthen the hand of local stakeholders to lobby for additional funding and support.\n- NCC are to look at monitoring water volumes and storm flows on the watercourse – again to strengthen their hand when lobbying for resources.\n- Local councillors asked what more could be done to improve safety for those homeowners currently taking risks to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear. It was asked if lighting and cameras could be installed.\n- I reiterated my ongoing support for all the efforts to tackle these flooding issues – and highlighted my efforts in Westminster to bring about the national reform needed also (see more here)\nAs is clear, this isn’t an easy fix – with multiple challenges faced. However, I am determined to all I can to support the community.\nThe key focusses/timescales moving forward are:\nShort Term (Now-next few weeks)\n- Doing as much as possible to improve the flood resilience of the most at risk properties\n- Explore what more can be done to improve safety for those putting themselves at risk to keep the Mill Lane culvert trash screen clear\n- Find a suitable location for an additional, temporary screen upstream to collect debris – and explore additional short term measures upstream that can reduce flood risk\nMedium Term (Summer)\n- Replacement of the existing trash screen with a new one that is designed specifically for the challenges being faced.\n- Continue to explore what measures can be introduced to reduce flood risk.\nLonger Term\n- Deliver a Flood Mitigation and Water Storage Scheme upstream that can significantly reduce flood risk\n- Deliver legislative changes and reform in the House to better empower local communities so that they can protect themselves from flooding, while also holding developers to account when new housing exacerbates local problems.\nRest assured, I will keep working tirelessly on this issue.\nTo stay up to date, please visit my flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 4 December 2023\nOver 100 homes in Attleborough were flooded in Storm Babet at the end of October.\nWe cannot allow this to happen again. Local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why earlier today, as part of my ongoing campaign (and having recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership that I established back in early 2021 – see here), I met with Norfolk County Council’s Flood and Water Management team, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance and representatives for some of the landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse.\nIt’s clear that that we need a proper long term strategic plan that addresses problem watercourse pinch points AND looks to better control the flow of water downstream during heavy rainfall events. While some positive progress is already being made at the Mill Lane culvert itself (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), today’s call focused on what can be done further upstream – and I am committed to actively supporting NCC/the NSFA and partners as they work with landowners and other agencies to explore what flood mitigation and water storage scheme measures might work best for Attleborough.\nTo see all of my recent work supporting Attleborough residents, please click here or see below.\nFor full details on all of my flooding campaign work, please visit my website here.\nUDPATE 29 November 2023\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted by recent flooding.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing campaign, I visited Mill Lane with Cllrs Samantha and Taila Taylor this past Friday to see the problem culvert/watercourse first hand and meet with some of the worst affected residents.\nPlease see my video above.\nLocal residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious – and I continue to hold the key stakeholders to account to ensure everything that can be done is indeed being done to provide affected residents with the support they need, as well as to put in place a short, medium and long term plan that looks to try and prevent future such flooding again in future.\nSome positive progress is already being made (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), but there still remains much more to do.\nThat’s why, as highlighted in my recent update here, I recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership to give our communities the strongest possible voice on these issues. Attleborough had strong representation on that call and I am determined to do everything I can, alongside local councillors, to ensure residents like those on Mill Lane and surrounding streets are heard.\nI will be involved in more meetings in the coming days and am also writing to ministers and officials in Westminster to re-emphasise again the need to put greater emphasis on flooding and drainage matters in the planning process – including putting increased responsibility on developers who’s developments subsequently flood and/or impact the existing community.\nTo stay up to date with all my work on these issues, please visit my Flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 3 November 2023\nFurther to my webstory update last week (see here), I can now provide more information on the work being done by multiple parties to address the terrible flooding that has recently affected many households and businesses in Attleborough.\nOn Monday, the Town Council and local district and county councillors held a public meeting in the town for local residents to speak with key stakeholders. The event was well attended and I am pleased to report that stakeholders have been following up on a number of the points and concerns raised – with additional site visits undertaken to the culvert and watercourse on Mill Lane (as well as the culvert in Briar Gardens). Meetings with developers to assess drainage on their building sites have also taken place and I am aware that a series of additional measures, along with further clearing of drains and ditches, are already being implemented – with anecdotal reports of additional blockages being addressed. I will continue to monitor progress closely.\nFurther to the emergency meeting I held last week (see here), an urgent meeting took place on Tuesday between Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council and Anglian Water to discuss in greater depth the specific issues that caused flooding at the Mill Lane culvert and connected watercourse.\nAs many are aware, the culvert and watercourse were divested to riparian ownership many years ago. While that question of who will take on the long term ownership remains (and rest assured that I continue to push very hard on that and have challenged all stakeholders to work collaboratively to develop a proper strategic plan and solution for the issue), I welcome the collective recognition that something needs to be done as soon as possible, with agreement that the inadequate and unsafe trash screen that caused many of the recent problemsneeds to be replaced.\nOn a without prejudice basis (of who will assume long term responsibility for the culvert and watercourse) and as a gesture of goodwill, Anglian Water have agreed to have their contractors assess the trash screen and culvert and work up the design for a much safer, more effective replacement. All stakeholders will then jointly fund the improved screen and Anglian Water will install it.\nIn the meantime (and again on a without prejudice basis and as a gesture of goodwill), Anglian Water will endeavour to send staff every couple of weeks to keep the existing trash screen clear. (Breckland, NCC and Anglian Water are also discussing a longer term plan for removing any debris collected from the culvert and watercourse)\nI would like to reiterate however that I will keep on the critical question of who will assume the long term responsibility and ownership of the culvert and watercourse – and am already liaising with the key stakeholders on the date for a follow-up meeting to discuss that matter further.\nNCC have also confirmed that the gulleys around Mill Lane have been cleared (with additional review taking place of gulleys on surrounding streets) and I understand that an assessment is taking place as to whether the trash screen at the Briar Gardens culvert should be removed.\nA full flood investigation is now being led by NCC in line with their statutory processes. Although their Flood and Water Management team had already been working on proposals to better mitigate flooding in this area (as a result of the December 23rd-24th 2020 flooding event), there is recognition that their Flood Plan for the area, and its associated work, now needs accelerating and upscaling. I have committed to supporting NCC as they seek to secure the additional funding required to implement any recommended measures, as well as to engage with key local landowners.\nI am also in the process of reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I previously established – and will ensure Attleborough is represented in those vital conversations.\nRest assured, I am determined to do everything I can to speak up for those affected in Attleborough, as well as those across Mid Norfolk.\nUPDATE 25 October 2023\nStorm Babet has reminded us again why we must continue to take flooding seriously.\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted, with severe flooding on Mill Lane, Norwich Road, Ferguson Way and other nearby streets. For some, it was the fourth time they had been flooded in 30 years – and the second time in just under three years. I appreciate, and share, the immense anger and frustration felt by those that have been forced to leave their homes as a result of the damage suffered this past weekend.\nThat’s why I held an emergency meeting today with Norfolk County Council and their Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Anglian Water and Breckland District Council to get to the bottom of what is causing the flooding at the watercourse and culvert on Mill Lane, as well as ensure that those with statutory flooding responsibilities come together and develop an urgent action plan.\nWhile NCC began working on proposals to address flooding at this location in light of the December 2020 flooding, Storm Babet has brought into sharper focus the need to upscale and accelerate those proposals, and address other issues such as questions around which authority is responsible for the culvert and watercourse and therefore who should be maintaining them.\nI had made clear that there needs to be:\n- A proper plan for ensuring affected residents (and the wider community) are protected from further flooding this winter.\n- An acceleration and upscaling of efforts to put in place a long term solution.\n- A proper plan for who is going to be responsible for this culvert and watercourse in due course.\n- Agreement on who is going to keep the culvert and watercourse clear NOW – while the longer term plan is being developed and implemented.\nI am in close contact with local district councillors and a number of those worst affected by the flooding and am determined to help them work with key stakeholders to develop a solution.\nWe must see action. This must not be allowed to happen again. And residents should not be risking their own safety to try and keep this culvert clear during storms and heavy rainfall.\nMore widely, I will be reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I established as a result of the Winter 2020/21 flooding to help support those affected by Storm Babet and ensure our communities have the strongest possible voice heading into this autumn/winter.\nRest assured, I will continue to support councillors and residents in the days, weeks and months ahead.\nTo see my Flooding Update earlier this week, please click here\nTo find out more about my historic campaign work on flooding, please visit my campaign page here",

MPs are there to help only with those matters for which Parliament or central government is responsible.\nFor many matters, (for example if it is connected with local planning, the day to day running of schools, refuse collection, housing repairs, anti-social behaviour or public lavatories) the appropriate first step is to contact your local councillor.\nServices in Norfolk are divided between Norfolk County Council and the local District Councils: Breckland District Council and South Norfolk District Council. The County Council manages services including schools, social services, strategic planning matters, highways, refuse and waste disposal sites, museums and libraries. The District Councils manage services including town planning, environmental health, housing, benefits, council tax collection, refuse collection and leisure facilities.\nYou can find the contact details for your local councillor at Norfolk County Council by clicking here.\nYou can find the contact details of your local councillor at Breckland District Council by clicking here or South Norfolk District Council here.\nAn MP is unable to settle private disputes with neighbours or employers, nor can he help in family arguments or commercial disputes.

Your MP can help you with all matters for which Parliament or central government is responsible, such as:\n- Tax problems involving the HM Revenue and Customs Department.\n- Problems dealt with by the Department for Work and Pensions such as benefits, pensions and National Insurance.\n- Problems dealt with by the Home Office, such as immigration.\n- Problems dealt with by the Department of Health, such as hospitals and the National Health Service (NHS).\n- Problems dealt with by the Department for Education, such as school closures and grants.\nHow does my MP deal with my problem? Ways George could deal with problems of his constituents would be:\n- A letter to the relevant department or official.\n- A letter to the Minister involved.\n- Attempt to ascertain the reason behind decisions.\n- Appeal on behalf of an indivdual or community.\n- Speak to relevant autorites on your behalf.\nMany problems (but not all) can be solved in this way. The Minister may not be able to give the answer you want to hear but if the decision has been made in the correct way there may be little that he can do. If you feel there has been unnecessary delay or maladministration George may be able to take your case to the Parliamentary Ombudsman. The Ombudsman can only be approached through George; you cannot approach that office directly.

Not only are they vital for our local economy, they do so much great work in their communities and help generate the famous rural community spirit that our beautiful part of the world is renowned for.\nThat’s why, throughout my time as the local MP, I have actively promoted and visited dozens of our rural pubs – the Beeston Ploughshare, The White Swan at Gressenhall, Darby’s in Swanton Morley, The Crown at Great Ellingham, The Railway Tavern at Dereham and The Lodge at North Tuddenham to name just a few. We are blessed that Mid Norfolk is home to some of our county’s finest establishments!\nHowever, as a former Business Minister and small business owner myself, I know how tough it can be for those running our local pubs. Like so many businesses in recent times, our rural pubs have faced the perfect storm of increased energy prices and the cost of living crisis, which have meant far higher operating costs and much more limited disposable income for the customers that frequent them. Compounded by the impacts of the pandemic beforehand, the pub sector is going through a very hard time.\nThat’s why, whenever I can, I seek to promote this wonderful sector – and why I frequently speak out in support of our town and village pubs in Westminster.\nRural communities depend on active community services to stay thriving and vibrant.

Only with full dualling of the entire A47 will we be able to unlock Norfolk (and the East)’s full economic potential – and make the most improvement to safety along the route.\nThat’s why I have co-signed a joint-MP letter to the Roads Minister Guy Opperman – making clear our support for the Alliance and Norfolk County Council’s proposals for a joint-study with National Highways that specifically looks at the challenges and opportunities the A47 presents to our Norfolk businesses and communities, as well as to outside investment, so that we can strengthen the Business Case for delivering full dualling.\nSee our letter below.\nI am determined to do all I can to help our region get the investment it needs to improve this key road and unlock enormous growth that will fuel new jobs and opportunities, and investment, in our local communities.\nThat’s why I’m also going further and writing to the Roads Minister myself to invite him to Norfolk to see the route himself and meet with local leaders – and why I’m working with the A47 Alliance and Norfolk County Council as we look to take a delegation of stakeholders to Westminster to lobby for further support.\nRest assured, I will keep on this.\nTo find out more, please see the EDP article here\nTo stay up to date with all my work on this issue, please visit my ‘Making Our Roads Fit for the 21st Century’ campaign page here.",

The pressures brought on by increased energy prices and the cost of living crisis have made operating costs far higher and limited the amount of disposable income customers are able to spend – reducing profit margins and, sadly, forcing a number of our local rural pubs to close.\nIn recent weeks, I have been made aware of the closure of The Green Dragon in Wymondham, Darby’s in Swanton Morley and the Windmill Inn at Necton.

Does she agree that, if we are to tackle the causes, we need better data? We need to understand what is driving this epidemic. I particularly want to draw attention to the children of alcoholics and the great work done by the National Association for Children of Alcoholics; the children of divorce and conflict; and those children badly affected during the pandemic. Does the hon. Member agree that we need better data to understand the causes, then we can start to prevent it, as well as, importantly, treating it when it occurs.

Lady has talked about, but I was taken out of the arms of my father by the police at 11 months, and I was a child carer of an alcoholic parent. Poverty has a part to play, but does the hon. Lady agree that we need to make sure we frame this in the context of the real causes, some of which are not related to poverty but to other chronic problems, such as alcohol, addiction or domestic violence? If we view the matter simply through the prism of a poverty attack, we are in danger of missing out some of the causes that are really embedded in repeated patterns of trauma within families.\nWera Hobhouse (Bath) (LD)\nFirst of all, it is brave that the hon. Gentleman is sharing his experiences of trauma. I think we need more people to do that. He is also absolutely right that not all of this is directly linked to poverty. Poverty or extreme poverty is one ACE among many others, and these things can happen in any family. Those who are doing research into ACEs would always recognise that trauma is not just suffered in a particular type of household but across socioeconomic backgrounds. The hon.

They are indiscriminate and can affect anyone at any age – with 16,000 people diagnosed every year.\nFinding a cure has long been a cause which I have supported – even more so since the passing of my childhood friend, Charlie, a few years ago. Charlie was still in the prime of his life at age 50. In Charlie’s memory, in that of distinguished former member of the House Baroness Tessa Jowell, and so many others, I actively campaign to help raise awareness and support the ongoing research efforts aimed at finally ridding our world of this terrible illness.\nThat’s why, when I was previously Minister of Life Sciences, I surprised my officials and announced the establishment of a Taskforce to look into brain tumour research – bringing together clinicians, charities, patients, carers and officials. Within eighteen months, the then Secretary of State had announced a further £45 million worth of funding for the cause and, while great strides forward have been made, there is still much more to do.\nThrough reforms like the Accelerated Access Reform I led with the then Secretary of State back in 2016, I believe we can develop a model in this country that enables the NHS to accelerate ground-breaking treatments and innovations for a variety of illnesses, including brain tumours. For example, by encouraging patients to share genomics and tissue data to drive research. I am committed to doing all I can to nurture that climate.\nMore generally, I support Brain Tumour Research’s national day for raising awareness, “Wear A Hat Day”, each year and recently met with my constituent Stuart Grant, himself having been diagnosed with a brain tumour, to support him on his 10,000 Steps per day challenge to raise funds for the charity’s work. I’ve also visited laboratories pioneering world leading research into this disease, such as the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at Queen Mary University of London in 2018, and, as highlighted during my recent visits to Switzerland and Israel, I believe that we’ll be able to turbo-charge science and research in this country, including efforts to find effective cures for brain tumours, by strengthening the connection between the best laboratories here in the UK and internationally.\nNow, as Minister for Science, Research and Innovation, I am determined to do all I can within my remit to support fellow Ministers at DHSC and ensure that researchers are supported in their quest to accelerate and deepen their understanding of cancers in the brain too, and I look forward to continuing all of my efforts in the months and years to come in order to help develop effective cures for this indiscriminate disease.\nPlease do check back on this page for updates on my work on this campaign.\nYou can also learn more on the Brain Tumour Research Website here: https://www.braintumourresearch.org",

This is no ordinary ‘sub-station’. Warwick Energy are proposing to build a facility larger than two Wembley Stadiums. To place it on high ground, 170metres from a village, when you’ve got a huge area to choose from looks like a lazy, lowest cost proposal with little sensitivity to the area or community. There must be alternative sites with less impact, and if they cost a little more and eat into the developer’s profits, so be it.\n“I hope and trust Breckland DC Planning Control will insist this is looked at again.\n“This is a perfect example of why we need a planning system which starts with a vision for Norfolk. People are rightly fed up with proposed developments like this which appear out of the blue, with little or no sensitivity to the local community, in order to suit some Whitehall target or make a quick buck for a developer, with little compensation or benefit for the local community. Our infrastructure is too important to be planned this way.”\nKeith Simpson MP and George Freeman recently met with the developers in the House of Commons, and have subsequently received briefing packs from the developers. Mr. Simpson has subsequently confirmed that he is yet to be convinced by the case. George Freeman said:\n“Warwick Energy is a business specializing in preparing these sorts of bids professionally – making it almost impossible for a village of volunteers to compete with the money that has obviously been spent on the application.\n“The Lt Dunham Campaign has set out some very detailed and sensible concerns and all we can do is hope that Breckland Council will do their job thoroughly and take the local objections seriously.”\nThe rally will be on Saturday 27th March at 1.30pm on the village recreation ground.

Not only had this held back businesses and families for too long, it had also proved dangerous for thousands of commuters travelling down unsafe single-carriage roads.\nThat’s why I vowed to get this sorted and was delighted to work alongside my fellow parliamentary colleagues, local councillors, businesses and community groups to secure the dualling of the A11 – a key first step.\nWhile the current A11 improvement works close to Wymondham are to be welcomed, I am acutely aware that many local communities are suffering from a spike of “rat-running” by motorists aiming to quickly move around Wymondham to continue their journey, or who instead wish to cut through the Wymondham-Kimberley/Carleton Forehoe-Barnham Broom-Honingham corridor to join the A47.\nI raised this issue with National Highways and Norfolk County Council Highways back in the autumn – and welcomed their acknowledgement of the problems being faced, as well as their commitment to go away and work together to explore what more they could do to mitigate rat-running during these improvement works and improve signage. However, from conversations with local councillors and constituents, I am aware that the issues have arisen once again since the Christmas period.\nThis week, I have been in touch with both National Highways and Norfolk County Council Highways again – and I am now awaiting a further update as to what they plan to do.\nRest assured, I will continue to do all I can to speak up for our Mid Norfolk communities.\nTo learn more about my work on this issue, as well as on rat-running more generally (including my work with the South of the A47 Taskforce I set up), please visit my website here.",

Not only are they vital for our local economy, they do so much great work in their communities and help generate the famous rural community spirit that our beautiful part of the world is renowned for.\nThat’s why, throughout my time as the local MP, I have actively promoted and visited dozens of our rural pubs – the Beeston Ploughshare, The White Swan at Gressenhall, Darby’s in Swanton Morley, The Crown at Great Ellingham, The Railway Tavern at Dereham and The Lodge at North Tuddenham to name just a few. We are blessed that Mid Norfolk is home to some of our county’s finest establishments!\nHowever, as a former Business Minister and small business owner myself, I know how tough it can be for those running our local pubs. Like so many businesses in recent times, our rural pubs have faced the perfect storm of increased energy prices and the cost of living crisis, which have meant far higher operating costs and much more limited disposable income for the customers that frequent them. Compounded by the impacts of the pandemic beforehand, the pub sector is going through a very hard time.\nThat’s why, whenever I can, I seek to promote this wonderful sector – and why I frequently speak out in support of our town and village pubs in Westminster.\nRural communities depend on active community services to stay thriving and vibrant. Pubs are a vital part of that.\nTo learn more of my work supporting this crucial sector over the years, please see the webstories below and my Facebook page here.",

I also helped Chapel Green School move from their old, cramped, unfit for purpose site in Attleborough and into their brand new, state-of-the-art facility at Old Buckenham, and I am now supporting Jane Hayman and the wonderful team at Fred Nicholson School in Dereham as they look to find a long term solution to their deteriorating current site – whether that be a new school being built on the existing site or a move to a brand new, state-of-the-art facility of their own nearby.\nDetails on all this work can be found in the webstories below.\nTo stay up to date with all of work in this area, please do check regularly back here.\nI spoke yesterday in a Westminster Hall debate on SEND provision in the East of England, highlighting the impact of the recent surge in demand which is overwhelming schools in mid-Norfolk and the need for the funding formula to properly account for rural costs.\nGeorge Freeman speaks in a debate on SEND provision in the East of England, highlighting the impact of the recent surge in demand which is overwhelming schools in mid-Norfolk and the need for the funding formula to properly account for rural costs.\nGeorge Freeman calls on the Government to support early years education in the Budget, in particular he highlights the need to better integrate mental health support, learning difficulty support and social care support into just one network of support.",

Only 20% of those diagnosed survive beyond five years compared with an average of 50% across all cancers. Brain tumours are indiscriminate and can affect anyone at any age – killing more people under the age of 40 than any other cancer.\nA couple of years ago, I lost a close childhood friend, Charlie, to a brain tumour – he was aged just 50 and in the prime of his life.\nSo many others have similar stories – that’s why I’ve donned my cap again on Brain Tumour Research’s ‘Wear A Hat Day’, thinking this year in particular of my constituent Stuart Grant who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2019 and has recently walked 10,000 steps a day in February to fundraise for Brain Tumour Research.\nI was very proud to secure £30m for brain tumour research when I was Minister for Life Science. Now as Minister for Science, Research & Innovation it’s wonderful to see how much great work is being done with this funding at the Centres of Excellence at Plymouth, QMUL, Imperial and Portsmouth Universities and by so many great patients and volunteers.\nFor Charlie, and the thousands of others who have lost their lives or been affected by brain tumours:",

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_wymondham-station-access-campaign/content_73.html": "I was very concerned to hear reports yesterday of an FOI request made to Network Rail which suggested that the sidings beside Platform 2 of Wymondham Station had been signed out of use back in 2020 due to them requiring “a large amount of work (beyond maintenance) to get [them] back in order.”\nWith a proper plan for Wymondham Station, this wonderfully historic site could be transformed into a stunning ‘gateway’ for tourists and residents, as well as for companies and investors on their way to the nearby Research Park, but who don’t want to travel all the way to Norwich Station and then fight their way through the city’s terrible traffic.\nProper access for ALL to both platforms of Wymondham Station MUST be an early step in that process however and that’s why I have taken the lack of step-free access to Platform 2 so seriously, sharing the widespread local anger and frustration that, after so many years, it remains inaccessible to so many.\nBack in 2018, tired of the endless delays and “obstacles” that had prevented progress being made by the key stakeholders despite previous site visits and summits that I had convened, I re-energised the campaign once again, reconvening the Taskforce I had previously established and securing universal agreement amongst the key stakeholders involved (South Norfolk Council, Network Rail, Greater Anglia, Wymondham Town Council and private landowners) that the issue needed resolving as quickly as possible. They all reaffirmed their commitment to working together in order to deliver a solution and, over the next couple of years, significant progress was made:\n- Network Rail agreed to shorten the length of their sidings on the south side of Wymondham Station to make the necessary room for a step-free access solution\n- Both Network Rail and Greater Anglia worked collaboratively to develop initial plans and drawings for a step-free access solution preferred option\n- In 2020, South Norfolk Council, with the vocal support of myself and many others, successfully secured £600,000 as part of the Greater Norwich Transforming Cities Fund towards the step-free improvement works.\nIn 2021, with many increasingly anxious that progress had yet to be made, I spoke again to Greater Anglia (who are responsible for Wymondham Station itself). They reaffirmed that step-free access improvements to Platform 2 remained an urgent priority and explained that they were in the process of completing the necessary delivery studies – with a target date of Spring 2022 set.\nUnfortunately however, just when it appeared that further progress was going to be made, Network Rail had to reject the preferred option for delivering step-free access to Platform 2 – informing the Taskforce that they now needed to retain slightly more of the sidings than had originally been thought. They explained that, while absolutely committed to the improvement works, they also need to ensure they could use their sidings moving forward – so as to be able to keep on top of track maintenance. Other landowners also expressed concern about releasing more land than they would desire – land which might make one of the other options easier to deliver.\nIn autumn 2022, sharing in the growing local frustration that key stakeholders were struggling to overcome the latest obstacles and that Platform 2 still lacked a step-free access solution, South Norfolk Council and I convened another series of (ongoing) summits to “knock heads together” and aim to get momentum moving forward again. As part of that work:\n- South Norfolk Council undertook to speak with the various landowners around Platform 2 to see if a solution can be found that releases more land for a step-free access solution.\n- South Norfolk Council (with the support of myself and other stakeholders) agreed to actively explore a wider regeneration package for the entire station – one that would transform all of the buildings and surrounding land into the proper ‘gateway’ to the town that it has long been envisioned it should be, with 5G community and business spaces, as well as additional public transport. Step-free access to Platform 2 would very much be the first stage of that scheme.\n- I wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport to highlight the importance of the scheme (and the wider regeneration package) to the broader Nor-Cam Innovation Corridor – with Wymondham Station a natural ‘gateway’ to the likes of Hethel and the Norwich Research Park (unlike Norwich Station). I have also emphasised the importance of ensuring the committed £600,000 is not “clawed-back” by Whitehall – with it key to unlocking further investment into the station.\n- Greater Anglia, with Network Rail, have submitted a bid to the Government’s Access for All scheme – with the hope of securing funds for a bridge and lift solution at the station too.\nWhile this is a complex case, it is simply unacceptable that, after so many years, platform 2 remains inaccessible for so many – particularly the disabled and those in wheelchairs, but also those pushing wheelchairs or even just trying to take a bike.\nI share the widespread anger, concern and frustration and remain committed to seeing this one get over the line – as rapidly as possible.\nPlease see the webstories below for more information on the work I am doing to finally get this issue addressed.\nI met again with key stakeholders for progress updates and set the next stage of actions that aim to ensure access improvements are delivered for Platform 2 as quickly as possible – and as stage one of a wider regeneration plan for the entire station site.\nOur local rail network has a vitally important role to play if we are to turbocharge a ‘Rural Renaissance’ of local business and enterprise, as well as spread jobs, opportunities and prosperity to EVERYONE living in our local Mid Norfolk communities.\nI welcomed the opportunity to ask ministers a question at Transport OPQs last week – highlighting the importance of our rural stations as much needed hubs of rural enterprise and regeneration, and specifically the importance of addressing access issues such as those that STILL affect Platform 2 of Wymondham Station.\nWith a proper plan for Wymondham Station, this wonderfully historic site could be transformed into a stunning gateway for tourists and residents, as well as for companies and investors on their way to the nearby Research Park, but who don’t want to travel all the way to Norwich Station and then fight their way through the city’s terrible traffic.",

We absolutely must see an end to these repeated disruptions.\nWhile National Highways have already taken urgent action to improve drainage following my extensive representations to their Regional Director for the East, along with his team, it’s clear more still needs to be done by National Highways to properly grip these issues and prevent them happening again.\nThat’s why, on Wednesday, I am meeting with National Highways in Parliament to raise the matter again. We must see an end to these problems.\nI will also use the opportunity to raise accident blackspots like the A47 Draytonhall Lane Junction once more and call for more safety improvements – in addition to reemphasising the importance of fully dualling the A47 all the way from Lowestoft in the East to the A1 in Cambridgeshire to the West.\nI am determined to speak up for Mid Norfolk on these crucial issues.\nTo find out more on my work to hold stakeholders to account and address the A47 flooding, please see below.\nTo learn more about my work on ‘Making Our Roads Fit For the 21st Century’, please click here.\nUPDATE - 6 January 2024\nThe repeated floodings and delays on the A47 have to stop.\nIt’s the key arterial route on which all of us depend. These constant floods and delays hit local businesses, villages and all of us who rely on this key road.\nFollowing my extensive discussions with National Highways previously, they have taken urgent action to improve drainage (see my past updates below). But it is clearly not enough.\nThat is why I am picking this up with them again today as a matter of urgency to make sure they sort out proper flood prevention.\nWe must also get on with the dualling works as quickly as possible. People have waited over a decade since I got the then Prime Minister to commit to fund the dualling (see here). We now need to get it done with proper drainage infrastructure as part of the county-wide flood prevention works that NCC are leading through their Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance – itself based on the recommendations of the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I established here in our area (see here).\nRest assured, I will keep on this.\nTo see the recent EDP article on this latest flooding, please click here.\nUPDATE - 24 November 2023\nFurther to my previous update last week (see here – and below), I have now received an additional briefing from National Highways with regards to the flooding issues on the A47 at Honingham – which have affected many of my Mid Norfolk constituents.\nWhile heavy, unprecedented rainfall has taken place over recent weeks, the Regional Director for National Highways and his team have again assured me that preventing the repeated flooding issues remains a high priority.\nHaving replaced a damaged surface water drainage pipe following Storms Babet and Ciaran, additional works were then undertaken to clear some nearby trees and a portion of garden wall that were found to be impeding water flow, and causing root damage to the previous pipe. With additional rainfall forecast last weekend, they also had crews standing by to pump any excess water away should there be a build up.\nAs we saw, unfortunately, those crews were required and National Highways have therefore been taking further action – working with nearby landowners to ensure their land is sufficiently worked (ploughed) post-harvest to minimise surface water-run off and reduce the chance of silt build up in the drainage pipes. Silt walls have also been installed to further mitigate silt build up in drainage pipes – with those pipes also being regularly monitored and cleared by NH crews.\nNevertheless, NH continue to follow the weather forecast and have crews monitoring the location closely. They are equipped with pumps should additional flooding occur. NH are prepared to undertake further works if required.\nRest assured, I will keep on this issue – and am due to speak with the NH Regional Director again on Monday. (To stay up to date with all my work on this issue, and my wider flooding campaign, please visit my campaign page here)\nThis issue highlights again the importance of dualling this section of the A47 – which improve the flow of traffic during heavy rainfall and enable a much larger and more effective drainage system to be introduced at this location (and others).

The A47 is a key transport artery and it’s vital that it isn’t closed due to flooding – or subject to severe delays.\nIt’s clear that recent works to repair a damaged pipe that should have taken surface water to the nearby River Tud were insufficient.

Coming from a farming family in a rural village, I know how vital a proper broadband connection is to local businesses and families across our area.\nThat’s why I set up my Digital Divide campaign, Broadband Summits and Norfolk Way project, making sure Norfolk was the first county to get £60m of funding through the Government’s BDUK scheme for broadband investment to tackle this issue.\nWith fast road, rail and broadband connections we can unlock what I have called a ‘Rural Renaissance’ in our area, with proper digital infrastructure allowing businesses to set up in our villages and towns creating new high-skilled jobs and opportunities.\nWhilst the £60m funding and progress in Norfolk is good news, too many rural areas are still not clear when or if they will be connected. Together with other Norfolk MPs, local businesses and councillors, I will go on making sure we continue tackling the remaining not-spots in our area, and make sure every business and family in Mid Norfolk has the high-speed connection they need.\nIf you would like to find out more about my work on this campaign, follow me on Twitter or sign up to my email updates.\nNorwich is the only UK county – and Norwich the largest UK city - not connected to the motorway and dual carriageway network. Nobody wants to flood Norfolk with London overflow and house-dumping, but neither can we be allowed to become a rural backwater. In order to develop our local economy and promote local busineses and opportunities for the next generation we need to be connected to the rest of the world, and alongside broadband, rail and our local airport, the A11 is key to that. Between Fiveways and Thetford, the A11 is a single-carriageway causing long delays with vehicles stuck in queues, polluting the environment. It is a notorious accident blackspot because it is so difficult to overtake, and yet the road is used by both fast moving trunk road traffic and slower moving agricultural traffic. In 2008, a petition to dual the A11 received 16,000 signatures.\nThat’s why I campaigned for funding to dual the A11. Despite the project being shelved many times over the past decades, I know that dualling the A11 is right for Norfolk and along with other Norfolk and Suffolk MPs, I was delighted to campaign for it.\nIn October 2010, the Department of Transport confirmed that the A11 would be dualled between Fiveways and Thetford. Once the work is completed, Norwich will be connected to the motorway and dual carriageway network: this is the new infrastructure we need to unlock new growth in Norfolk and bring our historic county into the 21st Century.\nTo keep up to date with this and my other campaigns, follow me on Twitter and Facebook or sign up to my email updates.\nCampaign News\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-17480495\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-11585709\nBetter broadband is crucial to Norfolk’s development. Far too many homes and commercial properties are stuck without basic broadband. This is bad for businesses, families, public services for the vulnerable like telemedicine, and many aspects of rural life. Improving Norfolk’s broadband would mean more profitable start-up businesses such as Liftshare (https://www.liftshare.com/uk), an award-winning Attleborough-based business started by one person on a farm with an internet connection. It would mean opening doors for people who can’t easily travel, and providing new opportunities. Better broadband makes it easier to work, shop, learn and keep in touch.\nThat’s why I’ve been campaigning for better broadband in Norfolk. I successfully campaigned in 2010 and 2011 in support of NCC and other MPs for a £15 million grant from Broadband Delivery UK, which was matched by Norfolk County Council. Now I’m supporting the “Say Yes to Better Broadband” campaign including a petition to encourage private sector investment and I am campaigning to ensure that, as the new broadband network is planned, the hidden, rural areas of Norfolk are not forgotten.\nNorfolk County Council recently announced BT has been awarded the £30m contract to upgrade Norfolk’s broadband. I will be following BT’s progress on this important roll out to ensure that broadband is delivered as fast as possible particularly to rural black spots around Norfolk.\nI am also keen to see the wide roll out of another innovative solution that is bringing broadband access to rural villages. WiSpire is a joint venture between the Diocese of Norwich and a company called FreeClix. For only around £2000 they can put transmitters and receivers on top of Norfolk churches and use them to send out broadband signals across the county. Each transmitter can deliver up to 8mbps of high speed wireless broadband internet access to local businesses, schools and residents in areas where speed is currently poor.\nIt’s ideal for small rural Norfolk villages – all they need is a church with a tower or spire and at least 25 households who don’t want to wait for the roll out of faster broadband access to reach them. I am urging villagers in my Mid Norfolk constituency to get in touch with me to see if they too can benefit from WiSpire.\nTo keep up to date with my broadband campaign work, follow me on Twitter and Facebook or sign up to my email updates.\nCampaign News\nhttp://www.norfolk.gov.uk/News/NCC111681\nhttp://sayyestobroadband.co.uk/latest-news.aspx\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-14794062\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-13575002\nNORFOLK’S INNOVATION ECONOMY\nHaving had a 15 years career before I became a Member of Parliament in the Eastern Region working to help set up new biomedical companies, I am particularly interested in doing what I can to support Norfolk’s thriving innovation economy.\nNorfolk is no rural backwater. Mid Norfolk is home to many innovative small businesses thriving despite the difficult economic conditions but there is still much to do to help other businesses bring their great ideas to the market place. Innovation hubs like the low carbon Hethel Engineering Centre and the globally respected Norwich Research Park provide fantastic breeding grounds for start-up companies. They help Norfolk to be internationally regarded as a “life science cluster” to rival more established centres of scientific innovation such as Cambridge.\nNorwich Research Park is a world-leading centre of research, producing internationally recognised work in sectors including food, health and environmental sciences. 11,000 people work on the site, and it is this research that will create jobs and enterprises in the future – indeed, it already has. Within the Research Park are the John Innes centre, Genome Analysis centre, Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich BioIncubator, Innovation Centre and the Institute of Food Research. The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (with an active research and development department) and the University of East Anglia neighbour the Park.\nI have long campaigned for more public sector support for Norwich Research Park and upcoming science such as the biotechnology and green innovation sectors, and was delighted when asked by the Prime Minister to work with David Willetts (Minister for Universities and Science) as Government Life Science Adviser to help drive investment in this key sector of our economy. In 2010, £5 million was invested in the Research Park to fund 30 new labs and offices and to provide an additional 5,000 jobs by 2021. More recently, in May 2012, the Government invested £90 million in the Norwich Research Park. I will continue to campaign for more support for this vibrant research and enterprise community and I will continue to promote Norfolk’s life sciences at home and abroad.\nHethel Innovation in Wymondham supports the growth and success of high performance engineering and manufacturing companies by advising them on technology, innovation, enterprise, skills and finance. Based at Hethel Engineering Centre and just around the corner from Formula One’s Lotus cars, Hethel Innovation is helping to attract investment and support for Norfolk’s businesses from around the world. In May 2012 I was honoured to be asked to host a delegation of Chinese investors in Parliament who were discussing future business ventures with Norfolk County Council and Hethel Innovation. I will continue to do what I can to support Norfolk’s hi-tech engineering and manufacturing sector.\nIf you would like to find out more about my work to support Norfolk’s innovation economy, follow me on Twitter and Facebook or sign up to my email updates.\nhttp://www.norwichresearchpark.com\nCampaign News\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/george-freeman-mp-opens-new-norfo...\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-17818420\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-15626549\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/world-class-science-norfolk-mps-v...\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-12839617\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-10873197\nI passionately believe in the potential of Norfolk’s rural economy to play a significant role in helping to rebalance the national economy so we can grow our way out of these tough economic times. But rural businesses often suffer from isolation and struggle to access the support they need. Our high street banks can’t always be relied on to lend. Where else can they go for help with finance, marketing, and other business support?\nThere are, in fact, many sources of information, advice and support – if you know where to look. Information can come from Local Enterprise Partnerships, the Chamber of Commerce, County and District Councils and Local Business Networks, but businessmen and women need to be made aware of them.\nMany of the market towns and high streets in Mid Norfolk face real challenges as the older local manufacturing businesses and jobs leave. Many of the villages suffer from closing Post Offices and pubs. I believe we can reverse this decline – by putting small businesses back at the heart of local communities. Watton in my constituency has all the hallmarks of a town facing that difficult adjustment. A proud town with a strong business heritage, its high street is struggling and it’s known best these days as the home of Adcocks, the High Street business hit by the bank mis-selling scandal, as profiled by the BBC’s Robert Peston.\nThat’s why I’m campaigning to promote Watton and Wayland as a home of enterprise, and develop and promote local support networks, with the help of the Wayland Partnership, the Chamber and local councillors. We are working on plans for a Watton and Wayland Enterprise Manifesto, a new Enterprise Network, a local Enterprise Directory, and a Work Club and Enterprise Bursary with the local Wayland Academy, pioneering new training for local youngsters.\nRelated to this work, and inspired by Watton entrepreneur, Paul Adcock, is my campaign to get banks to refocus their attention towards supporting a vibrant, rural economy. Over the last twenty years or so something has gone wrong with our banking system. The culture in our small number of big banks seems to have become more interested in trading in complex financial instruments and massive global investment banking at the expense of 'old fashioned' high street banking. The case of Adcocks in Watton profiled by the BBC's Robert Peston is an example of a local business damaged by complex interest rate products sold by their bank is symptomatic of a wider problem. The collapse of the banking boom, the debt crisis and subsequent recession are a wake-up call for the need for a banking system focussed on supporting grass roots saving and local businesses. To drive a sustainable recovery we need vibrant local economies which in turn need local banking.\nThe Government’s forthcoming Banking Reform Bill will implement important measures to separate investment banking from the 'retail' banking. In due course I believe we may need to go further to support local banking by promoting new entrants to the sector and encouraging smaller local banks to be set up. We should also think about other sources of finance for local businesses. I am particularly interested in exploring ideas for new finance models for local businesses, such as micro finance, where people in Norfolk may have the opportunity to invest their savings in successful Norfolk-based businesses.”\nTo keep up to date with the campaign, follow me on Twitter and Facebook or sign up to my email updates.\nCampaign News\nhttp://www.edp24.co.uk/business/banks_losing_the_trust_of_small_firms_1_...\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/george-freeman-brings-watton-and-...\nNorwich is the only UK county – and Norwich the largest UK city - not connected to the motorway and dual carriageway network. No-body wants to flood Norfolk with London overflow and house-dumping, but neither can we be allowed to become a rural backwater. In order to develop our local economy and promote local busineses and opportunities for the next generation we need to be connected to the rest of the world, and alongside broadband, the A11 and our local airport, rail links are key to that.\nNorwich and Cambridge are both world leading innovation hubs but despite being only 50 miles apart, travelling between the two is difficult and takes too long. By linking them better together we can unlock a world class “innovation corridor” linking Cambridge with Ely, Brandon, Thetford, Attleborough, Wymondham and Norwich, to the benefit of the local communities, local business and the regional economy.\nThat’s why I’m campaigning for improvements to Norfolk’s rail services, particularly the Cambridge-Norwich railway. I want the Norwich to London train journey to take no more than 90 minutes and I want to see faster and better trains to Cambridge from Norwich with excellent commuter services from stations along the route such as Wymondham and Attleborough.\nOver the past year the campaign for East Anglian rail upgrades has intensified with MPs from across the region uniting to press for improvements. In July this year we achieved a breakthrough with the announcement that we had won the funding to upgrade Ely North Junction. The bottleneck on this piece of track currently prevents half-hourly services from both Norwich to Cambridge and King’s Lynn to Cambridge and it also holds up freight services from Suffolk. This rail upgrade, which is at the heart of an “innovation corridor” has the potential to drive growth and prosperity in our region for the next generation.\nI will continue to push for better investment across Norfolk’s railways, and ensure that the improvements at Ely are rolled out as swiftly as possible.\nLong term, I believe we need to look at whether separating the Track and Train Operating Companies (TOCs) is really the right model. I would like to see us look at the idea of an Anglian Regional Rail Company – controlling track and train, which we could invest in and which could attract the necessary investment to upgrade our local network. We can’t and shouldn’t sit around waiting for handouts from Whitehall. We need to capture the enterprising spirit of our Victorian forebears and do it ourselves!\nTo keep up to date with the campaign, follow me on Twitter and Facebook or sign up to my email updates.\nCampaign News\nhttp://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2012-07-16/east-to-share-in-9-billion-rai...\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/george-freeman-celebrates-rail-in...\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/itv-coverage-and-cross-party-supp...\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/george-freeman-and-fellow-mps-mee...\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-18690938\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/george-freeman-mp-calls-upgrade-r...\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/itv-coverage-and-cross-party-supp...\nAs the UK’s population grows it is not surprising that many more people want to come to Norfolk to live, work and enjoy our beautiful countryside. Wymondham is no exception; given its proximity and rail links to Norwich, Cambridge and London, great schools, history and heritage, and stunning landscape it is the perfect Norfolk market town. Unsurprisingly, Wymondham’s population is expanding and there is a growing demand for more homes and services for new and existing residents.\nSince our Government passed the Localism Act decisions about planning where Wymondham’s development should go are no longer up to bureaucrats in Westminster. They are up to the people and their elected local councillors of Wymondham to decide. Whilst MPs have no responsibility for planning, I have long taken an interest in rural planning policy and am keen to play my part in helping bring people together to find the best way forward for Wymondham. It’s so important to encourage new homes, businesses and services to come to our unique and historic market town but we must not lose Wymondham’s special beauty and spirit in the process, and we must conserve what makes Wymondham so beautiful.\nEarlier in 2012 I was pleased to play my part in encouraging the Town Council to think again when proposing the ASDA supermarket on King’s Head Meadow and to have the chance to chair the residents’ meeting with South Norfolk District Council to discuss the Wymondham Area Action Plan.\nI am actively opposing the application for housing development in the Tiffey Valley, which I believe should be maintained as a precious ‘green lung’ for the town, and part of the special heritage area around the Abbey and Mid Norfolk Railway station.\nWhere I can play a useful role in support of the local council and key infrastructure I have. In July 2012 I brought together planners, Councillors, the new train and station operator and Network Rail to see if would be feasible to widen the Wymondham rail bridge and road to allow a better flow of traffic through the town. I am following up with Network Rail to determine the financial constraints of such a large project.\nMore recently I have urged the Government to ease the plight facing local councils like SNDC and Wymondham through the ‘5 year land supply’ loophole in which developers ‘bank’ permissions without building on them, thus fuelling further pressures on the councils to grant more persmissions for more land.\nI will continue to follow closely the process for finalising the Wymondham Area Action Plan that South Norfolk District Council is spearheading and I will endeavour to help make all future decisions about planning as inclusive as possible for the people of Wymondham.\nTo keep up to date with my work for Wymondham’s future, follow me on Twitter and Facebook or sign up to my email updates.\nCampaign News\nhttp://www.georgefreeman.co.uk/content/george-freeman-urges-mayor-and-to...",

Local residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious.\nThat’s why earlier today, as part of my ongoing campaign (and having recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership that I established back in early 2021 – see here), I met with Norfolk County Council’s Flood and Water Management team, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance and representatives for some of the landowners upstream of the Mill Lane culvert and watercourse.\nIt’s clear that that we need a proper long term strategic plan that addresses problem watercourse pinch points AND looks to better control the flow of water downstream during heavy rainfall events. While some positive progress is already being made at the Mill Lane culvert itself (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), today’s call focused on what can be done further upstream – and I am committed to actively supporting NCC/the NSFA and partners as they work with landowners and other agencies to explore what flood mitigation and water storage scheme measures might work best for Attleborough.\nTo see all of my recent work supporting Attleborough residents, please click here or see below.\nFor full details on all of my flooding campaign work, please visit my website here.\nUDPATE 29 November 2023\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted by recent flooding.\nThat’s why, as part of my ongoing campaign, I visited Mill Lane with Cllrs Samantha and Taila Taylor this past Friday to see the problem culvert/watercourse first hand and meet with some of the worst affected residents.\nPlease see my video above.\nLocal residents (for some of which the recent flooding was the fourth time they had been impacted) are rightly furious – and I continue to hold the key stakeholders to account to ensure everything that can be done is indeed being done to provide affected residents with the support they need, as well as to put in place a short, medium and long term plan that looks to try and prevent future such flooding again in future.\nSome positive progress is already being made (as explained in my previous Attleborough Flooding campaign update here), but there still remains much more to do.\nThat’s why, as highlighted in my recent update here, I recently reconvened the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership to give our communities the strongest possible voice on these issues. Attleborough had strong representation on that call and I am determined to do everything I can, alongside local councillors, to ensure residents like those on Mill Lane and surrounding streets are heard.\nI will be involved in more meetings in the coming days and am also writing to ministers and officials in Westminster to re-emphasise again the need to put greater emphasis on flooding and drainage matters in the planning process – including putting increased responsibility on developers who’s developments subsequently flood and/or impact the existing community.\nTo stay up to date with all my work on these issues, please visit my Flooding campaign page here.\nUPDATE 3 November 2023\nFurther to my webstory update last week (see here), I can now provide more information on the work being done by multiple parties to address the terrible flooding that has recently affected many households and businesses in Attleborough.\nOn Monday, the Town Council and local district and county councillors held a public meeting in the town for local residents to speak with key stakeholders. The event was well attended and I am pleased to report that stakeholders have been following up on a number of the points and concerns raised – with additional site visits undertaken to the culvert and watercourse on Mill Lane (as well as the culvert in Briar Gardens). Meetings with developers to assess drainage on their building sites have also taken place and I am aware that a series of additional measures, along with further clearing of drains and ditches, are already being implemented – with anecdotal reports of additional blockages being addressed. I will continue to monitor progress closely.\nFurther to the emergency meeting I held last week (see here), an urgent meeting took place on Tuesday between Norfolk County Council, the Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Breckland Council and Anglian Water to discuss in greater depth the specific issues that caused flooding at the Mill Lane culvert and connected watercourse.\nAs many are aware, the culvert and watercourse were divested to riparian ownership many years ago. While that question of who will take on the long term ownership remains (and rest assured that I continue to push very hard on that and have challenged all stakeholders to work collaboratively to develop a proper strategic plan and solution for the issue), I welcome the collective recognition that something needs to be done as soon as possible, with agreement that the inadequate and unsafe trash screen that caused many of the recent problemsneeds to be replaced.\nOn a without prejudice basis (of who will assume long term responsibility for the culvert and watercourse) and as a gesture of goodwill, Anglian Water have agreed to have their contractors assess the trash screen and culvert and work up the design for a much safer, more effective replacement. All stakeholders will then jointly fund the improved screen and Anglian Water will install it.\nIn the meantime (and again on a without prejudice basis and as a gesture of goodwill), Anglian Water will endeavour to send staff every couple of weeks to keep the existing trash screen clear. (Breckland, NCC and Anglian Water are also discussing a longer term plan for removing any debris collected from the culvert and watercourse)\nI would like to reiterate however that I will keep on the critical question of who will assume the long term responsibility and ownership of the culvert and watercourse – and am already liaising with the key stakeholders on the date for a follow-up meeting to discuss that matter further.\nNCC have also confirmed that the gulleys around Mill Lane have been cleared (with additional review taking place of gulleys on surrounding streets) and I understand that an assessment is taking place as to whether the trash screen at the Briar Gardens culvert should be removed.\nA full flood investigation is now being led by NCC in line with their statutory processes. Although their Flood and Water Management team had already been working on proposals to better mitigate flooding in this area (as a result of the December 23rd-24th 2020 flooding event), there is recognition that their Flood Plan for the area, and its associated work, now needs accelerating and upscaling. I have committed to supporting NCC as they seek to secure the additional funding required to implement any recommended measures, as well as to engage with key local landowners.\nI am also in the process of reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I previously established – and will ensure Attleborough is represented in those vital conversations.\nRest assured, I am determined to do everything I can to speak up for those affected in Attleborough, as well as those across Mid Norfolk.\nUPDATE 25 October 2023\nStorm Babet has reminded us again why we must continue to take flooding seriously.\nAttleborough was one of several Mid Norfolk communities badly impacted, with severe flooding on Mill Lane, Norwich Road, Ferguson Way and other nearby streets. For some, it was the fourth time they had been flooded in 30 years – and the second time in just under three years. I appreciate, and share, the immense anger and frustration felt by those that have been forced to leave their homes as a result of the damage suffered this past weekend.\nThat’s why I held an emergency meeting today with Norfolk County Council and their Norfolk Strategic Flooding Alliance, Anglian Water and Breckland District Council to get to the bottom of what is causing the flooding at the watercourse and culvert on Mill Lane, as well as ensure that those with statutory flooding responsibilities come together and develop an urgent action plan.\nWhile NCC began working on proposals to address flooding at this location in light of the December 2020 flooding, Storm Babet has brought into sharper focus the need to upscale and accelerate those proposals, and address other issues such as questions around which authority is responsible for the culvert and watercourse and therefore who should be maintaining them.\nI had made clear that there needs to be:\n- A proper plan for ensuring affected residents (and the wider community) are protected from further flooding this winter.\n- An acceleration and upscaling of efforts to put in place a long term solution.\n- A proper plan for who is going to be responsible for this culvert and watercourse in due course.\n- Agreement on who is going to keep the culvert and watercourse clear NOW – while the longer term plan is being developed and implemented.\nI am in close contact with local district councillors and a number of those worst affected by the flooding and am determined to help them work with key stakeholders to develop a solution.\nWe must see action. This must not be allowed to happen again. And residents should not be risking their own safety to try and keep this culvert clear during storms and heavy rainfall.\nMore widely, I will be reconvening the Mid Norfolk Flood Partnership I established as a result of the Winter 2020/21 flooding to help support those affected by Storm Babet and ensure our communities have the strongest possible voice heading into this autumn/winter.\nRest assured, I will continue to support councillors and residents in the days, weeks and months ahead.\nTo see my Flooding Update earlier this week, please click here\nTo find out more about my historic campaign work on flooding, please visit my campaign page here",

Thats why I worked with Norman Lamb MP as Lib Dem Minister for Mental Health in the Coalition and with Clive Lewis MP and the NSFT campaigners to get their voice properly heard in Parliament, DHSC, NSFT and the Norfolk and Waveney Integrated Care Board in a serious process of major reform to the way mental health services are provided.\nIt’s why I have been using to my freedom since resigning as a Minister in the last Government- to call for a bold decentralisation of the NHS to a properly integrated Norfolk Health and Care Service with mental health and elderly social care all in ONE Norfolk NHS accountable locally to local patients, communities and councils and much less money wasted on vast bureaucracies in NHS HQ and DHSC and the fragmentation of local services in Norfolk across c10 organisations, replaced by a single Norfolk Health & Care Service (NHCS).\nSo I welcome the apology, rigorous transparency and commitment to reform shown by the new NSFT leadership in its report yesterday.\nWhilst it is good to hear that the Guardian reports last year of 8000 preventable deaths from mental illness were incorrect and the number was in fact 494 unexplained deaths in the four years 2019 and 2023 - meaning the Norfolk rate of suicide was the same as the national average, there are major and serious lessons to be learnt and reforms to be made.\nIt is very important now that the NSFT is reformed urgently. Many have called for its abolition, and I can understand why. But whilst abolition is easy to call for - it would not help the many people in Norfolk who need access to mental health services now. Nor the many dedicated staff who have also been let down by bad leadership historically and want to help vulnerable patients.\nThe Trust in their report have set out a bold plan to reform the system. They must make it patient and user focussed, place based, integrated properly with the health system and community health boards.\nIt is encouraging to see the new Leadership team have delivered reduced waiting times for assessment and treatment, as well as a net increase of 100 nurses and 34 doctors in the last year. This is an encouraging start but there is much more to do.\nThe people who need these services are the most vulnerable in our society and it is crucial that all newly elected MPs work together cross-party to ensure that the NSFT fulfil their commitments in the report.\nI will continue my commitment to pursue this as a priority project and campaign in the new Parliament and work with all MPs across Norfolk and Suffolk and new Ministers to\n- ensure urgent reform delivery in the spirit of this report\n- much more local accountability and transparency\n- much stronger respect for patient voice\n- greater integration with local NHS and care services\n- represent the views of Patients and users in Mid Norfolk\nPlease write to me if you have any concerns on this issue so that I can pick them up and make representations on your behalf.\nTo read the full report please visit: NSFT publish Learning from Deaths report | News and events | Norfolk and Suffolk NHS\nFor background on my historic work on NSFT click here.",

This has recently been reviewed, and it no longer meets the criteria to receive such a subsidy as there is another post office in a 3 mile radius (Dereham and North Elmham are the closest).\nThe reality I am afraid - so I am informed - is that the post office has an annual turnover of just £2,500.

It was another invaluable opportunity to learn more about the challenges our frontline General Practice staff are facing on a daily basis, as well as a chance to discuss possible solutions in greater depth. I was also able to report back on my work since our previous meeting, which has seen me highlight the group’s feedback with the Department of Health and Social Care ministerial team, in addition to continuing my efforts to speak up on behalf of constituents with concerns.\nThe Government has showed that it is listening to the views being raised by the NHS and constituents alike. Indeed, it renewed its commitment to our NHS by making a further series of announcements (including £8 billion of funding for the NHS and adult social care in England by 2024-25) in the Autumn Statement – announcements I welcomed as they will ensure our NHS is receiving historic levels of funding, which will not only tackle the Covid backlog but will also enable rapid action to improve urgent and emergency care, as well as primary care so that our NHS is able to deliver even more than it did pre-pandemic, and to higher standards.\nI also understand that, in line with the commitment made by the Chancellor in the Autumn Statement, the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan will also be published soon too – and welcomed the news in today’s Budget that pension tax reforms are set to be implemented to remove legislation that disincentivises doctors from working full hours or from working right the way up to retirement age.\nMy hope is that I can bring key DHSC and NHS England officials to my next meeting with this key group of senior GP surgery figures – who I have committed to joining quarterly moving forwards (with conversations ongoing in between as we work together on any specific issues).\nRest assured, I remain committed to doing all I can to speak up for and represent Mid Norfolk – both on behalf of my concerned constituents and those working in our local NHS.",

Member for Keighley (Robbie Moore). I come from a farming family; it is nice to know that we are in such strong hands, and to hear such cross-party support for this key industry. The sector will be grateful to know how strongly it is represented across this House.\nI do not have an interest to declare, except that as I come from a farming family, I narrowly escaped a career in farm management. I worked for Greens of Soham and used to be a director of Elsoms Seeds. I also worked for the National Farmers Union back when there was a thing called the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and I used to chair the all-party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture. I take this opportunity to thank Minette Batters for her extraordinary leadership of an organisation that is at times not given to agility and clarity. She has brought clarity to the sector. I wish Tom Bradshaw, her successor, all the very best.\nI think the House knows that I was not a great believer that the Brexit referendum would be immediately and easily implementable—I thought it would cause some difficulties and problems—but the one thing that I was very excited about was the opportunity to replace the appalling common agricultural policy, and all its mess, bureaucracy and chaos, with a UK farm and agriculture support framework. That remains an exciting opportunity. Such a framework would give this great industry—that is what it is—security in the long term. History shows that when we give that to farmers, they give us back exactly what we want. We need a long-term, secure policy, that has enough support and flexibility to allow marginal hill farmers to protect the uplands and the beautiful countryside that we love; that supports small family holdings, whose economic marginality requires diversification; and that supports all those other activities that we want to support. In my part of the world, East Anglia, global, world-class, competitive agriculture can lead the way in growing the food that the world needs. There is a huge opportunity.\nI observe that in my 14 years in the House, agriculture has gone from not being properly recognised as an industry, and almost being seen by the Government as an activity of park keeping, to being, after the pandemic and Ukraine, a hugely important strategic sector that is key to food security and an opportunity for us globally. We need to double world food production by 2050 on the same land area, with half as much water and energy. That is a global grand challenge. This country is a powerhouse in agricultural science, research and technology, and can help make that possible. The opportunity is for us to set out a framework that unlocks the genius of our agricultural sector, so that we can show the world how it is done. If we get that right, we will invigorate the rural economy.\nOf course, Brexit was eight years ago. I pay tribute to the Government’s various commitments: the £2.4 billion ringfenced commitment, the sustainable farming incentive, countryside stewardship, the food innovation programme, the food strategy, the animal health and welfare pathway, ELMS, and the Prime Minister’s commitment at the recent NFU conference. The real key is ensuring that the farming community feel and see long-term, clear, sustainable support.\nI want to highlight one or two things that the farmers of Mid Norfolk say we have still to get right. First, they highlight the importance of a really reliable, long-term policy framework for the commercial sector, as well as an environmental framework for skills and for innovation. For 40 years after the war, the sector knew what we wanted it to do. It needs to know that we know what we want it to do, and that we will not change our mind every five, three or two years.\nSecondly, agriculture must be recognised as a strategic industry that is key to our balance of payments, food security and ability to connect to those huge global markets. Public support figures show that the public are with us now—they were not 20 or 30 years ago; they did not think of it as a great industry that they wanted to support, but they do now.\nThirdly, we must understand that farmers are, first and foremost, mainly small businesses. They are not sophisticated; generally, they are not people with degrees or MBAs in business management. They are people who love what they do. We need to give them a framework that works for them as small businesses. Farming is a very unusual business, which invests most of its costs up front in the hopeful pursuit of revenue and profit downstream. Not many businesses do that. We need to understand that reality, as that is partly why farms need such security.\nA number of colleagues have talked about food security. We are not destined only to grow the root crops, potatoes and traditional crops here, and to import the salad crops. Incredible innovations in vertical farming mean that we are now able to produce salad crops in this country. I have visited vertical farms—we have a great one in Norfolk at Fischer Farms. They use a fraction of the land area, with a fraction of the energy and chemicals used in traditional farming. There is no reason why that food security target could not be a lot higher.\nOf course we all want environmental agriculture. I pay tribute to Kevin Bowes, the Breckland farmers, the Upper Wensum farmers group and the farmers at Wendling Beck. Farmers in Mid Norfolk are shaping best practice for agri-environment schemes. I recently visited a flagship project with Natural England: 20 or 30 people had come up from London, having bought their wellies at the garage; and Tony Juniper was preaching rewilding. I went to look at some land that, as a farmer’s boy, I would think you could probably get two hectares or an acre out of—and the finest minds in the land were trying to work out how to get nothing out of it, at a time when we really need food production. I am worried that the E in DEFRA sometimes triumphs over the F, the R and the A. Food needs to be right back at the heart of the Department; I know that the Secretary of State and the Minister are committed to that.\nI make the point about the environment because we all know that, traditionally, agriculture has been a very high emitting industry. We need to show the world how to move to a low-emission agricultural sector. We are well positioned to do that, not least in agricultural genetics and breeding science at the Norwich Research Park, where we are pioneering drought-resistant crops that do not need highly carbon-intensive chemicals, and disease-resistant and drought-resistant crops for the rest of the world. In our chase for net zero, the left hand and the right hand need to be co-ordinated. We are not doing anything for net zero if we are disrupting farming in East Anglia with endless solar farms, cables and pylons.\nSir Edward Leigh (Gainsborough) (Con)\nThere is a simple thing that the Department can do, which I have asked it to do again and again: not put solar farms on 3b land. We put them on warehouses or inferior land, but not on good agricultural land in Lincolnshire and Norfolk.\nGeorge Freeman\nI agree. If we are to lead the world in net zero agriculture, it is all about metrics and data. It is about picking up a pint of milk, a potato or a loaf of bread and knowing its environmental footprint. With that, we can start to give the sector incentives and rewards for driving down the environmental footprint. Without it, we are condemned to follow environmental policies that are emotional and not connected to proper science and research. If we get that right, the UK could be a leader in setting those environmental metrics.\nThat brings me to water quality. I commend the fact that UK agriculture has achieved a 75% reduction in pollution—that is very right. In our part of the world, the nutrient neutrality muddle has been a serious blow to farmers who are taking water quality seriously by reducing pig effluent and trying to get the balance right. Clunky, bureaucratic, big schemes in Whitehall that were not thought through properly are causing chaos in our part of the world in both agriculture and housing.\nThat brings me to flooding, on which I agree with the hon. Member for Selby and Ainsty (Keir Mather)—it is good to hear colleagues from all corners of this House getting the problem. Large parts of Mid Norfolk are currently under water. That is not good for agricultural productivity. Farms are holding water, for which they receive no support. There has been a lot of talk recently of “from the river to the sea.” The basics of drainage are that rivers are there to drain water off the land into the sea, and we could do with the Environment Agency putting dredging and the clearing of rivers at the top of the priority list to ensure that we get the water off the land properly.\nMark Menzies (Fylde) (Con)\nMy hon. Friend is making a powerful point. That issue is not just limited to Norfolk. The Secretary of State will know, being a Fylde lad, that it is affecting my farmers. We are crying out for water draining off land and letting farmers farm.\nGeorge Freeman\nI could not agree more. The Secretary of State, whose constituency is North East Cambridgeshire, has lived the reality of getting water off the land as much as anybody.\nThat brings me to labour shortages. We have had real problems in the last few years: post Brexit, post pandemic and with the minimum wage, farmers are struggling. When a horticultural grower of the calibre of Andy Allen has to plough his prime English asparagus crop back into the land because he cannot find anyone to cut it, we are in real trouble. Some of our agricultural colleges are fantastic—I think I still have a place at Harper Adams if this career does not work out—but I worry that Easton College in Mid Norfolk is not properly anticipating the future needs of a high technology agricultural industry. We need to nurture the skills of tomorrow. Our young farmers get it, but we need to give them the courses.\nI echo the comments that a number of Members have made about the difference between landowners and farmers. They are not the same thing. Many farmers I see are contract farmers—they are working 24/7, covering huge amounts of land and operating with higher and higher costs. The environmental payments tend to go to the landowners. We need to look after the farmers: the people who are developing those skills and inspiring the next generation to come into this great industry. If we end up with an industry where the hedge funds own all the land and no one is able to farm it, we will have done ourselves no favours. Quite a lot of those pressures explain why we have such a problem with mental health in agriculture. One farmer a week is taking their life. We need to think about what is driving that.\nI applaud the Government’s work on production standards. We have a great opportunity in free trade deals to set the higher standards and to show the world how the UK produces more with less. I would offer a zero tariff only to those who are using the world’s very best technologies for zero-emission agriculture, and create a market for the exporting of our net zero technologies. Sustainable intensification—delivering more with less—is not just a strapline. The world desperately needs us to help deliver that. In our sector we have huge strength: the John Innes Centre at the Norwich Research Park, the Sainsbury Laboratory in Aberystwyth, and at Roslin and Wellesbourne. We are a global powerhouse in science research. We spend about half a billion a year on it, but it does not yet feel like the agricultural sector is underpinned by a half a billion of research. I know that the Secretary of State is thinking hard about how that science and research is better pulled through.\nThat brings me to agritech—a huge global sector. I was proud to set up our first agritech industrial strategy, the catalyst fund and the centres with my noble Friend Lord Willetts. We have some amazing agritech companies, but the key is to adopt the technologies they are producing. I pay tribute to companies such as Tropic Biosciences and to the work going on at Rothamsted. But when a company like the Small Robot Company develops brilliant technology but cannot find a market here to use it, I think that tells us as policymakers that we have to create a market in which those technologies are commercially viable and adoptable—otherwise we will end up incubating the rest of the world’s agritech sectors and not actually deploying the technologies here.\nI will close by mentioning gene editing, which is a huge strength here in the UK—not just in disease resistance and drought-resistant crops, and shifting from chemical to biological control systems, but in nutraceuticals, functional foods and novel foods. We could lead the world in a whole new sector of agriculture, but that regulatory leadership is key.\nThe opportunity that people voted for eight years ago is still there. It is being born slowly and there have been many disruptions, but it is exciting. If we get this right, we could trigger and be the crucible of a new agricultural revolution in which we show the world how to deliver high-quality, safe, highly productive, low-input agriculture based on innovation with science, data and metrics. The UK could export that around the world. The alternative is that we create a jungle of well-intended green tape that gets in the way of a fundamentally commercial sector leading us into that new dawn. I know that DEFRA Ministers understand that. My job is to speak for the people of Mid Norfolk, and to ensure that we in this House show that we get it and that we are there for a new generation, who want to do the right thing for this country and for the globe.",

Rarely, if ever, have they complained of the greater financial constraints within which they have had to operate during this time.\nI am acutely aware however that rising costs and pressures over the past couple of years are presenting a very significant challenge to many schools in our area. Small rural schools have higher costs and face different challenges in comparison to their urban counterparts – and I am determined to speak up on behalf of our local Mid Norfolk schools to ensure their voices are being heard at the highest levels.\nWhile the DfE’s new SEND funding announcement for Norfolk back in March was very welcome news, with NCC already putting into action work that will deliver much positive support as a result (see more here), I am also aware of the continued challenges many of our schools face in terms of SEND support. I acknowledge their frustration with OFSTED too – with many highlighting to me in recent months that, although they do not believe it should be abolished or that our education system should have no inspectorate, they believe it must be reformed in order to better encourage improvements in standards, support schools and reduce the levels of stress and demoralisation it can often cause staff and students.\nRest assured, I remain firmly committed to doing everything I can to help speak up for our local Mid Norfolk schools on these issues too and, after conversations with many of my local schools, intend to establish a regular online forum for myself and local heads – at which they can speak with me directly about any issues they might be having, in addition to the usual correspondence we often exchange with one another. I look forward to reaching out to my Mid Norfolk headteachers in the coming days.\nTo see some of my previous work lobbying for fairer rural schools funding and support, please click here and here\nTo see more on my work specifically in support of SEND provision in our local mainstream and specialist schools, please visit my campaign page here)",

Many have to travel to Norwich or Attleborough to use the disabled facilities there in order for them to be able to switch sides and continue with their journeys.

  "https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_/https_www_georgefreeman_co_uk_news_farming-and-inheritance-tax-debate/content_16.html": "My speech in the House this afternoon on why we need to fight the Family Farm Tax attack.\nGeorge Freeman (Mid Norfolk) (Con)\nI rise to speak on behalf of Mid Norfolk, a rural, agricultural, food-processing constituency that is reeling from this surprise and savage attack that was not in the Labour manifesto. I have no direct interest in farming, but I am the child of a farming family—my stepbrother runs that business. I worked on farms from the age of 15 to 21. I was going to go into farm management, and I think I still have a place at Harper Adams agricultural college if this career does not work out. My first job was with the NFU, working here in Parliament. I was a director of Elsoms Seeds and I was proud as a Minister to lead the agritech industrial strategy. I am chair of the all-party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture.\nThis is a hugely important strategic industry to the UK. It is key to our food security—now, gratifyingly, a Government priority—and it is completely key to the world’s ability to feed 9 billion mouths. We are a great agricultural research and technology economy, and the world is hungry for our innovations. Agriculture is also completely key to net zero. Agriculture and transport are the two dirtiest industries, and agriculture is moving more quickly than any, pioneering regenerative systems of agriculture and carbon-capturing systems. Those innovations are being driven by a new generation of young UK farmers, who are different from the post-war generation. They take their responsibilities to the broader planet and regenerative agriculture seriously.\nAt the same time as agriculture being a key strategic industry, farmers look after our countryside and keep our rural economy healthy. All of those are achieved in the most extraordinary way, in an industry not dominated by big companies. This industry is made up of millions of small businesses. Moreover, they exist in the most extraordinary business climate. They operate on incredibly expensive assets—the land—which they never seek to monetise, as colleagues have pointed out, in an industry in which their costs are fixed. They invest in all their costs up front and wait hopefully for a price for their product, which is subject to the vagaries of the weather and of climate change. Most business people looking at that business model would say, “That is not a business I want to be in.” Why do our family farmers do it? They do it because it is a way of life and because it is deeply embedded in the values of their families, their countryside and their communities. It is about stewardship, and it makes it all the more remarkable that this Government have decided to attack that very bit of the agricultural economy.\nWhat are the aims of this policy? What is the impact of this policy? How should this House and those MPs who understand the rural economy respond? If the Government had said, “Our aim is to close the loophole of land asset speculators enjoying the legitimate family tax relief that the Conservatives put in place in 1984,” I probably would have supported them. If they had said, “We want to stop international hedge funds enjoying a tax relief designed to protect family farms,” I suspect many of us would have supported them. If they had said, “We want to support new entrants to the industry to promote diversified, regenerative agriculture, to increase investment and to promote the vibrant rural economy,” I probably would have supported them. That, however, is not the aim of this policy. The truth is that we do not know its aim, because the policy was never in the Government’s manifesto and it is not from DEFRA. It is a Treasury policy that has been landed on unwitting Ministers, who are now having to carry the can. We know it is anti-small business, anti-family business and anti the rural economy.\nThe former Labour adviser, John McTernan, let the cat out of the bag. He said that Labour has waited a long time to seek revenge for the Tory attacks on the miners, and it was going to attack the farming community now—[Interruption.] That is exactly what he said. The impact of the policy is clear; we only have to read the CLA and NFU briefings. I have met Gavin Lane, Phil and Sophie Ellis, Oliver Munday and Nigel Stangroom. Most of our average family farms will have to pay tax bills of £400,000, £500,000 or £600,000. Where will they get the money, when the businesses do not generate the profits to pay those bills? They will all have to sell land, but who will buy it? It will not be their neighbour, because they will be selling land, too. I fear that this policy was designed in the Treasury with the support of bits of the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and DEFRA. The people hanging over Mid Norfolk waiting to buy the land are the big solar developers and the big mass housing developers.\nTom Hayes (Bournemouth East) (Lab)\nWill the hon. Member give way?\nGeorge Freeman\nI will not, as time is short and colleagues want to speak. This policy is a prescription for the industrialisation of the countryside, cooked up in the Treasury in the summer when nobody was looking. It will lead to family farms being broken up and sold, farm investment falling and young farmers leaving, with a major economic impact and tertiary impacts in my part of the world. Those industries that support farming are already seeing the effects. The response of rural MPs should be to move fast behind the hon. Member for Penrith and Solway (Markus Campbell-Savours) and make it clear to the Treasury that it needs to adjust the mechanisms, change the thresholds and change this policy, unless Labour wants to be the party of rural devastation.",
