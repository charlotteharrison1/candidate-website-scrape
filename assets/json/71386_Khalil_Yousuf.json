I lecture during the summer term on community engagement.\nMy students have gone to regularly hold and contribute towards litter picking sessions, tree planting sessions, fundraising programmes, assisting the Royal British Legion where and when needed, help organise numerous blood drive sessions for the NHS, visit numerous care homes during Christmas and New Years’ time, sharing their company for those who do not have anyone to celebrate the festive seasons with – and much more.\nI am the Director and Trustee of Charity Walk for Peace (now Beacon of Peace), which organized charity walks in Bordon in 2022 and 2023. We have raised thousands of pounds (just last year we raised £20,000 for more than 20 local charities based in Whitehill and Bordon and surrounding areas).\nThe next charity walk I am organizing will take place in Tilford on June 30, 2024, and the following one has been confirmed in Bordon after the election in October 2024, regardless of the election outcome.\nSince 2020, I have been supporting Bordon food bank, visiting myself or sending volunteers. Just in 2023 we contributed and donated more than 1000kg worth of food items to Bordon, Headley Down and Farnham foodbanks.\nSince 2023, I’ve been supporting Alton Food Bank.\nSince 2024, I have been supporting Headley Food Bank.\nMY OFFICE\nMy office has been located in Coxbridge Business Park, Farnham since September 26, 2020. I work there regularly and my team is also based there with me. The majority of my team are local residents.\nWHERE I LIVE\nSince the campaign began, I have been living with my brother in Bordon, who is a GP and regularly contributes to local charity works, for a few days each week.\nAlthough I spend most of my time in the constituency, my son currently attends primary school in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey. Therefore, I have declared my main home as being in another part of Surrey, outside the constituency.\nMy family and I plan to move to Farnham, Bordon or Haslemere during the late summer this year. We have been searching for affordable housing for several months. We hope to secure a place soon.\nMY SON’S FUTURE SCHOOL\nMy son sat the exam for Royal Grammar School, Guildford last year, before my campaign began. He passed those assessments and has been offered a place. He could start either this September or when he turns 13.\nThese are the facts.\nBased on this information, you can decide whether you consider me local, recognize my local connections, and see my commitment to Farnham, Bordon, and Haslemere.\nIntegrity in politics matters. I will always be here with you, for you.",

I am Khalil\nA dad, a husband, a lawyer and your Liberal Democrat candidate for Farnham and Bordon.\nMy journey to this moment is fuelled by a passion for justice, community service, and a deep-seated belief in fairness for everyone instilled in me by my own history.\nMY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\nProfessionally, I’m a solicitor specialising in Commercial and Energy law. My work has taken me from advising on the environmental impacts of offshore wind farm developments and decommissioning to advocating for the power of large-scale solar plants. For years, my base has been the vibrant Coxbridge Business Park in Farnham, where I’ve had the pleasure of growing with our community.\nMy commitment to public service was ignited during my law studies and has been the cornerstone of my life ever since. Qualifying as a solicitor in 2001 was just the beginning of a journey marked by regular volunteerism aimed at helping those in dire need. Throughout the challenges of Covid19, I dedicated nearly 700 hours to providing free legal advice, standing shoulder to shoulder with our community in its time of greatest need.\nMy personal mission\nBeyond my professional endeavours, I serve as a Trustee and Board Member for the Charity Walk for Peace and am the Chairman of Lawyers for Humanity. These roles offer me invaluable opportunities to contribute to our society’s well-being, guided by my core values of justice and community service.\nIn Farnham & Bordon and across the United Kingdom, we see the strength and decency of individuals from all walks of life, striving for a better future against increasing challenges. Yet, as we face these tough times together, the need for a fair deal has never been more pronounced.\nOur community is a vibrant part of this national endeavour, embodying the determination and compassion that make us great. But to truly flourish, we need a representative who understands the importance of fairness, opportunity, and support. It’s time for an MP who ensures that the hard work and integrity of our residents are met with the justice and prosperity they deserve.\nFIGHTING FOR FARNHAM & BORDON\nAs your prospective MP, my mission is clear: to secure a fair deal for every one of us. In conversations across our constituency, the challenges you face are evident. From the soaring costs of living affecting our ability to afford essentials like food, energy, and housing to the dire state of our healthcare and education systems. The increasing unsolved burglaries and the escalating climate crisis are issues that can no longer be ignored.\nA PLEDGE TO YOU\nI am determined to tackle these challenges head-on. With your support, we can strive towards a community where fairness is not just an ideal but a reality. Together, we can make the new constituency of Farnham and Bordon a beacon of hope, justice, and opportunity for all. Thank you for considering me as your voice.
