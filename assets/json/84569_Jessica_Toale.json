But the vibrant town of my youth has been let down by 14 years of neglect by successive Conservative governments.\nEnergy bills are soaring, and we are dealing with multiple crises - cost of living, wellbeing and climate. I've seen the decline of our high streets and town centre. Local people struggle to get an NHS dentist, social care and mental health support. Sewage is being pumped into our rivers and seas at an alarming rate. And knife crime is on the rise.\nAs Bournemouth West's first ever Labour MP, I will work with residents, businesses, civic leaders and the new mission-led government to help make sure Bournemouth is a great place to live, work and visit - with a revived town centre, safer streets and cleaner seas. A town where everyone, no matter their background, can enjoy a fulfilling life here.\nTogether we can build a brighter future for Bournemouth."
