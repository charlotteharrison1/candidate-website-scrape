I have copied below a reply I have received from Joe Green of the Transportation & Connectivity Team.\nI’ve also had previous confirmation that the letters will be sent to residents along the entire length of School Road, any road that leads directly off School Road (and roads leading off these), Valentine Road and Cambridge Road. Also (after I made some representation) it will now include Oxford Road between St. Mary’s Row and Billesley Lane, and Billesley Lane between Wake Green Road and the junction with Cambridge Road/ Southlands Road.\nFrom: Joe Green\nSent: 31/10/2018 16:48\nTo: Izzy Knowles; Gill Brook\nCc: Councillor Kerry Jenkins\nSubject: RE: School Road Traffic Issues\nHi Izzy,\nI sent some further information across to Cllr Jenkins this morning, on the back of a request from discussions at last night’s Moseley Forum meeting.The meeting you mention was requested by School Road Traffic Issues Group to provide them with an update, and was attended by Phil Edwards and myself.\nFurther answers to your questions are included below:\nPlease can you confirm whether an engineer has been allocated to the scheme yet and if so who it is?\nYes, this project has now been approved and funding allocated. It will be overseen by Natalia Haberko in our Infrastructure Delivery team. Gill and I are currently in the process of handing everything across to Natalia for taking things forward, but we will continue to be involved to support the communication and engagement elements of this scheme.\nWill there be any formal consultation either before or during the experimental period?\nA letter drop of the local area is being organised to inform residents of what is happening. It is envisaged that this will be sent out week commencing 12th November.\nIt is not necessary to hold formal (statutory) consultation for an experimental traffic order, other than with the emergency services who are in the process of being contacted.\nThere will be ongoing consultation while the experimental traffic order is in place, and any views or comments submitted during this period will be recorded to help inform future decisions.\nHow long do you envisage the experimental period to be?\nThe maximum length of time that an experimental traffic order can remain in place for is 18 months, after which point it is either progressed to a permanent intervention (pending formal consultation) or removed. It is generally seen as good practice to keep an experimental traffic order in place for a minimum of 6 months, but there is scope to remove it sooner than this if deemed necessary.\nThere is scope for the scheme to become permanent if it is deemed that the experimental road closure has been successful. However this would be subject to a formal consultation process – and this would need to have been completed within the maximum period of 18 months for an experimental traffic order for there to be no break in the provision of this intervention.\nWhat traffic surveys are planned to take place before and during the experimental scheme?\nNatalia will be developing monitoring arrangements for this scheme, which will include traffic counts before and during the experimental closure.\nThere is some existing data from traffic counts carried out at locations in the area last year that can potentially be used, and we will work with the local engineer to identify locations for any further counts; they have already suggested that the junctions of Oxford Road/St Mary’s Row and Billesley Lane/Wake Green Road should be included.\nI hope these answers are useful, we are keen to keep local residents informed of what is happening and shall continue to seek to do so.\nPlease do get in touch if there is anything else you would like to know at this stage. Regards, Joe\nJoe Green, BA (Hons)\nTransportation Behaviour Change Manager\nTransportation & Connectivity – Economy Directorate\nBirmingham City Council\nFrom: Izzy Knowles [mailto:moseleylibdems@gmail.com]\nSent: Wednesday, October 31, 2018 2:26 PM\nTo: Gill Brook\nCc: Joe Green\nSubject: Re: School Road Traffic Issues\nHi Gill & Joe\nI learned from Cllr Jenkins last night at a Moseley Forum meeting that a meeting has taken place with the School Road Traffic Issues group and the funding has been approved for the experimental scheme. There was also a suggestion that as it is an experimental scheme no further consultation will take place following the letter, which is still to go out to residents.\nPlease can you confirm whether an engineer has been allocated to the scheme yet and if so who it is?\nThis scheme is going to cost a lot of money to implement so it is important we get it right, otherwise it will be money wasted. I am concerned that the decision to carry out this experimental closure has been made with very little consultation and there are still people who will be directly affected who do not know it is taking place.\nWill there be any formal consultation either before or during the experimental period?\nHow long do you envisage the experimental period to be?\nI’m also concerned that proper measures need to be taken to correctly survey the amount and speed of traffic on these roads and potentially affected roads, both before and at periods after the experiment, so that the scheme can be properly evaluated.\nWhat traffic surveys are planned to take place before and during the experimental scheme?\nAre you able to please update me on these points?\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nIzzy Knowles\nMoseley Liberal Democrats",

These are a national online resource, comparing council performance across seven key categories. Birmingham City Council achieved an average score of 39%. Although 4 percentage points above the average, it’s a reflection of how poor the situation is across the country.\nCllr Roger Harmer the Birmingham Lib Dem leader commented on the scorecards: “there are several areas where Birmingham needs to up its game.\n“Transport management is key to reducing pollutants and reducing carbon emissions is a key priority area. We need to make more progress on improving the electric car charging network and the council should be more proactive in developing car clubs to reduce the number of cars on our streets whilst increasing the number of people with access to cars”.\n“The council currently scores poorly in terms of waste management and recycling. We have long argued for the introduction of kerbside food waste recycling, as part of a plan to end the need of incineration of waste”.\nLiberal Democrats have long campaigned for increasing the installation of solar panel on the Council’s rooves to save costs as well as carbon emissions.\nGovernance and finance is a particularly low scoring area, with the Council achieving just 6%. Cllr Harmer said “There’s a new team in place working on this at the council. I hope they are being listened to by decision makers”.\nRecently, Izzy and Councillor Jon Hunt have encouraged the council to reduce use of glyphosate; a weedkiller that damages wildlife – notably vital bee populations. To date, the weedkiller is still being used by the council and partner organisations.\nThe Government also needs to do more, particular in terms of helping to radically improve the insulation of our homes and other buildings.\nThe scorecards can be accessed here:\nIzzy finished her speech by urging young people to take an interest in politics and to campaign for things that are important to them. She talked about the recent elections in Poland and how young people turned out in their thousands to vote for a change in government.\nThe students have all been asked to write letters to people who can influence policy, including national and local politicians and business leaders. Izzy has agreed to deliver any letters addressed to Birmingham Councillors and to ensure they get a reply.",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_tag_traffic/content_49.html": "Last week the council published their proposals for the West Moseley Traffic Reduction Scheme. I wrote about the details here\nI would like to try to explain the rationale for the proposal to put a modal filter on Moor Green Lane using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO).\nFirstly, I would like to reassure residents there are no plans to put a similar filter on Russell Road. That option was considered by officers, who were looking at possibly incorporating it into the Cannon Hill Park to Moseley cycle lane extension, but it was not taken forward to the design stage.\nThe proposal for a filter on Moor Green Lane has come about due to the many concerns raised from residents of Russell Road, Reddings Road and Moor Green Lane about the volume of traffic, speeding and dangerous driving in residential roads in West Moseley. Some residents have been campaigning for action for many years.\nQueensbridge Secondary School and Moor Green Primary School report excessive volumes of traffic, inconsiderate parking and speeding. Many parents say they feel their children are unsafe travelling to school by bicycle or foot, and they have no option but to ferry them by car. There are also two special needs schools in the area, Uffculme and Fox Hollies.\nA traffic calming scheme proposed in 2022 for Russell Road was shelved in 2024 due to the excessive cost – approx. £620,000 pounds and rising. Costs of installing infrastructure have increased astronomically since Brexit and the Pandemic.\nIt was also felt that the scheme would not reduce the volume of traffic, which is a priority of the council as part of the Birmingham Transport Plan.\nOne modal filter in one location is much cheaper to install than a traffic calming scheme over a wider area. A modal filter in Moor Green Lane will likely cost less than a 10th of the previously proposed measures for Russell Road.\nAs much as everyone wants speed cameras, they are unlikely to be considered a priority for 20mph roads until there is a change of law. Speeding fine revenue goes straight to the government treasury and is used for general government expenditure. This means the cost of installation and maintenance of any speed cameras has to be met by the council and costs of administration of the offences are met by the police, with no revenue coming back other than for speed awareness courses, which does not cover the costs. There are currently only six speeding camera sites in Birmingham. Although work is on going to add more, they will inevitably be placed on arterial A routes within the city.\nNeither calming nor cameras will reduce traffic volume, which has got steadily worse in residential streets, mainly due to the use of satellite navigation systems.\nFaced with these barriers to addressing the many complaints and campaigns the council officers looked at a wider area than Russell Road. They discovered most of the traffic travelling through the West Moseley area comes via Moor Green Lane. They estimated if they stop the through traffic using this route it will reduce the amount of traffic using all the residential streets as a cut through by up to half and most of what will subsequently come into the area will be local.\nIt is anecdotally argued that local people are less likely to speed or drive dangerously in their own neighbourhoods. Indeed, if you look at roads where through traffic is restricted there is evidence of a much lower rate of collisions.\nLess traffic, fewer collisions and reduced amount of speeding will make the area much safer, especially outside the schools.\nThere is of course a potential for the traffic to be displaced to other roads. This is why the proposal would be undertaken with an experimental /trial order rather than an immediate permanent one. There would be monitoring of traffic volume and flows across the area before and after the filter is installed. If it doesn’t work or it causes undue problems to other roads it can be removed. The ETRO involves consultation prior to implementation and during the first six months of it being installed.\nThe advantage to installing a filter is safer, more pleasant streets, which for people who are able to cycle or walk or use a mobility scooter, will encourage and empower them to use their car less often.\nThe disadvantage is that if you do need to drive somewhere it may be slightly longer. But, overall the number of short journeys made by people will be reduced, as people use their cars less. That is not a bad thing, the major threat to air pollution is caused by traffic emissions.\nI understand why people are concerned about the use of an ETRO. An implementation will happen much quicker than if a permanent scheme were being proposed and there is a belief the council may make it permanent at the end of the experimental period, despite majority opposition.\nI have taken a lot of interest in the Kings Heath and South Moseley scheme since the first phase was implemented in 2020. It was not initially done very well and quite a number of changes have had to be made. It involved a much bigger series of measures, over many more streets than the West Moseley scheme is proposing. As a result opinion became very divided with as many residents wanting to keep and expand the scheme as those opposing. It is also still not fully complete with changes to the West side of the High Street planned, to replace modal filters with diagonal filters, creating more one way streets and the East side of the High Street and Moseley measures yet to be installed. The right turn from Vicarage Road to Alcester Road South is to be re-instated, which will ease the traffic build up at that junction. The biggest cause of traffic build up in Vicarage Road has long been from Camp Hill Schools and that has not been reduced, although the Pineapple Station opening should have a positive impact.\nIt is clear, however that lessons have been learned and a huge amount of consultation has gone into the second phase.\nIn contrast with that scheme the impact of one filter in Moor Green Lane will be much easier to measure, as will the level of local support.\nI do urge everyone to go to one of the drop in events and talk to the officers and make them aware of how you feel both about the use of an ETRO and how you feel the scheme will affect you, whether it is positive or negative. I will be at both events as I do want to hear the feedback from residents.\nAlthough I have outlined why the scheme is being proposed, that does not mean I won’t take into consideration all the reasons people give for why they oppose or support it. I understand there is no proposal that will satisfy the needs of everyone.\nI hope this post helps at least explain why the proposal has come about and what it is trying to achieve.",

In June some workmen turned up, examined the drain cover and went away again. In July Izzy found out that Severn Trent were the company responsible and sent them a video via Twitter which seems to be the best method of corresponding with most utility company’s these days.\nSevern Trent duly supplied a job number and a promise to carry out a repair. In August Severn Trent’s contractors, Network Plus suddenly noticed due to patches in the tarmac that another unknown company had carried out a repair at the location on some unspecified date in the past. This they decided was a good reason to refer the job back to Birmingham City Council.\nIn the mean time a second manhole cover has become loose, so now we have double clanking. This second manhole cover has no signs of previous road repairs. Izzy duly made a further referral to Severn Trent with the request that if they have to go to all the trouble to close a junction to fix one manhole cover, two would not be such an extra burden. Unfortunately the computer says no department couldn’t see the logic of this at all.\nIzzy has now written to the Principal Traffic Officer who has allocated the job to Kier Highways and sent a stern letter to Severn Trent.\nMaybe the clanking will be fixed soon — watch this space!",

This has come about following years of campaigning by local residents who have gathered data and submitted petitions to evidence their concerns. We thank them for their persistence and welcome the proposals. We also hope this can help lead to a review of how we manage road safety across a wider area, taking into account other roads with similar issues.\n“As part of an area-wide safety scheme, the speed limit on Russell Road, Moseley and surrounding roads was reduced to 20 mph in October 2016. However, traffic surveys carried out in September 2020 show there are still some issues with vehicles speeding along the road.\nThere have also been concerns in recent years regarding a number of collisions along the road, with the most up to date data from the last five years (May 2017- 2022) showing there were 30 reported personal injury collisions. There has however been a reduction in the number of collisions reported on Russell Road since the city council implemented a safety scheme at the junction of Russell Road and Moor Green Lane in 2018.\nThree options have been developed with the aim of moderating vehicle speeds, continuing to reduce the likelihood of collisions and preventing dangerous overtaking along Russell Road. All three options, as part of the traffic calming measures, propose to introduce a new zebra crossing at the southern end of Russell Road, as well as link into existing proposals for a zebra crossing with parallel cycle crossing facility at the northern end of Russell Road which is part of the proposed Cannon Hill park to Moseley cycle route.\nThis consultation is part of the design process, to gain feedback on a preferred scheme from residents, businesses and people in the local area who could be impacted by the scheme”\nYou can take part in the consultation here: It closes 16th August.",

I sent a letter on behalf of Friends groups and residents expressing our concern that ending this contract would result in more issues of fly tipping, vehicle incursions and anti – social behaviour and compromise the security of buildings like the MAC. A short term saving would ultimately result in greater long term costs than renewing the current contract.\nAfter our letter, at the end of the trial, the contract was renewed for six months with a further review to take place before March.\nAt the Neighbourhoods Overview and Scrutiny Committee this week I asked Cllr Majid Mahmood if that review had taken place.

While car drivers are being kept away from the city centre, the measures that would enable drivers to switch to public transport are no longer a priority”.\nYou can read more in this report by Birmingham Live\n£5.2million was due to be allocated to the Camp Hill Line, £3.4 million for the University Station and £4.2 million for the Cross City Bus Scheme, however these funds are now relegated to only happen if the CAZ makes sufficient revenue.\nYou can see the full report here:\nThe proposed Clean Air City Fund would see an annual allocation of £20,000 to each ward (£40,000 for two member wards) for use against a defined catalogue of measures to aid sustainable transport and improve air quality\nThe projected net revenue from the CAZ for 2020 to 2030 has been lowered from £85.7 million to £44.6 million so it is even more imperative that revenue is prioritised on improving public transport links to actually help people reduce their dependency on cars.",

They also plan to drastically reduce the amount of plants produced and sold to the public at Cofton Garden Centre.\nI have launched a petition calling the council to think again, look at other options and reconsider this short sighted decision.\nKings Heath Park Nursery has served the local and wider community for many years providing a large variety of good quality, competitively priced plants in an attractive and welcoming setting within the park as well as a popular floristry service. People come from far beyond the local area to purchase their summer bedding and other plants. The floristry service offers a high class service for businesses and the public, offering bouquets, banquet, wedding and funeral flowers as well as providing floral displays for council functions.\nClosing the nursery will not only deprive Kings Heath Park of one of its major attractions, at a time when the council is trying to increase footfall, but it will also have a knock on impact on the nearby Cartland Tea Rooms that also brings income to the park and to the charity Thrive which operates from the old TV garden to offer therapeutic gardening programmes to people with a defined health, social or educational need.\nThe glass houses will not be maintained if the nursery is closed and will be vulnerable to vandalism. Once beyond repair they are unlikely to be restored and these valuable community buildings will be lost for good.\nPlug plants will no longer be bought and grown on by parks staff at the nurseries which will have an impact on the sale of hanging baskets and floral displays to BIDS and charities like Moseley in Bloom to enhance the city retail areas.\nNursery staff have been given very little information or notice of the closure and yet could offer a big insight into increasing the commercial opportunities of the nursery site.\nLittle thought appears to have gone into business development or exploring other models which could keep the nursery open, for example utilising volunteers and considering use of S106 monies or other funding streams.\nKings Heath Park Nursery/Garden Centre is a valuable and important part of the Kings Heath Community – the (now closed) School of Horticultural Training is in a listed building with English Heritage and offered training and apprenticeships. A history of Kings Heath Park’s association with horticulture can be found on Thrive’s website:\nhttps://www.thrive.org.uk/how-we-help/regional-centres-and-programmes/birmingham/thrive-birmingham-history\nMy petition calls on Birmingham City Council to recognise the importance of Kings Heath Park Nursery as a community asset and to do everything in its power to keep it open, growing and selling plants to the public.",

We are extremely concerned about this decision and the impact it will have on residents of Wake Green Park, particularly those in Bowen Court as they over look the site.\nWe have written to the Wake Green Park management company via their managing agents. Metro PM to make representations on behalf of residents:\nDear Metro PM\nWe have been contacted by a number of residents of Wake Green Park in Moseley concerning the sale of the wooded area at the rear of Bowen Court known as The Dell.\nWe understand from a conversation I had with a representative from Metro PM on 18th February that the Management board for Wake Green Park have instructed you to start the statutory process required to sell this land and that an offer of £500,000 has been received from MIA property group. If the land is sold MIA will presumably apply for planning permission to develop it as a separate site to Wake Green Park with the entry/exit from Yardley Wood Road.\nFrom our conversations with residents, who are also shareholders, it seems that although a vote was held two years ago to erect security gates at the site many were unaware of the sale of the Dell until they received notification via yourselves earlier this month.\nThey were also not made aware that The Dell was designated a nature conservation area by Birmingham City Council in 1985 and has a Tree Preservation Order. It is also the home to a badger sett.\nAlthough we understand that Wake Green Management board members are elected to represent their shareholders we are concerned that this significant decision, which will affect the many residents on the site, who have little or no access to green open spaces, has been made with insufficient consultation.\nWe are aware that leaseholders have a statutory period in which they could make an offer to purchase the land themselves, however we feel this is not a realistic option judging on the number of units in the estate and arguably the land does already belong to shareholders as part of their lease.\nWe are therefore writing to make representations to the Wake Green Management board to urge them to further consult with leaseholders to properly inform them of:\na) the history and significance of The Dell as a nature reserve, which has an abundance of wildlife including a protected badger sett and a TPO.\nb) the rationale behind the decision to sell the site.\nc) full details of how the revenue from the sale of the site are proposed to be used.\nWe are aware there is an AGM on 10th March and this would be an opportunity to discuss the issue with residents but we also urge the board to write to shareholders with this information if possible before the AGM.\nWe would be grateful for an acknowledgement of this email and that it has been forwarded to board members.\nBest wishes\nIzzy Knowles\nIzzy Knowles & Radley Russell\nMoseley Lib Dems\nLocal*Visible*Hands On",

These include the continuing lack of traffic studies and no detailed rationale on why this particular option has been chosen over the other five options that were presented at the meeting on 24th January 2018 (other than it received the highest number of votes from people who happened to attend the meeting).\nThe council has published a map showing their preferred alternative routes, (see below). They are hoping traffic currently using School Road as a cut through between Moseley & Kings Heath will be forced to use Alcester Road or Springfield Road, Billesley Lane & Wake Green Road.\nAlthough the closure will undoubtedly lead to a reduction of through traffic on School Road between Prospect Road and Valentine Road roundabout, (which is a good thing) it will not prevent drivers meeting each other on the bend. It is also hard to see why into city traffic used to entering School Road from Poplar Road or Ashfield Road, is likely to re-route along the already congested A435, or Springfield Road, rather than cut down Cambridge, Prospect or Greenhill Roads for a quicker route to Billesley Lane. Similarly in the evening, what is to stop traffic travelling out of city to use Oxford Road rather than busy Wake Green Road to reach Billesley Lane. All of these roads are residential side roads with similar problems to School Road. Even Springfield Road & Billesley Lane which are favoured alternative routes are not without traffic problems, with speeding and volume already an issue, frequent accidents at the junctions and even fatalities in the past. These are questions to which no answers have yet been given.\nRight from the beginning of this process I have argued that the best possible solution should be the one that addresses the problem, with the least impact on surrounding roads. It is also important that the community is fully consulted and involved in the process, and we are given the fullest information to enable the best possible decision. Without any impact traffic studies to inform and advise us it is hard to make informed comments.\nI have now joined a group of residents who are collecting our own data in an attempt to understand the traffic flow and volume of the area at peak times. We will make our findings available to the Council Officers and anyone else who is interested.

A service vehicle may only be there for a few minutes, and the bay is indicated purely to show that there is somewhere legal, safe and practical for operatives to park.

Make sure the UK cuts its emissions fairly and fully to stand the best chance of keeping 1.5°C alive\n2. Make sure the UK reverses the destruction of nature by 2030\n3. Involve citizens in deciding the fairest way forward\nIn her speech to the council Izzy thanked the children of Camp Hill Schools who inspired her to bring this motion to full council following their Climate Assembly in October. She called for positive and can do action from everyone, and encouraged them all to sign up to support the Climate and Ecology Bill.\nClimate change is something that worries people, especially young people, and it’s small wonder, given the scale of the problem.\nThe Climate & Ecology Bill, a private member’s bill is expected to go back before the House of Commons in early 2024. It seeks to address the challenges that this situation poses by creating a whole-of-government approach to deliver a net zero and nature positive future.\nBased on the latest science, the CE Bill aims to:\n• Align current UK environmental policy on the need to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030, which was goal agreed to at COP15, via the Kunming-Montreal Framework (22 December 2022) and;\n• Reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the UK’s fair share of the remaining global carbon budget to give the strongest chance of limiting global heating to 1.5°C, which was the goal agreed to at COP21, via the Paris Agreement (12 December 2015).\nBy bridging the gap between the UK Government’s current delivery and what has been agreed at international levels, Britain has a chance to be a world leader on climate and the environment; seizing the opportunities of the clean energy transition, including green jobs and skills, reduced energy bills and a boost for the UK’s food and energy security.",

We now have an action plan to build on the successful aspects of the schemes and improve on what is already in place’\nYou can see the full statement issued here:\nWe welcome the statement but feel it is very late in the day to commit with working with residents and businesses when this should have been right at the heart of the project at its launch 12 months ago. From even before the scheme was first announced Izzy has been calling for a holistic, community led traffic management plan across Moseley to address the many different issues we experience including speeding and anti social driving, congested and polluted roads, reducing through traffic, enabling walking and cycling and dealing with collision hot spots.\nSince the Tranche1 measures of the People for Places scheme were announced back in July 2020 Izzy has worked hard to ensure all voices have been heard in this programme, including engaging with residents through the Better Streets for Moseley group and Moseley Forum, helping with traffic counts, securing funding for hand held speed monitors for use by residents groups, making representations to councillors and officers on behalf of local businesses and residents. Izzy recently wrote on behalf of businesses in York Road who feel disenfranchised about the measures put in place and concern about lack of access for deliveries, to point out the councils own technical review into the scheme recommends some type of one way system and how this could be a compromise that would allow restricted vehicular access whilst still enabling hospitality businesses to benefit from a pedestrianised scheme which would also provide a welcome safe family area off the High Street. The review and technical review of the scheme are below\nIn March this year it was agreed that the design consultants, Jacobs would take part in a walking tour of the revised area for the proposed LTN to engage with residents and stakeholders. Disappointingly this still hasn’t happened. We are hoping with the release of this statement and appointment of a dedicated project board (although details of the make up or remit of this are not yet known) to see a huge improvement in the level of meaningful engagement and full consultation before further measures are implemented.\nIzzy and Radley will continue to scrutinise the scheme, including the proposed action plan, to obtain feedback from residents and try to ensure all voices are heard.",

I have not spoken to one person who doesn’t think it is a good idea.\nHaving secured the backing of Government and Regional authorities, the West Midlands Rail Executive, Transport for West Midlands (TfWM), West Midlands Railway and Network Rail are now working together on the track, signalling and service changes required.\nWe even had West Midlands Mayor Andy Street and Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling visit for a tour of the Moseley station site and the unveiling of the station designs. In a press release by West Midlands Railway in September Cllr Roger Lawrence, the Chair of West Midlands Rail Executive, said: “The Moseley line is part of the wider investment TfWM is making across our region”\nBut, the current plans to re-open the stations will result in a maximum of only two trains an hour. This is due to the lack of capacity for trains into New Street Station. In order to develop the line into a fully functioning commuter service, which connects not only to services from New St but also to HS2 when it arrives, we need the Camp Hill chords to be built. This is an extra section of track which would divert the line into Moor Street station and part of integral plans to create a Midlands rail hub so significantly increasing rail use across the region.\nThis is now all under threat\nIn 2013 the city’s Labour cabinet, despite representations from opposition and community groups, decided to sell off the piece of land on which the chords would be built. At that time, it would appear they clearly didn’t have any optimism that the project would ever take off like it has. 2013 Press article\nNow the inevitable has happened and the land the council sold off has a planning application to build a hotel, housing and retail complex. We understand the West Midlands Rail Executive, Transport for West Midlands, Midlands Connect and other Rail user groups are objecting to the proposed development.\nThe Camp Hill Chords are critical to the long term resilience and success of the rail network in and around Birmingham, to ensure effective public transport so minimising the need for vehicular traffic and enabling Birmingham to meet it’s emissions targets\nMoseley Liberal Democrats are calling for as many people to add their voice by commenting on the planning application Comment online here\nThe planning application number is 2018/09467/PA\nURGENT – We have until 1st March to make comments.\nBetter transport links are vital for Birmingham.\nLikeLike\nThanks Joanne.

I have copied the update below. It can also be found on their website I welcome the release of the details of Phase 2 measures and am supportive of the revised design, having given some initial feedback concerning access to Moseley Golf Club. I am however disappointed no provision has been made to take into account the potential impact on Boundary Roads. I will continue to ensure community representations are fed back to the councilto try to ensure the best possible scheme is implemented for the residents and businesses of Moseley. Cllr Izzy Knowles.\nCouncil Update on Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People project (phase 2) – September 2023\n“Places for People in Kings Heath & Moseley aims to reduce traffic in residential neighbourhoods so that it is safer for people to walk, wheel, and cycle and nicer to be outside, for children to play and neighbours to chat. A first phase of this scheme was delivered in 2020 in the form of temporary measures, which were made permanent in April 2022, with the intention that a second phase would implement a revised area-wide scheme.\nThe Outline Business Case for this next phase of the Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People project was approved by Cabinet in January 2023. Our specialist delivery team are now overseeing the completion of scheme designs and other points required to progress this to delivery.\nFollowing engagement with residents in Autumn 2022, some minor changes have been made to the final concept design layout ahead of delivery, specifically:\nthe addition of a modal filter at the junction of Yardley Wood Road and St Agnes Road (in place of the proposed one-way ‘gyratory’ by St Agnes church)\nthe introduction of a diagonal modal filter (south-west to north-east) at the junction of School Road / Greenend Road / Greenhill Road, instead of the existing modal filter on School Road (and in place of the proposed modal filters on School Road and Greenhill Road)\nmaking the section of Springfield Road between Addison Road and Institute Road one-way (northbound) along with consideration of any other traffic calming measures required here (as with Billesley Lane)\nA revised final concept design for Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People is shown below\nAn updated delivery programme is now being put in place based on a phased approach, with measures being delivered through separate packages as follows: 1) improvements to phase 1 measures to the west of the High Street – including the York Road pedestrian zone – which already have TROs in place. 2) new measures being introduced as part of phase 2 (to the east of the High Street) which will require new TROs – this includes modal filters, one-way streets, and traffic calming. 3) a 20mph speed limit across the project area, including on ‘boundary’ roads. 4) bus gate on Addison Road and reinstate a right turn from Vicarage Road onto High Street. Work is underway to complete design work, obtain internal approvals, advertise Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) including statutory consultation, and award construction contracts. Further details, including envisaged timescales, will be shared as available. Notwithstanding the requirement to comply with any spend restrictions in place in advance of the Council setting out its Financial Recovery Plan, the funding allocated to this scheme comes from grants and income which is ring-fenced for sustainable travel and environmental improvements. This funding was committed by the Council’s Cabinet on 17 January 2023 and due to the nature of the funding, it cannot be used to fund any wider financial pressures across the City Council.“",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_tag_news/content_172.html": "Last week the council published their proposals for the West Moseley Traffic Reduction Scheme. I wrote about the details here\nI would like to try to explain the rationale for the proposal to put a modal filter on Moor Green Lane using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO).\nFirstly, I would like to reassure residents there are no plans to put a similar filter on Russell Road. That option was considered by officers, who were looking at possibly incorporating it into the Cannon Hill Park to Moseley cycle lane extension, but it was not taken forward to the design stage.\nThe proposal for a filter on Moor Green Lane has come about due to the many concerns raised from residents of Russell Road, Reddings Road and Moor Green Lane about the volume of traffic, speeding and dangerous driving in residential roads in West Moseley. Some residents have been campaigning for action for many years.\nQueensbridge Secondary School and Moor Green Primary School report excessive volumes of traffic, inconsiderate parking and speeding. Many parents say they feel their children are unsafe travelling to school by bicycle or foot, and they have no option but to ferry them by car. There are also two special needs schools in the area, Uffculme and Fox Hollies.\nA traffic calming scheme proposed in 2022 for Russell Road was shelved in 2024 due to the excessive cost – approx. £620,000 pounds and rising. Costs of installing infrastructure have increased astronomically since Brexit and the Pandemic.\nIt was also felt that the scheme would not reduce the volume of traffic, which is a priority of the council as part of the Birmingham Transport Plan.\nOne modal filter in one location is much cheaper to install than a traffic calming scheme over a wider area. A modal filter in Moor Green Lane will likely cost less than a 10th of the previously proposed measures for Russell Road.\nAs much as everyone wants speed cameras, they are unlikely to be considered a priority for 20mph roads until there is a change of law. Speeding fine revenue goes straight to the government treasury and is used for general government expenditure. This means the cost of installation and maintenance of any speed cameras has to be met by the council and costs of administration of the offences are met by the police, with no revenue coming back other than for speed awareness courses, which does not cover the costs. There are currently only six speeding camera sites in Birmingham. Although work is on going to add more, they will inevitably be placed on arterial A routes within the city.\nNeither calming nor cameras will reduce traffic volume, which has got steadily worse in residential streets, mainly due to the use of satellite navigation systems.\nFaced with these barriers to addressing the many complaints and campaigns the council officers looked at a wider area than Russell Road. They discovered most of the traffic travelling through the West Moseley area comes via Moor Green Lane. They estimated if they stop the through traffic using this route it will reduce the amount of traffic using all the residential streets as a cut through by up to half and most of what will subsequently come into the area will be local.\nIt is anecdotally argued that local people are less likely to speed or drive dangerously in their own neighbourhoods. Indeed, if you look at roads where through traffic is restricted there is evidence of a much lower rate of collisions.\nLess traffic, fewer collisions and reduced amount of speeding will make the area much safer, especially outside the schools.\nThere is of course a potential for the traffic to be displaced to other roads. This is why the proposal would be undertaken with an experimental /trial order rather than an immediate permanent one. There would be monitoring of traffic volume and flows across the area before and after the filter is installed. If it doesn’t work or it causes undue problems to other roads it can be removed. The ETRO involves consultation prior to implementation and during the first six months of it being installed.\nThe advantage to installing a filter is safer, more pleasant streets, which for people who are able to cycle or walk or use a mobility scooter, will encourage and empower them to use their car less often.\nThe disadvantage is that if you do need to drive somewhere it may be slightly longer. But, overall the number of short journeys made by people will be reduced, as people use their cars less. That is not a bad thing, the major threat to air pollution is caused by traffic emissions.\nI understand why people are concerned about the use of an ETRO. An implementation will happen much quicker than if a permanent scheme were being proposed and there is a belief the council may make it permanent at the end of the experimental period, despite majority opposition.\nI have taken a lot of interest in the Kings Heath and South Moseley scheme since the first phase was implemented in 2020. It was not initially done very well and quite a number of changes have had to be made. It involved a much bigger series of measures, over many more streets than the West Moseley scheme is proposing. As a result opinion became very divided with as many residents wanting to keep and expand the scheme as those opposing. It is also still not fully complete with changes to the West side of the High Street planned, to replace modal filters with diagonal filters, creating more one way streets and the East side of the High Street and Moseley measures yet to be installed. The right turn from Vicarage Road to Alcester Road South is to be re-instated, which will ease the traffic build up at that junction. The biggest cause of traffic build up in Vicarage Road has long been from Camp Hill Schools and that has not been reduced, although the Pineapple Station opening should have a positive impact.\nIt is clear, however that lessons have been learned and a huge amount of consultation has gone into the second phase.\nIn contrast with that scheme the impact of one filter in Moor Green Lane will be much easier to measure, as will the level of local support.\nI do urge everyone to go to one of the drop in events and talk to the officers and make them aware of how you feel both about the use of an ETRO and how you feel the scheme will affect you, whether it is positive or negative. I will be at both events as I do want to hear the feedback from residents.\nAlthough I have outlined why the scheme is being proposed, that does not mean I won’t take into consideration all the reasons people give for why they oppose or support it. I understand there is no proposal that will satisfy the needs of everyone.\nI hope this post helps at least explain why the proposal has come about and what it is trying to achieve.",

The party is warning that those who aren’t given ‘Settled Status’ by the 30th June deadline could “become the victims of another Windrush-style scandal”.\nResponding to the figures, Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: “The Conservatives must guarantee the rights of EU citizens who’ve made their lives here, and contribute enormously to our economy, our public services and our society. They must not become the victims of a new Windrush-style scandal. “Over 320,000 of our friends and neighbours are facing the cruel anxiety of hoping the Home Office will grant their applications before the cliff-edge at the end of June.“There is a serious risk that hundreds of thousands of people will be left effectively undocumented and exposed to the Conservatives’ Hostile Environment.

It will be scrutinised, it will be challenged and it can and will be defeated.\n“Across the country, the Liberal Democrats are taking on the Conservatives and winning.\n“In rural Shropshire today – just like in Buckinghamshire in June – we have won the support of people who have always voted Conservative and people who have always opposed them.\n“Thousands of lifelong Conservative voters, dismayed by Boris Johnson’s lack of decency and fed up with being taken for granted.\n“And thousands of lifelong Labour voters, choosing to lend their votes to the candidate who can defeat the Conservatives.\n“People who believe that our politics should be about creating a better country for us all, not a nightly soap opera of calamity and chaos.\n“All of them, casting their ballots for the Liberal Democrats.\n“And let me say specifically to all those Labour supporters who lent me their votes today: thank you.\n“You have shown tonight that, together, we can defeat the Conservatives. Not with deals behind closed doors, but with common sense at the ballot box.\n“These are testing times for our country.\n“Our NHS, as we know here in Shropshire, is teetering on the brink.\n“Our rural economy is in a precarious state with people’s livelihoods at risk.\n“Our country is crying out for leadership.\n“Mr Johnson, you are no leader.\n“Many of your predecessors took office because they believed in a sense of national service. That they were duty bound to do what they believed is right for our country.\n“To represent all of us, even if we disagreed with them.\n“Mr Johnson, this is not how you operate.\n“Too often it is all about you and never about us.\n“Instead of taking action to help Shropshire’s NHS, you spend your time seeking questionable donations to refurbish your flat.\n“Instead of taking action to support Shropshire’s farmers, you spend your time misleading the nation on how you and your office partied during lockdown.\n“Tonight the people of North Shropshire have said enough is enough.\n“They have said that you are unfit to lead and that they want a change.\n“I want to pay tribute tonight to my party leader Ed Davey.\n“Ed, thanks to you it is the Liberal Democrats who are opposing Boris Johnson’s Government and winning. From Chesham and Amersham to North Shropshire, you lead our campaigns from the front.\n“I want to thank you personally for the support you have given me over the last few weeks.\n“Whether it is on the streets of Whitchurch or Wem, Oswestry, Ellesmere or Market Drayton, you have led the charge for change.\n“Finally, thank you most of all to all the people of North Shropshire.\n“Not just for your support throughout this campaign –\n“Not just for putting your faith in me to be your champion in Parliament –\n“But for all the hard work and sacrifices you have made over the past two years, to get our communities through this awful pandemic.\n“I will never take it for granted.\n“My priorities are your priorities: Improving our local ambulance service, GPs and hospitals.\n“Supporting our farmers and defending our rural way of life.\n“Helping our communities through this new wave of COVID.\n“As your MP, I promise I will work for you and only you.

West Midlands Police, and organisations like the CST and Tell Mama have reported a rise in both anti Semitic and Islamophobic hate incidents.\nYou can see Izzy’s speech to council here\nThe motion had two amendments from the Labour group which we accepted. The amended motion was overwhelmingly voted in favour. It reads:\nThis council recognises that the horrors and repercussions of the conflict in Palestine and Israel have had a profound affect across all communities, but notably the Muslim and Jewish communities here in Birmingham.\nWest Midlands Police, and organisations like the CST and Tell Mama have reported a rise in both Islamophobic and antisemitic hate incidents.\nIn Birmingham, we have seen incidences of antisemitic and Islamophobic graffiti, with more than two hundred tags of a racist, offensive, antisemitic or Islamophobic nature reported and removed since October 7th. We must not allow the tragic events in the Middle East to divide our communities in the city, and we understand and feel the pain of all people in the city, especially the Muslim and Jewish communities.\nThis Council condemns those who have used this crisis to whip up hatred, sow division, and spread misinformation in our city.\nThis council acknowledges that it has a duty of care to the people of Birmingham, and must lead the way in promoting peace, tolerance and respect.\nThis Council notes:\n- There is a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. It is likely that this will impact Gazans throughout 2023 and beyond.\n- An immediate and sustainable ceasefire is needed, so that aid can get into Gaza, the hostages can be freed, and work can take place to deescalate this horrific conflict. Save the Children have highlighted that more children have been reported killed in this conflict than the annual number of children killed across the world’s conflicts zones since 2019. The international community has a responsibility to work towards a peace process and a two-state solution.\n- It is unlikely that many Palestinians will be able to return home for a substantial time.\n- With Birmingham having a proud status as a City of Sanctuary for people fleeing war torn countries and persecution. It is important that we in Birmingham, together with other communities in the UK, prepare to accommodate any refugees from this conflict that seek re-location.\n- Building on the success of the Homes for the Ukraine Scheme, a similar package must be offered to refugees choosing to flee the conflict.\nThis Council therefore:\n- Will write to the Government seeking the provision of a support package for refugees fleeing the conflict and provide further aid to assist the UN Agencies in their humanitarian work so that British citizens can get home safely, and Palestinian people are able to stay in their homeland.”.\n- Will support the active engagement of the voluntary sector in delivering aid and support to refugees from the conflict.\n- Will proactively engage with any Government schemes to house refugees from the conflict to ensure that all refugees are given a warm welcome in Birmingham.\n- Calls on everyone in Birmingham to show tolerance and respect at this time of significant stress to many communities; especially those of the Muslim and Jewish faiths.\n- Will work with faith communities to explore setting up more third-party hate crime reporting mechanisms and write to the Home Secretary to urge Government to reverse its decision to downgrade the monitoring of non-crime hate incidents specifically related to antisemitism and Islamophobia so they can be logged by the police.”\nLiberal Democrats nationally have also called for an immediate bilateral ceasefire to get aid in, get the hostages out, and provide space to realise a political solution, ultimately with two states and a lasting peace.",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_2021_09_14_how-many-collisions-does-it-take-for-action-on-billesley-lane/content_195.html": "Last November Izzy wrote to our local Councillors and our Neighbourhood Police Sergeant and Police Inspector about the alarming frequency and seriousness of collisions on Billesley Lane. https://moseleylibdems.com/2020/11/30/action-needed-on-billesley-lane/\nSince then we have received lots of assurances , repainted white lines and in March Vehicle Activation Signs were installed to monitor and record speed. https://moseleylibdems.com/2021/03/17/vehicle-activated-signs-for-billesley-lane/\nWhat we have not seen is a reduction in racing, speeding or serious collisions.\nFollowing two further bad collisions, both in the early hours, within the last 10 days Izzy has once again written to our local Councillors and Police. as below:\nDear Kerry, Martin, Tom and Neil\nLast November I wrote to you all about the increase of serious collisions in Billesley Lane. Since that email at least another four serious collisions have occurred in the stretch of road between the One Stop shop and the Tennis Club. They are mainly situated at or near the two junctions, with Greenhill/Dyott and Oxford Roads. That is seven collisions in just over a year. The latest two collisions, within just over a week have occurred in the early hours. The majority of the collisions have involved young male drivers and speed is the biggest factor. These are not minor shunts. In every case cars have been damaged to such an extent they are written off. In some serious damage has been caused to property including garden walls, a front window and porch.\nA recent email from the Highways Engineer Garry Dalton in response to local resident’s continued concerns sets out the criteria for assessing roads for traffic safety measures as follows:\n“As you are aware the need for traffic safety measures are prioritised according to reported numbers of injury collisions with locations considered by the Capital Programmes teams for inclusion as a potential Local Safety Scheme. The Capital Programme team have recently evaluated all similar requests received to put together the Local Safety Scheme element of the Capital Programme for 2022/23 and Billesley Lane was not included. Typically, priority is given to sites that have 9 or more Road traffic collisions over a 3 year period, where injuries have been sustained.\nThe collision history for the length of Billesley Lane has been checked, for a period of 3 years to end of May 2021 to reveal that there have been three injury collisions recorded here. All three of these collisions resulted in slight injuries and speed was attributed as a contributing factor in only one of them.\nThis is not an exceptional collision history, in comparable terms, and therefore, based on this information, this location wouldn’t gain high enough priority for traffic calming measures when compared with other roads with adverse collision records”.\nI don’t know when the criteria of 9 serious injury collisions over a 3 year period was decided or re-assessed, I suspect it was some years ago, but it seems more attuned to a motorway or busy A road rather than an unclassified road in a residential suburb. By insisting collision history has to involve serious injuries it does not take into account the big improvements in safety to vehicle occupants, such as seat belts, air bags and vehicle design . It does not take into account other factors that make the location so dangerous to others such as proximity to residential and community premises, a church hall used daily by children groups, sports club, allotments, garage, local shop and now a take away/ restaurant with associated high number of children, pedestrians and cyclists. Nor does it consider the layout of the road and factors that increase the likelihood of collisions occurring.\nAnother reason I believe the criteria is flawed is that police are attending fewer collisions, especially if no injuries are reported. That means evidence of drink, drugs (including increasing use of nitrous oxide) and excessive speed as factors is not being recorded or assessed. Neither are the police gaining intelligence on increasing use of vehicles by young men for racing and cruising. Yet, photographs obtained by residents often show the huge impact these collisions are having on the local community. However this information is not acted on which results in a negative view of the authorities and a reduction in community confidence and relations.\nI would like to see a whole different approach to prioritising traffic safety measures based on a ‘near miss’ criteria involving the factors listed above rather than injury caused.\nI would also point out that 20 years ago a fatal collision did occur in Billesley Lane when a cyclist was killed in the early hours by a driver who misjudged the bends. Following that collision the current speed humps and pedestrian refuges were put in place, however despite a rise in volume of traffic accompanied by numerous and increasingly serious collisions no serious attempt has ever been made to address the obvious issues with the layout of the road.\nI am aware that the proposals for Tranche 2 of the Kings Heath / Moseley LTN are due to be released very soon. I am hopeful they include significant measures which will make a huge difference to the residents every day experience of living in or travelling along Billesley Lane. If they do not then I would urge you to reconsider the use of this years Ward Minor Measures Transport Programme. Would that be sufficient to install two chicanes at strategic points? At the very least some crash bollards could be installed to prevent vehicles leaving the road whilst consideration is given to what other measures are available and how to obtain funding.\nI remember well Councillor Trickett , when talking of the traffic issues in School Road, insisting that the safety of children is not something that can be compromised. I appreciate everything you have been trying to do but sooner or later someone is going to be killed in Billesley Lane in an incident where the warning signs have been apparent for years.\nVery best wishes\nIzzy",

They are a free place to go with children and a place that inspires people to learn and develop, and they are a quiet place to go to if things are difficult at home.\nWe have launched a petition to keep Sparkhill, Hall Green and Kings Heath libraries open. They are all well used by their local communities and it would be a tragedy to lose even one of them.\nPledge your support and Sign our petition here\nThe petition will be presented to full council at the budget meeting on 5th March",

Staff to help guide them to the right platform and train are crucial.\n“There are many people that need extra support to board trains. From wheelchair users to cyclists, having expert staff on hand is not just a comfort, it can be a necessity.”\n“There’s also tourists needing help to plan a journey, and the many people who don’t use a smartphone, as well as the million people in the UK who don’t have a bank account – how will they purchase tickets?”\nThe Birmingham Liberal Democrats are calling for an extension to the consultation period, and more thought on how train staff support the community.\nA Lib Dem staff member added “I use the trains several times a week and I regularly see the vital service that staff offer to customers, especially vulnerable people and those\nunable to access services in other ways. There is so much that just hadn’t been thought through about this proposal. We must fight to protect this vital service for our community.”\n“We will continue to campaign on this issue, but time is against us.

The trial would entail the gates being left open overnight to the car parks in seven parks across the city.\nEnding the gate locking contract will save the council money in the short term but has huge long term implications of the security of our parks after darkness. The gate locking crews have also previously assisted people in distress who may have intended to harm themselves in the parks after dark.\nThis is the letter received:\nFollowing concerns raised by Friends groups and residents I wrote to the director of Street Scene and Cabinet member to ask how the impact of the trial would be measured.\nI have received this reply with a briefing note listing all 34 parks where the locking service is used.

Once beyond repair they are unlikely to be restored and these valuable community buildings will be lost for good.\nPlug plants will no longer be bought and grown on by parks staff at the nurseries which will have an impact on the sale of hanging baskets and floral displays to BIDS and charities like Moseley in Bloom to enhance the city retail areas.\nNursery staff have been given very little information or notice of the closure and yet could offer a big insight into increasing the commercial opportunities of the nursery site.\nLittle thought appears to have gone into business development or exploring other models which could keep the nursery open, for example utilising volunteers and considering use of S106 monies or other funding streams.\nKings Heath Park Nursery/Garden Centre is a valuable and important part of the Kings Heath Community – the (now closed) School of Horticultural Training is in a listed building with English Heritage and offered training and apprenticeships.

From an engineering perspective the Bordesley chords need to be seen as part of the wider HS2 works, and it is felt that the onset of the Commonwealth Games in 2022 will give further impetus to this happening on time.\nThe political imperative is the next Mayoral election – Mayor Andy Street has made reducing congestion, and indeed beginning work on connecting the Camp Hill line back to the passenger network – as a key commitment.

I wrote about the details here\nI would like to try to explain the rationale for the proposal to put a modal filter on Moor Green Lane using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO).\nFirstly, I would like to reassure residents there are no plans to put a similar filter on Russell Road. That option was considered by officers, who were looking at possibly incorporating it into the Cannon Hill Park to Moseley cycle lane extension, but it was not taken forward to the design stage.\nThe proposal for a filter on Moor Green Lane has come about due to the many concerns raised from residents of Russell Road, Reddings Road and Moor Green Lane about the volume of traffic, speeding and dangerous driving in residential roads in West Moseley. Some residents have been campaigning for action for many years.\nQueensbridge Secondary School and Moor Green Primary School report excessive volumes of traffic, inconsiderate parking and speeding. Many parents say they feel their children are unsafe travelling to school by bicycle or foot, and they have no option but to ferry them by car. There are also two special needs schools in the area, Uffculme and Fox Hollies.\nA traffic calming scheme proposed in 2022 for Russell Road was shelved in 2024 due to the excessive cost – approx. £620,000 pounds and rising. Costs of installing infrastructure have increased astronomically since Brexit and the Pandemic.\nIt was also felt that the scheme would not reduce the volume of traffic, which is a priority of the council as part of the Birmingham Transport Plan.\nOne modal filter in one location is much cheaper to install than a traffic calming scheme over a wider area. A modal filter in Moor Green Lane will likely cost less than a 10th of the previously proposed measures for Russell Road.\nAs much as everyone wants speed cameras, they are unlikely to be considered a priority for 20mph roads until there is a change of law. Speeding fine revenue goes straight to the government treasury and is used for general government expenditure. This means the cost of installation and maintenance of any speed cameras has to be met by the council and costs of administration of the offences are met by the police, with no revenue coming back other than for speed awareness courses, which does not cover the costs. There are currently only six speeding camera sites in Birmingham. Although work is on going to add more, they will inevitably be placed on arterial A routes within the city.\nNeither calming nor cameras will reduce traffic volume, which has got steadily worse in residential streets, mainly due to the use of satellite navigation systems.\nFaced with these barriers to addressing the many complaints and campaigns the council officers looked at a wider area than Russell Road. They discovered most of the traffic travelling through the West Moseley area comes via Moor Green Lane. They estimated if they stop the through traffic using this route it will reduce the amount of traffic using all the residential streets as a cut through by up to half and most of what will subsequently come into the area will be local.\nIt is anecdotally argued that local people are less likely to speed or drive dangerously in their own neighbourhoods. Indeed, if you look at roads where through traffic is restricted there is evidence of a much lower rate of collisions.\nLess traffic, fewer collisions and reduced amount of speeding will make the area much safer, especially outside the schools.\nThere is of course a potential for the traffic to be displaced to other roads. This is why the proposal would be undertaken with an experimental /trial order rather than an immediate permanent one. There would be monitoring of traffic volume and flows across the area before and after the filter is installed. If it doesn’t work or it causes undue problems to other roads it can be removed. The ETRO involves consultation prior to implementation and during the first six months of it being installed.\nThe advantage to installing a filter is safer, more pleasant streets, which for people who are able to cycle or walk or use a mobility scooter, will encourage and empower them to use their car less often.\nThe disadvantage is that if you do need to drive somewhere it may be slightly longer. But, overall the number of short journeys made by people will be reduced, as people use their cars less. That is not a bad thing, the major threat to air pollution is caused by traffic emissions.\nI understand why people are concerned about the use of an ETRO. An implementation will happen much quicker than if a permanent scheme were being proposed and there is a belief the council may make it permanent at the end of the experimental period, despite majority opposition.\nI have taken a lot of interest in the Kings Heath and South Moseley scheme since the first phase was implemented in 2020. It was not initially done very well and quite a number of changes have had to be made. It involved a much bigger series of measures, over many more streets than the West Moseley scheme is proposing. As a result opinion became very divided with as many residents wanting to keep and expand the scheme as those opposing. It is also still not fully complete with changes to the West side of the High Street planned, to replace modal filters with diagonal filters, creating more one way streets and the East side of the High Street and Moseley measures yet to be installed. The right turn from Vicarage Road to Alcester Road South is to be re-instated, which will ease the traffic build up at that junction. The biggest cause of traffic build up in Vicarage Road has long been from Camp Hill Schools and that has not been reduced, although the Pineapple Station opening should have a positive impact.\nIt is clear, however that lessons have been learned and a huge amount of consultation has gone into the second phase.\nIn contrast with that scheme the impact of one filter in Moor Green Lane will be much easier to measure, as will the level of local support.\nI do urge everyone to go to one of the drop in events and talk to the officers and make them aware of how you feel both about the use of an ETRO and how you feel the scheme will affect you, whether it is positive or negative. I will be at both events as I do want to hear the feedback from residents.\nAlthough I have outlined why the scheme is being proposed, that does not mean I won’t take into consideration all the reasons people give for why they oppose or support it. I understand there is no proposal that will satisfy the needs of everyone.\nI hope this post helps at least explain why the proposal has come about and what it is trying to achieve.",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_tag_wake-green-raod/content_114.html": "On 1st June Clr Izzy Knowles went on a walk about with local residents, Cabinet member for Transport, Cllr Liz Clements, Cllr Jenkins and the Highways Engineer Garry Dalton to point out and discuss road traffic issues, especially speeding in Yardley Wood Road and Wake Green Road.\nIzzy has made previous representations for a pedestrian crossing to be installed on Yardley Wood Road. She has also talked with the Highways Engineer about adding double yellow parking restrictions on Wake Green Road outside Moseley and St Bernards Schools.\nAfter the walkabout she sent a further email to Birmingham City Council:\nDear B’ham Connected team\nYesterday Cllr Jenkins and I together with Cllr Clements , Highways Engineer Garry Dalton and local residents completed a walk about of Yardley Wood Road, Moseley between Swanshurst Lane/Coldbath Road and Wake Green Road.\nThis is a boundary road in the Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People scheme.\nAs part of the scheme this section of Yardley Wood Road is due to become 20mph. So is Wake Green Road from Yardley Wood Road to St Mary’s Row.\nTwo things were raised during the walkabout which we would be very grateful if you could consider in the final design of the scheme.\nFirstly – There is a big need for a pedestrian crossing on Yardley Wood Road. This could be one of two locations – where there are currently pedestrian refuges. The first is just after the junction of Windermere Road where many families and children cross to go to Windermere Playing Fields and Moseley school and the other is opposite the entrance to Moseley Bog. I have suggested in my previous feedback to the PfP scheme that if funding is the issue the proposed pedestrian crossing on Billesley Lane could be re-located to Yardley Wood Road. My rationale for this is Billesley Lane will have chicanes and speed humps which should reduce speeding considerably, whilst Yardley Wood Road is reduced to 20mph with no further measures.\nSecondly: Hayfield Road is used as a cut-through between Yardley Wood Road and Wake Green Road and a number of speeding-related collisions have occurred. It is currently 30mph. Residents there have petitioned for calming measures and are concerned traffic will increase due to the PfP scheme. Wake Green Road, between Swanshurst Lane and Yardley Wood road is currently also 30mph. There are two schools along it’s length, Moseley School and St Bernards Primary School. St Bernards in particular has reported issues with speeding including a car overturning at 8.30 am outside the school on a school day a few weeks ago. Both schools are trying to encourage pupils to walk or cycle but safety is a huge concern to staff and parents. We discussed yesterday that these two roads could be added to the TRO to also be made 20mph as part of the PfP scheme and it would not add significantly to the cost. This seems a very sensible and cost-effective action to take to address the real and increasing issue of speeding on these roads, to assist both schools with their active travel plans and reassure residents.\nI look forward to hearing more about the design and the progress of the scheme in order to update residents.\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nCouncillor Izzy Knowles\nIzzy has received a reply:\nDear Cllr Knowles,\nThank you for sharing these comments with us following your recent site visit.\nI have forwarded these onto the project team responsible for producing the detailed design for the Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People project to take into account as part of this work.\nWe are meeting with them shortly to discuss how to keep people informed of developments over the next few months as this scheme progresses to delivery, and will update you further following this.\nRegards, Joe\nJoe Green\nTravel Demand Manager – Transport Planning & Network Strategy\nBirmingham City Council",

The chords are required to be constructed in order that the Camp Hill passenger service from Kings Norton to Birmingham can be upgraded from the initial two trains an hour to a full commuter line once it reopens to passenger services in 2021\nPlease see my blog of 1st March when the implications of the planning application first became known.\nThese are my latest comments:\nRe: Planning Application 2018/09467/PA, 193 Camp Hill, Highgate, Birmingham, B12 0JJ\n“I appreciate that the applicant has made some alterations to the plans in order to try to allow construction of South West Bordesley Chord at a future date. However,I am aware that the West Midlands Rail Executive (WMRE) and Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) have expressed their objection to the revised plans on the grounds that the detailed plans for the chords cannot be drawn up before this application is decided. If built, the development envisaged in these plans is likely to affect both the constructability of these chords and also lead to objections from the residents and businesses that the development will introduce into the land adjoining the railway.\nThe Moseley community has been campaigning for the reopening of the Camphill Railway Line for passenger traffic for well over 40 years. Plans and funds are now in place for that to happen. However, the reopening is being achieved on the original lines that take the Camphill service round by St Andrew’s Junction to New Street Station. Because of the lack of capacity at New Street all that can be offered is a half-hourly service. The only way for the large number of people living within walking distance of the Hazelwell, Kings Heath and Moseley Stations to be offered a more frequent rail connection is by building chords at Bordesley so as to take the Camphill Line into Moor Street Station. It would be a very big blow for Balsall Heath, Stirchley, Kings Heath and Moseley residents if this development prevented the chords being built and the line becoming a full commuter service. The number 50 bus service is already over capacity and the air pollution on the A435 route into city is a cause for concern to many residents. The way we travel needs to be radically changed and this rail improvement is of paramount importance in achieving those changes.\nI therefore urge that Planning Committee refuse this application – or require it to be reduced to the point where WMRE and TfWM are content that it will not prevent the future construction of railway chords at Bordesley”.\nIzzy Knowles\nProspective Parliamentary Candidate for Birmingham Hall Green",

An amendment from Baroness Hamwee to preserve the right of UK nationals living in the EU to bring non-British family members with them if they return to the UK was passed this afternoon.\nAnother amendment passed tonight, tabled by Liberal Democrat peer Jonny Oates, to force the Government to provide EU citizens in the UK who are granted Settled or Pre-Settled Status with physical proof of their migration status – instead of the digital-only proof under the Government’s current system.\nIzzy wrote a letter in support of this amendment as part of the campaign. https://deniedmybackup.org.uk/\nShe wrote: ‘I have recently helped two gentleman in their 80’s to get settled status. One Swedish and one Italian. They have both lived in the UK since their 20’s, contributing to our economy and community for over 60 years. One worked as a nurse in the NHS and the other opened a string of restaurants throughout the Midlands. Both these gentleman were very confused and upset when they learned they would not be given physical proof of their settled status. The Italian gentleman does not use email and will be totally reliant on his son’s help if and when he is asked in future to prove his status in the UK. He is a proud man and does not want to have to bother his son.\nThey are both eligible to apply under the Windrush scheme – but it is more paperwork, involves sending their passport to the Home Office and is not something I am qualified to help them with. Even then a card will only be valid until 2024. Both have found obtaining settled status stressful already, they were in denial about it for some time. They have had difficulty understanding why they would need to apply to two schemes and so far have not taken the Windrush opportunity. People need to prove their immigration status throughout life – when seeking a new job opportunity, finding a place to live or getting treatment in hospital. Where British citizens use their passport as proof and non-EU citizens have a biometric residence card as backup, EU citizens can only prove their new immigration status through the Home Office website. If any one part of the digital checking process fails, people without a physical form of backup will be vulnerable. We should not have a two-tier system for proving the right to stay in the UK, with inferior access for EU citizens. A digital-only immigration status will create new barriers for EU citizens – especially the elderly and most vulnerable, who may not have the necessary digital skills and who need alternative ways of accessing services. This is not a fair way to treat our friends and neighbours. I worry about my two elderly gentlemen if they are asked to prove their status, especially if it were in a stressful situation such as needing urgent medical treatment.’\nThe bill will now go to the House of Commons.

  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_author_izzyknowles13_page_7/content_214.html": "Update 4/2/18: The letter we recently sent to residents included ‘inconsiderate parking’ as one of the factors causing traffic issues on School Road. The impact survey reports an increased level of parking on that stretch of School Road at school pick up/drop off times. However the parking noted was not illegal and the narrowness of the road and lack of view from either end are also contributing factors. It is also important to note issues occur at all times of the day and not just during school times.\nResidents are calling for action to deal with the poor driving they are experiencing daily on the section of School Road from the roundabout outside Kings Heath Primary School to the junction with Prospect and Ashfield Roads.\nWe are concerned that not enough consultation has been done with people who do not use Facebook and who were not aware of or did not attend, the public meetings.\nWhat are the issues?\nThe issues faced by all users and residents of this route are:\n*Drivers regularly mounting and driving along the the pavement to pass oncoming traffic.\n*Aggressive behaviour from vehicle drivers including driving aggressively, verbal aggression, and physically intimidating behaviour.\n* Noise caused from horns and traffic grinding to a halt at numerous times of the day and week\n*Vehicles being driven at speed.\nThe current situation is dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. It is affecting the quality of life for residents and users of this road . School Road is an important access route to two local schools and is heavily used by children and families on foot at all times. Their safety, and that of other road users, is a risk.\nYou can see a video produced by School Road Action Group here:\nWhat are the solutions?\nAt a public meeting on 24th January 2018 six possible solutions were proposed by Councillor Trickett. They are listed below.\nIf you are unable to view the jpeg images we have included the six options as pdf files below .

(We now have a copy of the Traffic Impact Study dated 9/10/17 – please see below)\n*One way systems may need traffic calming to prevent increased speeding. Traffic calming humps are not good for motor cycles or cyclists and can increase pollution.\n*It could be dangerous for cyclists to travel two ways in a one way system, but preventing them from doing that would inconvenience cyclists when we are trying to encourage more cycling and could cause cyclists to ride on pavements .\n*A short two way system between two one way systems at the junction of Greenhill Road could be hazardous. This is already a difficult junction to manoeuvre out of.\n*Preventing traffic turning from High St into Valentine Road would lead to more congestion and tail backs and more traffic going up Poplar Road (and possibly Woodbridge Road/St Mary’s Row / Oxford Road)\n*Parking restrictions (option 4)with passing bays could be easily trialled but may not be enforced. There would be a displacement of parking to near by roads.\n*The Moseley triangle, Billesley Lane & Oxford Road could all be negatively impacted by larger volumes of traffic. (Before traffic calming was put into Billesley Lane in the late 90’s there was a fatal and several very serious accidents at the junction of Dyott Road).\n*Emergency vehicles may struggle to get through with options 5a & 5b. (It was suggested bollards could be removable)\n*Options 5a & 5b are different to the first 4 as they discourage vehicles from the whole region as opposed to one or two roads.\n*Options 5a & 5B could lead to the blocked off roads being used for car parking especially during school drop off and pick up times.\nTRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY\nWe have now obtained a copy of the Traffic Impact Study which you can see below together with all the appendices.\nNB: This study was undertaken in July & August 2017 to look into the impact on surrounding roads of the original proposed one way system (School Road between Blenheim Road & Valentine Rd/Springfield Rd/Poplar Road roundabout) which went out for consultation in June/July 2017 but was not progressed.\nAs the recent revised options also include one way systems along the same stretch we believe the report is still relevant although we would recommend it be updated if any of these schemes are taken further and made available as part of that consultation.\nTraffic Impact Study 9/10/17\nAppendix A – C1406 RTA Stats\nTables B1+B2\nDiagram C1\nDiagram C2\nDiagram C3\nTable C13\nTable C14\nTable C16\nTable C17\nTable C18\nTables C1-C3\nTables C4-C6\nTables C10-C12\nTables C7-C9\nDiagram D1\nTables D1-D4\nTables D5-D8\nTables D9-D12\nTables D13-D16\nTables D17-D20\nDiagram E1\nDiagram E2\nDiagram E3\nDiagram E4\nDiagram E5\nDiagram E6\nDiagram E7\nDiagram E8\nDiagram E9\nDiagram E10\nDiagram E11\nDiagram E12\nTables E1-E5\nTables E7-E11\nExisting Junction – AM Peak ARCADY Results\nExisting Junction – PM Peak ARCADY Results\nOne Way Scheme – AM Peak ARCADY Results\nOne Way Scheme – PM Peak ARCADY Results\nImse_gd_436 School Road (Option 2 – One-Way restriction)\nWhat happens now:\nCouncillor Trickett is seeking feedback on all the 6 options with the aim of one or two being put forward to a wider reaching public consultation and possibly trialled.\nYou can send feedback to:\nGill Brook\nDavid Clayfield\nWhat are your local Lib Dems doing:\nWe will be talking to residents over the coming weeks to gauge public opinion and would like to hear your thoughts on all of the options.\nYou can send us a message via our contact page, email moseleylibdems@gmail.com\nor call Izzy on 07784 155208\nWe are looking for the best solution to address the issues with the least impact on surrounding roads.

It may have been built as the engineering workshop and coach house for Uffculme Hall and is part of the Cadbury family history. It was used for community meetings and believed it may have been the base for the Pocket Testament League\nIn 1970 the land and buildings were bequeathed to Birmingham City Council and used as a base for the Parks department.

Representations were made by various organisations, including Moseley Forum, Highbury Orchard, and Kings Heath & Moseley Shed as well as both Moor Green Lane and Russell Road Residents Associations. There was also a petition. The site was withdrawn from sale following the concerns raised and a presentation at a Moseley Forum meeting. The important local interest, as well as the difficulties with traffic flows were the reasons given for ‘disposal for residential’ being rejected and withdrawal of the property for sale.\nThe same happened in 2020 when again it was put on a disposal list by BCC. Councillor Lisa Trickett gave assurances at that time that ‘no development would occur on this site and no future decision would be made on its use until ‘we are clear on how it might fit to securing a wider community asset and viable future for Highbury Hall‘.\nIn the past few years local organisations including Highbury Orchard and Moseley and Kings Heath shed have expressed interest to explore the possibility of taking it over, restoring it and opening it for community use working with the local schools and trusts, such as the Uffculme Centre in the nearby locality. Their requests have never been formally considered. There has also been interest from two nearby schools to enable them to extend provision, however this has never got off the ground either.\nI have now written to the director of Place Prosperity & Sustainability at Birmingham City Council to make my objections to the site being auctioned without prior consultation with local councillors (we were not informed of the latest auction listing) and the local community.\nI have received a reply and hope to progress a dialogue and remove the site from sale.",

The revised scheme for Moseley is not fundamentally about resolving traffic problems in Moseley.\nThis is what we said about the Council’s original consultation which took place in late 2021:\n“This is a scheme to reduce traffic in residential areas, particularly for shorter distances, and to promote walking and cycling. We support such broad aims but would only support an evidence-based solution that works and that does not divide communities”.\nThis is what we will do if we are elected as councillors on 5th May:\n- We will take up our places on the Project Review Board set up by the Council to manage Places for People. It is currently made up of four Labour councillors and two Labour MPs.\n- We would examine the evidence and rationale behind the new proposals and any modelling that has taken place. We are especially concerned about the impact on the less mobile and the boundary roads and would want reassurances as to how those things are to be addressed.\n- As Councillors we would have the power to refer the project to a scrutiny committee and to insist on a full consultation before implementation. Currently the plan is for the proposals to be signed off by cabinet and then implemented under an Experimental Traffic Order (which means they would install the measures and consult during the first six months).\n- We will insist on before and after traffic modelling and robust air pollution monitoring to assess the impact of any changes.\nThe Birmingham Lib Dems are in favour of increasing cycling provision, making our streets safer by use of average speed cameras, better enforcement against anti-social driving and parking and lobbying for a decent public transport system that encourages people away from cars.\nIzzy & Radley – Liberal Democrat candidates for Moseley Ward",

This is part of a move to close ticket offices across the country.\nGroup Leader Roger Harmer commented: “I am alarmed by the fact that people have had just 3 weeks to respond to this consultation. This does not give enough time for people to think through how this might impact them and their dependants.\n“At this time of year, lots of people are on holiday. Parents and children are focused on finishing the school year. It’s a busy time. Giving people just three weeks to respond to a consultation means that many people will not have the time to think this through.\n“Come September, parents will be putting their 11-year-old children onto trains, bound for new schools. Staff to help guide them to the right platform and train are crucial.\n“There are many people that need extra support to board trains. From wheelchair users to cyclists, having expert staff on hand is not just a comfort, it can be a necessity.”\n“There’s also tourists needing help to plan a journey, and the many people who don’t use a smartphone, as well as the million people in the UK who don’t have a bank account – how will they purchase tickets?”\nThe Birmingham Liberal Democrats are calling for an extension to the consultation period, and more thought on how train staff support the community.\nA Lib Dem staff member added “I use the trains several times a week and I regularly see the vital service that staff offer to customers, especially vulnerable people and those\nunable to access services in other ways. There is so much that just hadn’t been thought through about this proposal. We must fight to protect this vital service for our community.”\n“We will continue to campaign on this issue, but time is against us. The consultation ends on Wednesday 26 July, and we will only be heard if we respond in number. We encourage Birmingham residents to respond to the consultation here.",

It had been rumoured that Attock Cricket club were planning to take over the fields, to build a club house and extend their facilities with a new cricket pitch. Residents had already had to stop council workers from mowing some of the long grass at the side of the field, which is especially left untouched due to nesting birds and other wildlife. At the public meeting Councillor Lisa Trickett promised there would be no buildings or loss of use to dog walkers or families and a full public consultation would take place, as part of any bid to use the fields.\nOn 27th June, after a long period of silence and with no public consultation having taken place, I discovered that on 19th May Springfield Councillors had signed off a Local Innovation Fund bid (council funds) for £20,000 to assist Attock Cricket club to cut hedges, cut overgrown grass, trim trees, hedges & shrubs, scarify, roll, aerate, seed and fertilise the field. Further funding had been obtained / was being considered to lay one astro turf and two grass squares at the site and for a pavilion and changing rooms. There were many inaccuracies and mis- information in the bid including that the field is neglected and under used and that the club was working with Friends of Moseley bog, neither of these statements were true. The bid had also failed to take into account the ecological and architectural importance of the fields, the impact on wildlife or the huge impact on parking and noise nuisance to residents living in close proximity to the field. Finally there was no consideration of a covenant on the land, which is believed to have been bequeathed to the city for use for dog walking and recreation.\nI further discovered that the bid was due to go to cabinet the following day, on 28th June for full approval. This was brought to the attention of about 35 residents who came to a meeting that evening at the cricket club to discuss the bid. At that meeting Councillor Rehman declined the request to pull the bid from the next days cabinet meeting, despite the clear concerns and objections to the bid in its current form, by every resident there. Representations were then made at a Moseley Forum meeting the same evening which resulted in the bid being pulled the following day.\nYou might find it interesting to see the reason put forward for withdrawing the bid and the comments made in answer to a question by Councillor Jon Hunt (the Liberal Democrat leader) . You need to click on Cabinet Committee – Local Leadership 28th June – then no 7, Local Innovation Fund. The relevant times are 03:50, 15:20, 20:28 & 22:04 to 23:19\nOn 10th July 2017 Councillor Trickett finally sent an email to some of the residents concerned putting their minds at rest that this particular development was not going ahead.\nWax Wings in the Fields – February 2017\nI am now helping Friends of Moseley Bog and local residents to set up a Friends of Windermere Fields to protect this beautiful piece of open space against future, poorly thought out land grabs. There are still opportunities for local cricket clubs to play cricket on the field, without having exclusive access. I will post further updates in due course, but if you would like to know more or to join the new friends group please contact me via my contact page.",

She has proactively maintained a close contact with our teams, and has contributed by providing feedback regarding delivery of services and needs identified from her various engagements with partners, hosts/guests and her constituents. This has helped us to continue to improve our services.\n“Cllr Harmer was also involved with the Homes for Ukraine scrutiny panel earlier this year – and has since been following the development of the services/improvements on the areas identified.\n“The delegation heard me (Marsela) and my team, about the ‘Homes for Ukraine’ project – and the solidarity and support given to Ukrainians fleeing the war. The delegates also heard the ‘lived experiences’ stories from Ukrainian guests, who currently live in Birmingham – and we all shared a deeper understanding of the situation facing people back in Ukraine: and their desire to keep education and learning at the centre of rebuilding Ukraine.\n“Participants from Zaporizhzhia City brought a letter of appreciation from their Mayor for the Lord Mayor of Birmingham, Cllr Chaman Lal, expressing their gratitude for the welcome and support provided by BCC and its partners to the Ukrainian guests. This was received gratefully by the two councillors present, on the Lord Mayor’s behalf.\n“We all committed as organisations – and individuals – to continue to support the Ukrainians who are now part of our community of Birmingham; and to maintain communication, and strengthen our relationship, via future collaborations.”",

It genuinely makes us feel angry and ashamed of what our government is allowing, what our government is doing, what our government is showing not just to Europe but the rest of the world. The government’s behaviour in this regard could have baleful consequences for UK citizens travelling to the EU in future and could further sour our already damaged relationships with EU member states. The outcry, and the amazing scenes in Glasgow, where an attempted deportation on the day of Eid al-Fitr was stopped by a passionate, welcoming crowd, illustrates that, more than ever, citizens’ rights need to be defended for everyone.

I prepared a question to ask Cllr Saima Suleman – the Cabinet lead for Digital, Culture, Heritage & Tourism to ask if she would consider extending the Library Consultation, due to end on Wednesday 17th July, because of the General Election.\nHowever, I was not called by the Lord Mayor in the time limit given for verbal questions. I therefore later emailed the question to Cllr Suleman. I am sad to say I have not even received an acknowledgement.\nThe question is as follows:\n‘Dear Cllr Suleman\nI hoped to ask you this question at full council on Tuesday but I was not called by the Lord Mayor.\nHas any consideration been given to extending the first phase of the consultation please, due to the distraction of the recent general election and the possible change of direction on regional and LA funding considering we have a new Government in office?\nThe potential closure and loss of our library services is very controversial, as is evidenced by the strength of feeling in the number of ongoing questions, petitions, events and protests we are all aware of.\n3771 questionnaire responses received on Be Heard does not seem representative of a population of over 1.1 million people and does not correspond to the number of people who have signed petitions.\nPlanned Face to face events which could have obtained more detailed feedback, especially from people who might find filling in a 30-minute questionnaire daunting, have now been postponed to the second phase. This does not send a good message that initial feedback is being taken seriously.\nMembers who may have assisted the last few weeks in promoting the consultation have instead understandably been involved in election campaigning.\nThe libraries portfolio has recently been transferred to the Neighbourhoods Overview and Scrutiny committee, but that group has not had the opportunity to consider the budget implications and does not meet again until late July.\nThe restructuring of the library service has potential impact on our communities, especially young people for decades to come. It is imperative the council listens to its residents and gets this right. Save Libraries campaign groups have already stated they feel this consultation is deeply flawed.\nWould you please consider extending the consultation at least to the middle of August, if not longer ? This would allow more responses to be made but also give more children and families chance to take part when school breaks up for the holidays.\nI look forward to your reply\nBest wishes\nIzzy’\nCouncillor Izzy Knowles\nMoseley Ward\nBirmingham City Council",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_page_4/content_138.html": "Earlier this year Izzy wrote to the owner of this land in Sandford Road which had become a dumping ground for furniture and other rubbish. The council will not collect fly tipping from private land. After further contact with the owner last month we are pleased to say the land has been cleared and the fence repaired which should prevent further dumping.\nMoseley Hive comes to town\nIzzy helped clean up the old Pizza Express in Moseley today. We are very excited to work with Moseley Community Development Trust to make good use of this empty retail space for the community over the next three months.\nIzzy & Radley lobby for more Moseley roads to be included on the councils resurfacing programme.\nThe Council has published its proposed list of roads and footways for resurfacing treatments in the 2021/22 Highway Maintenance Works Programme.\nThe list has a total of 183 carriageway and footway schemes across the City, but disappointingly Moseley only gets three of them. The roads to be done are School Road, Stoney Lane and Yew Tree Road. While we very much welcome the inclusion of these three roads, with around 150 roads in total in Moseley, having just three resurfaced and no footways done, is not good for our area. Last year only one road in the ward, Belle Walk was re-surfaced so at this rate it would take over 50 years to reach the whole ward without even thinking of footpath resurfacing.\nIzzy and Radley have submitted petitions signed by local residents to Kevin Hicks, the Assistant Director of Highways and Infrastructure at Birmingham City Council for both Chantry Road and Anderton Park Road to be added to this years list. Chantry Road is a cycle route and school street with a very poor and dangerous surface. Anderton Park Road is similarly also full of potholes, especially the section between Stoney Lane and Woodstock Road and is also a street used by school pupils. Pot holes and splits in the tarmac are not only dangerous for cyclists and motor cyclists they also cause damage to vehicles so increasing pollution in our atmosphere.\nYou can sign the petitions here:\nChantry Road Anderton Park Road\nThe Council are asking for feedback on the programme, so there is still a chance to change it – please let us know if there are other roads you would like us to lobby to be added to the programme and we will push hard for them to be done, if not this year then included in the next round of investment .\nThe Council anticipate that this years programme will commence towards the end of August 2021, but timing is still to be confirmed.\nAlcohol Restricted Zone no longer valid in Moseley\nLast week Izzy wrote to Sergeant Tom O’Keeffe asking for increased patrols in Moseley Village and for enforcement of the Alcohol Restricted Zone (ARZ) . This was following a number of reported incidents of damage to, and theft from businesses, rowdy and drunken behaviour on the village green and fighting, which she witnessed, in the churchyard. Businesses have reported that customers are put off from visiting them due to the anti social behaviour of a group, which includes some new faces. They are loud, intimidating and sometimes aggressive. They dominate the benches and the bus stop and are now regularly causing issues in the church yard. They are drinking alcohol in the street, steadily from morning until night time.\nSince Izzy’s email there have been more patrols by the PCSO’s and visits to the businesses mostly affected, which is welcome but is not addressing the real problem.\nWhat is concerning is Sgt O’Keeffe also confirmed that officers were not enforcing the ARZ as he has been advised by his licensing officer that it had been superseded by the Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) introduced in 2017 and is no longer valid .\nThe PSPO itself expired in October 2020 and was not renewed by Birmingham City Council, despite calls from the local Police and community groups such as Moseley Forum and Moseley Society. A scrutiny report issued in October 2020 explains the council wished to introduce a new process for implementing PSPO’s which would be introduced ‘in the coming year’.\nThe local police have this month submitted an evidenced report to Birmingham City Council for consideration of renewal of the Moseley & Kings Heath PSPO. A decision is not expected until at least the autumn.\nIzzy has written to the council licensing department to clarify the situation with regard to the Alcohol Restricted Zone, originally introduced in 2003, which is still listed on the council website and advertised with signage in the village and beyond.\nIn the meantime though that signage is not worth the metal it is written on. No one is taking any notice of it and the police are not enforcing it. That is not good news for the businesses or the residents of Moseley over this coming summer.\nTree Preservation Order for Church Road\nEarlier in June we wrote about a case where Izzy helped some tenants whose new landlord had turned their home into a building site. See the post here\nShortly after that post Izzy was alerted by nearby residents that a beautiful and established copper beech tree had been felled at the front of the same premises. Izzy went to speak to the contractors, but was unable to prevent it being removed. The road is not in a conservation area and the tree was not protected with a TPO.\nA year ago Izzy had written to the council tree officer asking for that particular tree to be preserved by a TPO , however sadly that hadn’t happened.\nThe recent decision to refuse the planning application for the building had even mentioned three trees at the property, including the lost copper beech, being of public amenity value. The lack of a specific arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan had contributed to the decision for refusal.\nAfter the tree was felled Izzy immediately contacted the tree officer again and arranged a site visit. As a result a TPO has now been authorised to protect the two remaining lime and copper beech trees.\nA star for Steve\nIzzy and Radley have been helping a local resident from Moseley, Jim the Hat and his friends, put together a petition to get a star on Broad St for Brummie rock legend Steve Gibbons. Jim is a big fan and has wanted to do this for a long time. We’ve talked to the Westside BID manager and we’ll make a case and Jim can present the petition, probably at the end of July.\nSteve was born in Harborne in 1941, and in July will celebrate his 80th birthday. He still lives in Birmingham and has devoted his many talents to the city, including years of fund raising for causes such as Birmingham Children’s Hospital.\nBroad Street is currently undergoing a transformation, with the addition of a tram service which will bring more people to enjoy this special part of our city. What better time could there be to celebrate the re-opening of the area with a new star recognising the life and works of an iconic local Brummie in his 80th year\nFive years on ….\nFive years on from that referendum and Vote Leave’s broken promises, it is the people who didn’t have a vote who are the most affected. We have upped our campaign to find EU nationals who have not yet applied or are having difficulty with Settled Status. In the past eighteen months Izzy & Radley have written letters to EU/EEA/Swiss national’s across Hall Green constituency informing them of the deadline to apply on 30th June, asking them to spread the word and offering assistance with applications.\nRecently they contacted the Business Improvement Districts across Birmingham asking them to advertise the scheme, especially to the hospitality industry. Mike Olley of Westside BID responded by offering to contact every EU national employed in his BID area. His efforts and blog post were reported by Birmingham Live here\nSeveral people have replied to the letters, one of whom was Gabriella Muller of Kings Heath. She agreed to be interviewed by Birmingham Live to help appeal to other EU nationals across Birmingham.\nGabriella said in her interview: “Izzy had sent me a letter six month ago and I thought I would keep it.”But even then I still didn’t fully appreciate what I had to do and it was only when my friend went to the embassy that I realised I really did have to apply – and before June 30.”I thought ‘That can’t be right. I live here. I’ve got my house here. My kids are here. My grandchildren are here!’\nYou can read the full interview here\nWe believe it suits the Conservative government to disenfranchise sections of the population and the local Labour administration talk but don’t act. Liberal Democrats consistently stand up for EU citizens rights and will continue to do so as long as it takes. We support the campaigns of The Three Million for a physical proof of status, and for unilateral rights to vote and the campaign of the European Movement on citizens rights\nJust one person falling victim to a future Windrush type scandal is a failure of the whole scheme and betrayal of the millions of people who have made their home here and to whom the Leave campaign promised would retain ‘the exact same benefits’.\nTackling rogue landlords\nIzzy has written to Birmingham City Council calling for notice to be served on the owners of 65, Church Road, Moseley for building work to be immediately halted due to safety concerns.\nThe new owners purchased the property earlier this year with six sitting tenants. Three of them are still living in the property and have a legal right to stay until at least 13th August . Despite that the new owners have sent the builders in and completely gutted the vacated parts of the property and the communal areas.\nJournalists from Birmingham Live reported the appalling conditions the tenants have been left in and approached the owners NSH Properties for comment. You can read their report here together with interviews with Izzy and the tenants.\nIzzy is supporting the tenants who have been incredibly brave in speaking out. The landlords are clearly only concerned in furthering their business interests, and have demonstrated a total disregard for the responsibilities taken on as a purchaser of a property with sitting tenants. Their uncaring attitude makes them unfit to be landlords, in our view.\nThe statement made to the reporter that the property is to be converted back to a family home has no credibility when you consider recent planning applications to extend upwards and outwards and add more flats have been refused by Birmingham City Council.\nEU Settlement Scheme Deadline is 30th June – Can you EUaskFive today?\nLast month on 9th May we celebrated Europe Day, you may have seen the banner and bunting on Moseley Village Green. Moseley is the home of hundreds of EU/EEA & Swiss citizens, who enrich our community, and help make Birmingham the diverse and vibrant place we know and love.\nBut there is a deadline looming, which we all need to know about.\n30th June 2021 is the cut off period for applying to the EU settlement scheme. Many thousands of EU citizens across Birmingham have successfully obtained Settled Status, but there are still people out there who are yet to apply. They could be elderly and lived here for many years, married to a UK citizen and not aware the scheme applies to them, students who arrived before the end of the transition period or children who even though born here are not automatically eligible for UK citizenship.\nIt is imperative that EU citizens and non EU/UK family members who came to live in the UK before 1st January 2021 apply to the Settlement Scheme to secure the right to remain here after 1st July. Failure to do so will leave people as undocumented migrants and could lead to loss of rights to work, study, rent or buy property and access free healthcare.\nIzzy volunteers with the independent charity ‘Settled’ https://settled.org.uk/en/ to help EU/EEA & Swiss citizens and their families obtain settled status.\nWe are asking everyone to promote EUask5.\nAsk 5 EU/EEA or Swiss citizens if they have applied to the settlement scheme. Then ask them and all your friends and neighbours to do the same.\nIf you need help to apply or more information on Settled Status or EU citizens rights post Brexit you can contact me through this website, email izzy@moseleylibdems.com or call 07784 155208.\nPeople with dual UK/other citizenship, Irish citizens and people with documented Indefinite Leave to Remain (eg a stamp or sticker in their passport ,letter from the Home Office, biometric residence permit), do not need to apply. However Irish citizens and those with Indefinite Leave to Remain can apply if they wish , and it is worth checking the Government website for why they might want to.\nYou can apply on line for Settled Status via the Government website\nBirmingham City Council has published a list of local organisations that offer advice or help with applying.\nEUask5 today\nArt not tags\nIzzy recently sent a dossier of photo evidence to Birmingham Police following the identification of a person graffiti tagging in the city centre. The evidence showed the tag ‘ORB’ was prolific across Moseley and Kings Heath. The person has today admitted the tagging and as part of a community resolution has agreed to be party to a Community Protection Warning (CPW), which gives him strict conditions not to carry any item which may cause any sort of graffiti damage, across the whole of Birmingham. He will be writing a letter of apology to businesses whose premises were tagged and taking part in a local graffiti clean up. He states that he will not be tagging across Bham again. These are a few of the tags, many have since been removed by businesses, the council or the community group Moseley Litterbusters. Carefully designed street art in appropriate places is a wonderful way to enhance public areas, but indiscriminate prolific thoughtless ‘tagging’ costs businesses and the public purse tens of thousands of pounds a year to remove, it impacts on the local economy and environment and increases the fear of crime and social isolation.\nStatement from Bham City Council regarding Low Traffic Neighbourhoods- not before time!\nBirmingham City Council have issued a statement saying they are ‘committed to work with residents and businesses to adapt and improve Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) schemes in Moseley and Kings Heath and use local feedback to shape changes’.\nThey have promised a ‘series of ‘quick fix’ measures to improve traffic flow in congested locations including better signage and changes to traffic signal timings’\nA dedicated project board will be created to oversee any future phases, including the continued development of travel plans to encourage walking and cycling to school and full public consultation on new designs.\nThe council goes on to say: ‘ But we must work with communities to get this right. We now have an action plan to build on the successful aspects of the schemes and improve on what is already in place’\nYou can see the full statement issued here:\nWe welcome the statement but feel it is very late in the day to commit with working with residents and businesses when this should have been right at the heart of the project at its launch 12 months ago. From even before the scheme was first announced Izzy has been calling for a holistic, community led traffic management plan across Moseley to address the many different issues we experience including speeding and anti social driving, congested and polluted roads, reducing through traffic, enabling walking and cycling and dealing with collision hot spots.\nSince the Tranche1 measures of the People for Places scheme were announced back in July 2020 Izzy has worked hard to ensure all voices have been heard in this programme, including engaging with residents through the Better Streets for Moseley group and Moseley Forum, helping with traffic counts, securing funding for hand held speed monitors for use by residents groups, making representations to councillors and officers on behalf of local businesses and residents. Izzy recently wrote on behalf of businesses in York Road who feel disenfranchised about the measures put in place and concern about lack of access for deliveries, to point out the councils own technical review into the scheme recommends some type of one way system and how this could be a compromise that would allow restricted vehicular access whilst still enabling hospitality businesses to benefit from a pedestrianised scheme which would also provide a welcome safe family area off the High Street. The review and technical review of the scheme are below\nIn March this year it was agreed that the design consultants, Jacobs would take part in a walking tour of the revised area for the proposed LTN to engage with residents and stakeholders. Disappointingly this still hasn’t happened. We are hoping with the release of this statement and appointment of a dedicated project board (although details of the make up or remit of this are not yet known) to see a huge improvement in the level of meaningful engagement and full consultation before further measures are implemented.\nIzzy and Radley will continue to scrutinise the scheme, including the proposed action plan, to obtain feedback from residents and try to ensure all voices are heard.\nSt Agnes Conservation Area to expand\nConsultation on boundary changes to the St Agnes Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan (CAAMP) is underway. Survey and photographic work has been carried out by St Agnes Residents’ Association. Even if you do not live in the St Agnes area, the photographs are worth looking at.\nThe consultation ends on Friday 4th June\nDetails of how to respond to the consultation can be found here: https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/…/birminghams…/3\nThe draft document can be downloaded here: https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/…/st_agnes_moseley…\nLadypool Road Cycle Lane to become segregated\nConsultation has opened to create a permanent segregated cycle path on Ladypool Road between Church Road and Brighton / Taunton Road. The pedestrian crossing at Alder Lane will also be upgraded.\nWe welcome the move to segregate the cycle lane, which is currently not fit for purpose, as it is constantly blocked by parked cars. We hope to see it extended in future as a route in and out of the city centre through this popular and vibrant shopping area, which is in itself a destination worth a visit.\nThe cycle lane is proposed to be implemented in Summer 2021\nThe consultation closes on 11th June 2021.

It genuinely makes us feel angry and ashamed of what our government is allowing, what our government is doing, what our government is showing not just to Europe but the rest of the world. The government’s behaviour in this regard could have baleful consequences for UK citizens travelling to the EU in future and could further sour our already damaged relationships with EU member states. The outcry, and the amazing scenes in Glasgow, where an attempted deportation on the day of Eid al-Fitr was stopped by a passionate, welcoming crowd, illustrates that, more than ever, citizens’ rights need to be defended for everyone. As part of the Stories of Brexit campaign led by the European Movement, EU in Brum is proud to host its first ever webinar on Citizens’ Rights in the UK and the EU.\nThey have four great speakers:\nLuke Piper, Head of Policy for the 3million\nFiona Godfrey, co-chair of British in Europe\nPawel Koloziej, Midlands area Service Coordinator for the charity Settled\nLord Andrew Adonis, Chair of the European Movement.\nThe webinar will begin at 7 pm on Friday 21st May.\nYou can register to join the evening here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/…/citizens-rights-after…\nTories to cut £3,786,250 from Pupil Premium in Birmingham\nTories to cut £3,786,250 from Pupil Premium in Birmingham\nSchools in Birmingham are set to lose £3,786,250 in funding for the most disadvantaged pupils in the country following the government’s decision to alter the method of calculating Pupil Premium funding.\nThe pupil premium, which aims to close the attainment gap by providing extra money to pupils eligible for free school meals, was a flagship reform introduced by the Liberal Democrats in government in 2011.\nFreedom of information requests by Schools Week suggest that schools in Birmingham are set to lose £3,786,250 following the decision to base the funding on a school’s pupil numbers in October rather than January as previously calculated.\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson Izzy Knowles for Birmingham Hall Green constituency said:\n“This cut shows the Conservatives are more focussed on penny-pinching than on giving children the best possible education. When the attainment gap is widening and children from disadvantaged backgrounds have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, it is shameful that the Tories would seek to cut pupil premium money.\n“Liberal Democrats introduced the pupil premium and have had to fight the Tories to keep it properly funded. Given the financial pressure that families are under, this change has real potential to cause harm and will have a direct impact on the quality of education schools can provide for those who are in desperate need of more, not less, support.\n“This is a bad move at the worst possible time. The Government must listen to teachers about the reality on the ground, not pull support when it is most needed.”\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for Education and Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said:\n“Once again, disadvantaged school pupils are set to lose out as the Tories prioritise penny pinching over proper support. By moving the goalposts on the entitlement criteria for the “Pupil Premium”, thousands of children whose parents have become unemployed in the last three months will not get the crucial support they need.\n“Liberal Democrats introduced the Pupil Premium because we know how vital it is to target support to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils and close the gap between them and their peers.\n“The Conservative Government must urgently rethink this decision or they run the risk of more disadvantaged children falling behind.”\n320,000 EU citizens waiting for Settled Status ahead of cliff-edge- does our current Mayor care? It seems not.\nAt the Moseley Forum hustings for the Mayoral election all the candidates were asked to support the campaign by The 3 million to promote the EU settlement scheme, support EU /EEA/Swiss citizens up to and beyond the deadline of 30th June and to advocate for continued local voting rights.\nIt was hugely disappointing to hear Andy Street state that voting rights had to be a reciprocal arrangement with each separate EU country. By not lobbying his own party for unilateral voting rights to be given to every EU/EEA/Swiss citizen with settled status he is effectively condoning the removal of the only chance millions of people have of a democratic say in the governance of the city, town or region some will have called their homes for decades. It is a terrible thing to do to thousands of people who have already been disenfranchised by the EU referendum, another vote they were unable to take part in.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for all EU citizens in the UK to be given the automatic right to stay, as new figures reveal that 323,800 are still waiting for the Home Office to process their applications. The party is warning that those who aren’t given ‘Settled Status’ by the 30th June deadline could “become the victims of another Windrush-style scandal”.\nResponding to the figures, Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: “The Conservatives must guarantee the rights of EU citizens who’ve made their lives here, and contribute enormously to our economy, our public services and our society. They must not become the victims of a new Windrush-style scandal. “Over 320,000 of our friends and neighbours are facing the cruel anxiety of hoping the Home Office will grant their applications before the cliff-edge at the end of June.“There is a serious risk that hundreds of thousands of people will be left effectively undocumented and exposed to the Conservatives’ Hostile Environment. We can’t afford the Government to ignore these warnings any longer.“EU citizens in the UK have been living under a cloud of uncertainty for far too long and the buck stops with Boris Johnson who promised them the automatic right to stay. He must deliver on his promise.”\nLadypool Road. How not to consult\nVehicle Activated Signs for Billesley Lane\nSpeed monitors have been installed today on Billesley Lane. They are currently set to factory settings of 30mph but will be recalibrated in the next 24 hrs to 20mph. They won’t visually display speeds above 45mph to deter boy racers wanting to set them off, but top speeds will be recorded and data will be available for analysis.They are re-deployable so can be moved around the ward to help address issues in different roads. This is a welcome move towards what we hope will be a range of new road safety measures introduced across Moseley ward and will help to address the concerns many residents have been raising, in some cases for many years.Last night, at an online Better Streets 4 Moseley meeting, we also heard from the design company that has been awarded the council contract for the proposed Low Traffic Neighbourhood Tranche 2 measures across Kings Heath and the ‘Moseley Triangle’ area. We will continue to stress the need for a holistic community led design rather than a ‘one size fits all’ approach and for as much consultation and engagement as possible.Tranche 2 is an opportunity to address the road safety and speed issues experienced by so many people across the designated area but it must take into account that all roads are residential and it is not acceptable to expect residents of one road to take the burden of redirected traffic from another road.\nMostly Jazz move to Highbury?\nMoseley Folk Festival has applied for a licence to hold festivals in Highbury Park. This is a contingency plan in case social distancing is still needed in July and would be an alternative venue for their Mostly Jazz Funk & Soul Festival, normally held at Moseley Park and Pool\nThey have been in discussion with the Chamberlain Highbury Trust, other stakeholders of the park and the local authorities for some time and have produced this information sheet for residents:\nAt a recent Moseley Forum meeting the organiser Gerv Havill stressed any such move would be temporary . He said: ‘We have considered both Cannon Hill and Kings Heath but they’re either unavailable or unsuitable. It’s unclear what restrictions this summer or next will bring so this is very much a contingency plan. We hope that by July restrictions will be relaxed and we can remain in Moseley’. Gerv also confirmed he is in contact with local Moseley businesses and will keep them updated.\nIf you have any concerns or questions or would like further information you can contact Gerv by emailing info@mostlyjazz.co.uk with Highbury as the subject.\nRepresentations or comments can be made to Birmingham City Council by emailing licensing@birmingham.gov.uk\nor writing to:\nGeneral Licensing, Regulation and Enforcement, PO Box 17831 Birmingham B2 2HJ\nTopsy Turvey decision on CAZ funding priorities is a further blow to the Moseley / Kings Heath rail line being opened any time soon.\nThe Birmingham Liberal Democrat group have requested the council’s allocation of funding from the Clean Air Zone, (CAZ) be called in for scrutiny by the Transport Committee after it was revealed that city centre pedestrian schemes costing £15,478 million would be prioritised over the allocation of funding for the Camp Hill Line and other transport projects, as well as the creation of a city wide Clean Air City Fund.\nA statement from Liberal Democrat Group leader Cllr Jon Hunt and deputy leader Cllr Roger Harmer states: “This week’s decisions show that the Labour council has topsy turvy priorities. While car drivers are being kept away from the city centre, the measures that would enable drivers to switch to public transport are no longer a priority”.\nYou can read more in this report by Birmingham Live\n£5.2million was due to be allocated to the Camp Hill Line, £3.4 million for the University Station and £4.2 million for the Cross City Bus Scheme, however these funds are now relegated to only happen if the CAZ makes sufficient revenue.\nYou can see the full report here:\nThe proposed Clean Air City Fund would see an annual allocation of £20,000 to each ward (£40,000 for two member wards) for use against a defined catalogue of measures to aid sustainable transport and improve air quality\nThe projected net revenue from the CAZ for 2020 to 2030 has been lowered from £85.7 million to £44.6 million so it is even more imperative that revenue is prioritised on improving public transport links to actually help people reduce their dependency on cars.\nMusicians left high and dry by Brexit deal\n| Liam Gallagher, Sir Elton John and Bob Geldof have called on the Government to make it easier for musicians to tour around Europe. In an exclusive to The Times more than 170 musicians have urged Ministers to organise paperwork-free travel in Europe for artists on tour. The Brexit deal makes it extremely difficult for touring artists because they now need a costly work permit and face a mountain of paperwork for their equipment. The extra costs will make many tours unviable, especially for young emerging musicians.Liberal Democrat Peer Lord Peter Strasburger, said: “Predictably the government is trying to blame the EU, but the fact remains that when the going got tough during the talks on the trade deal, Tory ministers just ducked for cover and hoped the problem would go “As a result, our creative artists have been left high and dry, including musicians, dancers, actors and their many support staff who together with the rest of the creative industries generate over £100 billion a year to our economy. They were sacrificed in a botched negotiation, just like our fishermen, our farmers, and our crucial service industries. “The artists who signed this letter are either furious or fearful for the future of their business, or both. If the Conservative Government cares about these industries and the economy, they must get back around the negotiating table and get this sorted pronto.” Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Culture, Media and Sport in the Lords, Baroness Jane Bonham-Carter added: “The creative arts sector is a massive success story for the UK economy. It’s already in dire trouble because of Covid and this ‘friendly fire’ assault on its viability from our own government could be the last straw for many of our talented performers and backup staff. “Artists and crews will need to apply for work permits and other detailed paperwork for many of the countries they visit. This could make many tours unviable, particularly for younger, upcoming artists who don’t have big teams and big money behind them. “The same applies to EU-based artists wishing to perform in the UK. That means disruption not only to seeing our favourite foreign bands and orchestras but income to festivals and all the benefits of creative co-operation too. Reciprocity is good for Britain and should not be holding back a deal for artists.” The signatories in full: Roger Waters; Sir Simon Rattle; Dame Sarah Connolly; Sir George Benjamin; Sir Harrison Birtwistle; Nicola Benedetti; Steven Isserlis; Stephen Hough; Sir András Schiff; Judith Weir; Roderick Williams; Amanda Roocroft; Amelia Freedman; Nash Ensemble; Anna Meredith; Anna Patalong; Benjamin Baker; Bond Quartet; Brindley Sherratt; Professor Catherine Martin; Catherine Wyn-Rogers, Catriona Price; Chi-chi Nwanoku; Chris Stark, Christian Curnyn; Claudia Huckle; Dr Mark Taylor; Elizabeth Wallfisch; Gabriella Swallow; Gina McCormack; Gregory Walmsley; Harry Bicket; Hilary Summers; Jeremy Huw Williams; Jess Gillam; Joseph Middleton; Kate Royal; Lauma Skride; Levon Chilingirian; Mahaliah Edwards; Martyn Brabbins; Michael Chance; Miloš Karadaglić; Nicholas Collon; Nicky Spence; Paul Cassidy; Peter Robinson; Prof Nicholas Daniel; Professor Julian Anderson; Professor Julian Lloyd Webber; Professor Peter Fribbins; Rakhvinder Singh; Raphael Wallfisch; Rosa Mannion; Ruth Rogers; Sean Shibe; Sheku Kanneh-Mason; Tasmin Little; the Kanneh-Mason family; Sir Elton John; Ed Sheeran; Roger Daltrey; Bob Geldof; Midge Ure; Sting; Robert Plant; Peter Gabriel; Rag’n’Bone Man; Nick Mason; Aitch; Alex Kapranos; Beabadoobee; Bicep; Brett Anderson; Brian Eno; Brian May; Bryan Adams; Captain Sensible; Charlie Burchill; Chris Difford; Danny McNamara; Dave Stewart; Fryars; Gary Kemp; Gary Numan; Glass Animals; Grace Carter; Hayden Thorpe; Hot Chip; Hugh Cornwell; Iron Maiden; Jayda G; Jim Kerr; Joss Stone; Jungle; Kasai; Kero Kero Bonito; Kim Wilde; King Krule; LA Priest; Liam Gallagher; Mark King; Mick Hucknell; Nik Kershaw; Priya Ragu & Japhna Gold; Radiohead; Rick Wakeman; Roger Taylor; Ross From Friends; Rusty Egan Visage; Sex Pistols; SG Lewis; Simian Mobile Disco; SK Shlomo; Steve Norman; Superorganism; Terry Britten; The 1975; The Darkness; Will Young; Dame Evelyn Glennie; Julia Haferkorn; David Francis; Karine Polwart; Peewee Ellis; John J.

(I have edited to remove some personal details):\nFrom: Izzy Knowles <>Subject: Moseley LTN and Billesley LaneDate: 30 November 2020 at 22:02:30 GMTTo: Councillor Martin Straker Welds <>, Councillor Kerry Jenkins <>Cc: Tom O’Keeffe <t.okeeffe@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk>, Neil Kirkpatrick <n.kirkpatrick@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk>\nDear Martin & Kerry, Tom and Neil\nI have not long come inside from the scene of yet another crashed car on the corner of Greenhill Road and Billesley Lane at approx 18.30hrs this evening. From talking to neighbours it would appear two cars were racing each other down the hill from the direction of Kings Heath. The driver of the red Skoda in the photo has lost control on hitting the bend as he approached Greenhill Road junction, shot across the mouth of the junction, hit a bag of builders sand that was on the verge and spun into the tree, damaging the wall.The three occupants then left the scene in the second car which pulled up along side. Whilst I was talking to one of the neighbours three males turned up and started to remove items from the car, including the keys which had been left in the ignition. They all left again when I called the police. However over an hour later the police had still not arrived. The reason I’m writing is that this is the third similar collision on Billesley Lane in less than six months where vehicles have left the road at speed and crashed into houses or garden walls. As you know my neighbours and I have been recording traffic flow and volume at various junctions for the last few months, both before and after the modal filters were recently put in place in School Road and Cambridge Road . Our findings show a significant increase of traffic using both Greenhill Road and Oxford Road to travel between Kings Heath/Moseley and so adding to the pressure of traffic on Billesley Lane especially at these two junctions. Billesley Lane is not a major road. It has a high volume of cyclists and pedestrian traffic as well as vehicles. It is crossed by many pupils walking to and from local primary and secondary schools. St Agnes Church Hall on the corner of Dyott Road is in normal non lockdown times used by mother and toddler groups, pre school, cubs and brownies and various after school clubs with both children and adults frequently crossing the road at this junction. The One Stop shop is a very busy local shop used by many families who walk or cycle.Moseley Tennis Club is used by families and children, again many walk or cycle to classes or events.Two of these recent crashes have happened in the early evening when pedestrian traffic is normally heavier. Speeding and racing has long been an issue on roads like Billesley Lane. However this year it has become much more prevalent. Collisions like this one, although not resulting in injury are incredibly upsetting and frightening to residents and to passers by. However, possibly because there was no injury, they are not being taken seriously by the police.Residents who have lived on or near this road have felt ignored for a long time. They are now concerned they will be left to bear the burden of the redirected traffic from other roads within the LTN and incidents like this will increase.We have a real opportunity to address this now. I am urging you to ensure that Billesley Lane is considered for some serious traffic calming measures which could even involve re modelling the junctions.I’m also asking that the police please take much more interest including robust investigation of reports of no insurance, dangerous driving and fail to stop as well as increased speed checks during the evenings and partnership working to obtain more equipment and traffic calming measures in known collision hot spots. I look forward to hearing from you\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nTime to Give Carers the Voice they Deserve\nThe Liberal Democrats are asking people across our community who care for relatives to get in touch and share their story – to mark national Carers Rights Day.\nLiberal Democrat party leader Ed Davey has said he wants the party wants to be a “strong voice” for the millions across the country – including the 11964 people in Birmingham Hall Green Constituency who care for those who need it.\nEd himself knows the burden put on carers for family members – having been a carer for his mum when growing up and now caring for his disabled son.\nCarers can get in touch and share their experiences at www.libdems.org.uk/carerssurvey\nIzzy Knowles said:\n“Millions of people across the country act as unpaid carers for loved ones. This year has highlighted more than ever the issues many of them face.”\n“If you are a carer – or someone who receives regular care support from a relative of a friend – we want to hear from you. Please get in touch with us and share your story.”\nLib Dems urge Chancellor to “level the playing field” for small shops over Christmas\nThe Liberal Democrats have today called on the Chancellor to “level the playing field” to help small high streets compete with internet giants in the run up to Christmas.\nThe Liberal Democrat fear local shops hit by decreased footfall during the coronavirus pandemic will continue to struggle and have therefore proposed a new scheme in a similar vein to how the Eat Out to Help Out scheme aided restaurants.\nTo encourage people to shop local from home to save the high street, the Party wants to see the Government cover the costs of postage and have appealed to all MP’s to back the campaign.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has welcomed the idea to help firms survive. Mike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “This is the type of creative idea that would boost small businesses and balance out the playing field.”\nHall Green Liberal Democrat spokesperson Izzy Knowles said:\n“Small businesses in Hall Green constituency are worried about their ability to stay afloat over the coming months. For so many, Christmas is their most lucrative time of year but coronavirus restrictions have caused footfall to nosedive.\n“When people turn online to do their Christmas shopping, free postage offers from online shopping giants are incredibly tempting. That makes it even tougher for our local small businesses putting our high streets at further risk. Ministers must level the playing field.”\nLiberal Democrat Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine MP added:\n“In the Summer, the Chancellor launched a campaign to support the hospitality sector. We now need to see this Government go the extra mile to support small business in the festive period.\n“We want the Chancellor to pay the postage on online purchases from small local independent shops to make them a more viable option for people hunting for Christmas presents and encourage people to shop small from home.”\nMike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:\n“This is the type of creative idea that would boost small businesses and balance out the playing field.\n“We must do everything we can to help our small, independent stores.\n“This is going to be the most important festive season our economy has ever seen and could be make-or-break for some of our small businesses.\n“That’s why we must pull out all the stops to help them survive the end of 2020 and beyond.”\nThe text of the letter sent from Christine Jardine is as follows: “Dear Rishi, I would like to ask you to consider a support scheme for small businesses through the festive season which would help them in a similar way to the ‘eat out to help out’ campaign which the Government funded in the summer. Small businesses in England are missing out on business in precious lucrative months and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland footfall is still significantly reduced even though a full lockdown hasn’t been imposed. I urge you to explore pathways to pay the postage on online purchases from small local independent shops to make them a more viable option for people hunting Christmas presents and encourage people to shop small from home. The free postage offers from online shopping giants and the ease of using Amazon Prime are incredibly tempting for those Christmas shopping online. Paying postage on each individual Christmas purchase is a burden that is likely to repel shoppers from picking small retailers. That makes it an even tougher climate for small business and shut shops.The prohibitive nature of these costs rings especially true for those in remote or rural communities for whom delivery charges are unjustly steep. I am urging to embrace this idea as a way to stimulate traffic to small business sites. Removing the delivery cost burden would encourage shoppers to select individual items from different small shops – rather than resorting to bulk buy from large suppliers. I look forward to your response. Yours sincerely, Christine Jardine”\nLords defeat Government on Immigration Bill\nThe Government has tonight been defeated on the Immigration Bill, including amendments from the Liberal Democrats to protect the British nationals living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. An amendment from Baroness Hamwee to preserve the right of UK nationals living in the EU to bring non-British family members with them if they return to the UK was passed this afternoon.\nAnother amendment passed tonight, tabled by Liberal Democrat peer Jonny Oates, to force the Government to provide EU citizens in the UK who are granted Settled or Pre-Settled Status with physical proof of their migration status – instead of the digital-only proof under the Government’s current system.\nIzzy wrote a letter in support of this amendment as part of the campaign. https://deniedmybackup.org.uk/\nShe wrote: ‘I have recently helped two gentleman in their 80’s to get settled status. One Swedish and one Italian. They have both lived in the UK since their 20’s, contributing to our economy and community for over 60 years. One worked as a nurse in the NHS and the other opened a string of restaurants throughout the Midlands. Both these gentleman were very confused and upset when they learned they would not be given physical proof of their settled status. The Italian gentleman does not use email and will be totally reliant on his son’s help if and when he is asked in future to prove his status in the UK. He is a proud man and does not want to have to bother his son.\nThey are both eligible to apply under the Windrush scheme – but it is more paperwork, involves sending their passport to the Home Office and is not something I am qualified to help them with. Even then a card will only be valid until 2024. Both have found obtaining settled status stressful already, they were in denial about it for some time. They have had difficulty understanding why they would need to apply to two schemes and so far have not taken the Windrush opportunity. People need to prove their immigration status throughout life – when seeking a new job opportunity, finding a place to live or getting treatment in hospital. Where British citizens use their passport as proof and non-EU citizens have a biometric residence card as backup, EU citizens can only prove their new immigration status through the Home Office website. If any one part of the digital checking process fails, people without a physical form of backup will be vulnerable. We should not have a two-tier system for proving the right to stay in the UK, with inferior access for EU citizens. A digital-only immigration status will create new barriers for EU citizens – especially the elderly and most vulnerable, who may not have the necessary digital skills and who need alternative ways of accessing services. This is not a fair way to treat our friends and neighbours. I worry about my two elderly gentlemen if they are asked to prove their status, especially if it were in a stressful situation such as needing urgent medical treatment.’\nThe bill will now go to the House of Commons. We will need your help to convince Conservative MP’s to do the decent thing and vote for these two amendments. You can help, follow the campaign https://deniedmybackup.org.uk/ Write to MP’s and demand they keep their promise made in the Leave campaign that ‘No one will be treated any less favourably’",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_2021_07_28_alcohol-restricted-zone-no-longer-valid-in-moseley/content_89.html": "Last week Izzy wrote to Sergeant Tom O’Keeffe asking for increased patrols in Moseley Village and for enforcement of the Alcohol Restricted Zone (ARZ) . This was following a number of reported incidents of damage to, and theft from businesses, rowdy and drunken behaviour on the village green and fighting, which she witnessed, in the churchyard. Businesses have reported that customers are put off from visiting them due to the anti social behaviour of a group, which includes some new faces. They are loud, intimidating and sometimes aggressive. They dominate the benches and the bus stop and are now regularly causing issues in the church yard. They are drinking alcohol in the street, steadily from morning until night time.\nSince Izzy’s email there have been more patrols by the PCSO’s and visits to the businesses mostly affected, which is welcome but is not addressing the real problem.\nWhat is concerning is Sgt O’Keeffe also confirmed that officers were not enforcing the ARZ as he has been advised by his licensing officer that it had been superseded by the Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) introduced in 2017 and is no longer valid .\nThe PSPO itself expired in October 2020 and was not renewed by Birmingham City Council, despite calls from the local Police and community groups such as Moseley Forum and Moseley Society. A scrutiny report issued in October 2020 explains the council wished to introduce a new process for implementing PSPO’s which would be introduced ‘in the coming year’.\nThe local police have this month submitted an evidenced report to Birmingham City Council for consideration of renewal of the Moseley & Kings Heath PSPO. A decision is not expected until at least the autumn.\nIzzy has written to the council licensing department to clarify the situation with regard to the Alcohol Restricted Zone, originally introduced in 2003, which is still listed on the council website and advertised with signage in the village and beyond.\nIn the meantime though that signage is not worth the metal it is written on. No one is taking any notice of it and the police are not enforcing it. That is not good news for the businesses or the residents of Moseley over this coming summer.\nThat’s bad news and I’ve experienced the hassle myself you can’t sit at the bus home stop because its been colonised and I need to sit because of my mobility issues. Also had one guy try to get in the taxi with me no thanks sunshine\nLikeLike\nHi Mike. So sorry to hear it has affected you. I’ll keep raising it as an issue.\nLikeLike",

I have copied below a reply I have received from Joe Green of the Transportation & Connectivity Team.\nI’ve also had previous confirmation that the letters will be sent to residents along the entire length of School Road, any road that leads directly off School Road (and roads leading off these), Valentine Road and Cambridge Road. Also (after I made some representation) it will now include Oxford Road between St. Mary’s Row and Billesley Lane, and Billesley Lane between Wake Green Road and the junction with Cambridge Road/ Southlands Road.\nFrom: Joe Green\nSent: 31/10/2018 16:48\nTo: Izzy Knowles; Gill Brook\nCc: Councillor Kerry Jenkins\nSubject: RE: School Road Traffic Issues\nHi Izzy,\nI sent some further information across to Cllr Jenkins this morning, on the back of a request from discussions at last night’s Moseley Forum meeting.The meeting you mention was requested by School Road Traffic Issues Group to provide them with an update, and was attended by Phil Edwards and myself.\nFurther answers to your questions are included below:\nPlease can you confirm whether an engineer has been allocated to the scheme yet and if so who it is?\nYes, this project has now been approved and funding allocated. It will be overseen by Natalia Haberko in our Infrastructure Delivery team. Gill and I are currently in the process of handing everything across to Natalia for taking things forward, but we will continue to be involved to support the communication and engagement elements of this scheme.\nWill there be any formal consultation either before or during the experimental period?\nA letter drop of the local area is being organised to inform residents of what is happening. It is envisaged that this will be sent out week commencing 12th November.\nIt is not necessary to hold formal (statutory) consultation for an experimental traffic order, other than with the emergency services who are in the process of being contacted.\nThere will be ongoing consultation while the experimental traffic order is in place, and any views or comments submitted during this period will be recorded to help inform future decisions.\nHow long do you envisage the experimental period to be?\nThe maximum length of time that an experimental traffic order can remain in place for is 18 months, after which point it is either progressed to a permanent intervention (pending formal consultation) or removed. It is generally seen as good practice to keep an experimental traffic order in place for a minimum of 6 months, but there is scope to remove it sooner than this if deemed necessary.\nThere is scope for the scheme to become permanent if it is deemed that the experimental road closure has been successful. However this would be subject to a formal consultation process – and this would need to have been completed within the maximum period of 18 months for an experimental traffic order for there to be no break in the provision of this intervention.\nWhat traffic surveys are planned to take place before and during the experimental scheme?\nNatalia will be developing monitoring arrangements for this scheme, which will include traffic counts before and during the experimental closure.\nThere is some existing data from traffic counts carried out at locations in the area last year that can potentially be used, and we will work with the local engineer to identify locations for any further counts; they have already suggested that the junctions of Oxford Road/St Mary’s Row and Billesley Lane/Wake Green Road should be included.\nI hope these answers are useful, we are keen to keep local residents informed of what is happening and shall continue to seek to do so.\nPlease do get in touch if there is anything else you would like to know at this stage.

There was also a suggestion that as it is an experimental scheme no further consultation will take place following the letter, which is still to go out to residents.\nPlease can you confirm whether an engineer has been allocated to the scheme yet and if so who it is?\nThis scheme is going to cost a lot of money to implement so it is important we get it right, otherwise it will be money wasted. I am concerned that the decision to carry out this experimental closure has been made with very little consultation and there are still people who will be directly affected who do not know it is taking place.\nWill there be any formal consultation either before or during the experimental period?\nHow long do you envisage the experimental period to be?\nI’m also concerned that proper measures need to be taken to correctly survey the amount and speed of traffic on these roads and potentially affected roads, both before and at periods after the experiment, so that the scheme can be properly evaluated.\nWhat traffic surveys are planned to take place before and during the experimental scheme?\nAre you able to please update me on these points?\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nIzzy Knowles\nMoseley Liberal Democrats",

In the last five years, police recorded an average of 386 domestic burglaries per week in October, November and December. This compares to an average of 328 burglaries a week during the rest of the year.\nThe period between Christmas and New Year can prove particularly fruitful for burglars, with homes full of new presents left empty as occupants visit family elsewhere. The Liberal Democrats are calling for a return to community policing to keep families safe and bring criminals committing burglaries to justice.\nIzzy is a member of Birmingham East Police IAG. She will be making representations to the local Police Commander:\n“Everyone should be able to feel safe in their own homes over the Christmas period, and know that if someone does break in they will be caught and punished. But with the vast majority of burglaries going unsolved, that’s simply not the case for far too many victims of crime. The collapse of neighbourhood policing has resulted in poorer investigations, little or no feedback to victims and a huge drop in intelligence available to officers to work on to detect and prevent crime.\n“This Conservative government’s failure to tackle crime is letting victims down and letting criminals get away with it.\n“Liberal Democrats are working hard to make our communities safe and help residents feel safe too. We need a return to proper community policing, where officers are visible, trusted and known personally to local people.”",

He replied that the system cannot be suspended due to the contract with Veolia and changing that would come at a high financial cost to the council.\nToday I have emailed him to ask if this could be discussed further with Veolia following the declaration of a major incident. They may be willing to allow temporary changes to the contract without a financial implication for the council.\nI also asked about the prioritising of missed collections and pointed out that whilst the agency crews cannot cover a whole round in the time given, they are not alternating their start location, so the same properties are missed week after week. He acknowledged this as an issue and said crews are now being instructed to ensure they alternate start locations.\nI have explored several potential sites to bring a Mobile Household Waste Collection to Moseley. As they are attracting upwards of a 1000 visitors during the industrial action this would need to be a large area, such as a car park where there is room for people to unload cars quickly and safely. So far, private sites have all said no due to health and safety concerns.\nI am also exploring the possibility of a supervised paper and cardboard collection at a set location in Moseley.\nI continue to send almost daily lists of missed collections in Moseley to the depot supervisor and they are prioritising them as and when they can get crews and wagons out. Different wagons are required for containers and wheelie bins, so if you see a crew they may not necessarily be able to empty your particular bin. If I have reported your property or road, please let me know when it is collected.\nThe council has updated their FAQ on the website since declaring a major incident, which includes a factsheet about the reasons for the industrial action and their attempts to resolve it",

It sets out to transform Birmingham’s roads and streets to make them safer, more inclusive, and more attractive.\nTake part in the consultation HERE\nThe ambition of the strategy is to end death and serious injury for users of Birmingham’s roads in line with the Vision Zero concept, which aspires to eliminate all traffic fatalities and serious injuries.\nThe previous Birmingham Road Safety Strategy was adopted in October 2016. Whilst aligned with Vision Zero, its approach did not tackle traffic volume and its significant impact on road safety.\nThe revised strategy adopts the Healthy Streets Approach and is aligned directly with the vision, aim, objectives and principles of the Birmingham Transport Plan:\n- Prioritising active travel in local neighbourhoods – upgrading and improving streets in our local neighbourhoods to ensure they are attractive, inclusive, and safe environments for people walking, cycling and using public transport.\n- Reallocating road space – consolidating most motor vehicle journeys in Birmingham onto a defined and prioritised Arterial Route Network, whilst removing through trips from residential streets wherever possible.\n- Transforming the city centre – removing through motor traffic from the city centre, and redesigning public spaces to prioritise public transport, walking and cycling.\n- Managing demand – proactive management of the kerbside (the part of the road closest to the footway) to release the space needed for safe, healthy streetscapes, whilst improving access to local services and facilities.\nPaper copies of the consultation survey, along with copies of the strategy will be left at all of the city libraries from the week commencing 15 January 2024 (or you can email Izzy and we’ll send you one). The council also plans to hold a small number of drop in events, details of which will follow.\nIf you have any queries, please email: connected@birmingham.gov.uk",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_2018_09_15_preserving-our-grass-verges/content_253.html": "On Wednesday at The Moseley Meeting I supported residents in bringing up the issue of constant parking and driving of vehicles on the open grass verges where Stoney Lane meets Yardley Wood Road between Esme Road and Phipson Road. 90 residents have signed a petition calling for trip rail or other preventative measures to prevent the parking.\nThe Anderton Park Residents Association have been asking for these measures for some time, they campaigned years ago to stop the green space being built on, but since then they have seen the road become more densely used by traffic, witnessed the grass being damaged by an increasing number of cars and vans being driven and parked on it and experienced children being deterred from playing there. They have in the past planted bulbs with the school children from Anderton Park School, and they regularly litter pick to keep it tidy. At one stage the area was even costed up for trip rail, but it was never installed.\nI have had email conversations with the head of the Parks Department and the District Highways Engineer over the last six months to ask for trip rail to be installed. Springfield Police have . been contacted to deal with the parking on the grass, which is illegal. Letters were sent by Highways to the residents and several fixed penalty tickets were issued by PCSO Peach. However this has not deterred drivers from continuing to park on the grass area. As one individual or family stops doing it another takes over. The council departments have been supportive but a more long term solution is needed and we need funding to make it happen.\nI have witnessed myself numerous instances of cars and vans parking and driving across the verges. The area does not have any other safe green space for children to play close to their homes and children play on the greens whilst cars are parked there. If the green verges were railed off to prevent vehicles accessing them we would create a nice safe space for families and children to enjoy and the residents could utilise the space for other family friendly projects such as bulb planting, games and community events.\nThe council would not have to repair ruts, potholes and damage to the pavements caused by heavy vehicles and police time could be better taken up with other issues. The green space is also important to help reduce the traffic pollution in the area\nThe green verges are wholly in Sparkhill Ward, however the petition shows there is a demand for this action from residents of both Sparkhill and Moseley Wards. There is a budget for each ward to use for verge protection and minor transport measures. This is a small budget and there will be other needs to be considered in both wards however I believe this project should be seen as a priority need. It is possible if necessary we could fund some of the cost through an application to the Active Citizens fund or other similar scheme.\nI have sent the petition, together with photos to the Councillors for both Moseley and Sparkhill wards, the Police Sergeants for each ward ,Mike Hinton of the Parks department and Garry Dalton, the Highways Engineer and I have offered to work with them to get approval and find funding for this scheme.\nI hope to have some feedback by the next Moseley meeting in November\nOne Reply to “”",

This will mean that they will have reduced spending on services to residents and businesses by total annual savings of around £775 million over a twelve year period.\nThe council propose an increase of 2.99% in Council Tax in 2019/20 and 1.99% in later years. In addition they propose to raise a “Social Care Precept” by increasing Council Tax by a further 2% in 2019/20 to provide extra funding to meet the costs of social care. This would result in a combined increase in Council Tax of 4.99% in 2019/20\nClearly the council are in a difficult position. However there are still a number of questionable priorities. And your say is important in helping get it right.\nOne proposal for example includes a 25% cut in the budget of the flytipping team by £300,000. They will only investigate where there is a high likelihood of prosecution, which in reality means they will leave themselves with little choice but to pick up all dumping without investigation. In contrast the settlement following last year’s waste strike means another £2.5m has to go into basic waste collection services.\nSo we will have the crazy situation where you cannot overstuff your wheelie bin but if you dump it in bags round the corner it will be collected.\nPlease make your comments.

Our specialist delivery team are now overseeing the completion of scheme designs and other points required to progress this to delivery.\nFollowing engagement with residents in Autumn 2022, some minor changes have been made to the final concept design layout ahead of delivery, specifically:\n- the addition of a modal filter at the junction of Yardley Wood Road and St Agnes Road (in\nplace of the proposed one-way ‘gyratory’ by St Agnes church) - the introduction of a diagonal modal filter (south-west to north-east) at the junction of\nSchool Road / Greenend Road / Greenhill Road, instead of the existing modal filter on School Road (and in place of the proposed modal filters on School Road and Greenhill Road) - making the section of Springfield Road between Addison Road and Institute Road one-way (northbound) along with consideration of any other traffic calming measures required here (as with Billesley Lane)\nA revised final concept design for Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People is shown below\nAn updated delivery programme is now being put in place based on a phased approach, with measures being delivered through separate packages as follows:\n1) improvements to phase 1 measures to the west of the High Street – including the York Road pedestrian zone – which already have TROs in place.\n2) new measures being introduced as part of phase 2 (to the east of the High Street) which will require new TROs – this includes modal filters, one-way streets, and traffic calming.\n3) a 20mph speed limit across the project area, including on ‘boundary’ roads.\n4) bus gate on Addison Road and reinstate a right turn from Vicarage Road onto High Street.\nWork is underway to complete design work, obtain internal approvals, advertise Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) including statutory consultation, and award construction contracts. Further details, including envisaged timescales, will be shared as available.\nNotwithstanding the requirement to comply with any spend restrictions in place in advance of the Council setting out its Financial Recovery Plan, the funding allocated to this scheme comes from grants and income which is ring-fenced for sustainable travel and environmental improvements. This funding was committed by the Council’s Cabinet on 17 January 2023 and due to the nature of the funding, it cannot be used to fund any wider financial pressures across the City Council.“",

Scroll down through the posts to read it.\nWe have now received a letter, copied below, from Gill Brook – Senior Transportation Officer – Birmingham City Council.\n“Dear resident,\nI am feeding back as a result of the two resident-led meetings that Birmingham City Council Transportation officers were invited to attend to look at and discuss potential options for a scheme to address the issues of safety on School Road in Moseley and Kings Heath & Brandwood wards.\nFollowing responses collected from the meeting on 24th January 2018 where a number of different scheme options were put forward to residents, and further responses from local residents by email, 64% of those received were in favour of the option that would involve an experimental closure of School Road for motor vehicles at a point between Greenend Road and Birches Close.\nFrom comments taken at the meeting on 24th January, and further comments from emails received, issues relating to parking on a number of roads in the area were highlighted – including parking at junctions reducing visibility, and vehicles parking on pavements.\nPart of all of the 6 options put forward included a short length of one-way on Valentine Road from the High Street. This proved unpopular in the feedback we received, and will therefore not be taken forward.\nI have been advised that before formal consultation on a proposed scheme happens, we should undertake some further area-wide engagement to ensure all properties in the local area likely to be affected by the closure of School Road as a through route have the opportunity to give their opinion.\nThe potential costs and logistics of an experimental road closure and any parking restrictions will need to be submitted through the usual city council channels in order to get funding agreed and allocated.\nIt is anticipated that this proposal can be submitted within the next month, and if successful, the consultation would take place after this. As we would like to consult as widely as possible with all local residents and businesses affected by the proposed scheme, we would anticipate this consultation taking place after the main summer holiday period.\nWe will try and arrange this as soon as possible after the beginning of September.\nIn the meantime, can I encourage you to have a look at our 20mph toolkits which can be downloaded at www.birmingham.gov.uk/20mph. These toolkits contain activity ideas and we also have a range of resources such as additional temporary signage, wheelie bin and car bumper stickers to help to bring great visibility to the reduced speed limits in the area. We would be happy to support any activities”.\nGill Brook BA (Comb Hons)\nSenior Transportation Officer – Transportation Behaviour Change\nGrowth and Transportation (Economy Directorate)\nBirmingham City Council\n1, Lancaster Circus Queensway\nBirmingham\nB4 7DQ\nHi we live on GreenHill Road and it’s all ready like a race track some night with cars speeding to at least 50/60 mph. The simple way around the problem on school rd is to install high curbs and rails to the pavement to stop vehicles getting on to the pavement, also the main problem seems to be around school drop off time and pick up surely there must be away to stop them parking on school road\nLikeLike\nHi Nathan. Thanks for the comments. Please make sure you send them to Gill Brook at the council. Her email address is Gill.Brook@birmingham.gov.uk Also the council should carry out a full consultation before any decisions are made – residents in Greenhill Road must be included in this (I live on Greenhill Road too). We will also publicise any information we become aware of.\nBest wishes Izzy Knowles\nLikeLike\nThe issue here, surely, is as an elected representative, you really appear to be stopping Moseley from ‘getting things done’. There is a huge element of NIMBYISM here which steps from the inclusion of your own road being part of the sensible redirection and rethinking of vehicles using what is essentially a single carriageway rather then the much wider and safer roads of Billesley Lane and Oxford Roads. Both have traffic calming measure to avoid speeding and congestion that is such an issue for School Road. The key incentive for the extensive ‘research’ that many residents have noticed, experienced or monitored in the past two years is that an experimented proposal is just that. Try what’s been proposed and then monitor the difference. Kicking a temporary proposal into the long grass is simply no way to ‘get things done’.\nLikeLike\nHello there. Thank you very much for your comment and feedback.\nI must point out to you that I am not an elected representative. I campaign on behalf of Moseley residents, but I am not a Councillor.\nI do get that people in School Road are looking for a solution. I totally support their campaign to get some action and I have supported this long before I got involved in politics. As Chair of Moseley Forum I offered to host a public meeting for the School Road Traffic Issues group – but it was declined.\nI do however, take exception to your accusation of Nimbyism. The reason this proposal has become controversial is entirely down to mis-management and lack of consultation and communication by Birmingham City Council. In January 2018 Councillor Lisa Trickett presented six options for traffic management in School Road to a self selected group of residents at a meeting which had been advertised almost completely via Facebook. She went on at that meeting to promise a full consultation and traffic impact reports before any decision was made.\nInstead of what was promised the wider community was suddenly informed in September 2018 that an experimental traffic order would be made to close School Road. The council have not given any indication of where they think the traffic will be dispersed to or reassurance it won’t cause or exacerbate similar problems elsewhere. I’ve stood and counted traffic over the past few weeks at a number of junctions to try and get a better idea of the volume and direction for myself. Over 100 cars an hour come from Ashfield Road onto School Rd heading towards Moseley in peak time. That is in addition to the 100 or so that come along School Rd towards Moseley from the roundabout. The council’s preferred alternative route for this traffic is Alcester Rd or Billesley Lane. However, what is to stop it coming down the more likely route of Greenhill Rd, which is also residential? Is the best solution really to push traffic onto similar residential side roads? As you point out, I do live on Greenhill Road and many of my neighbours have knocked my door voicing those same concerns. Currently they are asking for a consultation and traffic impact studies. They quite understandably want reassurance from the council that Greenhill Road won’t become the new rat run. We already experience speeding down the hill. If the volume of traffic on Greenhill Road increases in the first six months of a trial I think those residents are instead going to be loudly objecting to the closure itself.\nAlso, although it is not to say an accident isn’t likely, there has not been any reported injury accidents in School Rd. However there have been several injury accidents and a fatal when a cyclist was killed in Billesley Lane, which has over 1000 cars per hour along it in peak time and it’s own problems with speeding and road rage incidents. Billesley Lane at Oxford Road is a very dangerous junction. Yet Billesley Lane and Oxford Road residents have also not been given a say. Many didn’t know about the scheme until recently. Again you could end up with many objections during the consultation period of the trial. Cambridge Road residents are similarly potentially affected and concerned.\nThe council should have got it’s act together a year ago and thought this through. By opting to trial a system, no matter how innovative, that is designed to deal with traffic rat runs in a neighbourhood, rather than to address one small section of road, they really needed to have anticipated that the wider community would expect to be consulted and to be given sufficient information to make the best decision possible. The fact that over five times as many people signed a recent petition calling for a consultation than made comments at the initial meeting shows the strength of feeling for this.\nThis council now need to take the lead and in doing so they should do everything possible to make sure this is not only the right solution to address the issue but they are not pushing the problem elsewhere and they have the community on side – otherwise we will end up back at the drawing board and no one is happy. A lot of money will go into this experimental scheme. We want it to work otherwise what is the point.\nI will continue to push for action for School Road and all the other rat runs and dangerous roads we have in the ward. I do get things done in Moseley, but I’m not an authoritarian, I communicate and do it with the community.\nI’d be very happy to meet with you to discuss this further and answer any concerns you have.\nVery best wishes\nIzzy\nLikeLike",

She has also talked with the Highways Engineer about adding double yellow parking restrictions on Wake Green Road outside Moseley and St Bernards Schools.\nAfter the walkabout she sent a further email to Birmingham City Council:\nDear B’ham Connected team\nYesterday Cllr Jenkins and I together with Cllr Clements , Highways Engineer Garry Dalton and local residents completed a walk about of Yardley Wood Road, Moseley between Swanshurst Lane/Coldbath Road and Wake Green Road.\nThis is a boundary road in the Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People scheme.\nAs part of the scheme this section of Yardley Wood Road is due to become 20mph. So is Wake Green Road from Yardley Wood Road to St Mary’s Row.\nTwo things were raised during the walkabout which we would be very grateful if you could consider in the final design of the scheme.\nFirstly – There is a big need for a pedestrian crossing on Yardley Wood Road. This could be one of two locations – where there are currently pedestrian refuges. The first is just after the junction of Windermere Road where many families and children cross to go to Windermere Playing Fields and Moseley school and the other is opposite the entrance to Moseley Bog. I have suggested in my previous feedback to the PfP scheme that if funding is the issue the proposed pedestrian crossing on Billesley Lane could be re-located to Yardley Wood Road. My rationale for this is Billesley Lane will have chicanes and speed humps which should reduce speeding considerably, whilst Yardley Wood Road is reduced to 20mph with no further measures.\nSecondly: Hayfield Road is used as a cut-through between Yardley Wood Road and Wake Green Road and a number of speeding-related collisions have occurred. It is currently 30mph. Residents there have petitioned for calming measures and are concerned traffic will increase due to the PfP scheme. Wake Green Road, between Swanshurst Lane and Yardley Wood road is currently also 30mph. There are two schools along it’s length, Moseley School and St Bernards Primary School. St Bernards in particular has reported issues with speeding including a car overturning at 8.30 am outside the school on a school day a few weeks ago. Both schools are trying to encourage pupils to walk or cycle but safety is a huge concern to staff and parents. We discussed yesterday that these two roads could be added to the TRO to also be made 20mph as part of the PfP scheme and it would not add significantly to the cost. This seems a very sensible and cost-effective action to take to address the real and increasing issue of speeding on these roads, to assist both schools with their active travel plans and reassure residents.\nI look forward to hearing more about the design and the progress of the scheme in order to update residents.\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nCouncillor Izzy Knowles\nIzzy has received a reply:\nDear Cllr Knowles,\nThank you for sharing these comments with us following your recent site visit.\nI have forwarded these onto the project team responsible for producing the detailed design for the Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People project to take into account as part of this work.\nWe are meeting with them shortly to discuss how to keep people informed of developments over the next few months as this scheme progresses to delivery, and will update you further following this.\nRegards, Joe\nJoe Green\nTravel Demand Manager – Transport Planning & Network Strategy\nBirmingham City Council",

David Farrow and I first started campaigning on this issue in March 2018. In September 2018 I submitted a 90 signature petition from residents calling for action to stop driving and parking of cars on these green spaces due to the damage they were causing to the grass, the danger to pedestrians and the extra pollution in an area that already suffers from excessive traffic. See my previous post about it here\nLocal residents campaigned years ago to stop these spaces being built on, they regularly litter pick and plant bulbs with the children from Anderton Park School. They very much value the green space as a community asset. After submitting the petition we were told there was no money, however we continued to make the case for action sending photographs and video evidence to the highways, parks dept and local police team. I organised two site visits with the head of Parks dept (who are responsible for the land) and following the second visit he agreed action was needed. This was started with the lovely planters on the corners of the greens to prevent driving across the pavement and now we have the trip rail being fitted. A big thank you and well done to the residents, especially to Elaine & Rob who didn’t give up and helped to lobby and provide the evidence we needed to get action.",

From talking to neighbours it would appear two cars were racing each other down the hill from the direction of Kings Heath. The driver of the red Skoda in the photo has lost control on hitting the bend as he approached Greenhill Road junction, shot across the mouth of the junction, hit a bag of builders sand that was on the verge and spun into the tree, damaging the wall.The three occupants then left the scene in the second car which pulled up along side. Whilst I was talking to one of the neighbours three males turned up and started to remove items from the car, including the keys which had been left in the ignition. They all left again when I called the police. However over an hour later the police had still not arrived. The reason I’m writing is that this is the third similar collision on Billesley Lane in less than six months where vehicles have left the road at speed and crashed into houses or garden walls. As you know my neighbours and I have been recording traffic flow and volume at various junctions for the last few months, both before and after the modal filters were recently put in place in School Road and Cambridge Road . Our findings show a significant increase of traffic using both Greenhill Road and Oxford Road to travel between Kings Heath/Moseley and so adding to the pressure of traffic on Billesley Lane especially at these two junctions. Billesley Lane is not a major road. It has a high volume of cyclists and pedestrian traffic as well as vehicles. It is crossed by many pupils walking to and from local primary and secondary schools. St Agnes Church Hall on the corner of Dyott Road is in normal non lockdown times used by mother and toddler groups, pre school, cubs and brownies and various after school clubs with both children and adults frequently crossing the road at this junction. The One Stop shop is a very busy local shop used by many families who walk or cycle.Moseley Tennis Club is used by families and children, again many walk or cycle to classes or events.Two of these recent crashes have happened in the early evening when pedestrian traffic is normally heavier. Speeding and racing has long been an issue on roads like Billesley Lane. However this year it has become much more prevalent. Collisions like this one, although not resulting in injury are incredibly upsetting and frightening to residents and to passers by. However, possibly because there was no injury, they are not being taken seriously by the police.Residents who have lived on or near this road have felt ignored for a long time. They are now concerned they will be left to bear the burden of the redirected traffic from other roads within the LTN and incidents like this will increase.We have a real opportunity to address this now. I am urging you to ensure that Billesley Lane is considered for some serious traffic calming measures which could even involve re modelling the junctions.I’m also asking that the police please take much more interest including robust investigation of reports of no insurance, dangerous driving and fail to stop as well as increased speed checks during the evenings and partnership working to obtain more equipment and traffic calming measures in known collision hot spots. I look forward to hearing from you\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nWe can hear them racing along Billesley Lane every night from our bedroom. Is there no possibility of arrests?\nLikeLike\nIt would only need there to be an arrest for dangerous driving and the news would soon get around to stop this constant racing on Billesley Lane.\nLikeLike\nHi David.

So is Wake Green Road from Yardley Wood Road to St Mary’s Row.\nTwo things were raised during the walkabout which we would be very grateful if you could consider in the final design of the scheme.\nFirstly – There is a big need for a pedestrian crossing on Yardley Wood Road. This could be one of two locations – where there are currently pedestrian refuges. The first is just after the junction of Windermere Road where many families and children cross to go to Windermere Playing Fields and Moseley school and the other is opposite the entrance to Moseley Bog. I have suggested in my previous feedback to the PfP scheme that if funding is the issue the proposed pedestrian crossing on Billesley Lane could be re-located to Yardley Wood Road. My rationale for this is Billesley Lane will have chicanes and speed humps which should reduce speeding considerably, whilst Yardley Wood Road is reduced to 20mph with no further measures.\nSecondly: Hayfield Road is used as a cut-through between Yardley Wood Road and Wake Green Road and a number of speeding-related collisions have occurred. It is currently 30mph. Residents there have petitioned for calming measures and are concerned traffic will increase due to the PfP scheme. Wake Green Road, between Swanshurst Lane and Yardley Wood road is currently also 30mph. There are two schools along it’s length, Moseley School and St Bernards Primary School. St Bernards in particular has reported issues with speeding including a car overturning at 8.30 am outside the school on a school day a few weeks ago. Both schools are trying to encourage pupils to walk or cycle but safety is a huge concern to staff and parents. We discussed yesterday that these two roads could be added to the TRO to also be made 20mph as part of the PfP scheme and it would not add significantly to the cost. This seems a very sensible and cost-effective action to take to address the real and increasing issue of speeding on these roads, to assist both schools with their active travel plans and reassure residents.\nI look forward to hearing more about the design and the progress of the scheme in order to update residents.\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nCouncillor Izzy Knowles\nIzzy has received a reply:\nDear Cllr Knowles,\nThank you for sharing these comments with us following your recent site visit.\nI have forwarded these onto the project team responsible for producing the detailed design for the Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People project to take into account as part of this work.\nWe are meeting with them shortly to discuss how to keep people informed of developments over the next few months as this scheme progresses to delivery, and will update you further following this.\nRegards, Joe\nJoe Green\nTravel Demand Manager – Transport Planning & Network Strategy\nBirmingham City Council",

Had it happened in good time this continuing debate would have been decided a long time ago.\nThere is to be no consultation on this plan which is using emergency powers. Whether these are being correctly used to re introduce pre – existing schemes is a possible future debate.\nPeople who have been calling for action to deal with the traffic issues on School Road for the last three years are rightfully happy that something is finally happening, but there is also a clear sense of frustration amongst a wider group of residents, who understandably feel that the Covid19 situation is being used to push through unpopular and ill thought out measures via the back door, and that once again their views are being ignored.\nI feel that the Council should now be absolutely clear with residents what the real aim of this scheme is. It is currently being sold as temporary measures to assist with social distancing, however what are the longer term aims? Is it to solve the issue of vehicles mounting the pavement on one short and narrow section of School Road or is it to introduce the beginnings of a Mini Holland low traffic neighbourhood to the wider area? I believe this vagueness over several years has helped to exacerbate the contentiousness of the scheme and has caused distrust, confusion and uncertainty.\nI look forward to learning of the finalised proposals and how they are to be communicated to the local community. I anticipate there will be more representations as the wider community, especially those not engaged on social media, become aware. I am sure there will be many more demands for traffic calming measures in surrounding streets. I am aware residents in Cambridge Road, Greenhill Road, Oxford Road, Prospect Road, Springfield Road and Billesley Lane are all concerned of an increase in traffic displaced due to this scheme.\nBillesley Lane already suffers from an alarming number of serious incidents of excessive speed. Only last month a racing, out of control car and it’s driver ended up in front gardens and badly damaged two houses, and there have been at least one fatal and several very serious accidents. Is it really fair to those residents that more traffic should be diverted down this already busy road, without their being even given a chance to make representations?\nSo to address all of this and to restore community confidence in local consultation and involvement I have proposed to the Councillors that a working group be set up with representatives who can communicate with people from all of the affected streets, to also include members of the community who are often forgotten, such as people with limited mobility who rely on the car to get about. The brief would be to properly discuss and examine the options first put forward to residents in 2018, with as much evidence as possible and support from people with expertise in traffic management and council officers.\nThey would also gather evidence of issues in surrounding streets and aspirations of residents in dealing with them. The end result should be a decent community led neighbourhood plan, which could be a low traffic neighbourhood or something else, to be implemented possibly in stages but with a time line and evidenced rationale.\nThe group could report to the Councillors ward meeting, to the Moseley Forum or to the Moseley Regeneration group.\nGood suggestions Izzy, I live in Oxford road & there has been a lot of concern on our WhatsApp group. The options for School Road also need to consider the impact of the reopening stations in Moseley & Kings Heath.\nGood suggestions Izzy, I live in Oxford road & there has been a lot of concern on our WhatsApp group.

Some didn’t receive their form in a timely manner because councils (including Birmingham) were too slow sending them out. Some completed the form but their local council didn’t receive it in time. Some completed the form and returned it on time, but their local council failed to process it in time. Some fell foul of administrative mistakes made by their local council. Whatever the reason, people turned up at polling stations expecting to vote and found their name crossed out\nMeanwhile in other European countries, British citizens were denied a UK postal vote because their local council sent out voting forms by the slowest possible method, which meant they did not arrive sufficiently early that they could be returned on time.\nSince the government’s inadequate preparation for the European elections would appear to be in contravention of European law, The 3 Million, a group that campaigns on behalf of non-British EU citizens, is investigating legal action. They are seeking evidence, so if you were affected by this disenfranchisement you can help them by sending information through their website DeniedMyVote\nWhether you were directly affected or not, please spread the word.\nAlso, please add your name to a government petition created by EU in Brum, calling for a public inquiry:\nAgain, please spread the word. They are already more than half way to getting a response from government. 100,000 signatures will ensure it is debated in Parliament.\nThe requirement for an EU citizen to complete an extra declaration that they will not vote in their country of origin varies between member states with the UK easily being the most bureaucratic. Citizens from Eire, Malta & Cyprus do not need to do it at all. Non German EU citizens voting in Germany are not required to fill in a form but are given a warning they commit an offence if they vote twice. Non Dutch EU citizens voting in the Netherlands fill in a form once when they first register to vote.\nNo person should be denied their democratic right to vote and all effort should be made to enable them to exercise that right.",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_tag_moor-green-lane/content_91.html": "Last week the council published their proposals for the West Moseley Traffic Reduction Scheme. I wrote about the details here\nI would like to try to explain the rationale for the proposal to put a modal filter on Moor Green Lane using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO).\nFirstly, I would like to reassure residents there are no plans to put a similar filter on Russell Road. That option was considered by officers, who were looking at possibly incorporating it into the Cannon Hill Park to Moseley cycle lane extension, but it was not taken forward to the design stage.\nThe proposal for a filter on Moor Green Lane has come about due to the many concerns raised from residents of Russell Road, Reddings Road and Moor Green Lane about the volume of traffic, speeding and dangerous driving in residential roads in West Moseley. Some residents have been campaigning for action for many years.\nQueensbridge Secondary School and Moor Green Primary School report excessive volumes of traffic, inconsiderate parking and speeding. Many parents say they feel their children are unsafe travelling to school by bicycle or foot, and they have no option but to ferry them by car. There are also two special needs schools in the area, Uffculme and Fox Hollies.\nA traffic calming scheme proposed in 2022 for Russell Road was shelved in 2024 due to the excessive cost – approx. £620,000 pounds and rising. Costs of installing infrastructure have increased astronomically since Brexit and the Pandemic.\nIt was also felt that the scheme would not reduce the volume of traffic, which is a priority of the council as part of the Birmingham Transport Plan.\nOne modal filter in one location is much cheaper to install than a traffic calming scheme over a wider area. A modal filter in Moor Green Lane will likely cost less than a 10th of the previously proposed measures for Russell Road.\nAs much as everyone wants speed cameras, they are unlikely to be considered a priority for 20mph roads until there is a change of law. Speeding fine revenue goes straight to the government treasury and is used for general government expenditure. This means the cost of installation and maintenance of any speed cameras has to be met by the council and costs of administration of the offences are met by the police, with no revenue coming back other than for speed awareness courses, which does not cover the costs. There are currently only six speeding camera sites in Birmingham. Although work is on going to add more, they will inevitably be placed on arterial A routes within the city.\nNeither calming nor cameras will reduce traffic volume, which has got steadily worse in residential streets, mainly due to the use of satellite navigation systems.\nFaced with these barriers to addressing the many complaints and campaigns the council officers looked at a wider area than Russell Road. They discovered most of the traffic travelling through the West Moseley area comes via Moor Green Lane. They estimated if they stop the through traffic using this route it will reduce the amount of traffic using all the residential streets as a cut through by up to half and most of what will subsequently come into the area will be local.\nIt is anecdotally argued that local people are less likely to speed or drive dangerously in their own neighbourhoods. Indeed, if you look at roads where through traffic is restricted there is evidence of a much lower rate of collisions.\nLess traffic, fewer collisions and reduced amount of speeding will make the area much safer, especially outside the schools.\nThere is of course a potential for the traffic to be displaced to other roads. This is why the proposal would be undertaken with an experimental /trial order rather than an immediate permanent one. There would be monitoring of traffic volume and flows across the area before and after the filter is installed. If it doesn’t work or it causes undue problems to other roads it can be removed. The ETRO involves consultation prior to implementation and during the first six months of it being installed.\nThe advantage to installing a filter is safer, more pleasant streets, which for people who are able to cycle or walk or use a mobility scooter, will encourage and empower them to use their car less often.\nThe disadvantage is that if you do need to drive somewhere it may be slightly longer. But, overall the number of short journeys made by people will be reduced, as people use their cars less. That is not a bad thing, the major threat to air pollution is caused by traffic emissions.\nI understand why people are concerned about the use of an ETRO. An implementation will happen much quicker than if a permanent scheme were being proposed and there is a belief the council may make it permanent at the end of the experimental period, despite majority opposition.\nI have taken a lot of interest in the Kings Heath and South Moseley scheme since the first phase was implemented in 2020. It was not initially done very well and quite a number of changes have had to be made. It involved a much bigger series of measures, over many more streets than the West Moseley scheme is proposing. As a result opinion became very divided with as many residents wanting to keep and expand the scheme as those opposing. It is also still not fully complete with changes to the West side of the High Street planned, to replace modal filters with diagonal filters, creating more one way streets and the East side of the High Street and Moseley measures yet to be installed. The right turn from Vicarage Road to Alcester Road South is to be re-instated, which will ease the traffic build up at that junction. The biggest cause of traffic build up in Vicarage Road has long been from Camp Hill Schools and that has not been reduced, although the Pineapple Station opening should have a positive impact.\nIt is clear, however that lessons have been learned and a huge amount of consultation has gone into the second phase.\nIn contrast with that scheme the impact of one filter in Moor Green Lane will be much easier to measure, as will the level of local support.\nI do urge everyone to go to one of the drop in events and talk to the officers and make them aware of how you feel both about the use of an ETRO and how you feel the scheme will affect you, whether it is positive or negative. I will be at both events as I do want to hear the feedback from residents.\nAlthough I have outlined why the scheme is being proposed, that does not mean I won’t take into consideration all the reasons people give for why they oppose or support it. I understand there is no proposal that will satisfy the needs of everyone.\nI hope this post helps at least explain why the proposal has come about and what it is trying to achieve.",

The currently tiny section of segregated cycle lane is to be extended from Alder Lane to Brighton Road. As a cyclist I welcome this because the current road markings are not fit for purpose and the cycle lane is are used as a car park .\nHowever what has been totally missing from this scheme from start to end is any sort of meaningful consultation. The original consultation in 2019 lasted for less than three weeks and was, as far as I can see, mainly online on the Be Heard website .\nThat initial consultation clearly says that ‘before this change to a one way road is made permanent, there will be a formal public consultation‘. So what happened to that ? I haven’t seen it, and none of the businesses or residents in that area I’ve asked have been approached. I might welcome the change as a cyclist but I was never given the opportunity to formally give this feedback and others may disagree.\nThis total lack of engagement with our communities is what causes people to lose faith in the council and become negative and apathetic about changes which could be positive for them.\nThere is nothing less empowering than having things done to you rather than with you. Imposing changes with no notice, giving less than three weeks to comment on them, pitching them as experimental but then later making them permanent is just not good enough.\nYou can see the latest update regarding the Ladypool ERTO on line here",

This topic has been number one in any political hustings for many years! We were always told that the issue stopping it happening was the cost of building the Camp Hill chord – a link to redirect the trains to Moor Street station as New St does not have the capacity for the extra services. In 2013 Moseley Forum was made aware that the land where a developer is now seeking this permission to build was to be sold by Birmingham City Council. They together with other community groups and local councillors objected to the sale on the grounds it could compromise the later building of the Camp Hill chord. However, Birmingham City Council in their wisdom, dismissed the need to protect the route of the link railway line stating they could ‘always compulsorily purchase it back’ at a later date.\nIn September 2018 Transport for West Midlands, West Midlands Rail Executive and Network Rail unveiled initial designs to rebuild stations at Moseley, Kings Heath and Hazelwell with the expectation the line will re-open to allow two passenger services an hour into New Street station, in time for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. This news was received with enormous excitement and anticipation locally but also many calls to West Midlands Mayor, Andy Street to ensure that the construction of the Camp Hill chord would still happen, so the line will in time become a fully functional high frequency train service. He fully acknowledged this call and stated that the opening of the line earlier than expected would not stop later construction of the chords which are now referenced in the Birmingham Development Plan, the Bordesley Area Action Plan, the West Midlands Local Transport Plan, in the proposed enhancements pipeline for the London North Western route and in the long-term strategies of Midlands Connect and West Midlands Rail Executive.\nNetwork Rail is currently carrying out development work on the Midlands Rail Hub on behalf of Midlands Connect; a Strategic Outline Business Case is due for submission to the Department for Transport by summer 2019.\nThe Camp Hill chord would allow up to 10 extra trains an hour in and out of Birmingham, that’s 85,000 extra seats a day. This will enable many more passengers into and out of Birmingham so easing pressure on our already congested road system and reducing vehicle emissions both in the centre and suburbs of Birmingham. The Midlands Rail Hub project is being developed by Midlands Connect to significantly increase passenger capacity to and from Birmingham from across the Midlands and the South West. Early analysis suggests the Midlands Rail Hub could bring overall economic benefits of £649 million a year to the region and the country by 2037.\nNetwork Rail stated in 2017 that the work that included the Camp Hill chord was worth up to £2billion of economic benefits through unlocking jobs and supporting economic growth and maximising transport connectivity.\nIf this planning application is approved the subsequent development has the potential to block the alignment and construction of the Camp Hill chord preventing the expansion of and long term desired frequency of rail passenger services. This would be a huge blow for the Birmingham and West Midlands community. Economic and environmental drivers will be severely and critically harmed if this planning application is allowed to go ahead in any form that prevents the city from installing the Camp Hill Chord.\nOn behalf of the community of Moseley and Kings Heath I ask Birmingham City Council planning committee, when considering this application, that as a very minimum sufficient land is protected to enable the construction and accommodation of an up and down south/east railway link at Bordesley from the Camp Hill railway line, known as the Camp Hill chord.\nI also urge the applicants and developers to work with the council, with Network Rail and local rail community groups to protect the future alignments of the proposed Camp Hill chords and to explore mutually beneficial opportunities for both developments to avoid any impediment to the chords’ future construction.\nIzzy Knowles\nMoseley Liberal Democrats”\nOne Reply to “”",

I have written back to ask that both Billesley Lane and Oxford Road residents are included in the letter to be sent out.\nFrom: Gill Brook <Gill.Brook@birmingham.gov.uk>\nDate: Mon, 10 Sep 2018 at 10:16\nSubject: RE: School Road Traffic Issues\nTo: Izzy Knowles <moseleylibdems@gmail.com>\nCc: Joe Green\nHi Izzy, thank you for your email. The information on the School Road Issues Facebook page was taken from a direct response to an email they sent in to our assistant director. The response was as follows:\nDear School Road Issues group\nThank you for your email of 13th August in response to the message sent out by Gill Brook on 19th July. I would like to respond to the points you have raised as follows:\n- I can confirm that the experimental closure is still proposed for between Cotton Lane and Greenhill Road. There appears to have been a discrepancy between the information that was shown at the meeting in January 2018 and what was passed on from this. Apologies for any confusion, this has now been clarified.\n- Before any scheme can be implemented, we need to take the proposal through the city council’s project management process, to obtain approval and release the required funding. The paperwork for this has been written, and is due to be taken through the first stage of this process on 10th September. With regards to the letter drop, this is not to formally consult on the experimental order but to make local residents, businesses and schools aware of what is being proposed as a matter of courtesy. There are many local people who would be affected by an experimental closure of School Road, and we need to make sure people in all local streets are informed of the proposal.\n- Once the project management process is complete, and letters have been distributed across the local area informing people of the proposed experimental closure, the management of this scheme will be handed across to the local engineer. They will make the necessary arrangements for the implementation of the scheme. It is hoped that the timescale for this will be in the next couple of months. I am happy to look to arrange a meeting with yourselves along with relevant officers and local Councillors if you feel that this would be useful for further clarification and discussion.\nWith regards to the questions you have asked:\n- The 64% figure refers to the total responses we received, including those from the meeting, and those we received after the meeting, including those that you kindly forwarded to us.\nThe total number of responses we received was 109.\nThis was made up of :\n3 in favour of Option 1\n1 in favour of Option 2\n7 in favour of Option 3\n28 in favour of Option 4\n70 in favour of Option 5A/5B\n- We will be sending the community wide letter to the entire length of School Road, any road that leads directly off School Road (and roads leading off these), Valentine Road and Cambridge Road. The area will be bounded to the north-east by Oxford Road and to the east by Billesley Lane (but will not include these roads).\n- The public meeting was a resident led initiative, and therefore this is something that you would need to speak to the organisers about.\nI hope that the information above answers your queries.\nKind regards, Gill\nGill Brook BA (Comb Hons)\nSenior Transportation Officer – Transportation Behaviour Change\nOne Reply to “”",

Mike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “This is the type of creative idea that would boost small businesses and balance out the playing field.”\nHall Green Liberal Democrat spokesperson Izzy Knowles said:\n“Small businesses in Hall Green constituency are worried about their ability to stay afloat over the coming months. For so many, Christmas is their most lucrative time of year but coronavirus restrictions have caused footfall to nosedive.\n“When people turn online to do their Christmas shopping, free postage offers from online shopping giants are incredibly tempting. That makes it even tougher for our local small businesses putting our high streets at further risk. Ministers must level the playing field.”\nLiberal Democrat Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine MP added:\n“In the Summer, the Chancellor launched a campaign to support the hospitality sector. We now need to see this Government go the extra mile to support small business in the festive period.\n“We want the Chancellor to pay the postage on online purchases from small local independent shops to make them a more viable option for people hunting for Christmas presents and encourage people to shop small from home.”\nMike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:\n“This is the type of creative idea that would boost small businesses and balance out the playing field.\n“We must do everything we can to help our small, independent stores.\n“This is going to be the most important festive season our economy has ever seen and could be make-or-break for some of our small businesses.\n“That’s why we must pull out all the stops to help them survive the end of 2020 and beyond.”\nThe text of the letter sent from Christine Jardine is as follows: “Dear Rishi, I would like to ask you to consider a support scheme for small businesses through the festive season which would help them in a similar way to the ‘eat out to help out’ campaign which the Government funded in the summer. Small businesses in England are missing out on business in precious lucrative months and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland footfall is still significantly reduced even though a full lockdown hasn’t been imposed. I urge you to explore pathways to pay the postage on online purchases from small local independent shops to make them a more viable option for people hunting Christmas presents and encourage people to shop small from home. The free postage offers from online shopping giants and the ease of using Amazon Prime are incredibly tempting for those Christmas shopping online. Paying postage on each individual Christmas purchase is a burden that is likely to repel shoppers from picking small retailers. That makes it an even tougher climate for small business and shut shops.The prohibitive nature of these costs rings especially true for those in remote or rural communities for whom delivery charges are unjustly steep. I am urging to embrace this idea as a way to stimulate traffic to small business sites. Removing the delivery cost burden would encourage shoppers to select individual items from different small shops – rather than resorting to bulk buy from large suppliers. I look forward to your response. Yours sincerely, Christine Jardine”",

If the problems of missed collections and poor recycling rates cannot be resolved, the Lib Dems would bring in partners to provide services in different parts of the city, the manifesto says.\n- Liberal Democrats call for radical devolution of power and resources to communities in the city, meaning genuine consultation with residents on any proposed changes to their communities\n- Prioritising safety around schools, by proposing funding for up to 400 “walking bus conductors” who would be the key to creating safe streets round the city’s schools for children and families\n- Liberal Democrats would focus on ensuring streets are kept clean, fly-tippers prosecuted and residents have accessible, free services for waste collection in their streets.\n- The Liberal Democrats say that under Labour, the Council has failed to listen to the concerns of its residents, spending money on “vanity projects” rather than basic services – and that this must be reversed.\nSpeaking on the manifesto, Cllr Jon Hunt, group leader for the Lib Dems on Birmingham Council, said:\n“People across the city are crying out for change, demanding a new direction for their community. Lib Dems have been demanding better and achieving much from opposition. We need more Lib Dems elected for positive change in Birmingham.\n“Birmingham city ward and Sutton Coldfield Parish ward residents and businesses are fed up with a Conservative government that’s given up caring, and a Birmingham Labour-run council that has long stopped listening.\n“Liberal Democrats agree with residents that our local areas need more power, more investment, and more care. As we recover from the pandemic, we need investment across our communities, not just spent in one area on vanity projects.\n“I’m very proud of this manifesto, and even prouder of the work across our city by hard-working Lib Dems. We want to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, fight against climate change for a secure future, and ensure people finally get a genuine say in their own communities.\n“The Conservative party has shown that it can’t lead, and Birmingham Labour doesn’t listen. People want change, people want a brighter future, and that’s what can be had by voting Lib Dem on May 5.”\nThe manifesto can be downloaded HERE (PDF)",

Local councillor NAME said “I have heard stories of people waiting over 24 hours to be seen, and people who have been treated in cupboards because of the lack of space available. The A&E department is not big enough to cope with demand. It needs urgent investment and the Liberal Democrats are campaigning hard for that.”\nThe Liberal Democrats want to see a new or improved building at the hospital. One that is big enough to cope with the demand of over 400,000 people who live in the area. There is a lot of deprivation around the area and health issues.

I have supported residents and schools in their campaigns for road safety measures and increased enforcement and I have shared their frustration when they fail to get any commitment to address their concerns, either due to lack of funds or out of date policies and priorities and when previously agreed schemes have been later cancelled. I have submitted at least six petitions, taken two successful road safety motions to council to change policy and contributed to a scrutiny enquiry into the council response to road safety and enforcement.\nThis is why, together with Councillor Jenkins, I was supportive of the councils request to take this scheme to residents in a consultation, as their views and feedback are extremely important to me. I tried to explain the rationale behind the scheme and its aims and benefits, of which I was also supportive, to enable a more informed decision to be made.\nI have carefully listened and responded in full to the large amount of feedback received over the first two weeks of the consultation.\nAlthough I have had some very positive responses, the vast majority of feedback is that people feel traffic will be displaced causing congestion to other roads and driving routes will be longer and more difficult.\nI have also taken into account the representations made by the parents of pupils at Special Educational Needs (SEN) schools in Queensbridge Road concerning the impact on childrens’ travel arrangements. I think they raise valid concerns and more time should be taken to consult and consider their needs.\nThe Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO), if implemented would have run for 12 months from the end of April. This will coincide with works at the entrance to Kings Heath Train station, followed by extensive works at Moseley Train Station, lasting well into the summer, followed by Phase 2 of the Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People scheme, which will not be fully implemented until Spring 2026.\nI cannot therefore rule out the impact of traffic congestion or hold ups caused by all these other works, on being able to properly evaluate the West Moseley scheme.\nMy report sent to officers yesterday is that now is not the time to implement a scheme such as this. We need to wait until Phase 2 Kings Heath and Moseley Places for People is consulted, installed and bedded in and the train stations are open and running and then we can re-evaluate the situation in West Moseley. We can use that time to further engage with the community and schools to explore other possible solutions, with the objective of applying for sufficient future funds. I have an open mind to study any ideas to improve road safety that are put forward.\nI would like to publicly thank the council officers who tried their best, under very difficult financial restraints, to find an answer to the concerns raised , whilst also adhering to council policy.

It may have been built as the engineering workshop and coach house for Uffculme Hall and is part of the Cadbury family history. It was used for community meetings and believed it may have been the base for the Pocket Testament League\nIn 1970 the land and buildings were bequeathed to Birmingham City Council and used as a base for the Parks department. It has been empty and the buildings semi derelict since 2009.\nYou can read Martins document here:\nIn June 2018 the site was included on a list of sites for sale by Birmingham City Council. Representations were made by various organisations, including Moseley Forum, Highbury Orchard, and Kings Heath & Moseley Shed as well as both Moor Green Lane and Russell Road Residents Associations. There was also a petition. The site was withdrawn from sale following the concerns raised and a presentation at a Moseley Forum meeting. The important local interest, as well as the difficulties with traffic flows were the reasons given for ‘disposal for residential’ being rejected and withdrawal of the property for sale.\nThe same happened in 2020 when again it was put on a disposal list by BCC. Councillor Lisa Trickett gave assurances at that time that ‘no development would occur on this site and no future decision would be made on its use until ‘we are clear on how it might fit to securing a wider community asset and viable future for Highbury Hall‘.\nIn the past few years local organisations including Highbury Orchard and Moseley and Kings Heath shed have expressed interest to explore the possibility of taking it over, restoring it and opening it for community use working with the local schools and trusts, such as the Uffculme Centre in the nearby locality.

I have copied below a reply I have received from Joe Green of the Transportation & Connectivity Team.\nI’ve also had previous confirmation that the letters will be sent to residents along the entire length of School Road, any road that leads directly off School Road (and roads leading off these), Valentine Road and Cambridge Road. Also (after I made some representation) it will now include Oxford Road between St. Mary’s Row and Billesley Lane, and Billesley Lane between Wake Green Road and the junction with Cambridge Road/ Southlands Road.\nFrom: Joe Green\nSent: 31/10/2018 16:48\nTo: Izzy Knowles; Gill Brook\nCc: Councillor Kerry Jenkins\nSubject: RE: School Road Traffic Issues\nHi Izzy,\nI sent some further information across to Cllr Jenkins this morning, on the back of a request from discussions at last night’s Moseley Forum meeting.The meeting you mention was requested by School Road Traffic Issues Group to provide them with an update, and was attended by Phil Edwards and myself.\nFurther answers to your questions are included below:\nPlease can you confirm whether an engineer has been allocated to the scheme yet and if so who it is?\nYes, this project has now been approved and funding allocated. It will be overseen by Natalia Haberko in our Infrastructure Delivery team. Gill and I are currently in the process of handing everything across to Natalia for taking things forward, but we will continue to be involved to support the communication and engagement elements of this scheme.\nWill there be any formal consultation either before or during the experimental period?\nA letter drop of the local area is being organised to inform residents of what is happening. It is envisaged that this will be sent out week commencing 12th November.\nIt is not necessary to hold formal (statutory) consultation for an experimental traffic order, other than with the emergency services who are in the process of being contacted.\nThere will be ongoing consultation while the experimental traffic order is in place, and any views or comments submitted during this period will be recorded to help inform future decisions.\nHow long do you envisage the experimental period to be?\nThe maximum length of time that an experimental traffic order can remain in place for is 18 months, after which point it is either progressed to a permanent intervention (pending formal consultation) or removed. It is generally seen as good practice to keep an experimental traffic order in place for a minimum of 6 months, but there is scope to remove it sooner than this if deemed necessary.\nThere is scope for the scheme to become permanent if it is deemed that the experimental road closure has been successful. However this would be subject to a formal consultation process – and this would need to have been completed within the maximum period of 18 months for an experimental traffic order for there to be no break in the provision of this intervention.\nWhat traffic surveys are planned to take place before and during the experimental scheme?\nNatalia will be developing monitoring arrangements for this scheme, which will include traffic counts before and during the experimental closure.\nThere is some existing data from traffic counts carried out at locations in the area last year that can potentially be used, and we will work with the local engineer to identify locations for any further counts; they have already suggested that the junctions of Oxford Road/St Mary’s Row and Billesley Lane/Wake Green Road should be included.\nI hope these answers are useful, we are keen to keep local residents informed of what is happening and shall continue to seek to do so.\nPlease do get in touch if there is anything else you would like to know at this stage.

There was also a suggestion that as it is an experimental scheme no further consultation will take place following the letter, which is still to go out to residents.\nPlease can you confirm whether an engineer has been allocated to the scheme yet and if so who it is?\nThis scheme is going to cost a lot of money to implement so it is important we get it right, otherwise it will be money wasted. I am concerned that the decision to carry out this experimental closure has been made with very little consultation and there are still people who will be directly affected who do not know it is taking place.\nWill there be any formal consultation either before or during the experimental period?\nHow long do you envisage the experimental period to be?\nI’m also concerned that proper measures need to be taken to correctly survey the amount and speed of traffic on these roads and potentially affected roads, both before and at periods after the experiment, so that the scheme can be properly evaluated.\nWhat traffic surveys are planned to take place before and during the experimental scheme?\nAre you able to please update me on these points?\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nIzzy Knowles\nMoseley Liberal Democrats\nIt would seem that Birmingham Council cannot keep their word! It was stated at the preliminary community meeting that they would not effect any plan that would just transfer the traffic problem onto ancillary roads, in other words, move the problem elsewhere, but this is exactly what they have done. If the Council sees fit to ignore the residents’ problems, we should return the compliment next election time. This intended measure is ill conceived and dangerous, in so many ways, and WE, the taxpayer are given no option but to pay for it. The whole consultation process has been a total sham, and only goes to confirm that the Council cannot be trusted to address our local problems.\nLikeLike\nHi David. Thanks for the comment. I have emailed the council to make representations for both a formal consultation and a traffic impact study to take place prior to the implementation of the scheme. If you haven’t done so already I suggest you also email the Councillors.\nBest wishes\nIzzy Knowles\nLikeLike\nHello Izzy, thank you for your reply. I cannot think that any resident communication at this point, to any Council member regarding the intended road closure of School Road, will have any effect on their plans, now apparently, being put into operation by a selected contractor. It is nothing more than an insult to the many residents who attended meetings to air the daily problems up and down the Road, mainly at the Kings Heath end, where I live. I can send you a photo taken today of careless obstructive parking opposite the Methodist church. This happens daily, and forces parents with push chairs, into the Road as the gaps left by inconsiderate motorists is too small to negotiate. The intended closure will do nothing to stop two way motorists from driving on the pavements. When this blockage is erected the chaos it will cause by unsuspecting traffic will force undue pressure on ancillary roads, something the Council has now ignored. Considering where this blockage is situated, there will be few turning spaces to redirect traffic. The financial cost of this ill thought out fiasco, also considering the on going maintenance of adequate lighting and illuminated warning signs, beggars belief as it ignores the fundamental points put forward by residents. Unless adequate night time illumination has been allowed for, I foresee a serious accident happening when anyone coming up School Road at night, happens upon this blockage as it occurs round a bend in the road. No one observes speed limits at night in School Road, and I very much doubt that the Council has considered this. I fear it will be a case of ‘I told you so’ in the event of an accident, but as usual no one will be held responsible. I thank you for your interest, but unless you have some political magic wand to wave, this will be yet another Council folly.\nLikeLiked by 1 person",

  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com/content_1.html": "Last week the council published their proposals for the West Moseley Traffic Reduction Scheme. I wrote about the details here\nI would like to try to explain the rationale for the proposal to put a modal filter on Moor Green Lane using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO).\nFirstly, I would like to reassure residents there are no plans to put a similar filter on Russell Road. That option was considered by officers, who were looking at possibly incorporating it into the Cannon Hill Park to Moseley cycle lane extension, but it was not taken forward to the design stage.\nThe proposal for a filter on Moor Green Lane has come about due to the many concerns raised from residents of Russell Road, Reddings Road and Moor Green Lane about the volume of traffic, speeding and dangerous driving in residential roads in West Moseley. Some residents have been campaigning for action for many years.\nQueensbridge Secondary School and Moor Green Primary School report excessive volumes of traffic, inconsiderate parking and speeding. Many parents say they feel their children are unsafe travelling to school by bicycle or foot, and they have no option but to ferry them by car. There are also two special needs schools in the area, Uffculme and Fox Hollies.\nA traffic calming scheme proposed in 2022 for Russell Road was shelved in 2024 due to the excessive cost – approx. £620,000 pounds and rising. Costs of installing infrastructure have increased astronomically since Brexit and the Pandemic.\nIt was also felt that the scheme would not reduce the volume of traffic, which is a priority of the council as part of the Birmingham Transport Plan.\nOne modal filter in one location is much cheaper to install than a traffic calming scheme over a wider area. A modal filter in Moor Green Lane will likely cost less than a 10th of the previously proposed measures for Russell Road.\nAs much as everyone wants speed cameras, they are unlikely to be considered a priority for 20mph roads until there is a change of law. Speeding fine revenue goes straight to the government treasury and is used for general government expenditure. This means the cost of installation and maintenance of any speed cameras has to be met by the council and costs of administration of the offences are met by the police, with no revenue coming back other than for speed awareness courses, which does not cover the costs. There are currently only six speeding camera sites in Birmingham. Although work is on going to add more, they will inevitably be placed on arterial A routes within the city.\nNeither calming nor cameras will reduce traffic volume, which has got steadily worse in residential streets, mainly due to the use of satellite navigation systems.\nFaced with these barriers to addressing the many complaints and campaigns the council officers looked at a wider area than Russell Road. They discovered most of the traffic travelling through the West Moseley area comes via Moor Green Lane. They estimated if they stop the through traffic using this route it will reduce the amount of traffic using all the residential streets as a cut through by up to half and most of what will subsequently come into the area will be local.\nIt is anecdotally argued that local people are less likely to speed or drive dangerously in their own neighbourhoods. Indeed, if you look at roads where through traffic is restricted there is evidence of a much lower rate of collisions.\nLess traffic, fewer collisions and reduced amount of speeding will make the area much safer, especially outside the schools.\nThere is of course a potential for the traffic to be displaced to other roads. This is why the proposal would be undertaken with an experimental /trial order rather than an immediate permanent one. There would be monitoring of traffic volume and flows across the area before and after the filter is installed. If it doesn’t work or it causes undue problems to other roads it can be removed. The ETRO involves consultation prior to implementation and during the first six months of it being installed.\nThe advantage to installing a filter is safer, more pleasant streets, which for people who are able to cycle or walk or use a mobility scooter, will encourage and empower them to use their car less often.\nThe disadvantage is that if you do need to drive somewhere it may be slightly longer. But, overall the number of short journeys made by people will be reduced, as people use their cars less. That is not a bad thing, the major threat to air pollution is caused by traffic emissions.\nI understand why people are concerned about the use of an ETRO. An implementation will happen much quicker than if a permanent scheme were being proposed and there is a belief the council may make it permanent at the end of the experimental period, despite majority opposition.\nI have taken a lot of interest in the Kings Heath and South Moseley scheme since the first phase was implemented in 2020. It was not initially done very well and quite a number of changes have had to be made. It involved a much bigger series of measures, over many more streets than the West Moseley scheme is proposing. As a result opinion became very divided with as many residents wanting to keep and expand the scheme as those opposing. It is also still not fully complete with changes to the West side of the High Street planned, to replace modal filters with diagonal filters, creating more one way streets and the East side of the High Street and Moseley measures yet to be installed. The right turn from Vicarage Road to Alcester Road South is to be re-instated, which will ease the traffic build up at that junction. The biggest cause of traffic build up in Vicarage Road has long been from Camp Hill Schools and that has not been reduced, although the Pineapple Station opening should have a positive impact.\nIt is clear, however that lessons have been learned and a huge amount of consultation has gone into the second phase.\nIn contrast with that scheme the impact of one filter in Moor Green Lane will be much easier to measure, as will the level of local support.\nI do urge everyone to go to one of the drop in events and talk to the officers and make them aware of how you feel both about the use of an ETRO and how you feel the scheme will affect you, whether it is positive or negative. I will be at both events as I do want to hear the feedback from residents.\nAlthough I have outlined why the scheme is being proposed, that does not mean I won’t take into consideration all the reasons people give for why they oppose or support it. I understand there is no proposal that will satisfy the needs of everyone.\nI hope this post helps at least explain why the proposal has come about and what it is trying to achieve.",

  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_page_7/content_108.html": "Update 4/2/18: The letter we recently sent to residents included ‘inconsiderate parking’ as one of the factors causing traffic issues on School Road. The impact survey reports an increased level of parking on that stretch of School Road at school pick up/drop off times. However the parking noted was not illegal and the narrowness of the road and lack of view from either end are also contributing factors. It is also important to note issues occur at all times of the day and not just during school times.\nResidents are calling for action to deal with the poor driving they are experiencing daily on the section of School Road from the roundabout outside Kings Heath Primary School to the junction with Prospect and Ashfield Roads.\nWe are concerned that not enough consultation has been done with people who do not use Facebook and who were not aware of or did not attend, the public meetings.\nWhat are the issues?\nThe issues faced by all users and residents of this route are:\n*Drivers regularly mounting and driving along the the pavement to pass oncoming traffic.\n*Aggressive behaviour from vehicle drivers including driving aggressively, verbal aggression, and physically intimidating behaviour.\n* Noise caused from horns and traffic grinding to a halt at numerous times of the day and week\n*Vehicles being driven at speed.\nThe current situation is dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. It is affecting the quality of life for residents and users of this road . School Road is an important access route to two local schools and is heavily used by children and families on foot at all times. Their safety, and that of other road users, is a risk.\nYou can see a video produced by School Road Action Group here:\nWhat are the solutions?\nAt a public meeting on 24th January 2018 six possible solutions were proposed by Councillor Trickett. They are listed below.\nIf you are unable to view the jpeg images we have included the six options as pdf files below . We have also included notes relating to the options produced by the council.\nOption 1\nOption 2\nOption 3\nOption 4\nOption 5A\nOption 5b\nNotes of Considered Options for issues relating to School Road\nFeedback so far:\nThese are some of the concerns/ points we noted that were raised at the meeting and in subsequent conversations:\n*No modelling /traffic impact assessment was presented and a completed traffic survey had not been circulated. (We now have a copy of the Traffic Impact Study dated 9/10/17 – please see below)\n*One way systems may need traffic calming to prevent increased speeding. Traffic calming humps are not good for motor cycles or cyclists and can increase pollution.\n*It could be dangerous for cyclists to travel two ways in a one way system, but preventing them from doing that would inconvenience cyclists when we are trying to encourage more cycling and could cause cyclists to ride on pavements .\n*A short two way system between two one way systems at the junction of Greenhill Road could be hazardous. This is already a difficult junction to manoeuvre out of.\n*Preventing traffic turning from High St into Valentine Road would lead to more congestion and tail backs and more traffic going up Poplar Road (and possibly Woodbridge Road/St Mary’s Row / Oxford Road)\n*Parking restrictions (option 4)with passing bays could be easily trialled but may not be enforced. There would be a displacement of parking to near by roads.\n*The Moseley triangle, Billesley Lane & Oxford Road could all be negatively impacted by larger volumes of traffic. (Before traffic calming was put into Billesley Lane in the late 90’s there was a fatal and several very serious accidents at the junction of Dyott Road).\n*Emergency vehicles may struggle to get through with options 5a & 5b. (It was suggested bollards could be removable)\n*Options 5a & 5b are different to the first 4 as they discourage vehicles from the whole region as opposed to one or two roads.\n*Options 5a & 5B could lead to the blocked off roads being used for car parking especially during school drop off and pick up times.\nTRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY\nWe have now obtained a copy of the Traffic Impact Study which you can see below together with all the appendices.\nNB: This study was undertaken in July & August 2017 to look into the impact on surrounding roads of the original proposed one way system (School Road between Blenheim Road & Valentine Rd/Springfield Rd/Poplar Road roundabout) which went out for consultation in June/July 2017 but was not progressed.\nAs the recent revised options also include one way systems along the same stretch we believe the report is still relevant although we would recommend it be updated if any of these schemes are taken further and made available as part of that consultation.\nTraffic Impact Study 9/10/17\nAppendix A – C1406 RTA Stats\nTables B1+B2\nDiagram C1\nDiagram C2\nDiagram C3\nTable C13\nTable C14\nTable C16\nTable C17\nTable C18\nTables C1-C3\nTables C4-C6\nTables C10-C12\nTables C7-C9\nDiagram D1\nTables D1-D4\nTables D5-D8\nTables D9-D12\nTables D13-D16\nTables D17-D20\nDiagram E1\nDiagram E2\nDiagram E3\nDiagram E4\nDiagram E5\nDiagram E6\nDiagram E7\nDiagram E8\nDiagram E9\nDiagram E10\nDiagram E11\nDiagram E12\nTables E1-E5\nTables E7-E11\nExisting Junction – AM Peak ARCADY Results\nExisting Junction – PM Peak ARCADY Results\nOne Way Scheme – AM Peak ARCADY Results\nOne Way Scheme – PM Peak ARCADY Results\nImse_gd_436 School Road (Option 2 – One-Way restriction)\nWhat happens now:\nCouncillor Trickett is seeking feedback on all the 6 options with the aim of one or two being put forward to a wider reaching public consultation and possibly trialled.\nYou can send feedback to:\nGill Brook\nDavid Clayfield\nWhat are your local Lib Dems doing:\nWe will be talking to residents over the coming weeks to gauge public opinion and would like to hear your thoughts on all of the options.\nYou can send us a message via our contact page, email moseleylibdems@gmail.com\nor call Izzy on 07784 155208\nWe are looking for the best solution to address the issues with the least impact on surrounding roads.

I sent a letter on behalf of Friends groups and residents expressing our concern that ending this contract would result in more issues of fly tipping, vehicle incursions and anti – social behaviour and compromise the security of buildings like the MAC. A short term saving would ultimately result in greater long term costs than renewing the current contract.\nAfter our letter, at the end of the trial, the contract was renewed for six months with a further review to take place before March.\nAt the Neighbourhoods Overview and Scrutiny Committee this week I asked Cllr Majid Mahmood if that review had taken place. He confirmed the gate locking contract would be renewed in March and said the council “would no longer proceed with that saving”.\nThis is a very sensible decision welcomed by Park Friends groups and park users across the city.",

Local Moseley campaigners have played a big part in making this happen. We are very hopeful of cross party support at full council.\nThis is the text of the motion Councillors Jon Hunt & Baber Baz will be bringing to the city council on Tuesday 11th September to cut the use of single use plastics. We’ve looked at ideas from other councils introduced by parties of all hues.\n“Council is alarmed at the growing evidence of the impact of disposable plastic items on the world’s oceans, fish supplies and the litter on the streets and in the hedgerows of Birmingham.\nCouncil notes and welcomes the success of plastic bag charging policies introduced by national governments. It calls for action at a city level so Birmingham makes a significant contribution to reducing disposal of plastics and cleaning up the environment.\nCouncil calls on the executive to:\n1. develop a robust strategy to make Birmingham City Council a ‘single-use-plastic-free’ authority by the end of 2019 and encourage the city’s institutions, businesses and citizens to adopt similar measures;\n2. end the sale and provision of disposable plastic products such as bottles, cups, cutlery and drinking straws in council buildings;\n3. . encourage market traders to sell re-usable containers and invite customers to bring their own, with the aim of phasing out single-use plastic containers and cutlery on market stalls by the end of 2019;\n4. investigate the possibility of requiring pop-up food and drink vendors at large council events to avoid disposable plastic items as a condition of their contract;\n5. promote refill schemes, in which retail businesses agree to free water refills, pointing them to the apps that are available to signpost customers to refill points;\n6. investigate the use of free water fountains in reception areas and elsewhere;\n7. further investigate having locally branded water containers for sale;\n8. work with tenants in commercial properties owned by Birmingham City Council to encourage the phasing out of disposable plastic cups, bottles, cutlery and straws.\n9.

This doesn’t include the waste actually put into bins. Currently all of Birmingham’s street waste goes to the Tyseley incinerator. We would like to see the city policy change to include re-cycling bins in our parks, streets and shopping areas.\nI wonder whether you would be interested in reviewing what happens to all of the nappies/pads that are used at care homes for senior citizens in your area. These are all made of man-made fibres and plastics, and are currently disintegrated in a machine in the sluice room and then swilled down the sewage system. This means that enormous amounts of plastics are currently disposed of without any consideration for the environment.\nThis is a far cry from the cans and bottles that have your attention now, but the scale is actually many times higher.\nLikeLike\nHi Ian. I hope you are well. Thanks ver much for raising this, I hadn’t thought if it and certainly will do now.

I am however disappointed no provision has been made to take into account the potential impact on Boundary Roads. I will continue to ensure community representations are fed back to the council to try to ensure the best possible scheme is implemented for the residents and businesses of Moseley. Cllr Izzy Knowles.\nCouncil Update on Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People project (phase 2) – September 2023\n“Places for People in Kings Heath & Moseley aims to reduce traffic in residential neighbourhoods so that it is safer for people to walk, wheel, and cycle and nicer to be outside, for children to play and neighbours to chat.\nA first phase of this scheme was delivered in 2020 in the form of temporary measures, which were made permanent in April 2022, with the intention that a second phase would implement a revised area-wide scheme.\nThe Outline Business Case for this next phase of the Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People project was approved by Cabinet in January 2023. Our specialist delivery team are now overseeing the completion of scheme designs and other points required to progress this to delivery.\nFollowing engagement with residents in Autumn 2022, some minor changes have been made to the final concept design layout ahead of delivery, specifically:\n- the addition of a modal filter at the junction of Yardley Wood Road and St Agnes Road (in\nplace of the proposed one-way ‘gyratory’ by St Agnes church) - the introduction of a diagonal modal filter (south-west to north-east) at the junction of\nSchool Road / Greenend Road / Greenhill Road, instead of the existing modal filter on School Road (and in place of the proposed modal filters on School Road and Greenhill Road) - making the section of Springfield Road between Addison Road and Institute Road one-way (northbound) along with consideration of any other traffic calming measures required here (as with Billesley Lane)\nA revised final concept design for Kings Heath & Moseley Places for People is shown below\nAn updated delivery programme is now being put in place based on a phased approach, with measures being delivered through separate packages as follows:\n1) improvements to phase 1 measures to the west of the High Street – including the York Road pedestrian zone – which already have TROs in place.\n2) new measures being introduced as part of phase 2 (to the east of the High Street) which will require new TROs – this includes modal filters, one-way streets, and traffic calming.\n3) a 20mph speed limit across the project area, including on ‘boundary’ roads.\n4) bus gate on Addison Road and reinstate a right turn from Vicarage Road onto High Street.\nWork is underway to complete design work, obtain internal approvals, advertise Traffic Regulation Orders (TROs) including statutory consultation, and award construction contracts. Further details, including envisaged timescales, will be shared as available.\nNotwithstanding the requirement to comply with any spend restrictions in place in advance of the Council setting out its Financial Recovery Plan, the funding allocated to this scheme comes from grants and income which is ring-fenced for sustainable travel and environmental improvements. This funding was committed by the Council’s Cabinet on 17 January 2023 and due to the nature of the funding, it cannot be used to fund any wider financial pressures across the City Council.“",

Latest reports from Gaza are citing 370 civilians killed.\nLiberal Democrat councillors have received calls from Birmingham residents who are concerned both by this weekends attacks, and the warnings of reprisals in the region. People here are fearful, angry and upset as tensions increase in the Middle East.\nCllr Ayoub Khan reflected thoughtfully; conscious that focusing solely on the attacks as isolated incidents does not reflect the wider, decades old dispute between Israel and Palestine that has made heartbreak, separation and bloodshed a way of life. “We condemn all forms of violence and no loss of innocent life is acceptable. If we are to bring an end to this decades old conflict, there needs to be a fair deal for the Palestinian people.”\nCouncillor Izzy Knowles commented “The videos & news from Israel are horrific.

I grieve for all the victims and families who are going through unimaginable suffering.\nI totally condemn the actions of Hamas, there can never ever be justification for the terrorism, hostage taking and brutal murder of innocent lives that happened over the weekend of 7th and 8th October.\nBut neither can there be justification for reprisals that violate international law and punish and kill civilians. Time and time again events in our world have shown reacting with violence only results in more suffering and more violence.\nI believe, our politicians should be listening to our communities and pushing for:\nAn immediate ceasefire on both sides\nImmediate release of all hostages\nFlow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and safe routes out for those injured or sick\nDeployment of UN peacekeepers\nInvestigation and prosecution of terrorism and war crimes\nAn international collaboration to achieve a lasting two state solution where communities can live and prosper in peace and friendship.\nI am also very troubled to see so much polarisation and increase of hate across our own communities.

Regrettably, the layout has clearly evolved to prioritise the mass movement of motor vehicles above the needs of all other road users. Indeed, a junction like this would not look out of place on one of the city’s principal A-class thoroughfares.\nIdeally, given the significant amount of space available here, the Council would look to redesign the junction to meet current standards, using the Healthy Streets Approach. The main issue would be assembling the scale of funding needed. This could cost well in excess of £600,000, given similar recent schemes. Even a like-for-like replacement of the signals only could cost in excess of £300,000 – but would deliver no wider benefit other than to maintain the junction in its current operational state, so would not represent good value for money.\nSpeaking candidly, the Council’s current funding situation is not favourable. In this context and at this point in time, I regret that I cannot see how the Council could bring a scheme forward here in the foreseeable future – unless as part of a wider strategic initiative, such as a bus corridor improvement scheme, for example. This issue will be recorded, and if a potential funding opportunity arises which might be appropriate for this location, Officers will be in touch with you and Cllr Jenkins to discuss.\nI have now written back to both the council and Kier to ask if any of the recommendations of the report could be incorporated as part of the repair – however I am not hopeful.\nIt is helpful though that this site is on the radar and I will continue to look for opportunities to make it safer for all road users.",

  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_tag_russell-road/content_133.html": "Last week the council published their proposals for the West Moseley Traffic Reduction Scheme. I wrote about the details here\nI would like to try to explain the rationale for the proposal to put a modal filter on Moor Green Lane using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO).\nFirstly, I would like to reassure residents there are no plans to put a similar filter on Russell Road. That option was considered by officers, who were looking at possibly incorporating it into the Cannon Hill Park to Moseley cycle lane extension, but it was not taken forward to the design stage.\nThe proposal for a filter on Moor Green Lane has come about due to the many concerns raised from residents of Russell Road, Reddings Road and Moor Green Lane about the volume of traffic, speeding and dangerous driving in residential roads in West Moseley. Some residents have been campaigning for action for many years.\nQueensbridge Secondary School and Moor Green Primary School report excessive volumes of traffic, inconsiderate parking and speeding. Many parents say they feel their children are unsafe travelling to school by bicycle or foot, and they have no option but to ferry them by car. There are also two special needs schools in the area, Uffculme and Fox Hollies.\nA traffic calming scheme proposed in 2022 for Russell Road was shelved in 2024 due to the excessive cost – approx. £620,000 pounds and rising. Costs of installing infrastructure have increased astronomically since Brexit and the Pandemic.\nIt was also felt that the scheme would not reduce the volume of traffic, which is a priority of the council as part of the Birmingham Transport Plan.\nOne modal filter in one location is much cheaper to install than a traffic calming scheme over a wider area. A modal filter in Moor Green Lane will likely cost less than a 10th of the previously proposed measures for Russell Road.\nAs much as everyone wants speed cameras, they are unlikely to be considered a priority for 20mph roads until there is a change of law. Speeding fine revenue goes straight to the government treasury and is used for general government expenditure. This means the cost of installation and maintenance of any speed cameras has to be met by the council and costs of administration of the offences are met by the police, with no revenue coming back other than for speed awareness courses, which does not cover the costs. There are currently only six speeding camera sites in Birmingham. Although work is on going to add more, they will inevitably be placed on arterial A routes within the city.\nNeither calming nor cameras will reduce traffic volume, which has got steadily worse in residential streets, mainly due to the use of satellite navigation systems.\nFaced with these barriers to addressing the many complaints and campaigns the council officers looked at a wider area than Russell Road. They discovered most of the traffic travelling through the West Moseley area comes via Moor Green Lane. They estimated if they stop the through traffic using this route it will reduce the amount of traffic using all the residential streets as a cut through by up to half and most of what will subsequently come into the area will be local.\nIt is anecdotally argued that local people are less likely to speed or drive dangerously in their own neighbourhoods. Indeed, if you look at roads where through traffic is restricted there is evidence of a much lower rate of collisions.\nLess traffic, fewer collisions and reduced amount of speeding will make the area much safer, especially outside the schools.\nThere is of course a potential for the traffic to be displaced to other roads. This is why the proposal would be undertaken with an experimental /trial order rather than an immediate permanent one. There would be monitoring of traffic volume and flows across the area before and after the filter is installed. If it doesn’t work or it causes undue problems to other roads it can be removed. The ETRO involves consultation prior to implementation and during the first six months of it being installed.\nThe advantage to installing a filter is safer, more pleasant streets, which for people who are able to cycle or walk or use a mobility scooter, will encourage and empower them to use their car less often.\nThe disadvantage is that if you do need to drive somewhere it may be slightly longer. But, overall the number of short journeys made by people will be reduced, as people use their cars less. That is not a bad thing, the major threat to air pollution is caused by traffic emissions.\nI understand why people are concerned about the use of an ETRO. An implementation will happen much quicker than if a permanent scheme were being proposed and there is a belief the council may make it permanent at the end of the experimental period, despite majority opposition.\nI have taken a lot of interest in the Kings Heath and South Moseley scheme since the first phase was implemented in 2020. It was not initially done very well and quite a number of changes have had to be made. It involved a much bigger series of measures, over many more streets than the West Moseley scheme is proposing. As a result opinion became very divided with as many residents wanting to keep and expand the scheme as those opposing. It is also still not fully complete with changes to the West side of the High Street planned, to replace modal filters with diagonal filters, creating more one way streets and the East side of the High Street and Moseley measures yet to be installed. The right turn from Vicarage Road to Alcester Road South is to be re-instated, which will ease the traffic build up at that junction. The biggest cause of traffic build up in Vicarage Road has long been from Camp Hill Schools and that has not been reduced, although the Pineapple Station opening should have a positive impact.\nIt is clear, however that lessons have been learned and a huge amount of consultation has gone into the second phase.\nIn contrast with that scheme the impact of one filter in Moor Green Lane will be much easier to measure, as will the level of local support.\nI do urge everyone to go to one of the drop in events and talk to the officers and make them aware of how you feel both about the use of an ETRO and how you feel the scheme will affect you, whether it is positive or negative. I will be at both events as I do want to hear the feedback from residents.\nAlthough I have outlined why the scheme is being proposed, that does not mean I won’t take into consideration all the reasons people give for why they oppose or support it. I understand there is no proposal that will satisfy the needs of everyone.\nI hope this post helps at least explain why the proposal has come about and what it is trying to achieve.",

West Midlands Police, and organisations like the CST and Tell Mama have reported a rise in both anti Semitic and Islamophobic hate incidents.\nYou can see Izzy’s speech to council here\nThe motion had two amendments from the Labour group which we accepted. The amended motion was overwhelmingly voted in favour. It reads:\nThis council recognises that the horrors and repercussions of the conflict in Palestine and Israel have had a profound affect across all communities, but notably the Muslim and Jewish communities here in Birmingham.\nWest Midlands Police, and organisations like the CST and Tell Mama have reported a rise in both Islamophobic and antisemitic hate incidents.\nIn Birmingham, we have seen incidences of antisemitic and Islamophobic graffiti, with more than two hundred tags of a racist, offensive, antisemitic or Islamophobic nature reported and removed since October 7th. We must not allow the tragic events in the Middle East to divide our communities in the city, and we understand and feel the pain of all people in the city, especially the Muslim and Jewish communities.\nThis Council condemns those who have used this crisis to whip up hatred, sow division, and spread misinformation in our city.\nThis council acknowledges that it has a duty of care to the people of Birmingham, and must lead the way in promoting peace, tolerance and respect.\nThis Council notes:\n- There is a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. It is likely that this will impact Gazans throughout 2023 and beyond.\n- An immediate and sustainable ceasefire is needed, so that aid can get into Gaza, the hostages can be freed, and work can take place to deescalate this horrific conflict. Save the Children have highlighted that more children have been reported killed in this conflict than the annual number of children killed across the world’s conflicts zones since 2019. The international community has a responsibility to work towards a peace process and a two-state solution.\n- It is unlikely that many Palestinians will be able to return home for a substantial time.\n- With Birmingham having a proud status as a City of Sanctuary for people fleeing war torn countries and persecution. It is important that we in Birmingham, together with other communities in the UK, prepare to accommodate any refugees from this conflict that seek re-location.\n- Building on the success of the Homes for the Ukraine Scheme, a similar package must be offered to refugees choosing to flee the conflict.\nThis Council therefore:\n- Will write to the Government seeking the provision of a support package for refugees fleeing the conflict and provide further aid to assist the UN Agencies in their humanitarian work so that British citizens can get home safely, and Palestinian people are able to stay in their homeland.”.\n- Will support the active engagement of the voluntary sector in delivering aid and support to refugees from the conflict.\n- Will proactively engage with any Government schemes to house refugees from the conflict to ensure that all refugees are given a warm welcome in Birmingham.\n- Calls on everyone in Birmingham to show tolerance and respect at this time of significant stress to many communities; especially those of the Muslim and Jewish faiths.\n- Will work with faith communities to explore setting up more third-party hate crime reporting mechanisms and write to the Home Secretary to urge Government to reverse its decision to downgrade the monitoring of non-crime hate incidents specifically related to antisemitism and Islamophobia so they can be logged by the police.”\nLiberal Democrats nationally have also called for an immediate bilateral ceasefire to get aid in, get the hostages out, and provide space to realise a political solution, ultimately with two states and a lasting peace.",

In the meantime GP Surgeries are struggling to meet demand and suspending all other appointments. |\n| Fewer than one third of the 4,733 pharmacies that applied to take part in the booster vaccination programme have been accepted, figures uncovered by the Liberal Democrats have revealed. Some pharmacies are waiting up to eleven weeks to be approved to give out Covid vaccines and booster jabs. If that wait was repeated from today, a pharmacy would not be able to provide vaccinations until March next year. By the end of September 2021, fewer than one third of the 4,733 pharmacies that applied to take part in the booster vaccination programme had been accepted. Of these, just 1,336 community pharmacy vaccination sites were actively providing the service as of 3 December.The figures were provided in response to a parliamentary question tabled by Liberal Democrat Health Spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP. They show that on average pharmacies are having to wait more than 6 weeks for applications to be approved by NHS England, with at least one waiting as long as 78 days.One pharmacy in Daisy Cooper’s constituency of St Albans, which has one of the worst Covid rates in the country, says they applied twice to become a vaccination centre only to be rejected. The first time they were not given a reason and the second time they were told that the government had “enough capacity”.The Liberal Democrats are calling on the government to get a grip of the crisis and ensure applications submitted by pharmacies that were rejected are urgently reviewed, to help meet the target of boosting up to one million people a day. Liberal Democrat Health and Social Care Spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: “Community pharmacies can play a critical role in getting boosters into arms in the coming weeks, while taking pressure off our GPs and NHS staff. “So it is staggering that some pharmacies applied several times to help provide booster jabs only to be rejected, while others have waited a shocking 78 days to be approved. “Ministers completely took their eye off the ball on the booster programme which has left millions without vital protection. Sajid Javid must now get a grip of this crisis, ensure NHS England speeds up the application process and deals with these bureaucratic delays. “Every pharmacy that has applied in the past should be given an opportunity to take part in this critical national effort.” |",

Therefore mixed messages are being sent out here.I am still very concerned, as I have been since the beginning of this process, that there are many residents who live in roads that will be directly affected, but who are still unaware of the proposal because they don’t use email or social media. Your proposed letter notifying them of the implementation of the experimental scheme will be the first they will be informed of what is happening. I anticipate some will not be very happy at not having been formally consulted, and the scheme being experimental will not appease them.Therefore I would urge you to please re-consider and conduct a formal consultation scheme prior to the experimental scheme beginning.Secondly:Traffic Impact studies:The scheme is being implemented in order to stop dangerous driving in School Road between Prospect Road and Valentine Road. The main issue is when drivers meet each other head on, due to parked vehicles and the narrow road and vehicles are driven onto the pavement or road rage incidents occur. This is a real problem and I totally support the School Road Traffic Issues residents in their desire to make this road safer.The proposed scheme to close off part of School Road further down past Greenhill Road will undoubtedly reduce traffic on the entirety of School Road as it will no longer be used as a a convenient alternative route between Kings Heath and Moseley, especially at peak times. Traffic is more likely to be local residents moving in and out of the immediate area. However traffic is still going to be able to travel two ways along that section of School Road. Having stood and watched traffic this evening , even at a quiet time of a weekend the same problem of cars not being able to pass each other is still occurring. What guarantee do we have that there will still not be incidents where cars meet each other on that section of road?There is also the issue of where the displaced traffic will head at peak times, I would suggest the most likely routes will be Billesley Lane and Oxford Road. These roads are not so narrow as School Road, but have suffered from safety issues in the past, including a fatal accident in Billesley Lane ,before traffic calming measures were put in, so residents are understandably concerned at the impact of an increase of traffic.Although the proposed scheme of closing School Road will be experimental, the outcome will hopefully be that it does the job and becomes permanent. Otherwise a lot of time and money will have been wasted.Therefore I urge that an impact study be undertaken before the closure, to measure vehicles traveling along that section of road and to consider the displacement on both the nearest likely commuter roads (Billesley Lane and Oxford Road) and the adjoining residential through roads, (Ashfield, Greenhill, Blenheim, Prospect & Cambridge Roads) This would not only reassure residents but also provide a benchmark to measure against during the experiment.Other questions I have been asked:How will the road be closed? Will it be a physical barrier such as bollards or will it be traffic regulation signs? If the former will emergency vehicles have access and how?When is the experimental order likely to begin? Can we please have a proposed timeline.Thank you for your time and efforts with getting this right.Very best wishesIzzy\nIzzy Knowles\nMoseley Liberal Democrats\n2 Replies to “School Road Closure – latest”",

He replied that the system cannot be suspended due to the contract with Veolia and changing that would come at a high financial cost to the council.\nToday I have emailed him to ask if this could be discussed further with Veolia following the declaration of a major incident. They may be willing to allow temporary changes to the contract without a financial implication for the council.\nI also asked about the prioritising of missed collections and pointed out that whilst the agency crews cannot cover a whole round in the time given, they are not alternating their start location, so the same properties are missed week after week. He acknowledged this as an issue and said crews are now being instructed to ensure they alternate start locations.\nI have explored several potential sites to bring a Mobile Household Waste Collection to Moseley. As they are attracting upwards of a 1000 visitors during the industrial action this would need to be a large area, such as a car park where there is room for people to unload cars quickly and safely. So far, private sites have all said no due to health and safety concerns.\nI am also exploring the possibility of a supervised paper and cardboard collection at a set location in Moseley.\nI continue to send almost daily lists of missed collections in Moseley to the depot supervisor and they are prioritising them as and when they can get crews and wagons out. Different wagons are required for containers and wheelie bins, so if you see a crew they may not necessarily be able to empty your particular bin. If I have reported your property or road, please let me know when it is collected.\nThe council has updated their FAQ on the website since declaring a major incident, which includes a factsheet about the reasons for the industrial action and their attempts to resolve it",

It had been rumoured that Attock Cricket club were planning to take over the fields, to build a club house and extend their facilities with a new cricket pitch. Residents had already had to stop council workers from mowing some of the long grass at the side of the field, which is especially left untouched due to nesting birds and other wildlife. At the public meeting Councillor Lisa Trickett promised there would be no buildings or loss of use to dog walkers or families and a full public consultation would take place, as part of any bid to use the fields.\nOn 27th June, after a long period of silence and with no public consultation having taken place, I discovered that on 19th May Springfield Councillors had signed off a Local Innovation Fund bid (council funds) for £20,000 to assist Attock Cricket club to cut hedges, cut overgrown grass, trim trees, hedges & shrubs, scarify, roll, aerate, seed and fertilise the field. Further funding had been obtained / was being considered to lay one astro turf and two grass squares at the site and for a pavilion and changing rooms. There were many inaccuracies and mis- information in the bid including that the field is neglected and under used and that the club was working with Friends of Moseley bog, neither of these statements were true. The bid had also failed to take into account the ecological and architectural importance of the fields, the impact on wildlife or the huge impact on parking and noise nuisance to residents living in close proximity to the field. Finally there was no consideration of a covenant on the land, which is believed to have been bequeathed to the city for use for dog walking and recreation.\nI further discovered that the bid was due to go to cabinet the following day, on 28th June for full approval. This was brought to the attention of about 35 residents who came to a meeting that evening at the cricket club to discuss the bid. At that meeting Councillor Rehman declined the request to pull the bid from the next days cabinet meeting, despite the clear concerns and objections to the bid in its current form, by every resident there. Representations were then made at a Moseley Forum meeting the same evening which resulted in the bid being pulled the following day.\nYou might find it interesting to see the reason put forward for withdrawing the bid and the comments made in answer to a question by Councillor Jon Hunt (the Liberal Democrat leader) .

After further contact with the owner last month we are pleased to say the land has been cleared and the fence repaired which should prevent further dumping.\nMoseley Hive comes to town\nIzzy helped clean up the old Pizza Express in Moseley today. We are very excited to work with Moseley Community Development Trust to make good use of this empty retail space for the community over the next three months.\nIzzy & Radley lobby for more Moseley roads to be included on the councils resurfacing programme.\nThe Council has published its proposed list of roads and footways for resurfacing treatments in the 2021/22 Highway Maintenance Works Programme.\nThe list has a total of 183 carriageway and footway schemes across the City, but disappointingly Moseley only gets three of them. The roads to be done are School Road, Stoney Lane and Yew Tree Road. While we very much welcome the inclusion of these three roads, with around 150 roads in total in Moseley, having just three resurfaced and no footways done, is not good for our area. Last year only one road in the ward, Belle Walk was re-surfaced so at this rate it would take over 50 years to reach the whole ward without even thinking of footpath resurfacing.\nIzzy and Radley have submitted petitions signed by local residents to Kevin Hicks, the Assistant Director of Highways and Infrastructure at Birmingham City Council for both Chantry Road and Anderton Park Road to be added to this years list. Chantry Road is a cycle route and school street with a very poor and dangerous surface. Anderton Park Road is similarly also full of potholes, especially the section between Stoney Lane and Woodstock Road and is also a street used by school pupils. Pot holes and splits in the tarmac are not only dangerous for cyclists and motor cyclists they also cause damage to vehicles so increasing pollution in our atmosphere.\nYou can sign the petitions here:\nChantry Road Anderton Park Road\nThe Council are asking for feedback on the programme, so there is still a chance to change it – please let us know if there are other roads you would like us to lobby to be added to the programme and we will push hard for them to be done, if not this year then included in the next round of investment .\nThe Council anticipate that this years programme will commence towards the end of August 2021, but timing is still to be confirmed.\nAlcohol Restricted Zone no longer valid in Moseley\nLast week Izzy wrote to Sergeant Tom O’Keeffe asking for increased patrols in Moseley Village and for enforcement of the Alcohol Restricted Zone (ARZ) . This was following a number of reported incidents of damage to, and theft from businesses, rowdy and drunken behaviour on the village green and fighting, which she witnessed, in the churchyard. Businesses have reported that customers are put off from visiting them due to the anti social behaviour of a group, which includes some new faces. They are loud, intimidating and sometimes aggressive. They dominate the benches and the bus stop and are now regularly causing issues in the church yard. They are drinking alcohol in the street, steadily from morning until night time.\nSince Izzy’s email there have been more patrols by the PCSO’s and visits to the businesses mostly affected, which is welcome but is not addressing the real problem.\nWhat is concerning is Sgt O’Keeffe also confirmed that officers were not enforcing the ARZ as he has been advised by his licensing officer that it had been superseded by the Public Space Protection Order (PSPO) introduced in 2017 and is no longer valid .\nThe PSPO itself expired in October 2020 and was not renewed by Birmingham City Council, despite calls from the local Police and community groups such as Moseley Forum and Moseley Society. A scrutiny report issued in October 2020 explains the council wished to introduce a new process for implementing PSPO’s which would be introduced ‘in the coming year’.\nThe local police have this month submitted an evidenced report to Birmingham City Council for consideration of renewal of the Moseley & Kings Heath PSPO. A decision is not expected until at least the autumn.\nIzzy has written to the council licensing department to clarify the situation with regard to the Alcohol Restricted Zone, originally introduced in 2003, which is still listed on the council website and advertised with signage in the village and beyond.\nIn the meantime though that signage is not worth the metal it is written on. No one is taking any notice of it and the police are not enforcing it. That is not good news for the businesses or the residents of Moseley over this coming summer.\nTree Preservation Order for Church Road\nEarlier in June we wrote about a case where Izzy helped some tenants whose new landlord had turned their home into a building site. See the post here\nShortly after that post Izzy was alerted by nearby residents that a beautiful and established copper beech tree had been felled at the front of the same premises. Izzy went to speak to the contractors, but was unable to prevent it being removed. The road is not in a conservation area and the tree was not protected with a TPO.\nA year ago Izzy had written to the council tree officer asking for that particular tree to be preserved by a TPO , however sadly that hadn’t happened.\nThe recent decision to refuse the planning application for the building had even mentioned three trees at the property, including the lost copper beech, being of public amenity value. The lack of a specific arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan had contributed to the decision for refusal.\nAfter the tree was felled Izzy immediately contacted the tree officer again and arranged a site visit. As a result a TPO has now been authorised to protect the two remaining lime and copper beech trees.\nA star for Steve\nIzzy and Radley have been helping a local resident from Moseley, Jim the Hat and his friends, put together a petition to get a star on Broad St for Brummie rock legend Steve Gibbons. Jim is a big fan and has wanted to do this for a long time. We’ve talked to the Westside BID manager and we’ll make a case and Jim can present the petition, probably at the end of July.\nSteve was born in Harborne in 1941, and in July will celebrate his 80th birthday. He still lives in Birmingham and has devoted his many talents to the city, including years of fund raising for causes such as Birmingham Children’s Hospital.\nBroad Street is currently undergoing a transformation, with the addition of a tram service which will bring more people to enjoy this special part of our city. What better time could there be to celebrate the re-opening of the area with a new star recognising the life and works of an iconic local Brummie in his 80th year\nFive years on ….\nFive years on from that referendum and Vote Leave’s broken promises, it is the people who didn’t have a vote who are the most affected. We have upped our campaign to find EU nationals who have not yet applied or are having difficulty with Settled Status. In the past eighteen months Izzy & Radley have written letters to EU/EEA/Swiss national’s across Hall Green constituency informing them of the deadline to apply on 30th June, asking them to spread the word and offering assistance with applications.\nRecently they contacted the Business Improvement Districts across Birmingham asking them to advertise the scheme, especially to the hospitality industry. Mike Olley of Westside BID responded by offering to contact every EU national employed in his BID area. His efforts and blog post were reported by Birmingham Live here\nSeveral people have replied to the letters, one of whom was Gabriella Muller of Kings Heath. She agreed to be interviewed by Birmingham Live to help appeal to other EU nationals across Birmingham.\nGabriella said in her interview: “Izzy had sent me a letter six month ago and I thought I would keep it.”But even then I still didn’t fully appreciate what I had to do and it was only when my friend went to the embassy that I realised I really did have to apply – and before June 30.”I thought ‘That can’t be right. I live here. I’ve got my house here. My kids are here. My grandchildren are here!’\nYou can read the full interview here\nWe believe it suits the Conservative government to disenfranchise sections of the population and the local Labour administration talk but don’t act. Liberal Democrats consistently stand up for EU citizens rights and will continue to do so as long as it takes. We support the campaigns of The Three Million for a physical proof of status, and for unilateral rights to vote and the campaign of the European Movement on citizens rights\nJust one person falling victim to a future Windrush type scandal is a failure of the whole scheme and betrayal of the millions of people who have made their home here and to whom the Leave campaign promised would retain ‘the exact same benefits’.\nTackling rogue landlords\nIzzy has written to Birmingham City Council calling for notice to be served on the owners of 65, Church Road, Moseley for building work to be immediately halted due to safety concerns.\nThe new owners purchased the property earlier this year with six sitting tenants. Three of them are still living in the property and have a legal right to stay until at least 13th August . Despite that the new owners have sent the builders in and completely gutted the vacated parts of the property and the communal areas.\nJournalists from Birmingham Live reported the appalling conditions the tenants have been left in and approached the owners NSH Properties for comment. You can read their report here together with interviews with Izzy and the tenants.\nIzzy is supporting the tenants who have been incredibly brave in speaking out. The landlords are clearly only concerned in furthering their business interests, and have demonstrated a total disregard for the responsibilities taken on as a purchaser of a property with sitting tenants. Their uncaring attitude makes them unfit to be landlords, in our view.\nThe statement made to the reporter that the property is to be converted back to a family home has no credibility when you consider recent planning applications to extend upwards and outwards and add more flats have been refused by Birmingham City Council.\nEU Settlement Scheme Deadline is 30th June – Can you EUaskFive today?\nLast month on 9th May we celebrated Europe Day, you may have seen the banner and bunting on Moseley Village Green. Moseley is the home of hundreds of EU/EEA & Swiss citizens, who enrich our community, and help make Birmingham the diverse and vibrant place we know and love.\nBut there is a deadline looming, which we all need to know about.\n30th June 2021 is the cut off period for applying to the EU settlement scheme. Many thousands of EU citizens across Birmingham have successfully obtained Settled Status, but there are still people out there who are yet to apply. They could be elderly and lived here for many years, married to a UK citizen and not aware the scheme applies to them, students who arrived before the end of the transition period or children who even though born here are not automatically eligible for UK citizenship.\nIt is imperative that EU citizens and non EU/UK family members who came to live in the UK before 1st January 2021 apply to the Settlement Scheme to secure the right to remain here after 1st July. Failure to do so will leave people as undocumented migrants and could lead to loss of rights to work, study, rent or buy property and access free healthcare.\nIzzy volunteers with the independent charity ‘Settled’ https://settled.org.uk/en/ to help EU/EEA & Swiss citizens and their families obtain settled status.\nWe are asking everyone to promote EUask5.\nAsk 5 EU/EEA or Swiss citizens if they have applied to the settlement scheme. Then ask them and all your friends and neighbours to do the same.\nIf you need help to apply or more information on Settled Status or EU citizens rights post Brexit you can contact me through this website, email izzy@moseleylibdems.com or call 07784 155208.\nPeople with dual UK/other citizenship, Irish citizens and people with documented Indefinite Leave to Remain (eg a stamp or sticker in their passport ,letter from the Home Office, biometric residence permit), do not need to apply. However Irish citizens and those with Indefinite Leave to Remain can apply if they wish , and it is worth checking the Government website for why they might want to.\nYou can apply on line for Settled Status via the Government website\nBirmingham City Council has published a list of local organisations that offer advice or help with applying.\nEUask5 today\nArt not tags\nIzzy recently sent a dossier of photo evidence to Birmingham Police following the identification of a person graffiti tagging in the city centre. The evidence showed the tag ‘ORB’ was prolific across Moseley and Kings Heath. The person has today admitted the tagging and as part of a community resolution has agreed to be party to a Community Protection Warning (CPW), which gives him strict conditions not to carry any item which may cause any sort of graffiti damage, across the whole of Birmingham. He will be writing a letter of apology to businesses whose premises were tagged and taking part in a local graffiti clean up. He states that he will not be tagging across Bham again. These are a few of the tags, many have since been removed by businesses, the council or the community group Moseley Litterbusters. Carefully designed street art in appropriate places is a wonderful way to enhance public areas, but indiscriminate prolific thoughtless ‘tagging’ costs businesses and the public purse tens of thousands of pounds a year to remove, it impacts on the local economy and environment and increases the fear of crime and social isolation.\nStatement from Bham City Council regarding Low Traffic Neighbourhoods- not before time!\nBirmingham City Council have issued a statement saying they are ‘committed to work with residents and businesses to adapt and improve Low Traffic Neighbourhood (LTN) schemes in Moseley and Kings Heath and use local feedback to shape changes’.\nThey have promised a ‘series of ‘quick fix’ measures to improve traffic flow in congested locations including better signage and changes to traffic signal timings’\nA dedicated project board will be created to oversee any future phases, including the continued development of travel plans to encourage walking and cycling to school and full public consultation on new designs.\nThe council goes on to say: ‘ But we must work with communities to get this right. We now have an action plan to build on the successful aspects of the schemes and improve on what is already in place’\nYou can see the full statement issued here:\nWe welcome the statement but feel it is very late in the day to commit with working with residents and businesses when this should have been right at the heart of the project at its launch 12 months ago. From even before the scheme was first announced Izzy has been calling for a holistic, community led traffic management plan across Moseley to address the many different issues we experience including speeding and anti social driving, congested and polluted roads, reducing through traffic, enabling walking and cycling and dealing with collision hot spots.\nSince the Tranche1 measures of the People for Places scheme were announced back in July 2020 Izzy has worked hard to ensure all voices have been heard in this programme, including engaging with residents through the Better Streets for Moseley group and Moseley Forum, helping with traffic counts, securing funding for hand held speed monitors for use by residents groups, making representations to councillors and officers on behalf of local businesses and residents. Izzy recently wrote on behalf of businesses in York Road who feel disenfranchised about the measures put in place and concern about lack of access for deliveries, to point out the councils own technical review into the scheme recommends some type of one way system and how this could be a compromise that would allow restricted vehicular access whilst still enabling hospitality businesses to benefit from a pedestrianised scheme which would also provide a welcome safe family area off the High Street. The review and technical review of the scheme are below\nIn March this year it was agreed that the design consultants, Jacobs would take part in a walking tour of the revised area for the proposed LTN to engage with residents and stakeholders. Disappointingly this still hasn’t happened. We are hoping with the release of this statement and appointment of a dedicated project board (although details of the make up or remit of this are not yet known) to see a huge improvement in the level of meaningful engagement and full consultation before further measures are implemented.\nIzzy and Radley will continue to scrutinise the scheme, including the proposed action plan, to obtain feedback from residents and try to ensure all voices are heard.\nSt Agnes Conservation Area to expand\nConsultation on boundary changes to the St Agnes Conservation Area Appraisal and Management Plan (CAAMP) is underway. Survey and photographic work has been carried out by St Agnes Residents’ Association. Even if you do not live in the St Agnes area, the photographs are worth looking at.\nThe consultation ends on Friday 4th June\nDetails of how to respond to the consultation can be found here: https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/…/birminghams…/3\nThe draft document can be downloaded here: https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/…/st_agnes_moseley…\nLadypool Road Cycle Lane to become segregated\nConsultation has opened to create a permanent segregated cycle path on Ladypool Road between Church Road and Brighton / Taunton Road. The pedestrian crossing at Alder Lane will also be upgraded.\nWe welcome the move to segregate the cycle lane, which is currently not fit for purpose, as it is constantly blocked by parked cars. We hope to see it extended in future as a route in and out of the city centre through this popular and vibrant shopping area, which is in itself a destination worth a visit.\nThe cycle lane is proposed to be implemented in Summer 2021\nThe consultation closes on 11th June 2021. You can comment here https://www.birminghambeheard.org.uk/economy/ladypoolrd2/\nCitizens Rights affect us all.\nOn Sunday we celebrated Europe Day.\nThis week the Guardian and Italian newspaper La Republica have reported about the treatment some Europeans have received after travelling to the UK: having their possessions taken off them, imprisoned, forbidden from making calls. It genuinely makes us feel angry and ashamed of what our government is allowing, what our government is doing, what our government is showing not just to Europe but the rest of the world. The government’s behaviour in this regard could have baleful consequences for UK citizens travelling to the EU in future and could further sour our already damaged relationships with EU member states. The outcry, and the amazing scenes in Glasgow, where an attempted deportation on the day of Eid al-Fitr was stopped by a passionate, welcoming crowd, illustrates that, more than ever, citizens’ rights need to be defended for everyone. As part of the Stories of Brexit campaign led by the European Movement, EU in Brum is proud to host its first ever webinar on Citizens’ Rights in the UK and the EU.\nThey have four great speakers:\nLuke Piper, Head of Policy for the 3million\nFiona Godfrey, co-chair of British in Europe\nPawel Koloziej, Midlands area Service Coordinator for the charity Settled\nLord Andrew Adonis, Chair of the European Movement.\nThe webinar will begin at 7 pm on Friday 21st May.\nYou can register to join the evening here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.co.uk/…/citizens-rights-after…\nTories to cut £3,786,250 from Pupil Premium in Birmingham\nTories to cut £3,786,250 from Pupil Premium in Birmingham\nSchools in Birmingham are set to lose £3,786,250 in funding for the most disadvantaged pupils in the country following the government’s decision to alter the method of calculating Pupil Premium funding.\nThe pupil premium, which aims to close the attainment gap by providing extra money to pupils eligible for free school meals, was a flagship reform introduced by the Liberal Democrats in government in 2011.\nFreedom of information requests by Schools Week suggest that schools in Birmingham are set to lose £3,786,250 following the decision to base the funding on a school’s pupil numbers in October rather than January as previously calculated.\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson Izzy Knowles for Birmingham Hall Green constituency said:\n“This cut shows the Conservatives are more focussed on penny-pinching than on giving children the best possible education. When the attainment gap is widening and children from disadvantaged backgrounds have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, it is shameful that the Tories would seek to cut pupil premium money.\n“Liberal Democrats introduced the pupil premium and have had to fight the Tories to keep it properly funded. Given the financial pressure that families are under, this change has real potential to cause harm and will have a direct impact on the quality of education schools can provide for those who are in desperate need of more, not less, support.\n“This is a bad move at the worst possible time. The Government must listen to teachers about the reality on the ground, not pull support when it is most needed.”\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for Education and Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said:\n“Once again, disadvantaged school pupils are set to lose out as the Tories prioritise penny pinching over proper support. By moving the goalposts on the entitlement criteria for the “Pupil Premium”, thousands of children whose parents have become unemployed in the last three months will not get the crucial support they need.\n“Liberal Democrats introduced the Pupil Premium because we know how vital it is to target support to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils and close the gap between them and their peers.\n“The Conservative Government must urgently rethink this decision or they run the risk of more disadvantaged children falling behind.”\n320,000 EU citizens waiting for Settled Status ahead of cliff-edge- does our current Mayor care? It seems not.\nAt the Moseley Forum hustings for the Mayoral election all the candidates were asked to support the campaign by The 3 million to promote the EU settlement scheme, support EU /EEA/Swiss citizens up to and beyond the deadline of 30th June and to advocate for continued local voting rights.\nIt was hugely disappointing to hear Andy Street state that voting rights had to be a reciprocal arrangement with each separate EU country. By not lobbying his own party for unilateral voting rights to be given to every EU/EEA/Swiss citizen with settled status he is effectively condoning the removal of the only chance millions of people have of a democratic say in the governance of the city, town or region some will have called their homes for decades. It is a terrible thing to do to thousands of people who have already been disenfranchised by the EU referendum, another vote they were unable to take part in.\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for all EU citizens in the UK to be given the automatic right to stay, as new figures reveal that 323,800 are still waiting for the Home Office to process their applications. The party is warning that those who aren’t given ‘Settled Status’ by the 30th June deadline could “become the victims of another Windrush-style scandal”.\nResponding to the figures, Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: “The Conservatives must guarantee the rights of EU citizens who’ve made their lives here, and contribute enormously to our economy, our public services and our society. They must not become the victims of a new Windrush-style scandal. “Over 320,000 of our friends and neighbours are facing the cruel anxiety of hoping the Home Office will grant their applications before the cliff-edge at the end of June.“There is a serious risk that hundreds of thousands of people will be left effectively undocumented and exposed to the Conservatives’ Hostile Environment. We can’t afford the Government to ignore these warnings any longer.“EU citizens in the UK have been living under a cloud of uncertainty for far too long and the buck stops with Boris Johnson who promised them the automatic right to stay. He must deliver on his promise.”\nLadypool Road. How not to consult\nVehicle Activated Signs for Billesley Lane\nSpeed monitors have been installed today on Billesley Lane. They are currently set to factory settings of 30mph but will be recalibrated in the next 24 hrs to 20mph. They won’t visually display speeds above 45mph to deter boy racers wanting to set them off, but top speeds will be recorded and data will be available for analysis.They are re-deployable so can be moved around the ward to help address issues in different roads. This is a welcome move towards what we hope will be a range of new road safety measures introduced across Moseley ward and will help to address the concerns many residents have been raising, in some cases for many years.Last night, at an online Better Streets 4 Moseley meeting, we also heard from the design company that has been awarded the council contract for the proposed Low Traffic Neighbourhood Tranche 2 measures across Kings Heath and the ‘Moseley Triangle’ area. We will continue to stress the need for a holistic community led design rather than a ‘one size fits all’ approach and for as much consultation and engagement as possible.Tranche 2 is an opportunity to address the road safety and speed issues experienced by so many people across the designated area but it must take into account that all roads are residential and it is not acceptable to expect residents of one road to take the burden of redirected traffic from another road.\nMostly Jazz move to Highbury?\nMoseley Folk Festival has applied for a licence to hold festivals in Highbury Park. This is a contingency plan in case social distancing is still needed in July and would be an alternative venue for their Mostly Jazz Funk & Soul Festival, normally held at Moseley Park and Pool\nThey have been in discussion with the Chamberlain Highbury Trust, other stakeholders of the park and the local authorities for some time and have produced this information sheet for residents:\nAt a recent Moseley Forum meeting the organiser Gerv Havill stressed any such move would be temporary . He said: ‘We have considered both Cannon Hill and Kings Heath but they’re either unavailable or unsuitable. It’s unclear what restrictions this summer or next will bring so this is very much a contingency plan. We hope that by July restrictions will be relaxed and we can remain in Moseley’. Gerv also confirmed he is in contact with local Moseley businesses and will keep them updated.\nIf you have any concerns or questions or would like further information you can contact Gerv by emailing info@mostlyjazz.co.uk with Highbury as the subject.\nRepresentations or comments can be made to Birmingham City Council by emailing licensing@birmingham.gov.uk\nor writing to:\nGeneral Licensing, Regulation and Enforcement, PO Box 17831 Birmingham B2 2HJ\nTopsy Turvey decision on CAZ funding priorities is a further blow to the Moseley / Kings Heath rail line being opened any time soon.\nThe Birmingham Liberal Democrat group have requested the council’s allocation of funding from the Clean Air Zone, (CAZ) be called in for scrutiny by the Transport Committee after it was revealed that city centre pedestrian schemes costing £15,478 million would be prioritised over the allocation of funding for the Camp Hill Line and other transport projects, as well as the creation of a city wide Clean Air City Fund.\nA statement from Liberal Democrat Group leader Cllr Jon Hunt and deputy leader Cllr Roger Harmer states: “This week’s decisions show that the Labour council has topsy turvy priorities. While car drivers are being kept away from the city centre, the measures that would enable drivers to switch to public transport are no longer a priority”.\nYou can read more in this report by Birmingham Live\n£5.2million was due to be allocated to the Camp Hill Line, £3.4 million for the University Station and £4.2 million for the Cross City Bus Scheme, however these funds are now relegated to only happen if the CAZ makes sufficient revenue.\nYou can see the full report here:\nThe proposed Clean Air City Fund would see an annual allocation of £20,000 to each ward (£40,000 for two member wards) for use against a defined catalogue of measures to aid sustainable transport and improve air quality\nThe projected net revenue from the CAZ for 2020 to 2030 has been lowered from £85.7 million to £44.6 million so it is even more imperative that revenue is prioritised on improving public transport links to actually help people reduce their dependency on cars.\nMusicians left high and dry by Brexit deal\n| Liam Gallagher, Sir Elton John and Bob Geldof have called on the Government to make it easier for musicians to tour around Europe. In an exclusive to The Times more than 170 musicians have urged Ministers to organise paperwork-free travel in Europe for artists on tour. The Brexit deal makes it extremely difficult for touring artists because they now need a costly work permit and face a mountain of paperwork for their equipment. The extra costs will make many tours unviable, especially for young emerging musicians.Liberal Democrat Peer Lord Peter Strasburger, said: “Predictably the government is trying to blame the EU, but the fact remains that when the going got tough during the talks on the trade deal, Tory ministers just ducked for cover and hoped the problem would go “As a result, our creative artists have been left high and dry, including musicians, dancers, actors and their many support staff who together with the rest of the creative industries generate over £100 billion a year to our economy. They were sacrificed in a botched negotiation, just like our fishermen, our farmers, and our crucial service industries. “The artists who signed this letter are either furious or fearful for the future of their business, or both. If the Conservative Government cares about these industries and the economy, they must get back around the negotiating table and get this sorted pronto.” Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Culture, Media and Sport in the Lords, Baroness Jane Bonham-Carter added: “The creative arts sector is a massive success story for the UK economy. It’s already in dire trouble because of Covid and this ‘friendly fire’ assault on its viability from our own government could be the last straw for many of our talented performers and backup staff. “Artists and crews will need to apply for work permits and other detailed paperwork for many of the countries they visit. This could make many tours unviable, particularly for younger, upcoming artists who don’t have big teams and big money behind them. “The same applies to EU-based artists wishing to perform in the UK. That means disruption not only to seeing our favourite foreign bands and orchestras but income to festivals and all the benefits of creative co-operation too. Reciprocity is good for Britain and should not be holding back a deal for artists.” The signatories in full: Roger Waters; Sir Simon Rattle; Dame Sarah Connolly; Sir George Benjamin; Sir Harrison Birtwistle; Nicola Benedetti; Steven Isserlis; Stephen Hough; Sir András Schiff; Judith Weir; Roderick Williams; Amanda Roocroft; Amelia Freedman; Nash Ensemble; Anna Meredith; Anna Patalong; Benjamin Baker; Bond Quartet; Brindley Sherratt; Professor Catherine Martin; Catherine Wyn-Rogers, Catriona Price; Chi-chi Nwanoku; Chris Stark, Christian Curnyn; Claudia Huckle; Dr Mark Taylor; Elizabeth Wallfisch; Gabriella Swallow; Gina McCormack; Gregory Walmsley; Harry Bicket; Hilary Summers; Jeremy Huw Williams; Jess Gillam; Joseph Middleton; Kate Royal; Lauma Skride; Levon Chilingirian; Mahaliah Edwards; Martyn Brabbins; Michael Chance; Miloš Karadaglić; Nicholas Collon; Nicky Spence; Paul Cassidy; Peter Robinson; Prof Nicholas Daniel; Professor Julian Anderson; Professor Julian Lloyd Webber; Professor Peter Fribbins; Rakhvinder Singh; Raphael Wallfisch; Rosa Mannion; Ruth Rogers; Sean Shibe; Sheku Kanneh-Mason; Tasmin Little; the Kanneh-Mason family; Sir Elton John; Ed Sheeran; Roger Daltrey; Bob Geldof; Midge Ure; Sting; Robert Plant; Peter Gabriel; Rag’n’Bone Man; Nick Mason; Aitch; Alex Kapranos; Beabadoobee; Bicep; Brett Anderson; Brian Eno; Brian May; Bryan Adams; Captain Sensible; Charlie Burchill; Chris Difford; Danny McNamara; Dave Stewart; Fryars; Gary Kemp; Gary Numan; Glass Animals; Grace Carter; Hayden Thorpe; Hot Chip; Hugh Cornwell; Iron Maiden; Jayda G; Jim Kerr; Joss Stone; Jungle; Kasai; Kero Kero Bonito; Kim Wilde; King Krule; LA Priest; Liam Gallagher; Mark King; Mick Hucknell; Nik Kershaw; Priya Ragu & Japhna Gold; Radiohead; Rick Wakeman; Roger Taylor; Ross From Friends; Rusty Egan Visage; Sex Pistols; SG Lewis; Simian Mobile Disco; SK Shlomo; Steve Norman; Superorganism; Terry Britten; The 1975; The Darkness; Will Young; Dame Evelyn Glennie; Julia Haferkorn; David Francis; Karine Polwart; Peewee Ellis; John J.

(I have edited to remove some personal details):\nFrom: Izzy Knowles <>Subject: Moseley LTN and Billesley LaneDate: 30 November 2020 at 22:02:30 GMTTo: Councillor Martin Straker Welds <>, Councillor Kerry Jenkins <>Cc: Tom O’Keeffe <t.okeeffe@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk>, Neil Kirkpatrick <n.kirkpatrick@west-midlands.pnn.police.uk>\nDear Martin & Kerry, Tom and Neil\nI have not long come inside from the scene of yet another crashed car on the corner of Greenhill Road and Billesley Lane at approx 18.30hrs this evening. From talking to neighbours it would appear two cars were racing each other down the hill from the direction of Kings Heath. The driver of the red Skoda in the photo has lost control on hitting the bend as he approached Greenhill Road junction, shot across the mouth of the junction, hit a bag of builders sand that was on the verge and spun into the tree, damaging the wall.The three occupants then left the scene in the second car which pulled up along side. Whilst I was talking to one of the neighbours three males turned up and started to remove items from the car, including the keys which had been left in the ignition. They all left again when I called the police. However over an hour later the police had still not arrived. The reason I’m writing is that this is the third similar collision on Billesley Lane in less than six months where vehicles have left the road at speed and crashed into houses or garden walls. As you know my neighbours and I have been recording traffic flow and volume at various junctions for the last few months, both before and after the modal filters were recently put in place in School Road and Cambridge Road . Our findings show a significant increase of traffic using both Greenhill Road and Oxford Road to travel between Kings Heath/Moseley and so adding to the pressure of traffic on Billesley Lane especially at these two junctions. Billesley Lane is not a major road. It has a high volume of cyclists and pedestrian traffic as well as vehicles. It is crossed by many pupils walking to and from local primary and secondary schools. St Agnes Church Hall on the corner of Dyott Road is in normal non lockdown times used by mother and toddler groups, pre school, cubs and brownies and various after school clubs with both children and adults frequently crossing the road at this junction. The One Stop shop is a very busy local shop used by many families who walk or cycle.Moseley Tennis Club is used by families and children, again many walk or cycle to classes or events.Two of these recent crashes have happened in the early evening when pedestrian traffic is normally heavier. Speeding and racing has long been an issue on roads like Billesley Lane. However this year it has become much more prevalent. Collisions like this one, although not resulting in injury are incredibly upsetting and frightening to residents and to passers by. However, possibly because there was no injury, they are not being taken seriously by the police.Residents who have lived on or near this road have felt ignored for a long time. They are now concerned they will be left to bear the burden of the redirected traffic from other roads within the LTN and incidents like this will increase.We have a real opportunity to address this now. I am urging you to ensure that Billesley Lane is considered for some serious traffic calming measures which could even involve re modelling the junctions.I’m also asking that the police please take much more interest including robust investigation of reports of no insurance, dangerous driving and fail to stop as well as increased speed checks during the evenings and partnership working to obtain more equipment and traffic calming measures in known collision hot spots. I look forward to hearing from you\nBest wishes\nIzzy\nTime to Give Carers the Voice they Deserve\nThe Liberal Democrats are asking people across our community who care for relatives to get in touch and share their story – to mark national Carers Rights Day.\nLiberal Democrat party leader Ed Davey has said he wants the party wants to be a “strong voice” for the millions across the country – including the 11964 people in Birmingham Hall Green Constituency who care for those who need it.\nEd himself knows the burden put on carers for family members – having been a carer for his mum when growing up and now caring for his disabled son.\nCarers can get in touch and share their experiences at www.libdems.org.uk/carerssurvey\nIzzy Knowles said:\n“Millions of people across the country act as unpaid carers for loved ones. This year has highlighted more than ever the issues many of them face.”\n“If you are a carer – or someone who receives regular care support from a relative of a friend – we want to hear from you. Please get in touch with us and share your story.”\nLib Dems urge Chancellor to “level the playing field” for small shops over Christmas\nThe Liberal Democrats have today called on the Chancellor to “level the playing field” to help small high streets compete with internet giants in the run up to Christmas.\nThe Liberal Democrat fear local shops hit by decreased footfall during the coronavirus pandemic will continue to struggle and have therefore proposed a new scheme in a similar vein to how the Eat Out to Help Out scheme aided restaurants.\nTo encourage people to shop local from home to save the high street, the Party wants to see the Government cover the costs of postage and have appealed to all MP’s to back the campaign.\nThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has welcomed the idea to help firms survive. Mike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “This is the type of creative idea that would boost small businesses and balance out the playing field.”\nHall Green Liberal Democrat spokesperson Izzy Knowles said:\n“Small businesses in Hall Green constituency are worried about their ability to stay afloat over the coming months. For so many, Christmas is their most lucrative time of year but coronavirus restrictions have caused footfall to nosedive.\n“When people turn online to do their Christmas shopping, free postage offers from online shopping giants are incredibly tempting. That makes it even tougher for our local small businesses putting our high streets at further risk. Ministers must level the playing field.”\nLiberal Democrat Treasury Spokesperson Christine Jardine MP added:\n“In the Summer, the Chancellor launched a campaign to support the hospitality sector. We now need to see this Government go the extra mile to support small business in the festive period.\n“We want the Chancellor to pay the postage on online purchases from small local independent shops to make them a more viable option for people hunting for Christmas presents and encourage people to shop small from home.”\nMike Cherry, National Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said:\n“This is the type of creative idea that would boost small businesses and balance out the playing field.\n“We must do everything we can to help our small, independent stores.\n“This is going to be the most important festive season our economy has ever seen and could be make-or-break for some of our small businesses.\n“That’s why we must pull out all the stops to help them survive the end of 2020 and beyond.”\nThe text of the letter sent from Christine Jardine is as follows: “Dear Rishi, I would like to ask you to consider a support scheme for small businesses through the festive season which would help them in a similar way to the ‘eat out to help out’ campaign which the Government funded in the summer. Small businesses in England are missing out on business in precious lucrative months and in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland footfall is still significantly reduced even though a full lockdown hasn’t been imposed. I urge you to explore pathways to pay the postage on online purchases from small local independent shops to make them a more viable option for people hunting Christmas presents and encourage people to shop small from home. The free postage offers from online shopping giants and the ease of using Amazon Prime are incredibly tempting for those Christmas shopping online. Paying postage on each individual Christmas purchase is a burden that is likely to repel shoppers from picking small retailers. That makes it an even tougher climate for small business and shut shops.The prohibitive nature of these costs rings especially true for those in remote or rural communities for whom delivery charges are unjustly steep. I am urging to embrace this idea as a way to stimulate traffic to small business sites. Removing the delivery cost burden would encourage shoppers to select individual items from different small shops – rather than resorting to bulk buy from large suppliers. I look forward to your response. Yours sincerely, Christine Jardine”\nLords defeat Government on Immigration Bill\nThe Government has tonight been defeated on the Immigration Bill, including amendments from the Liberal Democrats to protect the British nationals living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. An amendment from Baroness Hamwee to preserve the right of UK nationals living in the EU to bring non-British family members with them if they return to the UK was passed this afternoon.\nAnother amendment passed tonight, tabled by Liberal Democrat peer Jonny Oates, to force the Government to provide EU citizens in the UK who are granted Settled or Pre-Settled Status with physical proof of their migration status – instead of the digital-only proof under the Government’s current system.\nIzzy wrote a letter in support of this amendment as part of the campaign. https://deniedmybackup.org.uk/\nShe wrote: ‘I have recently helped two gentleman in their 80’s to get settled status. One Swedish and one Italian. They have both lived in the UK since their 20’s, contributing to our economy and community for over 60 years. One worked as a nurse in the NHS and the other opened a string of restaurants throughout the Midlands. Both these gentleman were very confused and upset when they learned they would not be given physical proof of their settled status. The Italian gentleman does not use email and will be totally reliant on his son’s help if and when he is asked in future to prove his status in the UK. He is a proud man and does not want to have to bother his son.\nThey are both eligible to apply under the Windrush scheme – but it is more paperwork, involves sending their passport to the Home Office and is not something I am qualified to help them with. Even then a card will only be valid until 2024. Both have found obtaining settled status stressful already, they were in denial about it for some time. They have had difficulty understanding why they would need to apply to two schemes and so far have not taken the Windrush opportunity. People need to prove their immigration status throughout life – when seeking a new job opportunity, finding a place to live or getting treatment in hospital. Where British citizens use their passport as proof and non-EU citizens have a biometric residence card as backup, EU citizens can only prove their new immigration status through the Home Office website. If any one part of the digital checking process fails, people without a physical form of backup will be vulnerable. We should not have a two-tier system for proving the right to stay in the UK, with inferior access for EU citizens. A digital-only immigration status will create new barriers for EU citizens – especially the elderly and most vulnerable, who may not have the necessary digital skills and who need alternative ways of accessing services. This is not a fair way to treat our friends and neighbours. I worry about my two elderly gentlemen if they are asked to prove their status, especially if it were in a stressful situation such as needing urgent medical treatment.’\nThe bill will now go to the House of Commons.

In an exclusive to The Times more than 170 musicians have urged Ministers to organise paperwork-free travel in Europe for artists on tour. The Brexit deal makes it extremely difficult for touring artists because they now need a costly work permit and face a mountain of paperwork for their equipment. The extra costs will make many tours unviable, especially for young emerging musicians.Liberal Democrat Peer Lord Peter Strasburger, said: “Predictably the government is trying to blame the EU, but the fact remains that when the going got tough during the talks on the trade deal, Tory ministers just ducked for cover and hoped the problem would go “As a result, our creative artists have been left high and dry, including musicians, dancers, actors and their many support staff who together with the rest of the creative industries generate over £100 billion a year to our economy. They were sacrificed in a botched negotiation, just like our fishermen, our farmers, and our crucial service industries. “The artists who signed this letter are either furious or fearful for the future of their business, or both. If the Conservative Government cares about these industries and the economy, they must get back around the negotiating table and get this sorted pronto.” Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Culture, Media and Sport in the Lords, Baroness Jane Bonham-Carter added: “The creative arts sector is a massive success story for the UK economy. It’s already in dire trouble because of Covid and this ‘friendly fire’ assault on its viability from our own government could be the last straw for many of our talented performers and backup staff. “Artists and crews will need to apply for work permits and other detailed paperwork for many of the countries they visit. This could make many tours unviable, particularly for younger, upcoming artists who don’t have big teams and big money behind them. “The same applies to EU-based artists wishing to perform in the UK. That means disruption not only to seeing our favourite foreign bands and orchestras but income to festivals and all the benefits of creative co-operation too. Reciprocity is good for Britain and should not be holding back a deal for artists.” The signatories in full: Roger Waters; Sir Simon Rattle; Dame Sarah Connolly; Sir George Benjamin; Sir Harrison Birtwistle; Nicola Benedetti; Steven Isserlis; Stephen Hough; Sir András Schiff; Judith Weir; Roderick Williams; Amanda Roocroft; Amelia Freedman; Nash Ensemble; Anna Meredith; Anna Patalong; Benjamin Baker; Bond Quartet; Brindley Sherratt; Professor Catherine Martin; Catherine Wyn-Rogers, Catriona Price; Chi-chi Nwanoku; Chris Stark, Christian Curnyn; Claudia Huckle; Dr Mark Taylor; Elizabeth Wallfisch; Gabriella Swallow; Gina McCormack; Gregory Walmsley; Harry Bicket; Hilary Summers; Jeremy Huw Williams; Jess Gillam; Joseph Middleton; Kate Royal; Lauma Skride; Levon Chilingirian; Mahaliah Edwards; Martyn Brabbins; Michael Chance; Miloš Karadaglić; Nicholas Collon; Nicky Spence; Paul Cassidy; Peter Robinson; Prof Nicholas Daniel; Professor Julian Anderson; Professor Julian Lloyd Webber; Professor Peter Fribbins; Rakhvinder Singh; Raphael Wallfisch; Rosa Mannion; Ruth Rogers; Sean Shibe; Sheku Kanneh-Mason; Tasmin Little; the Kanneh-Mason family; Sir Elton John; Ed Sheeran; Roger Daltrey; Bob Geldof; Midge Ure; Sting; Robert Plant; Peter Gabriel; Rag’n’Bone Man; Nick Mason; Aitch; Alex Kapranos; Beabadoobee; Bicep; Brett Anderson; Brian Eno; Brian May; Bryan Adams; Captain Sensible; Charlie Burchill; Chris Difford; Danny McNamara; Dave Stewart; Fryars; Gary Kemp; Gary Numan; Glass Animals; Grace Carter; Hayden Thorpe; Hot Chip; Hugh Cornwell; Iron Maiden; Jayda G; Jim Kerr; Joss Stone; Jungle; Kasai; Kero Kero Bonito; Kim Wilde; King Krule; LA Priest; Liam Gallagher; Mark King; Mick Hucknell; Nik Kershaw; Priya Ragu & Japhna Gold; Radiohead; Rick Wakeman; Roger Taylor; Ross From Friends; Rusty Egan Visage; Sex Pistols; SG Lewis; Simian Mobile Disco; SK Shlomo; Steve Norman; Superorganism; Terry Britten; The 1975; The Darkness; Will Young; Dame Evelyn Glennie; Julia Haferkorn; David Francis; Karine Polwart; Peewee Ellis; John J.

I prepared a question to ask Cllr Saima Suleman – the Cabinet lead for Digital, Culture, Heritage & Tourism to ask if she would consider extending the Library Consultation, due to end on Wednesday 17th July, because of the General Election.\nHowever, I was not called by the Lord Mayor in the time limit given for verbal questions. I therefore later emailed the question to Cllr Suleman. I am sad to say I have not even received an acknowledgement.\nThe question is as follows:\n‘Dear Cllr Suleman\nI hoped to ask you this question at full council on Tuesday but I was not called by the Lord Mayor.\nHas any consideration been given to extending the first phase of the consultation please, due to the distraction of the recent general election and the possible change of direction on regional and LA funding considering we have a new Government in office?\nThe potential closure and loss of our library services is very controversial, as is evidenced by the strength of feeling in the number of ongoing questions, petitions, events and protests we are all aware of.\n3771 questionnaire responses received on Be Heard does not seem representative of a population of over 1.1 million people and does not correspond to the number of people who have signed petitions.\nPlanned Face to face events which could have obtained more detailed feedback, especially from people who might find filling in a 30-minute questionnaire daunting, have now been postponed to the second phase. This does not send a good message that initial feedback is being taken seriously.\nMembers who may have assisted the last few weeks in promoting the consultation have instead understandably been involved in election campaigning.\nThe libraries portfolio has recently been transferred to the Neighbourhoods Overview and Scrutiny committee, but that group has not had the opportunity to consider the budget implications and does not meet again until late July.\nThe restructuring of the library service has potential impact on our communities, especially young people for decades to come. It is imperative the council listens to its residents and gets this right. Save Libraries campaign groups have already stated they feel this consultation is deeply flawed.\nWould you please consider extending the consultation at least to the middle of August, if not longer ? This would allow more responses to be made but also give more children and families chance to take part when school breaks up for the holidays.\nI look forward to your reply\nBest wishes\nIzzy’\nCouncillor Izzy Knowles\nMoseley Ward\nBirmingham City Council",

(16th July 2018)\nPC Byrne & PC Hobday updated us the following:\nCrime update:\n112 crimes have been recorded in Moseley & Kings Heath since the beginning of July. This is an increase of 3.7% compared with July 2017.\nOf these – 8 were burglaries (an increase of 3 from last year) & 8 were robberies (an increase of 4). Vehicle crime is the most prolific offence and some of the robberies and burglaries resulted in cars being stolen.\nThree people have recently been charged with a series of burglaries across Moseley. CCTV was an important part of the evidence assisting in identifying the offenders.\nModern cars are currently more likely to be stolen than older models due to the rise in keyless car theft where thieves can remotely steal your car even when it is locked up outside your home. See this article from Motoring Research\nPolice advice is to keep keyless fobs in a metal box or specially designed signal blocker pouch which are inexpensive to buy. The article above also suggests a microwave oven could be used (but please remember you did that!).\nUsing a traditional disc lock or steering wheel lock is also a good deterrent to thieves.\nPSPO:\nToday the police have issued a ‘Community protection warning’ to an individual who has continually breached the PSPO in Moseley village. This can be followed up with the issuing of a ‘Community protection notice’ if the behaviour continues. The notice will require the behaviour to stop and if necessary reasonable steps to be taken to ensure it is not repeated in the future. More info on Community Protection Notices.\nThe neighbourhood team have welcomed the recent appointment of an outreach worker by Moseley Community Development Trust and will be signposting more vulnerable individuals to her for support.\nParking offences:\nThe police team have continued to issue fixed penalty tickets where they see obstructive parking. Today they carried out an operation on Moor Green Lane outside the primary school and reported 16 drivers for offences of speeding and obstructive parking, including to one driver who had parked on a resident’s drive.\nCommunity Speedwatch:\nA resident asked how the community could assist the police in tackling speeding. The officers explained that the police are currently trying to put together a community speed watch programme which will run on similar lines to community street watch. There are two Community Street Watch schemes in Moseley.\nOfficers regularly complete speed operations in various parts of the ward, including Billesley Lane and Russell Road. A resident requested they also target Yardley Wood Road.\nMembers of the public can now self report motoring offences and submit evidence for consideration of prosecution. They need to report to 101 and will be issued an evidential pack to complete.\nTravellers on Sarehole Recreation Ground:\nSince the tragic death of a toddler last week at the recreation ground, the travellers are expected to leave Birmingham by Saturday. Should there be any requirement for the immediate family to remain the council will find suitable accommodation for them.\nShop theft in Moseley village:\nIzzy raised the issue of repeat thefts at the three supermarkets and Boots the chemist in Moseley village. These shops are all being targeted, often by the same offenders. Security Officers have expressed frustration that police are not keeping them updated or matching repeat crimes to offenders. A meeting will be arranged for representatives of all the shops involved to meet with each other and the police to discuss how they can work better together.\nFuture meetings:\nDue to operational demand these will now be held bi monthly and will be hosted by the PCSO’s. The next meetings are scheduled for 10th September, 19th November & 14th January 2019. All to be held at Whitesmiths Croft, Silver Street, Kings Heath.",

A short term saving would ultimately result in greater long term costs than renewing the current contract.\nAfter our letter, at the end of the trial, the contract was renewed for six months with a further review to take place before March.\nAt the Neighbourhoods Overview and Scrutiny Committee this week I asked Cllr Majid Mahmood if that review had taken place.

These are a national online resource, comparing council performance across seven key categories. Birmingham City Council achieved an average score of 39%. Although 4 percentage points above the average, it’s a reflection of how poor the situation is across the country.\nCllr Roger Harmer the Birmingham Lib Dem leader commented on the scorecards: “there are several areas where Birmingham needs to up its game.\n“Transport management is key to reducing pollutants and reducing carbon emissions is a key priority area. We need to make more progress on improving the electric car charging network and the council should be more proactive in developing car clubs to reduce the number of cars on our streets whilst increasing the number of people with access to cars”.\n“The council currently scores poorly in terms of waste management and recycling. We have long argued for the introduction of kerbside food waste recycling, as part of a plan to end the need of incineration of waste”.\nLiberal Democrats have long campaigned for increasing the installation of solar panel on the Council’s rooves to save costs as well as carbon emissions.\nGovernance and finance is a particularly low scoring area, with the Council achieving just 6%. Cllr Harmer said “There’s a new team in place working on this at the council. I hope they are being listened to by decision makers”.\nRecently, Izzy and Councillor Jon Hunt have encouraged the council to reduce use of glyphosate; a weedkiller that damages wildlife – notably vital bee populations. To date, the weedkiller is still being used by the council and partner organisations.\nThe Government also needs to do more, particular in terms of helping to radically improve the insulation of our homes and other buildings.\nThe scorecards can be accessed here:\nIzzy finished her speech by urging young people to take an interest in politics and to campaign for things that are important to them. She talked about the recent elections in Poland and how young people turned out in their thousands to vote for a change in government.\nThe students have all been asked to write letters to people who can influence policy, including national and local politicians and business leaders. Izzy has agreed to deliver any letters addressed to Birmingham Councillors and to ensure they get a reply.\nOne Reply to “”",

In 1949 it was converted for buses, it later became West Midlands Travel Engineering Workshops.

  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_tag_places-for-people/content_7.html": "Last week the council published their proposals for the West Moseley Traffic Reduction Scheme. I wrote about the details here\nI would like to try to explain the rationale for the proposal to put a modal filter on Moor Green Lane using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO).\nFirstly, I would like to reassure residents there are no plans to put a similar filter on Russell Road. That option was considered by officers, who were looking at possibly incorporating it into the Cannon Hill Park to Moseley cycle lane extension, but it was not taken forward to the design stage.\nThe proposal for a filter on Moor Green Lane has come about due to the many concerns raised from residents of Russell Road, Reddings Road and Moor Green Lane about the volume of traffic, speeding and dangerous driving in residential roads in West Moseley. Some residents have been campaigning for action for many years.\nQueensbridge Secondary School and Moor Green Primary School report excessive volumes of traffic, inconsiderate parking and speeding. Many parents say they feel their children are unsafe travelling to school by bicycle or foot, and they have no option but to ferry them by car. There are also two special needs schools in the area, Uffculme and Fox Hollies.\nA traffic calming scheme proposed in 2022 for Russell Road was shelved in 2024 due to the excessive cost – approx. £620,000 pounds and rising. Costs of installing infrastructure have increased astronomically since Brexit and the Pandemic.\nIt was also felt that the scheme would not reduce the volume of traffic, which is a priority of the council as part of the Birmingham Transport Plan.\nOne modal filter in one location is much cheaper to install than a traffic calming scheme over a wider area. A modal filter in Moor Green Lane will likely cost less than a 10th of the previously proposed measures for Russell Road.\nAs much as everyone wants speed cameras, they are unlikely to be considered a priority for 20mph roads until there is a change of law. Speeding fine revenue goes straight to the government treasury and is used for general government expenditure. This means the cost of installation and maintenance of any speed cameras has to be met by the council and costs of administration of the offences are met by the police, with no revenue coming back other than for speed awareness courses, which does not cover the costs. There are currently only six speeding camera sites in Birmingham. Although work is on going to add more, they will inevitably be placed on arterial A routes within the city.\nNeither calming nor cameras will reduce traffic volume, which has got steadily worse in residential streets, mainly due to the use of satellite navigation systems.\nFaced with these barriers to addressing the many complaints and campaigns the council officers looked at a wider area than Russell Road. They discovered most of the traffic travelling through the West Moseley area comes via Moor Green Lane. They estimated if they stop the through traffic using this route it will reduce the amount of traffic using all the residential streets as a cut through by up to half and most of what will subsequently come into the area will be local.\nIt is anecdotally argued that local people are less likely to speed or drive dangerously in their own neighbourhoods. Indeed, if you look at roads where through traffic is restricted there is evidence of a much lower rate of collisions.\nLess traffic, fewer collisions and reduced amount of speeding will make the area much safer, especially outside the schools.\nThere is of course a potential for the traffic to be displaced to other roads. This is why the proposal would be undertaken with an experimental /trial order rather than an immediate permanent one. There would be monitoring of traffic volume and flows across the area before and after the filter is installed. If it doesn’t work or it causes undue problems to other roads it can be removed. The ETRO involves consultation prior to implementation and during the first six months of it being installed.\nThe advantage to installing a filter is safer, more pleasant streets, which for people who are able to cycle or walk or use a mobility scooter, will encourage and empower them to use their car less often.\nThe disadvantage is that if you do need to drive somewhere it may be slightly longer. But, overall the number of short journeys made by people will be reduced, as people use their cars less. That is not a bad thing, the major threat to air pollution is caused by traffic emissions.\nI understand why people are concerned about the use of an ETRO. An implementation will happen much quicker than if a permanent scheme were being proposed and there is a belief the council may make it permanent at the end of the experimental period, despite majority opposition.\nI have taken a lot of interest in the Kings Heath and South Moseley scheme since the first phase was implemented in 2020. It was not initially done very well and quite a number of changes have had to be made. It involved a much bigger series of measures, over many more streets than the West Moseley scheme is proposing. As a result opinion became very divided with as many residents wanting to keep and expand the scheme as those opposing. It is also still not fully complete with changes to the West side of the High Street planned, to replace modal filters with diagonal filters, creating more one way streets and the East side of the High Street and Moseley measures yet to be installed. The right turn from Vicarage Road to Alcester Road South is to be re-instated, which will ease the traffic build up at that junction. The biggest cause of traffic build up in Vicarage Road has long been from Camp Hill Schools and that has not been reduced, although the Pineapple Station opening should have a positive impact.\nIt is clear, however that lessons have been learned and a huge amount of consultation has gone into the second phase.\nIn contrast with that scheme the impact of one filter in Moor Green Lane will be much easier to measure, as will the level of local support.\nI do urge everyone to go to one of the drop in events and talk to the officers and make them aware of how you feel both about the use of an ETRO and how you feel the scheme will affect you, whether it is positive or negative. I will be at both events as I do want to hear the feedback from residents.\nAlthough I have outlined why the scheme is being proposed, that does not mean I won’t take into consideration all the reasons people give for why they oppose or support it. I understand there is no proposal that will satisfy the needs of everyone.\nI hope this post helps at least explain why the proposal has come about and what it is trying to achieve.",
  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_2018_01_29_traffic-management-in-school-road/content_157.html": "Update 4/2/18: The letter we recently sent to residents included ‘inconsiderate parking’ as one of the factors causing traffic issues on School Road. The impact survey reports an increased level of parking on that stretch of School Road at school pick up/drop off times. However the parking noted was not illegal and the narrowness of the road and lack of view from either end are also contributing factors. It is also important to note issues occur at all times of the day and not just during school times.\nResidents are calling for action to deal with the poor driving they are experiencing daily on the section of School Road from the roundabout outside Kings Heath Primary School to the junction with Prospect and Ashfield Roads.\nWe are concerned that not enough consultation has been done with people who do not use Facebook and who were not aware of or did not attend, the public meetings.\nWhat are the issues?\nThe issues faced by all users and residents of this route are:\n*Drivers regularly mounting and driving along the the pavement to pass oncoming traffic.\n*Aggressive behaviour from vehicle drivers including driving aggressively, verbal aggression, and physically intimidating behaviour.\n* Noise caused from horns and traffic grinding to a halt at numerous times of the day and week\n*Vehicles being driven at speed.\nThe current situation is dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists. It is affecting the quality of life for residents and users of this road . School Road is an important access route to two local schools and is heavily used by children and families on foot at all times. Their safety, and that of other road users, is a risk.\nYou can see a video produced by School Road Action Group here:\nWhat are the solutions?\nAt a public meeting on 24th January 2018 six possible solutions were proposed by Councillor Trickett. They are listed below.\nIf you are unable to view the jpeg images we have included the six options as pdf files below . We have also included notes relating to the options produced by the council.\nNotes of Considered Options for issues relating to School Road\nFeedback so far:\nThese are some of the concerns/ points we noted that were raised at the meeting and in subsequent conversations:\n*No modelling /traffic impact assessment was presented and a completed traffic survey had not been circulated. (We now have a copy of the Traffic Impact Study dated 9/10/17 – please see below)\n*One way systems may need traffic calming to prevent increased speeding. Traffic calming humps are not good for motor cycles or cyclists and can increase pollution.\n*It could be dangerous for cyclists to travel two ways in a one way system, but preventing them from doing that would inconvenience cyclists when we are trying to encourage more cycling and could cause cyclists to ride on pavements .\n*A short two way system between two one way systems at the junction of Greenhill Road could be hazardous. This is already a difficult junction to manoeuvre out of.\n*Preventing traffic turning from High St into Valentine Road would lead to more congestion and tail backs and more traffic going up Poplar Road (and possibly Woodbridge Road/St Mary’s Row / Oxford Road)\n*Parking restrictions (option 4)with passing bays could be easily trialled but may not be enforced. There would be a displacement of parking to near by roads.\n*The Moseley triangle, Billesley Lane & Oxford Road could all be negatively impacted by larger volumes of traffic. (Before traffic calming was put into Billesley Lane in the late 90’s there was a fatal and several very serious accidents at the junction of Dyott Road).\n*Emergency vehicles may struggle to get through with options 5a & 5b. (It was suggested bollards could be removable)\n*Options 5a & 5b are different to the first 4 as they discourage vehicles from the whole region as opposed to one or two roads.\n*Options 5a & 5B could lead to the blocked off roads being used for car parking especially during school drop off and pick up times.\nTRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY\nWe have now obtained a copy of the Traffic Impact Study which you can see below together with all the appendices.\nNB: This study was undertaken in July & August 2017 to look into the impact on surrounding roads of the original proposed one way system (School Road between Blenheim Road & Valentine Rd/Springfield Rd/Poplar Road roundabout) which went out for consultation in June/July 2017 but was not progressed.\nAs the recent revised options also include one way systems along the same stretch we believe the report is still relevant although we would recommend it be updated if any of these schemes are taken further and made available as part of that consultation.\nExisting Junction – AM Peak ARCADY Results\nExisting Junction – PM Peak ARCADY Results\nOne Way Scheme – AM Peak ARCADY Results\nOne Way Scheme – PM Peak ARCADY Results\nImse_gd_436 School Road (Option 2 – One-Way restriction)\nWhat happens now:\nCouncillor Trickett is seeking feedback on all the 6 options with the aim of one or two being put forward to a wider reaching public consultation and possibly trialled.\nYou can send feedback to:\nWhat are your local Lib Dems doing:\nWe will be talking to residents over the coming weeks to gauge public opinion and would like to hear your thoughts on all of the options.\nYou can send us a message via our contact page, email moseleylibdems@gmail.com\nor call Izzy on 07784 155208\nWe are looking for the best solution to address the issues with the least impact on surrounding roads. We do not want a situation that causes further issues elsewhere. However we also believe the status quo is not an option.\n2 Replies to “Traffic Management in School Road”",

West Midlands Police, and organisations like the CST and Tell Mama have reported a rise in both anti Semitic and Islamophobic hate incidents.\nYou can see Izzy’s speech to council here\nThe motion had two amendments from the Labour group which we accepted. The amended motion was overwhelmingly voted in favour. It reads:\nThis council recognises that the horrors and repercussions of the conflict in Palestine and Israel have had a profound affect across all communities, but notably the Muslim and Jewish communities here in Birmingham.\nWest Midlands Police, and organisations like the CST and Tell Mama have reported a rise in both Islamophobic and antisemitic hate incidents.\nIn Birmingham, we have seen incidences of antisemitic and Islamophobic graffiti, with more than two hundred tags of a racist, offensive, antisemitic or Islamophobic nature reported and removed since October 7th. We must not allow the tragic events in the Middle East to divide our communities in the city, and we understand and feel the pain of all people in the city, especially the Muslim and Jewish communities.\nThis Council condemns those who have used this crisis to whip up hatred, sow division, and spread misinformation in our city.\nThis council acknowledges that it has a duty of care to the people of Birmingham, and must lead the way in promoting peace, tolerance and respect.\nThis Council notes:\n- There is a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. It is likely that this will impact Gazans throughout 2023 and beyond.\n- An immediate and sustainable ceasefire is needed, so that aid can get into Gaza, the hostages can be freed, and work can take place to deescalate this horrific conflict. Save the Children have highlighted that more children have been reported killed in this conflict than the annual number of children killed across the world’s conflicts zones since 2019. The international community has a responsibility to work towards a peace process and a two-state solution.\n- It is unlikely that many Palestinians will be able to return home for a substantial time.\n- With Birmingham having a proud status as a City of Sanctuary for people fleeing war torn countries and persecution. It is important that we in Birmingham, together with other communities in the UK, prepare to accommodate any refugees from this conflict that seek re-location.\n- Building on the success of the Homes for the Ukraine Scheme, a similar package must be offered to refugees choosing to flee the conflict.\nThis Council therefore:\n- Will write to the Government seeking the provision of a support package for refugees fleeing the conflict and provide further aid to assist the UN Agencies in their humanitarian work so that British citizens can get home safely, and Palestinian people are able to stay in their homeland.”.\n- Will support the active engagement of the voluntary sector in delivering aid and support to refugees from the conflict.\n- Will proactively engage with any Government schemes to house refugees from the conflict to ensure that all refugees are given a warm welcome in Birmingham.\n- Calls on everyone in Birmingham to show tolerance and respect at this time of significant stress to many communities; especially those of the Muslim and Jewish faiths.\n- Will work with faith communities to explore setting up more third-party hate crime reporting mechanisms and write to the Home Secretary to urge Government to reverse its decision to downgrade the monitoring of non-crime hate incidents specifically related to antisemitism and Islamophobia so they can be logged by the police.”\nLiberal Democrats nationally have also called for an immediate bilateral ceasefire to get aid in, get the hostages out, and provide space to realise a political solution, ultimately with two states and a lasting peace.",

The lack of a specific arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan had contributed to the decision for refusal.\nAfter the tree was felled Izzy immediately contacted the tree officer again and arranged a site visit.

They also plan to drastically reduce the amount of plants produced and sold to the public at Cofton Garden Centre.\nI have launched a petition calling the council to think again, look at other options and reconsider this short sighted decision.\nKings Heath Park Nursery has served the local and wider community for many years providing a large variety of good quality, competitively priced plants in an attractive and welcoming setting within the park as well as a popular floristry service. People come from far beyond the local area to purchase their summer bedding and other plants. The floristry service offers a high class service for businesses and the public, offering bouquets, banquet, wedding and funeral flowers as well as providing floral displays for council functions.\nClosing the nursery will not only deprive Kings Heath Park of one of its major attractions, at a time when the council is trying to increase footfall, but it will also have a knock on impact on the nearby Cartland Tea Rooms that also brings income to the park and to the charity Thrive which operates from the old TV garden to offer therapeutic gardening programmes to people with a defined health, social or educational need.\nThe glass houses will not be maintained if the nursery is closed and will be vulnerable to vandalism. Once beyond repair they are unlikely to be restored and these valuable community buildings will be lost for good.\nPlug plants will no longer be bought and grown on by parks staff at the nurseries which will have an impact on the sale of hanging baskets and floral displays to BIDS and charities like Moseley in Bloom to enhance the city retail areas.\nNursery staff have been given very little information or notice of the closure and yet could offer a big insight into increasing the commercial opportunities of the nursery site.\nLittle thought appears to have gone into business development or exploring other models which could keep the nursery open, for example utilising volunteers and considering use of S106 monies or other funding streams.\nKings Heath Park Nursery/Garden Centre is a valuable and important part of the Kings Heath Community – the (now closed) School of Horticultural Training is in a listed building with English Heritage and offered training and apprenticeships.

This time we were in Anderton Park Road at the junction of Woodstock Road.\n10 drivers will be sent warning letters for exceeding 20mph. The main aim of Speedwatch is to raise public awareness of the dangers of speeding. It is not designed to fine or prosecute people, but if really dangerous driving is witnessed the PCSO’s will follow that through.\nMost traffic collisions are caused by drivers losing concentration or if at traffic lights because they think they can beat the lights. No one sets out on a journey to injure someone or wreck their car, so if we can make people think more about their standards of driving that is a good thing.\nThe Community Speedwatch team is now out regularly in different parts of Moseley so if you see them say hello.

  "https_moseleylibdems_com_/https_moseleylibdems_com_author_izzyknowles13/content_104.html": "Last week the council published their proposals for the West Moseley Traffic Reduction Scheme. I wrote about the details here\nI would like to try to explain the rationale for the proposal to put a modal filter on Moor Green Lane using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order (ETRO).\nFirstly, I would like to reassure residents there are no plans to put a similar filter on Russell Road. That option was considered by officers, who were looking at possibly incorporating it into the Cannon Hill Park to Moseley cycle lane extension, but it was not taken forward to the design stage.\nThe proposal for a filter on Moor Green Lane has come about due to the many concerns raised from residents of Russell Road, Reddings Road and Moor Green Lane about the volume of traffic, speeding and dangerous driving in residential roads in West Moseley. Some residents have been campaigning for action for many years.\nQueensbridge Secondary School and Moor Green Primary School report excessive volumes of traffic, inconsiderate parking and speeding. Many parents say they feel their children are unsafe travelling to school by bicycle or foot, and they have no option but to ferry them by car. There are also two special needs schools in the area, Uffculme and Fox Hollies.\nA traffic calming scheme proposed in 2022 for Russell Road was shelved in 2024 due to the excessive cost – approx. £620,000 pounds and rising. Costs of installing infrastructure have increased astronomically since Brexit and the Pandemic.\nIt was also felt that the scheme would not reduce the volume of traffic, which is a priority of the council as part of the Birmingham Transport Plan.\nOne modal filter in one location is much cheaper to install than a traffic calming scheme over a wider area. A modal filter in Moor Green Lane will likely cost less than a 10th of the previously proposed measures for Russell Road.\nAs much as everyone wants speed cameras, they are unlikely to be considered a priority for 20mph roads until there is a change of law. Speeding fine revenue goes straight to the government treasury and is used for general government expenditure. This means the cost of installation and maintenance of any speed cameras has to be met by the council and costs of administration of the offences are met by the police, with no revenue coming back other than for speed awareness courses, which does not cover the costs. There are currently only six speeding camera sites in Birmingham. Although work is on going to add more, they will inevitably be placed on arterial A routes within the city.\nNeither calming nor cameras will reduce traffic volume, which has got steadily worse in residential streets, mainly due to the use of satellite navigation systems.\nFaced with these barriers to addressing the many complaints and campaigns the council officers looked at a wider area than Russell Road. They discovered most of the traffic travelling through the West Moseley area comes via Moor Green Lane. They estimated if they stop the through traffic using this route it will reduce the amount of traffic using all the residential streets as a cut through by up to half and most of what will subsequently come into the area will be local.\nIt is anecdotally argued that local people are less likely to speed or drive dangerously in their own neighbourhoods. Indeed, if you look at roads where through traffic is restricted there is evidence of a much lower rate of collisions.\nLess traffic, fewer collisions and reduced amount of speeding will make the area much safer, especially outside the schools.\nThere is of course a potential for the traffic to be displaced to other roads. This is why the proposal would be undertaken with an experimental /trial order rather than an immediate permanent one. There would be monitoring of traffic volume and flows across the area before and after the filter is installed. If it doesn’t work or it causes undue problems to other roads it can be removed. The ETRO involves consultation prior to implementation and during the first six months of it being installed.\nThe advantage to installing a filter is safer, more pleasant streets, which for people who are able to cycle or walk or use a mobility scooter, will encourage and empower them to use their car less often.\nThe disadvantage is that if you do need to drive somewhere it may be slightly longer. But, overall the number of short journeys made by people will be reduced, as people use their cars less. That is not a bad thing, the major threat to air pollution is caused by traffic emissions.\nI understand why people are concerned about the use of an ETRO. An implementation will happen much quicker than if a permanent scheme were being proposed and there is a belief the council may make it permanent at the end of the experimental period, despite majority opposition.\nI have taken a lot of interest in the Kings Heath and South Moseley scheme since the first phase was implemented in 2020. It was not initially done very well and quite a number of changes have had to be made. It involved a much bigger series of measures, over many more streets than the West Moseley scheme is proposing. As a result opinion became very divided with as many residents wanting to keep and expand the scheme as those opposing. It is also still not fully complete with changes to the West side of the High Street planned, to replace modal filters with diagonal filters, creating more one way streets and the East side of the High Street and Moseley measures yet to be installed. The right turn from Vicarage Road to Alcester Road South is to be re-instated, which will ease the traffic build up at that junction. The biggest cause of traffic build up in Vicarage Road has long been from Camp Hill Schools and that has not been reduced, although the Pineapple Station opening should have a positive impact.\nIt is clear, however that lessons have been learned and a huge amount of consultation has gone into the second phase.\nIn contrast with that scheme the impact of one filter in Moor Green Lane will be much easier to measure, as will the level of local support.\nI do urge everyone to go to one of the drop in events and talk to the officers and make them aware of how you feel both about the use of an ETRO and how you feel the scheme will affect you, whether it is positive or negative. I will be at both events as I do want to hear the feedback from residents.\nAlthough I have outlined why the scheme is being proposed, that does not mean I won’t take into consideration all the reasons people give for why they oppose or support it. I understand there is no proposal that will satisfy the needs of everyone.\nI hope this post helps at least explain why the proposal has come about and what it is trying to achieve.",

The area is geo-fenced so that the Global Positioning System (GPS) on the bike can pick up that it has been left within the virtual dock area.\nThe plans below provide further details of the six proposed locations:\nPhysical docking station: Salisbury Road at Alcester Road (outside the old Boots building)\nVirtual docking stations: Wake Green Road outside Wake Green Surgery\nOxford Road at St Mary’s Row (On corner of M& S building)\nAlcester Road at Chantry Road (Outside St Columba’s Church)\nMoor Green Lane nr to Russell Rd (Outside Scientology building)\nEdgbaston Road opposite Oakfield Road\nYardley Wood Road at Wake Green Road (outside Moseley Court)\nOn the map you will see service bays marked out near each docking station. They are points where a service vehicle may park for a short time in order for the docking stations to be rebalanced. This is an operation carried out at night, by staff in service vehicles, whereby bikes from places with large accumulations of bikes have some removed and relocated in other places where there are less numbers. A service vehicle may only be there for a few minutes, and the bay is indicated purely to show that there is somewhere legal, safe and practical for operatives to park. Bays are not restricted to other vehicles or have any markings or signage.\nBoth pedal bikes and e bikes can be left at the docking stations.\nAll existing docking station locations are available to view at http://ow.ly/p9Yk50EPfHY\nIf you have any comments or questions about these locations, please email : connected@birmingham.gov.uk by Wednesday 16 November 2022.\nHow will the scheme work? To hire a bike, the user needs to register for the scheme on the Beryl bikes app.\nBikes are available to hire 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year so residents and visitors can always access the bikes when they need one.

I believe it is time for change. I would harness the knowledge and guidance of local experts, business and community power, to champion Hall Green and Moseley and our fabulous city. I’d work collaboratively to bring investment and improvement to tackle the inequalities and injustices we see every day. I would get things done and I would hold people to account.\nI’ve been deeply saddened by the destructive and detrimental impact of the current Conservative Government. From a disastrous Brexit, dividing our communities, to a woeful lack of progress on environmental matters and trashing our economy, they have let us down now, and they have let down future generations too.\nBirmingham Labour have brought us local austerity too. The cuts caused by their mismanagement will be deep and devastating, and they will impact people for generations.\nLiberal Democrats want to do things differently.\nWe will fight to undo the disaster of Brexit, to return to stronger, better international relations that allow the big issues such as international conflicts and climate change to be resolved at the right level.\nWe will fight to fix services in Britain so that it doesn’t feel like everything is broken.\nWe want a fair deal for you, and I will fight for that in this election.\nI have been described as a community activist.

As a result I am an active volunteer in a number of different organisations, these include attending the district Housing Liaison Board which seeks to include tenants and stakeholders in partnership with city housing officers as well as holding them to account. I have been a member of the Birmingham East Police IAG, which acts as liaison between local police senior management and the community. I founded Moseley Litter Busters, a group of volunteers who help to enhance and support a pride in our neighbourhoods. I help run Moseley Farmers Market which has done much to boost the economy and the profile of Moseley as a destination and I set up Moseley Alternative Giving Campaign which provide help and support to homeless and vulnerable people in our community. When the pandemic struck I was one of a key group of volunteers who set up Moseley Together which arranged deliveries of food and medicines to shielding and vulnerable resident, supported businesses and found volunteers for vaccination clinics. I went on to become a volunteer vaccinator with St Johns Ambulance. I was awarded the BEM for ‘Services to the community in Moseley, especially in response to Covid 19’ in the 2022 New Years Honours list. In 2022 I helped a group set up Moseley for Ukraine in response to the war in Ukraine and to support refugees and host families in Moseley.\nHaving lived, worked and volunteered in public service for most of my life I feel I am in a good place to understand and tackle the very many issues that matter to people, such as local policing, crime, fly tipping, pollution, poor levels of recycling and dirty streets, and to take on injustices that prevent people succeeding in life such as the housing crisis, lack of funding for schools, inequality, prejudice and racism.\nI will be highly visible, hands on, local, accountable and contactable and when someone needs help or advice I will be there for them because it doesn’t matter who they are, or what their politics are, everyone matters and we can always find common ground.\nI believe that everyone, no matter their background or starting point in life should be enabled to achieve.

A history of Kings Heath Park’s association with horticulture can be found on Thrive’s website:\nhttps://www.thrive.org.uk/how-we-help/regional-centres-and-programmes/birmingham/thrive-birmingham-history\nMy petition calls on Birmingham City Council to recognise the importance of Kings Heath Park Nursery as a community asset and to do everything in its power to keep it open, growing and selling plants to the public.",

As Izzy is a host herself she was not allowed to speak in the debate as it was seen as a potential conflict of interest.",

The roads to be done are School Road, Stoney Lane and Yew Tree Road. While we very much welcome the inclusion of these three roads, with around 150 roads in total in Moseley, having just three resurfaced and no footways done, is not good for our area. Last year only one road in the ward, Belle Walk was re-surfaced so at this rate it would take over 50 years to reach the whole ward without even thinking of footpath resurfacing.\nIzzy and Radley have submitted petitions signed by local residents to Kevin Hicks, the Assistant Director of Highways and Infrastructure at Birmingham City Council for both Chantry Road and Anderton Park Road to be added to this years list. Chantry Road is a cycle route and school street with a very poor and dangerous surface. Anderton Park Road is similarly also full of potholes, especially the section between Stoney Lane and Woodstock Road and is also a street used by school pupils. Pot holes and splits in the tarmac are not only dangerous for cyclists and motor cyclists they also cause damage to vehicles so increasing pollution in our atmosphere.\nYou can sign the petitions here:\nChantry Road Anderton Park Road\nThe Council are asking for feedback on the programme, so there is still a chance to change it – please let us know if there are other roads you would like us to lobby to be added to the programme and we will push hard for them to be done, if not this year then included in the next round of investment .\nThe Council anticipate that this years programme will commence towards the end of August 2021, but timing is still to be confirmed.",

The plans would benefit 20,020 small and medium-sized businesses in Birmingham, from family-owned high street shops to hairdressers.\nThis would include the 1000 plus cafes, restaurants, pubs and other hospitality businesses in the Local Authority area including over 150 in Birmingham Hall Green Constituency.\nUnder the proposed Liberal Democrat scheme, small businesses would be able to apply for Government grants covering 80% of the increase in their energy bills for one year, up to a maximum of £50,000. Nationally the proposals would help 1.4 million small businesses across the UK.\nThe party is also calling on the new Prime Minister to introduce laws to support families and businesses with spiralling energy costs as soon as Parliament returns next week.\nThe scheme would cost an estimated £10 billion and could be met by reversing the Conservatives’ planned tax cuts for big banks, which are seeing their profits grow with rising interest rates. That would include cancelling the Government’s cut to the Bank Surcharge that is due to take effect in April 2023 and restoring the Bank Levy to 2015 levels, raising £10.6 billion over the next four years.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor and Parliamentary Spokesperson for Birmingham Hall Green Izzy Knowles said:\nOur local high streets risk being devastated by spiralling energy costs and turned into ghost towns, but the Conservatives don’t seem to get it or even care.\n“Local shops, cafes and restaurants that survived through the Coronavirus pandemic, could now be taken down by soaring energy costs and forced to close their doors unless the Government steps up urgently.\n“We need this energy bailout now to save our high streets, rescue small businesses and keep prices down for local families.\n“We’ve known this hike was coming for months and the Government has done nothing.\n“We cannot waste more time. The new Conservative Prime Minister must act immediately to protect families and small businesses in Birmingham as soon as Parliament returns.”",

In response to Birmingham City Council’s decision to move to a different model of service delivery Trident Group are moving to a localised emergency bed model. They will be closing their 101 bed hostel, Washington Court, and instead provide emergency beds from smaller locations outside of the city centre.\nHelen Dixon House in Moseley has been identified as a hostel that will change from a ‘female only long term supported’ site to ‘mixed housing emergency provision’. It is due to change provision on 30th November.\nTrident Group have given the three remaining female residents two weeks notice of the change of provision under ‘exempt licence’ rules, and are supporting them to find alternative accommodation.\nHelen Dixon House as a women’s hostel, has been an important part of the Moseley community for many years. It is one of the very few hostels in Birmingham where vulnerable women can feel safe and also have a reasonable length of tenancy in order to gain confidence, become involved in the community and get back on their feet.\nFemale residents from Helen Dixon House have the support of a drop in and activities at Moseley Hive and work closely with a nearby charity, Anawim, who specifically support women who have suffered trauma, violence or abuse.\nHomeless outreach officers will agree that many women are too frightened to enter mixed emergency provision and will even feel safer out on the street or in an abusive relationship.\nTo close Helen Dixon House as a safe hostel where women can rebuild their lives is a travesty to vulnerable women across the city.\nI have launched a petition to keep Helen Dixon House a women’s only long term supported hostel.\nWe call on Trident Group to urgently re-consider this decision and keep Helen Dixon House as a long term supported women’s hostel.\nWe call on Trident Group to guarantee the three remaining residents can continue to live at the hostel, receiving support, until they find suitable alternative accommodation.\nWe call on Birmingham City Council to review their service delivery model to include women’s only hostels so that hostels such as Helen Dixon House can continue to operate to provide long term consistent support to women in a safe environment.\nUpdate: 24/11/24: I have written to Trident Group who have confirmed the move, and say it is due to the service delivery model adopted by the council. They have reassured me they will not evict the three remaining residents.",

When the attainment gap is widening and children from disadvantaged backgrounds have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, it is shameful that the Tories would seek to cut pupil premium money.\n“Liberal Democrats introduced the pupil premium and have had to fight the Tories to keep it properly funded. Given the financial pressure that families are under, this change has real potential to cause harm and will have a direct impact on the quality of education schools can provide for those who are in desperate need of more, not less, support.\n“This is a bad move at the worst possible time. The Government must listen to teachers about the reality on the ground, not pull support when it is most needed.”\nLiberal Democrat Spokesperson for Education and Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said:\n“Once again, disadvantaged school pupils are set to lose out as the Tories prioritise penny pinching over proper support. By moving the goalposts on the entitlement criteria for the “Pupil Premium”, thousands of children whose parents have become unemployed in the last three months will not get the crucial support they need.\n“Liberal Democrats introduced the Pupil Premium because we know how vital it is to target support to raise the attainment of disadvantaged pupils and close the gap between them and their peers.\n“The Conservative Government must urgently rethink this decision or they run the risk of more disadvantaged children falling behind.”"
