We discussed priorities for policy in the coming years, as well as achievements in Government. The panel was hosted by the NEU's Daniel Kebede and chaired by Schools Week's Samantha Booth.\nIt is clear the Conservative record on education has been significant and advances in reading and standards in schools must be maintained. E.g. England is rated 'Best in the West' for reading among 9-10 year olds according to the 2023 PIRLS - https://www.gov.uk/government/news/england-among-highest-performing-western-countries-in-education.\nWe also discussed the reforms to Teacher Training, to extend training periods, as well as the investment in advanced qualifications (NPQs), which have benefitted over 50,000 teachers. (https://buyingforschools.blog.gov.uk/2023/06/05/free-funding-available-…)\nThere were many questions to the panel, which included how to target teacher recruitment and retention, as well as ensuring the curriculum is broad and offers enrichment for all children.

I recently met with a group of concerned residents who are very worried about the impact that this policy could have on their road, as it will impact the events they can hold and they don't have any current problems with parking. The new scheme means a monthly cost to pay for a permit for your street in certain areas. After your first free booklet, vistor permits cost an additional amount too. There are proposed benefits, such as more trees and enhancements for cyclists.\nI experienced parking permits when living in an area of South East London and I remember how it made small things like having friends round for my children’s birthday parties just that bit more difficult as you had to check you had enough permits or organise things outside of restricted times. It impacts small businesses, who risk fines when they visit customers. And I even heard last week of a community centre that may need to close because parking restrictions have made hall hire so much more difficult.\nBut, I support choices. If a parking restriction is needed, then it must be one that is community led and supported by local residents.\nI want to hear your views. If you are impacted by the Sustainable Streets initiative and want your voice heard, please get in touch and let me know.\nLouise for Lewisham East - Listening to Local Residents",

If elected on July 4th, I will make it a priority to meet with Network Rail and South Eastern to discuss with them any improvements that rail passengers would like to see, to make commuting as easy and accessible as possible.\nGiven how busy the network is in our area, it is vital that we protect it from trespassing, so I will look at how we can work with Network Rail to educate, inform and protect passengers and the public.\nCombatting anti-social behaviour on the railway lines is also a priority, to ensure money isn't wasted on repairs after vandalism. I will prioritise meeting with the British Transport Police, as well as Network Rail, to understand what more can be done to avoid this.\nAnother initiative that I have seen work well in other areas is making it easy for people to report things that impact their safety, such as faulty lights near train stations or bus routes. Surveying people on places where they feel further measures can be taken to improve safety can also faciliate joining the dots between local authorities, network rail and the train companies too.\nI have a track record of working with these organisations to deliver improvements and if you vote for me on July 4th, will work hard to deliver this across Lewisham East.",

When I had the opportunity to retrain as a teacher after a long career in business, I took it, fulfilling the passion for social mobility my experiences gave me.\nConservatives have led a revolution in our schools. I agree with the Prime Minister who describes education as the best social and economic policy we have.\nSince 2010 we have seen:\n🏫 90% of schools rated good or outstanding, up from 68% under Labour,\n📕 The 4th best primary school readers in the world,\n📈 Our secondary school children have risen from 27th to 11th in maths & 25th to 13th in reading,\n👨🏫 27,000 more teachers since 2010, and 59,600 more teaching assistants,\nThis has been delivered due to record levels of investment:\n📈 Increased pupil premium funding rates to £1,480 for primary pupils and £1,050 for secondary pupils this year, an increase of 10 per cent since 2021-22. This brings total funding to more than £2.9 billion overall, supporting schools in disadvantaged areas to raise educational outcomes for the pupils who need it most.\n📈 This year Conservatives increased education funding to almost £60 billion, an increase of almost £2 billion compared to last year, taking funding to its highest ever level in real terms.\nOf all the policies the opposition discuss, the tax hikes on independent school fees worry me the most. I worry about the impact this will have on the ability of many parents to afford this option, leading to disruption for children and a squeeze on school places in the state sector.

They also help to ensure that slower devices and Internet connections do not impede substantially on navigating the website.\nTherefore, you should be able to:-\n- Zoom in up to 300% without test spilling off the screen using your web browser settings.

It is entirely possible for all of these accessibility issues to be resolved by content creators themselves.\nBrowser accessibility\nThis website has been optimised for the latest versions of the following browsers:-\n- Google Chrome\n- Mozilla Firefox\n- Apple Safari\n- Microsoft Edge\nIf the website does not display correctly, please update to the latest version of your browser.\nHow to request information in an accessible format\nThis website has its own administrator and if you need information in a different format, please contact that individual using the form or details on the Contact page in the menu.
