Residents from Harlesden to Westbourne have told me that they want\nto see national change.\nWe see every day the chaos and devastation under this Tory Government.\nIt is everywhere, from the hours I spent waiting in A&E with my\ngrandparents at St Mary's Hospital to the parents I meet forced to skip\nmeals to feed their children.\nIf elected I will be a community MP, working every day to make sure the\nresidents of Queen's Park and Maida Vale are seeing change - more\nteachers in schools, more opportunities for young people, more homes\nlocal people can afford, safer streets and reduced NHS waiting times.\nGeorgia Gould\nGeorgia's Story\nMy family have lived around this area for generations. My great\ngrandfather came to this country as a teenager, working his way up to\nopen a shop on Kilburn High Road. My mum grew up off Edgware Road and I\ngrew up on Westbourne Park Road. I will work every day to give back to\nthe community that has given my family so many opportunities.\nPromoted by Marc Harris on behalf of Georgia Gould, both at 4G Shirland\nMews, London, W9 3DY."
