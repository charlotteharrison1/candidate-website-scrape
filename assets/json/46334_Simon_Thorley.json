He is married to Nicole and has two children: Clara, six, and Jack, four.\nWe believe that everybody should be free to choose the path they want to follow through life.\nWe believe that rights are vital to protect individuals against the power of the state, big business and other powerful interests.\nWe believe that each individual can make their own decisions and think for themselves.\nWe believe that national prosperity is founded on free-market economics, combined with fair and adequate taxation for well-run public services.\nWe believe that nations working together is essential to solve the world's big problems.\nWe believe that international free trade is the foundation of prosperity and peace.\nDarlington has been ill-served by generations of local and national politicians, both Conservative and Labour.\nChild poverty is at record highs. The population is ageing and shrinking. NHS waiting lists keep on rising. Wages are lower than they were in 2009. Taxes and public debts keep going up. Our beautiful rivers and coastline are blighted by sewage and industrial neglect.\nHowever, there is every reason to have hope for the future.\nChange is possible - but it requires a new approach. A people-first, bottom-up approach which focusses on delivering simple, practical and sustainable improvements.\nAnd that's what a vote for me on 4th July means.\nWe have invested more than £500m in regenerating the old steelworks site in Redcar. £250m of that is borrowed, and will have to be repaid by taxpayers.\nThe good news is: there are profits to be had on that investment.\nThe bad news is: under the current mayor, 90% of those profits have been given away - for literally nothing - to favoured private sector partners. That's around £1bn in profits which could - and should - have been funding local councils. Instead, it's disappearing into the pockets of a few well-connected businessmen.\nThis is, undeniably, a scandal.\nBut we don't have to just accept it.\nIf I am elected mayor, I will regain those profits for local taxpayers and ensure that all future regeneration work is done exclusively to public benefit.\nThe way to do that is via a mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\nA CIL is a charge which is levied on developers who build on public Development Corporation land (such as STDC).\nIt recognises that a large amount of investment in public infrastructure has been made, or will be made, in the redevelopment area – which will directly benefit the developers concerned.\nIn the case of STDC, the major external benefits which developers enjoy are the remediation of the toxic site itself (with the public taking on all the risk), the investments in transport infrastructure, and subsidised training programmes.\nThe charge will not be paid by Teesworks Ltd. Unfortunately, they will still be able to buy each parcel of remediated land (if they want to – no obligation!) for a knock-down price.\nInstead, it will be paid by the end client, who actually builds a factory or other facility on the site.\nThis will take revenue away from Teesworks Ltd, and instead redirect it to where it should always have been going – to TVCA and henceforth the local authorities of the Tees Valley.\nHere’s an example:\nUnder the current arrangement, 100% of the money paid by the end client goes to Teesworks Ltd. Let’s say that for a given parcel of land, that’s £100mn.\nUnder my proposal, the CIL will take a portion of that £100mn (the exact percentage will have to be carefully calculated to avoid legal challenge). The end client will still pay £100mn, but split between Teesworks Ltd and TVCA.\nIt’s a workable solution, with powers the mayor already has.\nIf I am elected mayor, I will create a £25m per year fund to target the biggest single issue affecting our region: poverty.\nMy Early Years Support Fund will:\nPublic transport in the Tees Valley is unreliable, expensive and complex.\nThis destroys opportunity.\nIf we are to tackle poverty and build a more prosperous region, we need a public transport system - particuarly buses - that people can rely on. One that isn't driven by profit, but by a mission to connect people and open up possibilities.\nI will bring our buses under Combined Authority control, and introduce:\nThe Tees Valley has a £38m Adult Education budget - not that you'd know about it, under our current mayor.\nRather than using the budget to expand opportunity, it has been channeled directly to colleges, who have to run specific skills-based courses using the funds - regardless of whether that's what people want to learn or not.\nI will change this.\nI believe that people know for themselves what they need to progress through life: what skills and education will bring them the biggest return.\nI will introduce a system of Individual Learning Grants, allowing any local resident to apply for financial support to study a course which they want to study, when they want to study it.\nCopyright © 2023 Simon Thorley.
