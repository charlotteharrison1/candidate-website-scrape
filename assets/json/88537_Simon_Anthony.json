I had had diagnosed M.E. for 8 and a half years; this was diagnosed by four GPs and two Professors. I was 71 and felt I would be too old to appreciate it if I ever did get better !\nI consulted a London Professor. After a few false starts he suggested that I had an URINE test for thyroid function. This test is, at present, only done in Holland.\nThe results showed very low readings for T3 and T4, though blood tests had never showed anything other than normal and I did not present as a thyroid case (attested to by all the doctors and the professors I had consulted.\n| My readings were :- |\nT3 184 : - mean ref. value in urine 1400-2500 |\n| |\nT4 309 : - mean ref. value in urine 1800--3000 |\nI was prescribed Thyroxin and Tertroxin and, here is the amazing part, two hours after the first dose I felt the M.E symptoms roll away! That was at the end of October 2002 and I am still feeling perfectly normal,now18 months later. I had to get my strength back, of course, as I had had to use an electric buggy to get about, but I could soon walk and suffered only aching legs - not complete flop out and blank head.\nThe relief was extraordinary: I had got my life back. So I want to let the world know that this thyroid test is something worth trying. I am sure that I cannot be the only person to have 'normalÃ« thyroid tests when they are not normal at all. T3 is not tested in the normal blood test, it is reckoned to be unnecessary if T4 is normal. T4 has to convert to T3: there can be plenty of T4 but if it's not converting, it's not doing its job.\nThe test costs about costs under £100, and the lab is;-\n| |\nEuropees Laboratorium voor Nutritienten |\n| |\nRegulierenring 9 |\n| |\n3981 LA Bunnik |\n| |\nPostbus 10, 3980 CA Bunnik |\n| |\nThe Netherlands. |\n| |\nTel. 0031 30 287 1492 |\nYou can write to the lab yourself. You need to collect urine over 24 hours. The lab sends a syringe which is filled and sent away. The volume of the urine must be recorded. My instructions said that the sample had to be in their hands within 24 hours but I later found that for this test this was not necessary, though the sample should be as fresh as possible. You might prefer it if your GP took the sample and filled in the form, so you will have to persuade him/her to do the necessary. Thyroid U.K.have a list of sympathetic doctors, if you join them, and have an excellent package when you do join.They are all volunteers and do not give a phone number.\nGood luck to all of you, it is well worth a try !\n| |\n|\n| |\n|\n| |\n|\n| |\n|\n| |\n|\n| |\n|\n| |\nemail This email address is being protected from spambots.

The British Thyroid Foundation have so far to my knowledge not helpful in this regard.\nRecommended reading :-\nThe Great Thyroid Scandal. Dr.Barry Peatfield. ISBN 0-9544203-0-6 Published by Barons Down Publishing.\nI met Dr.Peatfield at the Thyroid UK conference, where I was a fellow speaker, he now endorses the urine test.\n============================================\nHi, I am Simon Anthony.\nMy mother suffered for many years from a debilitating illness that was considered by some to be M.E, and by others to be nothing at all. She was forced to use a wheelchair and a motorised buggy on the few days she had the strength to attempt to move out of the house. She is not a lady to take this sort of thing quietly. As part of the 'Put the Heart back in Ealing' Civic society group she took on the great and the good of Ealing Borough Council when the 'Spine Route' road scheme was proposed for central Ealing back on the 1980s. The group fought long and hard and finally won. Ealing Town Centre was redeveloped but along the lines accepted by the Civic Society. It was opened by the Queen. The centre won an architecture award and my mother and the other two of the 'Three Witches' as the Council called them, were strongly featured. It took them twenty years. My Mother is not the sort to stay down even when both pushed and sat on.\nWhen my mother was struck down by her own body, she didn't accept the 'inevitable' that she knew she could reverse. It took her eight years of continual battling against her debilitating illness and the medical professions' inability to find a reason for it - as well as a great deal of their opposition to her questioning her situation.\nOnce the target had finally been established, a magic bullet could be chosen that would and did hit and destroy the problem - and she was better - able to think, walk, sleep, shop and - after 8 and a half years - able put even more effort than before to her task of making other undiagnosed people well again.\nAfter very many false dawns she found medical advice that would listen to her as well as just talk at her - she was advised to use a private company to do a urine test, which she did. My Mother's illness had eventually been tracked down to a thyroid malfunction that did not show up in any of her multiple blood tests. The results were remarkable in that they showed something was wrong. Better than that, that something could be fixed. Once the target had finally been established, a magic bullet could be chosen that would and did hit and destroy the problem - and she was better - able to think, walk, sleep, shop and - after 8 and a half years - able put even more effort than before to her task of making other undiagnosed people well again.\nHer recovery was so rapid, unexpected and so remarkable that she was asked to speak at the first ever National Thyroid conference later that year (2003). She got a standing ovation from the hall-full of high ranking medics. These medics listened and took her story to heart to such an extent that other patients have benefitted on at least two occasions even more remarkably than my Mother.\nSadly, she is now again unwell and most medics think it is due to her now being over 80. Once more she disagrees and is attempting to fight her way back to health. She had been well for well over a decade after her cure, but now has to attend hospitals again. A few weeks ago as she left the hospital, she was recognised by a woman who had seen an article about her cure in the Jersey Evening Post. This lady had been ill for 47 years and my mother's cure worked for her too. She had her life restored.\nI think that my Mother should be recognised and thanked for her efforts as she may have been responsible for many other life recoveries. I created this webpage containing the solution to her Thyroid issue, it has been online in some form for over ten years. I have no idea how many people may have seen it. Does anyone know of any other sufferers of undiagnosed thyroid problems that may be helped, or have been helped? She can not be much of a blogger herself, she is not well enough any more, so I do this bit for her.\nThe last online proof of this story is at\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140412064832/http://thyroid.about.com/library/news/blthyroiduk2.htm\nMy Mother has put all of her strength in to finding a cure for herself and then once she found one she spent even more energy telling the world about it. Now she is again ill, I'd like the world to say thank-you and may be, spread the news a little further.\nSimon Anthony.\n|",

  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_politics_55-open-letter-to-nottingham-county-council_html/content_15.html": "This open letter is sent in advance of the County's Planning & Licensing Committee meeting to respond to the expansion of the Eastcroft incinerator. I send this openly for simplicity and because this issue effects all of us equally. We equally have a responsibility for the future and to the people who have to live in it.\nThe re-submitted proposals for an increase in the incineration capacity of the Eastcroft site must be seen for what they are - a short sighted money making enterprise wrapped in the guise of an environmental necessity. It is essential that the people of Nottingham throw away greatly reduced amounts of household waste, essential also that our society re-organises to not produce waste in the first place. If you don't make it, you don't have to dump it.\nThis necessity has been self-evident to many environmentalist for decades and is finally being realised and accepted as a fact by the Government.\nSimple maths and everyday knowledge of the way the world works tells anyone willing to learn that continued waste can not be supported in our society. Now, almost at the eleventh hour, the electorate is belatedly calling for action.\nNow is not the time to find a 'business as usual' way around the issues. For many years Environmentalists have been thinking beyond these stark facts and we have found many possible solutions. Please listen to us now, we were right years ago and you ignored us, and now you realise we we right but still don't hear.\nShort-termist thinking will always be able to see a way of squeezing more perceived value from existing infrastructure - expansion of Eastcroft is the most locally pressing example. The cosmetic alterations from the first application for expansion do not and indeed can not address the long term issues which have been listed by many people for so long.\nTo reiterate. Even the National Government states that recycling and (much more importantly) a reduction in the production of waste - is essential for this country and the world. Slowly, as if wading through treacle, the national consensus is finally moving in the right direction.\nAllowing a expansion of Eastcroft will lessen the amount of waste going to landfill - it is true - But;\nIt will increase pollution levels in the air we breath in Nottingham. (I can often smell it - irrespective of what the claimed measured emissions may be)\nIt will increase greatly the road traffic required to deliver the waist needed to make an expansion a viable economic system.\nIt will not use modern incineration methods - as 'retraining existing staff is too expensive'\nIt will send utterly the wrong message to Nottingham residents who are just beginning to realise the importance of recycling. The existing chimney totem to the god of waste - high on our skyline is bad enough as it is,\nLulling people - including yourselves, in to a false sense of security through buying a few years worth of landfill space at the expense of so many other areas is not worth the money and not worth our future. The only answer is to reduce the problem, not try and hide it away like a guilty child pushing rubbish under the carpet.\nThis is a grown-up problem and requires grown-up responsible action to answer it. Reduction, not incineration at any cost.\nSimon Anthony, Local resident.",

  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_chick-anthony_html/content_10.html": "I am very sad to have to announce that after a long illness - that he didn't tell anyone about, our Father Chick (Rowland) Anthony has died after a short illness that he eventually mentioned, in Jersey Hospital yesterday. He died peacefully after requesting no further medical assistance holding my sister Biddy's hand at ten past six on the 1st July 2017. He has asked for there to be no funeral. Arrangements are yet to be made for his cremation which he didn't want a fuss to be made about either.\nMy Father, Chick Anthony ( Rowland really, but no one called him that ), has died aged 87 one month short of 88. He grew up in Jersey, the son of a second generation emigrant from Kerala in India. His Father became a headmaster and his mother had the foresight to buy a place for their retirement. It was there, in Grouville Jersey where Chick and Joy eventually lived.\nHis name, Chick, comes from his Christening - when he wore a yellow suite. This prompted someone to say he \"looked a real Chick\" - and the name stuck. The religion didn't, he was a life-long agnostic, not bothering with that sort of thing.\nChick met my Mother in Salisbury when he was working in his first job at the Met Office - judging the way the wind blew gas around the Army base at Salisbury Plain. He lived in a hostel for several years, spending his free time at an amateur theatre group as a stage manager. There he noticed the leading lady and married her. It was about then that he first attempted to join the BBC but there were no openings until ITV started up and there were plenty, he got in on his second attempt. At his interview he noticed his original application letter on the desk - written on blue paper. This was the start of a long relationship with officialdom at the BBC.\nJoy and Chick started their married life in a flat in Acton but soon moved to Hanwell where I was born. He was very pleased as my birth got him off doing Grandstand - a show which I also tried to avoid working on in VT Tel.Rec. some years later. He, like me had a hard time coping with the Evesham training centre at Wood Norton but he got through without being terminated and his first role was as a Boom Op. He was seen on telly from Jersey handing a microphone to David Jacobs on the Six Five Special - or so he told me - but it was probably Pete Murray. It was a live show so no recorded evidence exists. Over the years he rose to the top Sound job of Senior Supervisor working on a wide variety of shows, from the first use of VT on air - Vera, through Grandstand and Doctor Who, via I Claudius and loads of Shakespeare and several major music productions to mention but a few - some are now lost. A fuller list is on IMDB, which is, despite it's length, not complete.\nBiddy was born in Mum's family home in Salisbury and shortly afterwards her father, William Forder ( a master builder who built Laverstock ) helped finance a move to Ealing where the family lived for around twenty five years - just up the road from Ealing Film studios where we sometimes had tea. Chick cycled to work at TVC with ease from there.\nChick was a leading light in the ABS, which lead to the only argument I know of between him and Joy when a strike was called. He had used his great abilities with language to act as an arbitrator in the hope of preventing it, but as a true democrat he supported his representative's views and went on strike with them.\nOutside the BBC, Chick and Joy lived an 'Upper,Lower,Middle - Middle Class' life working hard and long for many years with the Ealing Civic Society. After a decade's battle to \"Put the Heart back in Ealing\", they won and the - locally approved - Ealing Broadway Centre was opened by the Queen.\nHe was a long standing Liberal and worked for the party just as much as for the Civic Society, but not so sucsesfully. One way or another, everyone who lived in Ealing would have had a leaflet through their door from him on his bike - often.\nJoy became ill with an M.E./Thyroid related disease - for which she trailblazed a treatment regime during and after her recovery. Sadly this didn't last and her returning disability resulted in their move to Jersey where she did indeed recover somewhat. In Jersey he took up the mantle left by his Father in the Jersey Battle of Flowers association, helping with the flowering of many a Grouville float over the years. His speciality was brushing down the \"Mare's Tails\" used for detailed work. He was very particular about detail. Chick also became very active in Jersey Heritage, becoming Chair of the Jersey Environmental Society and making many media appearances until Joy's illness returned.\nThis illness then escalated to dementia and Chick has been acting as full time carer for many years - ignoring his own deteriorating health and keeping it secret - presumably so as not to bother us. He gave up cycling after his second hip replacement - he never had a car nor learned to drive, \"you don't need one in London\" he said. Joy disagreed and got one, but couldn't learn the thing. Before her illness, she did manage the far harder task of controlling a tricycle which defeated the rest of us.\nBoth Chick and Joy are deeply proud of all four grandchildren - one of the last things he did was prof read David's Master's presentation. He was awarded a 'First' on the same day his Grandad died.\nHis final illness was recognised by a Doctor that he had called to attend to Joy. He was told to go to hospital at once, but, he took Joy to a nursing home by taxi first, then on to the hospital where he had an emergency bowel operation. This triggered a heart attack and he died of complications after requesting no further treatment.\nHe has gone, but his work shall live forever - unless the BBC wipes it again.",
  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_politics_61-the-point-of-the-green-party-22-sep-2006_html/content_8.html": "I joined the Young Conservatives because the name Conservative appealed to my ideals of conservation. It did not take me long to realise the word in the party name had nothing to do with the word in the environmental sense - so I left - and grew up.\nIt took me many more years before I put together the pieces of the world I saw in to a coherent whole - and longer yet to find that I was not the first person to do it - the Greens had been there long before me.\nAnd so it is today. People join or support a political party until they see the party go against the views which drew them to it. At that point they have a choice, either to think again or to give up and just follow the flow. It is our human duty to think again - it is democracy - but it is our human nature to follow the flow that gives us an easy ride - at least as long as we keep our eyes closed.\nIn 1993 I stood as a Green for the parliamentary constituency of Rushcliffe. Had I not stood there would have been no party for me to vote for. I gave voters their democratic right to vote for a party of their choice by giving them a choice. There was no doubt who would win, but I hope I made the other candidates start to think.\nToday, Ken Clarke is happy to say that he believes human action is at least in part the cause of admitted global warming. In 1993 he didn't. Had there not been a Green Party - had there not been a reason for a Green Party he would not have been forced to change his mind. I expect Ken would say he always thought it was true, but even if he did, he never did anything publicly about it - or we would not be in the mess we are in and can't easily get out of today.\nAfter the election I took part in an audience television debate on the BBC, I think the topic was - 'Have you been betrayed by the Conservatives'. At the end of a heated afternoon I put my question \" How can the Green Party get its policies heard, how can we be treated as a real party when the BBC ignores us. How long will it take?\" John Sergent, the then leading political journalist for the BBC answered. He said it took the young Labour Party 60 years. I did not have the chance to reply that we don't have 60 years left because he had taken up the rest of the program answering me. He had taken the question very seriously.\nToday, other parties have decided to state in public that they support Green concerns. In private however they have always known we were right. It has taken them this long to say anything publicly because they have been able to continue with the status quo - which supports them very well - until this point. By hiding the facts from the public the grey parties, industry, big business, the status quo have kept on doing business as usual up to the point where the realities which we warned them about decades ago stopped business being usual - forcing them to change. Only now do they admit in public what they must have always known in private.\nThese people are not stupid, Greens don't have the only clear vision of reality. Green though put our joint vested interests in the world environment before vested interests in businesses as usual. That's the difference.\nThat was the pithy point at which to stop this blog, but I have to continue. It is important to make it clear that Greens do not think that 'doing Business' is the problem, nor are the people who do it. For example, I love technology and live by and with it. Business and every day life does not have to change very much to have a very great change on the way it impacts the natural and man made environment. We can, must and shall do what the Greens have always said - because there is no choice.\nHad the world listened when the problem was first noticed, then there would have been time and space for a gentle alteration of our habits over the last 40 or so years. During that time Greens have worked out what to do. The other parties have either just started thinking about the problem or are about to unleash massive packages of change which will astonish everyone and probably do more harm than good. We though have a simple set of steps, but all must be taken together, now, by all of us together, for all of us together. There is no time left for blame or recriminations, nor very much point - as long as we really do act now.",
  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_politics_54-sub-prime-problems-and-opportunities_html/content_14.html": "2007\nWe hear a lot these days about the American Sub Prime mortgage situation. Why should we in Nottingham care? It's a complex and long chain but each link in it is strong one. It could result in us losing not only our green open spaces but also lower the re-sale value of our own homes.\nOur house prices, in Nottingham as well as all over the country, have been rising month on month for years now. They go up each month on average more than a person would pay as interest repayments on a 100% mortgage. In anyone's book this is a good deal. But, in America this is not true any longer. It was true, and people with poor credit ratings (sub prime in American speak) were given mortgages in huge numbers.\nWhen the economy changed for the worse as many would think, or 'stabilised' as is a better way of thinking about it - then all of a sudden the maths of growth stopped working and big financial institutions started to lose money. Here the word 'lose' does not mean having less money than before, it means gaining not as much money as they expected. If a normal person loses money they have less of it after the loss. In big financial worlds, losing means not gaining as much as expected.\nThe expectation thing is the point here, seeing the future allows planning and thus investment. If your financial crystal ball develops a crack then you lose confidence in the safety of it's predictions and you get more careful about who you lend money to. The big banks, all over the world, have now lost so much confidence that they won't even lend money to each other for fear that the other banks have massive unrecoverable debts due to lending money to the 'Sub Prime' amongst us.\nWe in the UK and particularly Nottingham have an extra link in the chain to think about. Here, as Norman Lamont, an ex Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated on the BBC Radio 4 Today program this morning, our housing market is not as vulnerable to this lack of confidence as for example in America. America has lots of space and no considerations against building on any of it.\nSo, the more houses they build, the easier it is to find one, demand drops as the pressure to buy at any cost diminishes and so the pressure on house price rises also falls - if this goes on for any length of time house prices themselves can fall too. This is global financial instability at work, a bit like over steering in a skid, you swing one way then hard back the other - damaging things as you go.\nWe British live in a small country and quite like the parts we have not built on yet. We also like our houses to keep their value - negative equity is a nasty word and a worse reality. But, we hear from the Government that more homes need to be built. What will happen if they are? Frankly, unless we are either careful or very lucky we shall go the same way as America - lose our open land and also lose the value of our homes.\nIt does not have to be this way. If there is a demand for places to live (rather than an opportunity to make money selling property which is a different thing by the way) this can be met in other ways. It may come as a surprise to read that building on 'Brown field' sites is not one of them. When you learn that the definition of a 'brown field site' includes not only your back garden but also the place you are living in at the moment, the picture changes somewhat. If it meant what the term sounds as if it means, building on old industrial land, then that's OK. But this land is heavily polluted by it's industrial past - which is why it's not been built on already. Do you want to live on a toxic waste dump? Many people already are and that is another story.\nThe answer from environmentalists (who have been working on this problem for decades before most groups have even accepted there was a problem) is to make better use of what buildings we have. For example, the spaces above shops in city centres are often not only empty but in some cases open to the sky. Having been left to ruin by years of neglect. Landlords have not been able to make a 'decent' profit on the upper floors in shopping areas and so have not bothered to do anything with them. The roofs have fallen in in some places while the shops stay open several floors below.\nThat situation has begun to improve, but is still a real issue and a real opportunity. Rates should and could be changed to make it financially worthwhile to open up this mass of unused City centre space for people to live in. This will have the effect of bringing the Cities back to life and also win back the streets from hoards of marauding bored people who make it frightening to go out at night. This revitalisation will stimulate worth while and sustainable growth. There is a real way for people to make good money here.\nSo, when you hear the call to build on the land East of Lady Bay, or anywhere else for that matter, think what effect it could have on the value of your own property. Can you afford to let that happen? I can't.\nP. S. Since writing the above, Northern Rock has suffered a 30% or more fall on the stock market. The instability is getting worse by the minute. Today also the Government is saying it will bribe local councils to build on land against the wishes of local residents. What did I tell you?",
  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_perma_html/content_21.html": "In these times of food scares, predictions of eco-holocaust and political upheaval, it would be nice to think there is a way in which mere individual gardeners could help put matters right. If there were, then we could all potter around our plots doing what suits us best not feeling guilty for ignoring the important national disasters by hiding in the garden. In more than a trivial way I believe gardeners have already been helping out in some small manner for many years. Not much of a help maybe by itself, but by providing a second source of food for the kitchen, by creating areas of green that can nurture wildlife and as a side effect reminding people a little of what nature can do for herself, it all adds up to a tidy sum. Every little helps. It takes a major leap of the imagination to think these efforts would ever really change anything. Amazingly though, now it is possible. The humble gardener, even of only a window box, can show the world a thing or two if we do it right. How do we do that? By Permaculture. Don’t worry, this is no gimmick or wonder cure-all even though it sounds that way. It does look too good to be true when you find it is dreadfully easy to do, almost stupidly rewarding and what is more it’s totally safe but then we are due for a piece of luck.\nEnough of the introduction. What is it? In part, Permaculture is the structure of the natural interconnections between plants and animals that keep everything on this planet going. Bill Mollison recognised it as being something rather useful about thirty years ago whilst he was studying rain forests. Mollison had been fascinated by these forests ever since his time as an Australian lumberjack. After a dehumanising period cutting them down he asked himself what it was all for, and came up with some very wide ranging answers. He has never since cut down a tree although he would if it proved necessary, it just never has. His answers had lead him to his first attempts at forest conservation.\nHe began by investigating how forests work. The rain forests are some of the oldest stable communities of life to be found anywhere on the planet. His forest once grew on an ancient continent known only to geologists, they called it Gondwanaland. That was the single land mass which split up under the power of continental drift to form the globe map as we know it today. Geological time has the slowest clockwork on Earth and yet the forest is still here. This makes the forest (not the individual plants and animals) older than most of the rocks that make up the surface of the Earth. You can’t get much older than that. What could be so special as to out-live not only the Dinosaurs but also the continent on which they evolved? (A certain blue-green algae has beaten that record. It is also very special, it first made the oxygen in our atmosphere so it had to start early.)\nMollison and his team realised that in order to survive at all, all parts of the forest or any other stable system interact as a mutually supporting, self - balancing and renewable whole. It was much less obvious to see exactly how this trick was managed over such tremendously long time periods. Here Mollison was helped by his almost\nBuddhist way of seeing things. It was his feeling for the overview or totality of life that let him concentrate his efforts on uncovering the ‘shape’ rather than the details of the full forest system. Working in this way he began to find multiple parallels between the ways in which the different plants and animals interacted and he reasoned that the stability of the total forest system must come from the shape or pattern of these relationships rather than have anything much to do with the detail of how any particular interdependency works. He knew it would be hard to explain this almost mystical concept when it was exposed to the hash light of scientific scrutiny, so he shone that light on it first himself.\nMollison’s rigorous scientific studies did nothing but sharpen up his feel of the pattern. Then, armed with demonstrable facts and edible information he found he could go further. He could copy the pattern. He took a selection of seeds and cuttings from the forest plants, put them with the insects and animals that occurred naturally in the original and transplanted them in the correct forest pattern somewhere else. The new forest worked. Many years later it still shows all the stability of a real rain forest right down to the correct level of rainfall. This water trick is managed by the plants themselves. They grow a bacteria which is released from the leaves. It then rises and ‘seeds’ clouds in the otherwise clear but moist sky. The rain then falls and keeps the plants alive. Very early on in his experiment he saw that the soil condition of his plot also began to match that of the original. Ground litter from a real forest had been transferred to start the system running but unlike other attempts at forest building his leaf layer did not dry up and blow away. This was because he had kept the relationship between the plants and the leaf litter unaltered so the layer stayed and grew in just the expected manner. He had transferred the system that supported the forest itself without even knowing exactly what it was.\nAfter a while he wondered if he could go further still. The next stage after showing that the important aspect of a forest is the pattern of interdependencies between the flora and fauna is to try and fit different plants and animals into places in the pattern replacing the tropical species. That way he hoped he could design a system for another climate. This would have the long term stability of a rain forest and also produce humanly useable crops in a non tropical climate like ours in Britain. The hope was that such a system would be able to provide a small scale low maintenance food source for the somewhat lazy. He tried it and it worked. Hey presto - Permaculture.\nThe story does not end there at all. Copied plant and animal systems are very good at growing, much better than anything we have managed to achieve. Even with all our chemical fertilizers, genetic engineering and insecticides we can’t begin to match nature at her own game, and nor should we try. A remarkable finding at first sight, but not so strange when you think about it. Nature had been working on the most efficient way to turn the sun’s energy into living organic matter for many millions of years before we evolved. Nature has come up with tricks that we can’t yet even see let alone understand. Our not understanding them doesn’t change the effect they have on our very existence.\nThis lack of understanding seems not to have taught us caution. We blindly go on with our ‘tried and tested’ methods of agriculture and production regardless of the costs while teaching there is nothing to worry about. For example the ‘Water cycle’ as taught in schools of my time is 80% wrong. Only 20% of water returns to land as rain. The rest condenses out of mist and fog every morning onto the plants. If we lose the trees then we lose that water, which is our only fresh source apart from rain. Remember rain only falls once clouds have been seeded by bacteria grown in plants. That same bacteria also triggers ground level condensation. Dust particles are too small to do the job by themselves. Get rid of the plants and we lose the remaining 20% as well. We can’t even put our hope in\naquifers as they will soon dry up, the water table is kept in place by the pumping action of trees evaporating water back into the atmosphere.\nIt is not only deforestation and land clearance that is causing problems. Nearer to the home back garden there is a genetically altered strawberry that has been made frost resistant by suppressing its ability to grow the rain seeding bacteria. If this technique is widely used without due regard to the newly understood water cycle then we are in for big trouble. No one would deliberately do this, but do they see the danger? Another worry is that in a world without plants we don’t need to fear of dying from thirst. As plants still produce all the oxygen we breathe we will have suffocated long before the water runs out. It is essential to learn every little we can of nature’s methods so that we can avoid destroying or damaging the natural balance which has kept as alive until now.\nThat is enough of the dangers of fighting nature, what of the benefits of working with her? As Mollison has shown it is not necessary to understand everything to benefit from the largess of nature, so it is not all gloom. In fact Permaculture could be the longed for panacea for a stupidly large number of our ills. For example, findings from a working farm show that within eight years of running the business under permaculture conditions it has been possible to do away with all farm subsidies and yet still produce greater profits than traditional agro-business driven agriculture. The benefits mount with the fact no chemical fertilizers are required. This is because the land retains a high fertility which is normally washed out through over watering. A permaculture system stops the land drying out by using a heavy mulch which also keeps off the weeds, keeps the soil temperature level and holds in the moisture. Eventually it rots down to feed the next crop. The land is never ploughed, worms and beetles keep it aerated so the need for a tractor and other expensive farm machinery is much reduced. Indeed a horse would be a splendid self-renewing, fertilising, self-fuelling alternative. The harvest becomes totally ‘organic’ almost as a byproduct. Crops of meat and plant produce contain no toxins from insect spraying as the flora and fauna in a mixed crop do not offer the incentive to insect or microbial invasion that literally plagues a monoculture. The farm causes no pollution save from the exhaust of the odd tractor. It does create extra work at harvest time but that should be seen as another advantage as the labour force needs no special skills. Also, the modern dangers of a farm will not threaten any untrained workers as the dangers are simply not there - unless they annoy the bulls.\nThis is not as childish a hope as it sounds, there are major precedents for massive reorganisation of human systems in the hope of universal rewards. For example there are the agricultural system and the free market enterprise culture to mention just two. Both of these establishment ‘panaceas’ have shown exceptional results in their own spheres but only now are the costs of flying in the face of nature becoming too great either to hide or ignore. It is long past time for a change and this could be it.\nPermaculture, like all Godlike gifts, is very powerful. It can be applied to anything from desert reclamation to window box herb growing. It is not even restricted to the ‘lower’ life-forms, there are many parallels to be found in the way people interact in human societies. That could be called the Miss Marple effect, the habits of a single small village community accurately reflect on the dealings of big businesses etc. She too was laughed at, but she was fiction, you can prove the truth of Permaculture with the window-box test. First you need to know how. To find out more simply contact the Permaculture Association, 8 Hunter’s Moon, Dartington Totnes, Devon TQ9 6JT. There are many books on the subject, each has the word Permaculture in the title so they shouldn’t be too hard to find.

  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_politics_58-green-shoots-1991_html/content_9.html": "The Green shoots of economic recovery' indeed, Norman Lamont should know that there is nothing in the least bit green about the economy of this country!\nAt the moment or prosperity such that is it is based entirely on the backs of those least able to bear the weight. The third world and the poor in all parts of the globe, the people we see on the TV news stories starve to benefit us! We can no longer hide our heads in the sand. The inequity that lies at the very heart of our economy is the very cause of the scenes of starvation and horror across the world. The worst of it is the big buisneses and economic gurues know very well, all too well exactly how to squeeze the poor for all they can get. Where do you think our constant increase in wealth comes from? This planet is limited, it comes from them. The more we get the less they have. It is as simple and as disgusting as that. But you will rightly think we in the west are increasing or productivity to the point where we over produce food and pile it up in rotting mountains which we can't even give away. Our science gives us the power to create a garden of eden out of anything so why don't we? The answer is again very simple. There is no money in it!\nThis horror is done in our name. The benefits trickle down from a table overfilled by the lifes blood of people we call peasants. It does not have to be like this. Our great technology can be used to uphold our real wealth, we don't need growth, it does none of us any good anyway. Stability has to be won but there is no need for us to suffer at all! We have the technology but more than that we have the common sence. Just give people, you, that chance to do more than send money to the destiture countris of the world. Vote to give us the chance to stop taking everything else from them!\nIt is easy, it is painless, it is essential or we will all pay for it with the death of our ecosystem.",
  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_politics_57-the-green-leadership-debate-1991_html/content_12.html": "26.3.91\nThe current problems of finance and organisation within the Green Party stem not so much from any particular real inefficiency but from the simple fact that we are very much alone. Other parties can make thumping losses, drastic errors, disgusting proposals etc and get away with it just because it is traditionally expected of a politician. But, a Green politician, which is perhaps a contradiction in terms, has to be super human. Faultless, selfless, utterly open minded and fully informed. This is a very great burden to shoulder and yet the Greens in their many forms have raised public awareness from nothing to the point where the other parties and even the media are forced to take notice.\nThe Greens have done well to achieve as much as they have with very limited resources and less media support but we know the party is far from perfect. The problems of existing as a political entity in the 'real world' have to be firmly addressed. The shake up that Jonathan Porrit calls for in our organisation has been much need and I as a prospective parliamentary candidate welcome it unreservedly. However his actions have raised a dust cloud of confusion in the press that could hide some of the important basic issues.\nStupidly the leadership question has become a head on clash between the aspects of inflexible authoritarianism in the standard party system and the dangers of an utterly disorganised shambles of 100% democracy. The former results in the passing of laws that only benefit the law makers, the latter results in nothing being done at all. The situation is neither that clear cut nor that simple because a 'party line' as such on any matter can not exist for the Greens. For other parties any deviation from an implicitly correct 'line' has to be totally wrong. But for us there is always an organic and flexible answer to hand. In this case we should find the sensible middle ground of co-operation. This should not be seen as a half baked compromise between working alternatives with bits of both but with the advantages of neither. It would be and indeed is the practical working position between two untenable positions.\nWhat though of co-operation and leadership? Are these concepts as incompatible as 'green' and 'party'? I believe not. Look at the way co- operatively operated businesses can run. Each member has a position in the structure that is valuable but not necessarily unique to them. The job has to be done but the merits of the jobs are not vertically ordered but of equal importance (if not of equal simplicity) to the running of the whole. Each job often requires a specialist. In the Green Party a leader should be seen as the person doing the three specialist jobs of communication, consolidation and mediation. For this they need to be well as suited and fully informed as possible. The great time and effort this takes should not have to be spent by everyone in the organisation. Only someone with full information, ability and backing can be in the position to lead in the traditionally accepted sense and resources being limited we can only afford a few well chosen specialists for this particular job. Therefore we need 'leaders'.\nIn our party it is not often up to a leader, councillor, MP etc to make decisions unaided but when the situation arises they should be willing and indeed able use the known wishes of the party rather than act on personal preference (although often the two are very similar).\nWhat if we should choose wrong? At the moment if an elected representative acts outside of their mandate there is nothing the electors can do except wait until the next chance to vote them out. For the Greens the answer is Recall. Under the 12 point Citizens Charter launched this week all Green politicians councillors and leaders are required to submit themselves to recall from office if the people they represent feel dissatisfied. Other parties could consider this to be a hobbling restriction on the running of government, always having to look over their shoulder to see if they are doing the right thing or face loosing power. But that is true democracy, not the clinging on to power for years, doing what is politically expedient and then sweetening the pill just before an election. We have greater faith in both the good will of our leaders and the sanity of our members and the rest of the electorate. We are more than willing to put this radical new approach to the test of the voters.\nCooperation, communication and specialisation will keep the Greens together as a political entity and at the same time let in a more festive 'party' atmosphere. After all, with our act really together we will surely have something to celebrate.",

  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_politics_56-lets-help-ourselves-out-of-recession_html/content_11.html": "It came to a head for me when I just couldn't manage to paper the wall properly. I can mend video machines easily but can't manage a simple bit of paper hanging. For a while I hoped that perhaps it would come right if I just took a bit more time over it, maybe then the result would be worth the effort, but after the first few weeks it struck me it was never going to be finished. During that time I fixed several videos, a couple of computers, made many meals, laid a carpet and even had time to build a window seat (and do a bit of teaching, for which I was paid a bit) but the walls remained stubbornly undecorated.\nWe don't have the money to pay someone else to do it so, being practical in all things but decoration I looked around for some other way of getting it done. After a bit of thought I found out that the danger of becoming a 'Jack of all trades, master of none' can be avoided. If people get together and share their skills, swapping the jobs they can't do for the ones they can, then everyone benefits. In our case our wall gets papered (not an easy task) and someone else gets their electric stuff working again, and all for the cost of the material and a few minutes on the phone.\nLucky for Lady Bay, I don't have to work out all the details of a job swap scheme, that has already been done. The National LETS co- ordinator said on the phone that only about ten people are needed to start up a new core group in Lady Bay. Each of the first few people bring in their (non professional) skills, (or we may get taxed), as wide a range as possible - from baby sitting, plumbing, car mending, gardening, dog walking, if you can do it then you offer it. It all goes into a job swap database until a job needs doing. Then a coordinator matches the task with the master and away we go. 'Payment' is in kind, as in the time honoured barter system but brought up to date with cheque books and job tokens. One stipulation is that no hour of one job should be 'worth' more that three times an hour of any other. Don't ask me exactly why, it just works best that way. Records need be kept only of who does what, not of who 'owes' whome for what. You give and receive LETS cheques in place of money to pay other LETS members for their work. There will be an exchange rate between LETS and LSD but it won't be made known to 'speculators' so we should be alright there. And there you are, and here I am...with a half decorated wall.\nAny broken electric thingies out there? Labour Exchange Transfer Scheme some call it, Lots Easier Terribly Simple I call it. If you are interested in being first on the database then please contact me, either by phone or by letterbox whenever you get a chance. Your's co-operatively, Simon",
  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_politics_62-nef-new-job-application-cover-blog_html/content_16.html": "I am very proud to say that as a school boy I managed a 4% mark in a multiple choice Economics exam. Zero would have been perfect. I knew that by randomly ticking a box I would score 33.3%, so 4% really showed my understanding of the subject. I have often wondered which 4 questions I accidentally got 'right'. My Economics master disagreed. He told me to read the newspapers and follow the news so that I could gain a proper understanding of the world and the way it works. He did not realise that my 4% showed that even then I had been doing just that for many years. What I had learned I did not like.\nI now believe that the 4% 'error' probably showed that 'real' economics was just beginning to learn the realities of the world as I intuitively saw them. At the time, I was stunned and deeply hurt to learn that the basis of the working world in to which I was being launched was fundamentally skewed against the laws of physics and to my mind morality. I got good marks in Physics.\nAs I listened more to radio 4 and began to follow the somewhat more sensationalist TV news programs, it became all too clear that if I was to get on in the world I had to act against it. This put me in a difficult position. I wanted stuff, safety, a good life, to see the world and do interesting things, but I knew that the way most people did these things destroyed their very reasons for wanting them. I had to find another way.\nMy education had provided me with insufficient qualifications to make it in to further education, let along the higher type, so I needed a job. I had made a list, but only of things I didn't like. The first job on the list was installing telephones, so I joined Post Office Telecoms. This was simply because the job was known and available to me. Like most other people, I knew the ‘Devil I knew’ better than anything I hadn’t ever thought about, so I did what I knew.\nI was good at it, but wanted to follow my Father in to the BBC. When I was old enough I did. It was there I saw a few more of the errors of my ways. I felt more and more uncomfortable with the status quo at the BBC. There was a total lack of foresight or awareness of the world outside TV Centre. I found valuable television programs in junk piles ready to go to landfill. I pulled them out ( Doctor Who mostly ) and sent them to the BFI for archiving. Today these very programs are on sale in shops. I saw that coming but was almost sacked for trying to do something about it. I left the BBC, but it took me ten years to pluck up the courage.\nMany years later, I found the Green Party. A great place to vote, less great at getting things done. The problem with political parties is, other groups don’t want to do have anything to do with them. So if a party is small to start with it isn’t going to grow very fast. My thoughts turned then to just how long we have before we run out of time to wait fr things to get better. Frankly we ran out of time many years ago.\n21 hours of work a week would give me back time in the week to do things I actually enjoy, one thing I like is Radio 4. Saturday’s interview with the New Economics Forum, nef – lower case because small is beautiful, gave me the chance to do just that – use my working time to do what I really like and have time left to do even more of it.\nAnd so – I now aim myself at the opportunity of a Media Officer post at nef. Hence this small addition to my infrequent blog.",

  "https_torty_co_uk_/https_torty_co_uk_index2_html/content_6.html": "| The Anthony familyWeb site\n| |\nLast Updated 24/9/99.\nFor a more recent page, get a frames browser or look at almost the same thing here. But anyway, welcome to our web site. This has recently been fixed so that poor sad PC users can see it too. If you are reading this then you do not have a frames browser - you are missing nothing much at least on this site. I have only put a frame on the side of this lot to be annoying anyway.This site comes to you from the offices of Tortoisesoft Enterprises which is the name which until recently I gave to what ever I was doing at the moment which was not paid work but which might eventually have lead to some. Unfortunately I have just been made redundant from ECS and so all my RISC OS free and shareware stuff has come over to this site.\nPart of that work was my writing for Arc World. Due to problems at Arc House the first two disc's worth of programs were missing from my Teach Yourself Wimp programming series. You can download all my programs and Arc World related stuff from here now.\nEven though Arc World 16/1 was the last ever and my series was cut short by this unpleasantness it may be revived in a book one day.\nUntil then you can still read my deathless prose in Acorn User. The last stuff before the above was not new. It was a very old version of Pentominoes written in BBC basic for the Arc. It has been sold as Careware for several years for and on behalf of Archive mag and may have done someone some good somewhere. Because I found it on the Archive CD rom I thought I may as well pad out my site with it and so it is on the Software page with the My World screens which you have really come here to download.\nWhy is my site so big? Well I know it isn't really but each time my provider offers more space I feel I am obliged to use it up, not very green of me but I still need the practice. The animations here are just to show I can do it.\nPentoms for My World2 is still here, as is my totally unsold Stickers. Pentoms has been revamped and is soon to be re-released (Ha!) as Maths Games 2, or so I hope. Keep an eye out for my MyWorld Jigsaw creation program too. Both products will be sold via me directly if at all..\nI don't only write about computers. If you have got here by following the link at the end of one of my articles in Acorn User then you may not be expecting stories - daft stories at that. I have written many of these and links to the best (well all of them) are at the end of this page (and in the frame at the left if you have one. Hope you like them, more are to come.\nMy family pics have been given their own page, so as to let the rest of you see the site without having to wade through my snap book. These are updated from time to time and now show last year's holiday in Jesery.
