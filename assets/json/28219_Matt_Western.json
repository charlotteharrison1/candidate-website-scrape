Through the pandemic, they were on the frontline, serving customers despite the risk to their health and keeping our rail services moving.\nThe focus should be on providing customers with the much used and appreciated service at our local stations, not making changes that will make it harder for passengers to purchase tickets and get advice from ticket office staff.\nWith only 21 days allowed for the consultation, it is crucial that the opposition to these plans is made abundantly clear.\nPlease scroll down and sign below to help save our local ticket offices.",

It will also be hugely expensive for Warwickshire taxpayers – membership is expected to cost Warwickshire County Council £650,000 per year. The five District/Borough councils will be expected to contribute on top of this too. This is money that should be spent on Warwickshire, which could end up being spent in Birmingham, Coventry or elsewhere.\nThe question of why this is happening now will come to mind for many residents. The reality is that the Andy Street is doing what the Conservatives do best, playing political games to further their own interests. The attempts to bring in Warwickshire and Shropshire to the WMCA is an attempt to shore up Conservative support for Andy Street in the May 2024 Mayoral election.\nIf not, there would be no such urgency to get this change through ahead of then. Why not wait until after the Mayoral election in May 2024 and the General Election that is likely to follow? It should not be possible for authorities to change boundaries less than a year ahead of an election. It is blatant gerrymandering.\nVoters in Warwickshire deserve a say on their future. Any plans that go forward regarding Warwickshire County Council joining the West Midlands Combined Authority should be put to the public in a referendum in line with the Mayoral election next year.\nIt’s so important Warwickshire residents make their voices heard and tell Andy Street we don’t want to be a part of his political games.\nPlease scroll down and sign below to make your voice heard.",

This information may include your name, your contact details (including postal address, email address and telephone number), your payment details (i.e. relating to any payment you make to us in connection with our services), any other information we request from time to time to enable us to provide our Site to you and to continue to do business with you and any other information you provide to us.\nWe may occasionally receive information about you from other sources, including:\n- credit reference and fraud prevention agencies;\n- where you have consented for other organisations to lawfully share data with us; or\n- where we receive data from trusted third parties to assist us in our marketing efforts.\nWe will add this data to any information we already hold about you.\nAdditional information may be collected through the deployment of cookies on our Site. See the “Cookies” section below for further information on our use of cookies.\nAny of the information or data referred to in this paragraph (together, the “Information”) may or may not constitute or include Personal Data.\nSafety of Children\nOur services are not intended for and may not permissibly be used by individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from persons under 16. If it comes to our attention that we have collected Personal Data from such a person, we may delete this Information without notice. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact matt.western.mp@parliament.uk\nHow long we keep your Information\nWe will keep your Information only for as long as we need to hold it for the purposes set out in this Policy.\nHowever, if required we will be entitled to hold your Information for longer periods in order to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.\nLegal basis for processing your Information\nFrom 25 May 2018, under applicable Data Protection Law we may only process your Information if we have a “legal basis” (i.e. a legally permitted reason) for doing so. We will have a legal basis for processing your Information under this Policy if:\n- you have given us your consent to process your Personal Data (see below); or\n- processing is necessary for the performance of a contract you have entered into (i.e. we need to process your Information in order to provide you with services), or in order to take any preliminary steps that you consider are required before you can enter into such a contract; or\n- processing is necessary to allow us to comply with our legal obligations; or\n- processing is necessary in order to protect your vital interests; or\n- processing is necessary for us to perform tasks that are of public interest or in the exercise of official authority (where applicable); or\n- processing is necessary for our legitimate interests, provided that these legitimate interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights.\nYour consent to processing\nIf you have previously given your consent to the processing of your Information, you may freely withdraw such consent at any time. You can do this by notifying us in writing using our contact details below.\nIf you withdraw your consent, and if we do not have another legal basis for processing your Information (see above), then we will stop processing your Information. If we do have another legal basis for processing your Information then we may continue to do so subject to your legal rights (for which see “Your Rights” below).\nWhere we are unable to rely on consent, we will rely on the performance of a contract with you or compliance with our legal obligations as the basis for processing your Information, unless we consider that processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (e.g. delivery and/or improvement of our services). Marketing is considered separately below.\nHow we use your Information\nWe will use your Information for the following purposes:\n- to help us identify you and any account you hold with us;\n- administration of your account and any services you order from us;\n- to assist us in complying with or enforcing any legal obligations;\n- research, statistical analysis and behavioural analysis;\n- to provide insights based on aggregated, anonymous data collected through the research and analysis referred to above;\n- fraud prevention and detection;\n- billing and order fulfilment;\n- to improve our services; and\n- marketing (see ‘Marketing’ below).\nMarketing\nIf you have not purchased services from us or enquired about purchasing any of our services and if you have given us prior permission, then we will use the Information we hold about you to contact you by email for the purpose of letting you know about our services. If you prefer not to receive these communications from us, or if you no longer wish to receive them, then you can opt out at any time.\nIf you are an existing customer of ours, or if you have previously purchased services from us or enquired about purchasing any of our services, we may use the Information we hold about you to contact you by email to provide you with details of similar services to those purchased or enquired about by you. If you prefer not to receive these communications from us, or if you no longer wish to receive them, then you can opt out at any time. We have undertaken a legitimate interests assessment of our marketing practices and we have concluded that legitimate interests is an appropriate basis for those practices, as we consider that it is reasonable to assume that you would expect us to promote our services to you in this manner and that doing so involves relatively little intrusion into your privacy or any disproportionate impact on your fundamental rights; furthermore, because we utilise an email marketing system which allows us to exercise a sophisticated degree of control over your marketing preferences, we do not consider that a less invasive form of processing is available to achieve the same ends.\nYou have the right at any time to ask us to stop processing your Information for marketing purposes. If you wish to exercise this right, you should contact us by sending an email to matt@mattwestern.org giving us enough information to identify you and deal with your request. Alternatively, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions in emails you receive from us.\nSharing Information\nWe may share your Information with:\n- other companies within our group;\n- our suppliers, subcontractors, agents and service providers who help us to provide our services (and we will ensure they have appropriate measures in place to protect your Information);\n- law enforcement agencies in connection with any investigation to help prevent unlawful activity;\n- regulatory bodies, in response to any official request; and\n- if our business is sold or integrated with another business, your Information may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.\nKeeping your Information secure\nWe will use technical and organisational measures in accordance with good industry practice to safeguard your Information. However, while we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard your Information, you acknowledge that the use of the internet is not entirely secure and for this reason we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any Information that is transferred from you or to you via the internet.\nMonitoring\nWe may monitor and record communications with you (such as telephone conversations and emails) for the purpose of quality assurance, training, fraud prevention and compliance. Any information that we receive through such monitoring and communication will be added to the information we already hold about you and may also be used for any of the purposes listed in this Policy.\nInformation about other individuals\nIf you give us information on behalf of a third party, you confirm that the third party has appointed you to act on his/her/their behalf and has agreed that you can:\n- give consent on his/her/their behalf to the processing of his/her/their information;\n- receive on his/her/their behalf any data protection notices; and\n- give consent to the transfer of his/her/their information abroad (if applicable).\nOverseas transfers\nFrom time to time we may need to transfer your Information to countries outside the European Economic Area, which comprises the EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein (‘EEA’). Such countries may not have similar protections in place regarding protection and use of your Information as those set out in this Policy. Therefore, if we do transfer your Information to countries outside the EEA we will take reasonable steps in accordance with applicable Data Protection Law to ensure adequate protections are in place to protect the security of your Information.\nBy submitting your Information to us in accordance with this Policy you consent to these transfers for the purposes specified in this Policy.\nYour rights\nThis section sets out your legal rights in respect of any of your Personal Data that we are holding and/or processing.

If any of the Information that you have provided changes, or if you become aware of any inaccuracies in such Information, please let us know in writing giving us enough information deal with the change or correction.\n- You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we delete all Personal Data we hold about you (the ‘right of erasure’).

If this is the case we will let you know.\n- You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data, for example where the Personal Data is inaccurate or where you have objected to the processing (see below).\n- You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to have it provided in a structured format suitable for you to be able to transfer it to a different data controller (the ‘right to data portability’). Please note that the right to data portability is only available in some circumstances, for example where the processing is carried out by automated means. If you request the right to data portability and it is not available to you we will let you know.\n- You have the right in certain circumstances to object to processing of your Personal Data. If so, we shall stop processing your Personal Data unless we can demonstrate sufficient and compelling legitimate grounds for continuing the processing which override your own interests.\n- You have the right in certain circumstances not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, for example where a computer algorithm (rather than a person) makes decisions which affect your contractual rights. Please note that this right is not available in all circumstances. If you request this right and it is not available to you we will let you know.\nComplaints\nIf you have any concerns about how we collect or process your Information then you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, which for the UK is the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (‘ICO’).

  "https_mattwestern_org_/https_mattwestern_org_about/content_6.html": "Matt Western was elected to serve as MP for Warwick and Leamington in his first election campaign as a candidate in June 2017, overturning a Conservative majority of more than 6,000. He was re-elected against the odds at the December 2019 election. Matt was re-elected for a third time in the July 2024 election.\nMatt made an immediate impact in the House of Commons and was appointed to both the Communities and Local Government Committee and the International Trade Committee. He currently sits on the Business and Trade Select Committee and chairs the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy. He is a champion of the automotive industry and chairs both the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Electric Vehicles and the All-Party Parliamentary Motor Group. He also sits on the All Party Parliamentary Groups for International Students, Semiconductors and Video Games and Esports.\nAfter serving as an opposition Whip in the House of Commons, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Higher Education in March 2021. In October 2024, Matt was elected to the Business and Trade Select Committee, on which he serves as Vice-Chair. In December 2024, he became Chair of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, which scrutinises the structures for Government decision-making on national security.\nBefore his election, Matt worked for many years in industry, where he specialized in marketing, finance and procurement. He has long been active in the local community, having served as a Warwickshire County Councillor from 2013 to 2018 (he resigned a year after winning the parliamentary seat).\nHe is a long-term resident of Leamington and lives in the heart of the community with his wife, the University of Warwick historian Rebecca Earle. He served as a governor of his local school, Clapham Terrace Community Primary School, and remains a patron or trustee of several local schools, organisations and charities.\nHe is a long time supporter of Arsenal Football Club – something he shares with Keir Starmer – and also attends Leamington FC games when he can.\nHe is a keen sportsman and cyclist and is often out on quiet weekends on Warwickshire’s roads.\nYou can keep up to date with his latest appearances here. You can also follow him on Twitter and Facebook as well as by signing up here for Matt’s email newsletter.",

To fix these services, the Government needs to learn from your experiences and hear your ideas. Your views, experiences and ideas will shape immediate steps and long-term changes in a new 10 Year Health Plan.\nThe views and experiences that you share below will be brought together with what people share on other surveys and other events and will be used to shape the 10 Year Health Plan.\nMatt Western MP’s team will feedback this anonymous information to the 10 Year Health Plan consultation to ensure the views of Warwick, Leamington, Whitnash and the surrounding villages are part of the conversation.The anonymous information will also be shared with local health partners who are developing local plans on how to best deliver healthcare for our communities. This will ensure your voice is heard at both a local and national level.\nYour participation in this survey is completely confidential and your responses will not be linked to your name or any other identifying information.

  "https_mattwestern_org_/http_mattwestern_org_campaign_no-to-new-council-offices/content_2.html": "I am opposing Warwick District Council’s proposals to sell off their Riverside House site for exclusive use of private housing and build new offices on part of the Covent Garden site in Leamington alongside a new multi-storey car park. As a result, there will be no car parking available on the Covent Garden Car Park for at least 20 months.\nThe complete absence of affordable housing in their plans is scandalous. The cost of the project in a time of austerity makes it totally unjustifiable. 800 people rely on Covent Garden Car Park per day. Half of those who use it do so to shop in Leamington Town Centre, while up to 35% of shoppers are from Coventry. The loss of 800 people a day not coming to Leamington will seriously undermine the viability of many Leamington Town Centre businesses.",

We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from persons under 16. If it comes to our attention that we have collected Personal Data from such a person, we may delete this Information without notice. If you have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact matt.western.mp@parliament.uk\nHow long we keep your Information\nWe will keep your Information only for as long as we need to hold it for the purposes set out in this Policy.\nHowever, if required we will be entitled to hold your Information for longer periods in order to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.\nLegal basis for processing your Information\nFrom 25 May 2018, under applicable Data Protection Law we may only process your Information if we have a “legal basis” (i.e. a legally permitted reason) for doing so. We will have a legal basis for processing your Information under this Policy if:\n- you have given us your consent to process your Personal Data (see below); or\n- processing is necessary for the performance of a contract you have entered into (i.e. we need to process your Information in order to provide you with services), or in order to take any preliminary steps that you consider are required before you can enter into such a contract; or\n- processing is necessary to allow us to comply with our legal obligations; or\n- processing is necessary in order to protect your vital interests; or\n- processing is necessary for us to perform tasks that are of public interest or in the exercise of official authority (where applicable); or\n- processing is necessary for our legitimate interests, provided that these legitimate interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights.\nYour consent to processing\nIf you have previously given your consent to the processing of your Information, you may freely withdraw such consent at any time. You can do this by notifying us in writing using our contact details below.\nIf you withdraw your consent, and if we do not have another legal basis for processing your Information (see above), then we will stop processing your Information. If we do have another legal basis for processing your Information then we may continue to do so subject to your legal rights (for which see “Your Rights” below).\nWhere we are unable to rely on consent, we will rely on the performance of a contract with you or compliance with our legal obligations as the basis for processing your Information, unless we consider that processing is necessary for our legitimate interests (e.g. delivery and/or improvement of our services). Marketing is considered separately below.\nHow we use your Information\nWe will use your Information for the following purposes:\n- to help us identify you and any account you hold with us;\n- administration of your account and any services you order from us;\n- to assist us in complying with or enforcing any legal obligations;\n- research, statistical analysis and behavioural analysis;\n- to provide insights based on aggregated, anonymous data collected through the research and analysis referred to above;\n- fraud prevention and detection;\n- billing and order fulfilment;\n- to improve our services; and\n- marketing (see ‘Marketing’ below).\nMarketing\nIf you have not purchased services from us or enquired about purchasing any of our services and if you have given us prior permission, then we will use the Information we hold about you to contact you by email for the purpose of letting you know about our services.

If you prefer not to receive these communications from us, or if you no longer wish to receive them, then you can opt out at any time. We have undertaken a legitimate interests assessment of our marketing practices and we have concluded that legitimate interests is an appropriate basis for those practices, as we consider that it is reasonable to assume that you would expect us to promote our services to you in this manner and that doing so involves relatively little intrusion into your privacy or any disproportionate impact on your fundamental rights; furthermore, because we utilise an email marketing system which allows us to exercise a sophisticated degree of control over your marketing preferences, we do not consider that a less invasive form of processing is available to achieve the same ends.\nYou have the right at any time to ask us to stop processing your Information for marketing purposes. If you wish to exercise this right, you should contact us by sending an email to matt@mattwestern.org giving us enough information to identify you and deal with your request. Alternatively, you can follow the unsubscribe instructions in emails you receive from us.\nSharing Information\nWe may share your Information with:\n- other companies within our group;\n- our suppliers, subcontractors, agents and service providers who help us to provide our services (and we will ensure they have appropriate measures in place to protect your Information);\n- law enforcement agencies in connection with any investigation to help prevent unlawful activity;\n- regulatory bodies, in response to any official request; and\n- if our business is sold or integrated with another business, your Information may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.\nKeeping your Information secure\nWe will use technical and organisational measures in accordance with good industry practice to safeguard your Information.

Such countries may not have similar protections in place regarding protection and use of your Information as those set out in this Policy. Therefore, if we do transfer your Information to countries outside the EEA we will take reasonable steps in accordance with applicable Data Protection Law to ensure adequate protections are in place to protect the security of your Information.\nBy submitting your Information to us in accordance with this Policy you consent to these transfers for the purposes specified in this Policy.\nYour rights\nThis section sets out your legal rights in respect of any of your Personal Data that we are holding and/or processing.

If this is the case we will let you know.\n- You have the right in certain circumstances to request that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data, for example where the Personal Data is inaccurate or where you have objected to the processing (see below).\n- You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you and to have it provided in a structured format suitable for you to be able to transfer it to a different data controller (the ‘right to data portability’). Please note that the right to data portability is only available in some circumstances, for example where the processing is carried out by automated means. If you request the right to data portability and it is not available to you we will let you know.\n- You have the right in certain circumstances to object to processing of your Personal Data. If so, we shall stop processing your Personal Data unless we can demonstrate sufficient and compelling legitimate grounds for continuing the processing which override your own interests.\n- You have the right in certain circumstances not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, for example where a computer algorithm (rather than a person) makes decisions which affect your contractual rights. Please note that this right is not available in all circumstances. If you request this right and it is not available to you we will let you know.\nComplaints\nIf you have any concerns about how we collect or process your Information then you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, which for the UK is the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (‘ICO’).

  "https_mattwestern_org_/https_mattwestern_org_campaign_radford-semele-solar-farm-petition/content_10.html": "On Tuesday, 15th October, developers submitted a planning application for a 212-acre solar farm to be located southeast of Radford Semele, Leamington Spa. The proposal includes the installation of 75,300 solar panels, with a generating capacity of 49.99 megawatts (MW), and a request for a 40-year lease on the site. For further details about the application, you can click here.\nAfter reviewing the plans, meeting with the developers, listening to the concerns of local residents, and consulting with key stakeholders, I believe that Warwick District Council’s planning committee should not approve this application.\nWhile I acknowledge the importance of this project in contributing to the UK Government’s renewable energy goals and addressing the climate crisis, I am concerned that the developers have been misleading and disingenuous in their approach.\nBy signing this petition, you will join me in urging the review and refusal of this proposal to develop a 212-acre solar farm southeast of Radford Semele, Leamington Spa, due to the following concerns:\n- its size, the minor deviance of 0.01MW below the acceptable tolerance stipulated by the Government’s 50MW threshold should not diminish the project’s qualification as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project (NSIP);\n- its scale, the immediacy of 75,300 solar panels to a substantial village;?\n- the cumulative impact of several large-scale solar farms in the local area, government data suggests that 3 additional solar farms, are either operational or being developed within 2 miles of the site;\n- the use of predominantly ‘best’ and ‘most versatile’ agricultural land, which should be protected from such industrial developments;\n- its impact on the recreational amenity of the residents, there are 2 footpaths leading out into the countryside that are valued by local residents;\n- the lack of proper community inclusion in the proposal, planning and consumption of this local energy scheme. In its current form, the proposed solar farm offers little to no benefit to residents who live near the site, such as cheaper energy bills.\nPlease sign the petition below:",

  "https_mattwestern_org_/https_mattwestern_org_news-article_statement-on-the-terminally-ill-adults-end-of-life-bill/content_25.html": "Today, I cast my vote in favour of the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill. Such decisions are difficult and they are binary. Ultimately, they are personal but informed by countless hours over many weeks of discussions with people from all walks of life – legal experts, medical professionals, and individuals with or without lived experience. I have reviewed statistics, read articles, and listened to personal stories – both from supporters and opponents. On balance, I believe it is crucial for this Bill to advance to the next stage in Parliament for thorough consideration.\nFirst and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who reached out to me regarding the Bill. I am deeply honoured that so many of you trusted me to represent your views. Your letters, filled with your experiences, opinions, and thoughts, have been profoundly moving and thought-provoking. I am especially grateful to those who shared personal experiences with me; your trust is invaluable, and I have carefully considered your stories and will continue to hold them in high regard.\nIn principle, I believe in the notion of assisted dying. While I understand and respect that others may disagree with me for whatever reasons, this vote is a matter of conscience that I have been entrusted to make.\nMy vote does not signify unwavering support for the Assisted Dying Bill. Rather, it indicates my support for further exploration and discussion. I believe that assisted dying is an issue that requires deeper consideration. As a nation, we must continue to engage in open and respectful debate, listening to each other and addressing the complexities involved.\nNow the Bill has passed, it will progress through the committee stage, report stage, and third reading in both the Commons and the Lords, followed by Royal Assent. I have been interested and persuaded by the argument put forward by Sir David Natzler, a former Clerk of the House, who has suggested that if the Bill were to pass at second reading, the government could then “seek withdrawal or suspension of further proceedings on the bill in return for a public consultation on the issue.” I would like to see consideration of this, so that extra time can be made available for the remaining stages of the Bill. Additionally, I would like to see the House consider authorising a call for oral or written evidence at the committee stage. Given the gravity of this Bill, it is essential that we allocate as much time and consideration as possible and hear from the widest diversity of voices.\nIn my conversations, I have heard concerns about prognosis, the potential impacts on palliative care, and the implications for the justice system and the NHS. It is important that we fully consider these issues. I strongly support improving palliative care and believe that, if the Bill were to pass, it must coexist with assisted dying. Assisted dying should not be seen as an opposite, but rather as part of a comprehensive approach – alongside palliative care – in determining what the end of life and the choices we face should look like.\nI believe the Terminally ill Adults (End of Life) Bill explicitly outlines those it would cover. The person must have an inevitably progressive illness, disease or medical condition that cannot be reversed by treatment. The title and scope would be legally enshrined, ensuring it cannot be expanded. For this reason, I believe the Bill is absolutely robust and will not lead to a ‘slippery slope.’\nThe substantial merits and impacts of the Bill deserve thorough consideration and assessment. This belief is reflected in my vote, but I respect greatly the views of my colleagues from across the House as I hope you may respect the decision that I have come to. But, as I say, today’s vote will allow further debate and discussion and does not necessarily mean it will make itself into law. Be assured that the stages of parliamentary process – through Bill committee, the Lords and Third Reading – will ensure that the improvements and refinements but Parliament will ultimately decide whether the amended legislation should be added to the statute book.",
  "https_mattwestern_org_/https_mattwestern_org_campaign_stop-east-whitnash-petition/content_45.html": "UPDATE: On Tuesday 16th April, the East Whitnash development was granted planning permission. This is a deeply disappointing update but does not mean we will stop our campaign. We have fought this for 9 years and will continue.\nYou can sign up below to receive updates on our ongoing campaign:\nNine years ago, in 2015, I started my community-focused campaign against the proposed ‘East Whitnash’ housing development, which would create a giant cul-de-sac off Chesterton Gardens – of at least 190 homes, possibly later rising to 500 homes.\nBoth local residents and I knew way back in 2015 that this development wouldn’t serve our communities. It would not provide the type of housing our communities desperately need.\nCritically, it would:\n– NOT provide the necessary infrastructure a development of this size would require such as shops,\n– NOT provide local GP capacity,\n– NOT provide additional NHS Dentistry capacity,\n– NOT provide more classrooms in our schools or\n– NOT be possible for public transport to serve the housing, so adding yet more congestion on already dangerous roads\nNor did it provide the necessary plans for appropriate access roads.\nIn 2023, with the support of local residents, I wrote to Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Housing, demanding he call this application in. This meant the Government called the application in and had to hold an inquiry to further examine the plans. Before they could, the developers withdrew their plans. It was a massive win for the community.\nBut now they are trying again.\nWe defeated the plans before and now we must do it again.\nNext Tuesday 16th April, the developers are bringing the plans back to the Warwick District Council Planning Committee and we must make our case again.\nThe community MUST come first, not the developers. We cannot allow developers to get away with continuously putting forward utterly unsustainable plans which will not serve the community nor those looking to make their home here.\nThese plans would do NOTHING to address the affordability crisis, a very small proportion of the 200+ homes would end up being social rents.\nI know the strength of feeling amongst local residents and will continue to stand by them. Please join us and make your voice heard by signing this petition.\nWe the undersigned:\n- Demand that the ‘East Whitnash’ development is stopped and the planning applications are voted down.",
