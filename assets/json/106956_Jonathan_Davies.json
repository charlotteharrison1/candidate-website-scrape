  "https_jonathan-davies_org_uk_/https_jonathan-davies_org_uk/content_1.html": "After 14 years of Tory government and five prime ministers, it’s hard to see how people’s lives are better.\nNHS waiting lists are at record highs, the roads are in a terrible state, and sewage is routinely dumped in waterways. To cap it all, we have the highest tax burden in over 70 years.\nThis isn’t the Great Britain people deserve.\nOn July 4, you can end the chaos. Vote Jonathan Davies, Labour, for the change we need.\nJonathan has lived in Derbyshire for 13 years and began his career teaching music in schools before going into healthcare regulation.\nWorking closely with NHS and social care providers, he saw how pressured our health care services are. Despite the very best efforts of healthcare professionals, under the Tories, over eight million people are on waiting lists.\nJonathan now serves on several Derbyshire-wide bodies – including for the police and NHS. He wants great public services for everyone – there for us when we need them and delivered with best value for taxpayers.\nA Labour government will deliver economic stability, cut NHS waiting times and recruit 6,500 extra teachers. It will tackle the criminal gangs behind the small boats and put 13,000 more police officers on the beat.\nJonathan is also campaigning to save music in schools. It’s vital, but the Tories are allowing it to slip off the curriculum."
