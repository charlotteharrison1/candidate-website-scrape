A gorgeous day out there and we couldn't have asked for better conditions for our gully cleaning contractors who were out on Hivings Hill, Great Hivings and Asheridge Road this morning. Bucks Council carry out this crucial work in every street in February and March right across the county.\nParking suspension signs go up a couple of days before so if you see them in your road please make sure your cars are moved on the right day. Cars that weren't removed today were given parking tickets by enforcement officers. Also good to see the street cleaning teams out mopping up after the gully team and generally making our streets much tidier. All part of the £110 Million in investment into our highways over the last four years.",

Still one of the most iconic role models for girls and women and a role model for all politicians, especially in a time when so many of them could learn a lesson from her about speaking plain truth and delivering what they promise. Lovely to celebrate with fantastic women, and some lovely men.\nFrom there a quick hop to Westminster to catch up with Greg Smith MP and update him on local election campaigning. Then joined by Mr MacBean so we could attend the 1922 Committee and Enterprise Forums business reception in the Terrace Pavilion and catch up with friends and colleagues. A busy but rewarding day.",

Data Controller\nThe Data Controller is Jane MacBean\n2. Contact\nIf you have any questions about this policy or for more information about how we use your data or would like to exercise any of your rights contact Jane MacBean.\n3. Lawful basis for processing\nAll processing is carried out by consent or either under the legitimate interest of Jane MacBean, or public interest. These cover processing to conduct casework, campaigning and communication. Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data. The Register of Electors that councils provide to authorised persons under the Representation of the People Act is also used for electoral purposes.\n5. Data Security\nPersonal data is stored electronically and securely. We ensure that our service providers comply with the same high standard that we do, and we store our data on the Bluetree servers in the UK.\n6. Special category data\nSpecial category data will be processed under the lawful basis indicated in section 3, as is permitted in clauses 22, 23 and 24 of schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act, covering political parties and elected representatives.\n7. Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Some service providers are located outside of the EEA and therefore it may be necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA. Where the transfer of your data outside of the EEA takes place we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if the data was inside the EEA, and it only occurs with your consent.\nWe will use one of the following safeguards to ensure this:\n• Where the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision determining that a non-EEA country or organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection.\n• A contract is put in place with the recipient of the data obliging them to protect the data to the same standards as the EEA.\nLegally it is not permitted to transfer certain types of data, such as Electoral Register Data, outside of the EEA, and we honour that obligation.\n8. Data retention policy\nPersonal data will be held for no longer than necessary. Some types of data may be held for longer than others. Typically the maximum retention is two election cycles. Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10.

Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11.

You have the right to complain.\n12. Making a complaint\nIf you are unhappy with the way that we have processed or handled your data then you have a right to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).

As she worked her way up from an entry level position to become Commercial Manager of Grenada Media Consumer Products, she attended evening classes to gain her marketing qualifications. These helped her to develop the careers of artists like Tina Turner and Queen and grow household brands including Emmerdale and Thomas the Tank Engine.\nJane, her husband David, and their twin daughters spent several years living in Buffalo in America and New Delhi in India. They returned to the UK and set up their own financial services firm whilst adding the fifth member to their family, their slightly cheeky but much-loved border terrier Charlie.\nIn January 2014 Jane tackled her local opposition Councillors over a persistent flooding problem near her house. After they did nothing effective, she worked with Council officers to solve the issue and was persuaded to stand for Council by her neighbours. She has continued to be a champion for local people who deserve better and the belief that everyone should have a voice has never left her and continues to drive her.\nThat is why Jane is now standing to be the next Member of Parliament for Bishop Auckland. She is passionate about people, places and problem-solving, and is determined to give local people a strong voice, make our communities better for everyone and build on the excellent foundations we have begun to lay since 2019.",

The Bucks Free Press reported that an ANPR camera was being installed but Buckinghamshire Council have actually installed one of the new CCTV cameras that will be going in at various locations across the town over the next few months. This work was expedited after concerns raised by residents at a Town Council meeting and Cllr Joseph Baum and I highlighted the concerns and work of the Water Meadow Action Group to officers.\nANPR cameras record details of vehicles entering and leaving a car park but can't be used for enforcement or prosecution. That is why we have installed CCTV instead. You can see vehicles and people in detail, so we will now be able to identify the vehicles and the numpties who are engaging in anti social or illegal behaviour. The footage will be monitored daily and any images will be passed on to the ASB team and Thames Valley Police who will then carry out checks on the vehicles and take any further action necessary.\nI've seen some of the initial images, which are great, and the detail is amazing. Sadly I can't share them due to privacy issues but rest assured they will prove invaluable. This upgrade has been a long time coming. When we changed from a District to a Unitary council your Chesham Councillors ensured that money ring-fenced for our local CCTV project was rolled over and we will see many more improvements being delivered over the next few months.",
