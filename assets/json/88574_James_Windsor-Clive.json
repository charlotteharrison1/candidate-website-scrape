Based on the new boundaries, James’ campaign was able to reduce Labour’s majority by 138 votes.\nJames’ campaign focussed on rising crime, protecting green spaces, and Labour’s parent tax.\nCommenting on the result, James said:\n“I am happy that the Conservatives have maintained a strong footing in Ealing Central and Acton.\nWe faced a strong campaign from the Lib Dems that we were able to keep at bay by focussing on the issues that mattered to our core vote.\nThank you to all the activists for their immense efforts throughout the campaign”.",
  "https_www_jameswindsorclive_uk_/https_www_jameswindsorclive_uk_news_it-time-councils-embrace-e-bikes-and-scooters/content_2.html": "In 2018, I found myself whizzing around the hilly streets of San Francisco on a rental e-bike efficiently ticking off the various tourist sites. It was an exhilarating experience coasting along Golden Gate Bridge – the wind in my hair – the meerest caresses of the pedal propelling me along. Was this the revolution in intra-city travel we had been looking for? Such musings were promptly cut short as I was told off by a MAMIL – a middle-aged man in lycra – for impeding his speedier progress.\nIn some senses, this encounter encapsulated the response to e-bikes and scooters since their arrival in the UK. Less an innovation to be welcomed, more an additional irritant in our already nuisance-filled cityscape.\nIt remains a hot topic in West London. My neighbouring council, Kensington and Chelsea, has received many complaints about the use of e-bikes and scooters. So much so, they recently called a special summit to discuss their proliferation and how they can be used responsibly.\nUnderstandably, people are frustrated. It is far too common a sight to see an e-bike or scooter strewn across the street in an obstructive manner – an unwelcome obstacle course for the elderly, disabled, or parents with prams. Sometimes they can be found in a green, garish hep – pushed over like dominos by the wind or an impish individual.\nPerhaps – more worryingly – are the individuals who believe it is ok to use e-bikes on the pavement. Hearing the whirr-whirr of the electric pedal motor as they sneak up on pedestrians in a Jaws-like manner, before passing a hair’s breadth from those happily going about their business in a respectful way.\nVandalism is also an issue. I have often found myself silently cursing those who have tried to steal e-bikes by forcing the pedal against the locking mechanism, and breaking it off in the process. Leaving me to pedal lopsidedly with one leg whilst deciding whether I could limp home or go through the hassle of changing bike – probably endangering myself in my distraction.\nLike in many situations, the few are ruining it for the many. Many people are using e-bikes and scooters in the correct manner: obeying the highway code; wearing their own helmet; and parking them in sensible locations. In turn, this mode of transport is quietly revolutionising how people move around cities. How they commute to work. How they visit their friends and family. How they get to their nearest station or bus. A solution to the first and last mile of travel that has long perplexed travel authorities.\nOn paper, it should be an easy win for councils. It is a mode of transport that uses existing infrastructure and requires little investment. It takes strain off overcrowded public transport, whilst also being one of the cleanest and most environmentally friendly ways to travel around our towns and cities.\nThere is a danger that we migth squander this opportunity. I am fearful that we are heading in this direction as negative public sentiment – often led by a vocal minority – leads to overregulation that reduces the positive societal impact that e-bikes and scooters can have.\nWe have already seen this in Europe. Italy has recently imposed strict new rules on e-scooters, requiring users to wear helmets and be insured as well as banning their use in cycle lanes. A more lenient ruling than Madrid and Paris, where rental e-scooters have been banned entirely.\nThis seems like an unnecessary knee-jerk reaction. Councils should work closely with residents and the rental companies to improve the service. Some councils have already mandated the use of parking bays to prevent the additional, unwanted street furniture. Although, this solution does remove some of the flexibility and spontaneity that people find most useful about this mode of transport.\nAn alternative could be dishing out stiff fines for those who park carelessly, something that some of the operators do already. Tougher action should also be taken on those riding on pavements, electric or not, to stamp out the current endemic.\nRental operators also need to play their part. They must educate people about how to responsibly use their e-bikes or scooters. They can incentivise proper parking by offering discounts to leave the bike or scooter in a designated area, where it will not be an obstruction. The companies are embracing new innovations. After leaving a restaurant recently after dinner, I was forced to do a test that measured whether I was in a fit state to ride a bike – fortunately I passed!\nThose who enjoy using rental e-bikes and scooters can help out too. If you are physically able, then it normally takes only a matter of seconds to right a bike or scooter or move it a couple of yards out of the way. Clearing the way for those who might not have the capacity to move it.\nThere is undoubtedly a generation divide which we need to bridge. Like with Boris bikes, the majority of users are under 40. Given the upside these transport options provide in saved time and money, younger people can live with the nuisance elements they bring. For older groups there is mainly only downside to their introduction given the low levels of usage. We must keep it as palatable as possible for the non-users and do everything we can to mitigate their concerns.\nWe are fortunate in London to have a wide-range of options given the population density and affluence. At Conference in Birmingham this year, I thought it would be easy to jump on an e-bike or scooter to cover the 25 minutes between my hotel and the Conference centre. Instead, I found myself using a taxi to get back late at night due to a lack of coverage.\nThis is indicative of the bumpy road that other areas have faced with operators coming and going. An operator pulled out of Manchester a few years ago citing the high levels of vandalism and theft. A Council-led operation has now filled the gap. Similar council initiatives have led to schemes blossoming from Southampton to Liverpool. Councils need to continue to be proactive and support schemes in partnership with operators. It is becoming easier as operators learn from previous mistakes and the contraptions continue to get more robust to deter nefarious users.\nThere will always be challenges introducing new technologies into an established environment. There are countless amusing stories of people parking their new motor cars in inconvenient places in early 1900s London. One gentleman decided to park his car in the middle of Piccadilly Circus, later saying to the police that it was not clear that he could not leave his car there. Others parked on the pavements outside their offices considering them to be like carriage aprons. Unsurprisingly, there were many angry letters to newspapers demanding rules for these new machines.\nWe are in a learning phase with e-bikes and scooters. We need to calmly work through the challenges to make sure they establish a place in the transport mix. It is a two way street. Some relishing the new found freedom; others cursing the increased antisocial behaviour. We should be mindful of both in the ongoing debate.\nLink to original published in Conservative Home on 12th December",

  "https_www_jameswindsorclive_uk_/https_www_jameswindsorclive_uk_about-james/content_8.html": "Early Life\nJames was born in London. His family moved to Oxfordshire, when he was two, seeking a more rural setting surrounded by neighbouring farms. A happy compromise for a father who had grown up amongst the rolling hills of Shropshire and a mother who was more at home roaming the bustling streets of London.\nIt was a happy and carefree childhood, if somewhat traditional. James attended a boarding school in Oxford from the age of 8, before moving to a secondary school in Berkshire.\nHe finished his studies at Newcastle University, reading Economics.\nCareer\nJames’ career began in an orthodox fashion, as a management consultant on Deloitte’s graduate scheme. The intense, project-based work was a fantastic training ground alongside more formal studies to become a chartered management accountant.\nIn 2016, James received the life-changing diagnosis of Stargardt’s Disease, a juvenile form of macular degeneration. It forced him to re-evaluate his career choices and he resolved to do something with a tangible and positive societal impact.\nIn the startup world, he worked for a HealthTech firm providing digital therapy for stroke and dementia patients. A cause close to his heart because his grandmother had suffered with severe dementia. During Covid, he successfully founded his own business to rent outdoor facilities but struggled to scale it.\nEntering the political world, he worked as a researcher for Anthony Browne MP. He spearheaded campaigns on pension and mortgage market reform in conjunction with speech writing and policy research.\nHe currently works in public relations, providing strategic advice to the world’s leading companies and organisations.\nPolitics\nThe Brexit Referendum in 2016 was a pivotal moment, launching James’ politics from the armchair out onto the streets. Since then, James has campaigned on a range of national and local campaigns.\nIn 2022, James stood as a councillor in the Labour-held ward of Fulham Reach. While he was not able to unseat the incumbents, he did beat the local swing.\nIn 2024, James stood as the parliamentary candidate for Ealing Central and Acton. In a tough election for the Conservatives, James was able to reduce Labour’s majority whilst seeing off effective campaigns from the Liberal Democrats and Greens.\nCurrently, James is Vice Chair of his local association and chairs his local ward.\nPersonal Life\nJames lives in West London with his wife, Addy, who grew up in Worcestershire and is always keen to sell a return to the Malvern Hills. James has gently resisted so far!\nJames’ eye condition provides friction in day-to-day life but few barriers. He is still able to work at a computer and drive, but struggles to recognise faces in public settings.\nAway from work and politics, James loves being out in the great British outdoors whether walking along the river or trying to swing something at a ball, whether it is a racquet or a club!",

Their right to make choices over education should not be taken away by Labour. James is very concerned about the effect Labour’s 20% tax would have on hard-working families in Ealing Central and Acton\nEffect on state school sector\nDue to Labour’s tax, many families would no longer be able to make the decision to send their children to private schools. This means a huge number of children would suddenly be entering into the state education sector, which would cause disruption to local schools. It will increase competition for places and could result in larger class sizes.\nIn the general election campaign Emily Thornberry, a Labour spokesperson, said ‘“it would be fine if we have to, in the short term, have larger classes”\nThis really highlights the short-sightedness of Labour’s proposal; there is no plan for where these displaced pupils would go to school.\nThe Conservatives have made fantastic strides in improving educational standards. We have shot up the international league tables in math and science as well as having the best readers in the West. Labour’s policy is a clear threat to our schools and educational standards.",
