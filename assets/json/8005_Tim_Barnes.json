Tim explains\n\"It's the eve of polling day, and I've just finished my final campaigning session here in Abbey Road. We've had sessions in the Cities of London and Westminster throughout the day, in every single one of our wards in Westminster and the City of London, and we've had a fantastic and really positive series of responses. It doesn't mean everybody is going to vote for us.\n\"This isn't a fantasy election of any sort. It does mean that we're finding long-term Conservatives who are still going to support us, people who've been thinking about voting for other parties who've come back to us, and a few people who still have to make up their minds. But overall, it's been a wonderful campaign, and I've really enjoyed it as the candidate, and I'm hoping shortly to enjoy it as the elected Member of Parliament.\n\"The truth is, the things that people have asked about vary. They vary with different areas and regions and with different priorities that many people have. Some people are most interested in the fact that I'm the only candidate who lives in the constituency and of any of the major parties and that I am, therefore, the one who is using the services and experiencing the same things they are.\n\"Some are interested in my track record of delivery from my time as a councillor, and indeed my work in my day job life, where I run a charity or my previous work in universities, and some people are really just interested in talking about the issues and my plans for the area.\n\"The top six issues of crime, housing, transport, investment in our public services, air pollution, trying to build a ladder of opportunity for every one of our residents and other people are interested in issues around foreign affairs and the sort of significant picture issues that are really the domain of Parliament, particularly, my commitment to defence and security, my concerns about the rise of the power of Russia and China and many of those other things that come up in all of the doorstep conversations.\n\"What is true is that people are really engaged. They're looking for reasons to vote for one party or another in an election where nobody has necessarily covered themselves in glory.\n\"And my experience of being able to chat with people on the doorsteps is that we can provide answers and we can provide that reassurance.\n\"So I'm really looking forward to tomorrow as the last day when we'll be trying to get out the vote and trying to find those people who have still yet to make up their minds.\n\"I hope that if you are not one of those if you have made up your mind that you'll be going out to vote, you'll be voting for whoever it is that you want to vote for. Voting is a privilege, and it is something that we should all treasure. So please use your vote on Thursday, the 4th of July, ideally for me.\n\"Thanks very much.\"\nFInd out more about Tim via his website.",
  "https_www_votetimbarnes_org/https_www_votetimbarnes_org_news_episode-3-diary-election-candidate-challenging-labour-e-bikes/content_6.html": "\"It's Saturday morning. Actually Saturday lunchtime now.\n\"And we've been out all over West End Ward today with dozens of supporters talking with residents about all of the issues that they care about.\n\"We've heard from people who have been dismayed by the national Labour government's decision to withdraw the Winter Fuel Payment from quite so many of our older residents.\n\"We've been hearing about local issues, such as the failure, for TfL, controlled by Labour's London Mayor to start a pedicabs consultation, delaying the ultimate introduction of a licensing regime for the sort of lunatic and generally very unhelpful pedicabs by at least a year from when it could have been.\n\"But the big issue has come up really this week, more than anything else, has been about e-bikes and specifically the way in which the rental e-bikes predominantly Lime are being just left and parked everywhere.\n\"We've had an extraordinary double set of comments by the responsible Cabinet Member, Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg, who has really admitted this week two huge issues that that are really occurring.\n\"The first is that there is an agreement with Lime for about 2,000 of their bikes to be in Westminster every day, but they're regularly exceeding that and hitting 3,000. A 50% increase. One thousand more bikes than they should be using, each day.\n\"And that comes on top of the second revelation, which is that the council hasn't actually enforced against Lime in over two years, since August 2022.\n\"It's no wonder that Lime feel that they can do whatever they like, if the council won't take the action that they have the power to do, and they have that power, they've shown it.\n\"They carried out an enforcement action against them in 2022, but they haven't bothered doing so since.\n\"This is mismanagement and this is really letting down residents. Instead, they're complaining that they need more powers, and that makes no sense whatsoever when there has been successful action in the past. So my challenge, in this week's Diary of a Candidate to the Labour Party in Westminster, is simply this:\n\"'Why not at least use the powers that you've got before demanding other new powers?'\"The answer to this can't always be just to give more legislation and more powers to the state, if the state isn't even using the powers that it's got.\n\"Come on, Paul, you can do better.\"",

Tim explains,\n\"Saving my legs for a few minutes as I take the Number 13 bus through the Cities of London and Westminster, from where I've been knocking up this morning, in Fitzrovia, and visiting a couple of our groups who are out and about, and heading back down to the office for a bit of a catch up with the team.\n\"Knocking up is the process that we go through in order to find those people we believe will be voting for us and trying to make sure that they've had a chance to get out today and remind them to vote.\n\"So we're mostly talking with those who are down as might be Conservative voters and those who are going to vote Tim Barnes today, along with a few of those that we haven't had a chance to speak to recent weeks that we think might be interested in doing so.\n\"It's one of the critical stages in the process and making sure that we maximise our vote. And I'm looking forward to seeing what the effects are in sometime in the next 18 hours or so.\"\n\"Thanks very much for everybody supporting us. And this is Diary of a Candidate Part Two for today, where we sort of explain all the different stages that we're going through. I'll be back in touch later on with, the next step.\"",

E-bikes\nHundreds of local people have contacted Tim to express their concerns over the mis-management of e-bikes in central London.\nTim explains,\n\"In March, Nickie Aiken, our outgoing MP, saw years of hard work rewarded with the passing of the Pedicabs Bill, which will see pedicabs regulated across London.\n\"I was delighted to be with her in Parliament to see the final debate. The passing of the Pedicabs Bill shows what a committed local MP can achieve: I am determined to focus on the issues that matter to local people.\n\"I support cycling but mismanagement of e-bike parking by the Labour-led Council is causing chaos on our pavements and roads.\n\"There’s a lot more Westminster Council should be doing to better regulate e-bikes. They brought in just 200 bays for the tens of thousands of e-bike journeys that Westminster sees each day. It’s simple maths that there are not enough spaces in some parts of Westminster given where people want to go. It was never going to be enough. The Labour-run council’s mismanagement created this problem, and they could do more to sort it out.\n\"But if they don’t, I will follow in Nickie’s footsteps and get new legislation to force them to get a grip.\n\"I am keen to hear your experiences about e-bikes, please complete my survey below.\"",

He is the only local candidate of the major parties.\n\"Being local is critical as it means Tim can truly represent us in Parliament. It means Tim uses the same services, walks the same streets, and can truly understand the local issues that need national focus.\n\"I've known Tim for many years. As Leader of Westminster City Council, I made him the Cabinet Member responsible for our schools, libraries and children's services. Tim had a £100 million budget and worked with local people to get the best out of these services.\n\"Tim will make an excellent MP for the Cities of London and Westminster.

  "https_www_votetimbarnes_org/https_www_votetimbarnes_org_news_diary-election-candidate/content_3.html": "I'm standing for the Conservatives in the West End ward by-election on Thursday, 19 September. This is my Diary of a By-Election Candidate.\n\"We're back with Diary of a Candidate with me here in the West End. I wasn’t expecting to necessarily restart this series quite so soon after the general election, barely a month ago. But we now have a by-election in the West End caused by one of the Labour councillors resigning as they were elected to the House of Commons in a general election just six weeks ago.\n\"There are a huge number of issues to get stuck into here based on the failings that Labour really has had since they controlled Westminster City Council two years ago. And, with the Mayor of London, they've combined to really drop the ball on a variety of issues. They failed to take advantage of the legislation that the Conservatives campaigned for and successfully achieved to help regulate and license pedicabs.\n\"They brought in their own rules in Westminster for e-bikes, in assembling huge pools of e-bikes without them necessarily being in any way better managed. As a result, they are clogging up roads and pavements everywhere. Certainly, in the West End, we've seen a drop in some of the standards and the regularity of rubbish collection. There are issues to do with street lighting that hasn't been put into place and promised CCTV that hasn't been delivered, that have all contributed to crime.\n\"And much in the same way as the Mayor of London has increased the salaries of his senior advisers, we saw the Labour group on the council increase their allowances for their elected members, but in both cases with no appreciable sense of improvement in services. In fact, all the services have gone backwards. The Mayor has failed to, start the number of affordable homes that he needs to, he needs about 3,000 a quarter.\n\"And in the last quarter, he only delivered 150. We've seen the Met Police, so another thing, the Mayor is responsible for, recently graded by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary as inadequate when it comes to investigating crime. Surely the most fundamental element of policing! And so wherever you look, we're seeing Labour pushing up costs, paying more to public sector workers, which isn’t in itself necessarily a bad thing.\n\"But it is when there's no improvement of standards, and there's no improvement of what can be delivered. It's exactly the same with the national government. and the train drivers strike. Some of the junior doctors, all of the things that were being campaigned for to improve the quality of services and the ability to deliver public services effectively and efficiently, have all been thrown out of the window.\n\"They just given them the money, pushed up the costs, and things aren't getting any better. So that's why I'm standing in the West End this time round. I want to represent the people here, and I want to make sure that there is a voice that is able to say to Labour at every level, at the council level, at the mayor’s level, at the government level, that this isn't good enough and that we need to improve things.\n\"That's why I hope you'll vote for Tim Barnes on Thursday, 19 September. Thanks, everybody.\"",

And on this first Tuesday evening after the bank holiday, where a few more people are back and things are getting a little bit busy, I'm doing exactly that, with a double booking of events.\n\"I just had a nice meeting with the Exec from the Soho Society. I'd like to thank them for inviting me along, to have a chance to chat with them and answer a couple of their questions.\n\"And I'm now off to do a campaigning session in the Mayfair side of the ward, where we will be delivering a message to potential postal voters, and some of our other key audiences.\n\"This is what it is to be a candidate. There's a really interesting piece, in the Guardian over the last couple of days, about a Labour candidate, who became a councillor a couple of years ago and has recently resigned, on the grounds that they didn't really think that this is what the life of a councillor should be.\n\"I’ve been a councillor before. I know what the life is like. I know what it's possible to do and what it's not possible to do.\n\"But I'm really hoping that I'll have another chance to be able to deliver for local residents, from that base of experience, and with that commitment to the West End ward, the area I'm proud to live in and call home.\"",
