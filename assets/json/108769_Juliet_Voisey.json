  "https_stalbans_greenparty_org_uk_/https_stalbans_greenparty_org_uk_2024_10_29_greens-oppose-local-plan/content_12.html": "Green and Independent councillors have voted against the draft Local Plan at a meeting of St Albans Council. The overall result of the vote was that it was passed, due to the large majority of Lib Dem councillors.\nSt Albans urgently needs a local plan. A robust and bold one that secures sustainable, well-built housing for future generations and those waiting on housing lists.\nDoes the current plan deliver that? There’s plenty of talk about sustainability and biodiversity, but will it stand up to the changes from climate change? If we must build on greenbelt land, we have to get it right. Greenbelt land provides carbon sequestration, flood mitigation, wildlife habitats, and food crops.\nWe need to build fully sustainable, gas-free homes to protect people from energy price spikes. Let’s give people homes of the future – warm, cheap to run, powered by renewable technologies – that won’t need retrofitting later because we didn’t commit to the best we can build.\nWe also need better commitment and service from public transport companies. Car usage here is higher than average, and the local plan does little to address it. Walking and cycling are promoted, but we need reliable, frequent buses to get around. Redbourn has no rail access, poor bus service, and yet is earmarked for major development. Air quality is already an issue, with rising asthma rates, especially in children.\nThe Environment Agency’s report on the plan raises concerns about our water quality and efficiency – we use more water per capita than the national average. The sewage plant that serves St Albans is at capacity and regularly discharges into the River Ver – a river we’re trying to revitalise. Thames Water has had little input, and the plan leaves it to developers to liaise with them. How will the sewage plant cope with all the sites listed in the plan?\nThe plan includes flood-risk sites and says the risk will be mitigated. Given our current rainfall levels, careful planning is essential. It also includes a meadow with rare, protected species and an ancient monument. The number of houses on this site has already been reduced because it’s so restrictive, and the Greenbelt Review suggests there are too many complications to include it. How can houses be built here when we can’t plant trees in Verulamium Park because of ancient monuments?\nThe local plan should commit to a sustainable future for St Albans.",

  "https_stalbans_greenparty_org_uk_/https_stalbans_greenparty_org_uk_2025_03_09_greens-raise-alarm-on-lack-of-climate-action-at-council/content_10.html": "Councillor Simon Grover, leader of the Green & Independent group on St Albans District Council, has highlighted serious concerns about the Council’s commitment to tackling the climate emergency in a speech delivered at the budget-setting meeting of the Council.\nWhile acknowledging some positive changes resulting from committee scrutiny, Cllr Grover expressed alarm over several issues, including growing budget gaps for future years, low reserves, service reductions (including public toilet closures and cuts to community grants), and insensitive implementation of increased charges that fail to consider vulnerable residents.\nCllr Grover particularly emphasized the disappointing progress on what was previously described as the administration’s “top priority” – fighting the climate emergency.\nCiting a timely report from the Climate Change Committee published on February 26th, Cllr Grover noted that local government climate action remains “inconsistent and hindered by a lack of clarity on responsibilities, limited resources, and short-term funding” – a description that aptly characterizes St Albans’ situation.\nKey Areas of Concern\nDespite St Albans District Council pledging to reach net zero by 2030, critical areas of emissions reduction remain neglected:\n- Transport: As the district’s largest source of emissions (36% of the total carbon footprint), road transport emissions have barely decreased in over a decade. The Climate Emergency UK scorecard gave St Albans a concerning 3% rating for transport actions, reflecting a continued prioritization of road traffic over sustainable transport, failure to implement comprehensive cycling infrastructure, and unreliable public transport.\n- Home Energy Efficiency: Over half of St Albans homes remain rated EPC D or lower, with 11,500 homes lacking adequate loft insulation and 12,400 needing cavity wall insulation. At the current pace, retrofitting the district’s housing stock will take decades, despite Friends of the Earth advising that at least 4,000 homes per year need insulation upgrades to meet targets.\n- Heating: Progress on decarbonizing heating systems is particularly poor, with only around 240 heat pumps installed district-wide. The councillor called for investment in mass heat pump rollout and district heating schemes instead of continuing reliance on outdated, polluting gas systems.\n- Planning Policy: The district’s planning framework received just 9% in the Climate Emergency UK rating for planning and land use, reflecting years without serious policies to mandate energy-efficient new builds, support renewables, or integrate low-carbon transport into development plans.\nNot on Track for 2030 Target\nSimon emphasized that St Albans is not on track to meet its Net Zero 2030 pledge, which required a 64% reduction in emissions by 2024/25. After five years, the council is already two years behind on aims to reduce corporate greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe current sustainability and climate crisis strategy was criticized for lacking urgency and measurable objectives, with emissions reductions so far largely coming from national energy grid decarbonization rather than bold local policies.\nGreens have urged immediate prioritization of transport reform, home retrofitting, clean heating, and climate-conscious planning, warning that further delays will result in failure to meet the net zero commitment.",
  "https_stalbans_greenparty_org_uk_/https_stalbans_greenparty_org_uk_2025_03_19_matt-fisher-campaigns-on-ev-charging/content_4.html": "St Albans councillor Matt Fisher has launched a new campaign to push for cross-pavement electric vehicle (EV) charging for residents who rely on on-street parking.\nCllr Fisher is inviting residents to sign an open letter to Hertfordshire County Council, highlighting the urgent need for accessible, sustainable, and convenient charging solutions to support the increasing number of EV owners in our community. Many people want to switch to electric vehicles, but without off-street parking, they have no easy way to charge. The council must act to remove this barrier.\nThe case for cross-pavement EV charging:\n- Better access – Thousands of residents depend on street parking. Without a way to charge at home, many are locked out of the EV transition. The Council could identify safe cross-pavement charging that would provide a practical fix.\n- Environmental benefits – A lack of charging options forces people to keep using petrol and diesel cars. Supporting home charging will accelerate the shift to cleaner transport and cut emissions.\n- Economic boost – Encouraging EV adoption will create demand for charging infrastructure, leading to local job creation and investment in green technology.\n- Community support – Residents, environmental groups, and industry experts back this idea, recognising the need for sustainable transport solutions.\nCllr Matt Fisher commented:\n“Introducing cross-pavement EV charging is a crucial step in making electric vehicles accessible to more residents. This initiative not only supports our environmental goals but also enhances the well-being of our community. We strongly urge Hertfordshire County Council to consider this proposal and take meaningful steps toward a greener, more sustainable future.”\nThe Green Party encourages all residents with on-street parking to sign the open letter and support the call for safe, viable options for cross-pavement EV charging. Together, we can make a lasting impact on our environment and pave the way for a cleaner, greener future.",

This work complements our ongoing collaboration with the local swift group, where we support installation days throughout St Albans to protect these important birds.\nWaste reduction features prominently in our agenda: we’re looking at opportunities to improve facilities at the local recycling centre, including improvements to the existing shop and expanded recycling options for items such as coffee pods and ink cartridges.

By allowing planning officers to approve developments without councillors’ input, it sidelines local communities and prioritises profit-driven developers over genuine need. In St Albans, this approach risks creating more high-cost, car-dependent homes that fail to address our affordability crisis.\nGrey belt is not a solution\nThe so-called “grey belt” offers no real solution to land shortages in St Albans. Sites such as quarries, car parks and golf courses are limited and often unsuitable for housing. This definition doesn’t magically create viable land – it simply opens the door to inappropriate and environmentally damaging developments. In a district already under pressure, this could lead to conflict between competing priorities like green space preservation, food security, and nature recovery.\nChanges make planning harder\nRather than working to the Council’s advantage, these changes will make things harder. By bypassing local decision-making, they risk imposing poorly planned developments that fail to meet community needs.\nThousands of approved homes remain unbuilt\nThere are already thousands of unbuilt homes nationwide with planning permission, yet the government ignores this bottleneck, blaming councils instead. The new targets will impose inappropriate developments on our green spaces while neglecting vital infrastructure like GP surgeries, schools, and public transport.\nWe need homes that meet local needs\nSt Albans needs the right homes in the right places – high-quality, affordable social housing that meets local needs and adheres to strict environmental standards. Developers must be held accountable for delivering these homes while contributing to essential services, not just profits.\nThe government’s framing of this as a battle between “builders and blockers” is an insult to residents who understand the need for balance – protecting nature and ensuring food security alongside meeting housing demand. Green councillors in St Albans will continue to fight for truly affordable, sustainable housing while opposing damaging developments that threaten our environment and community wellbeing.\nLocal democracy must not be bulldozed.",

I have heard other councillors say they don’t like it, yet we are not telling the government that. We should be clear that we are not convinced that any benefits that have been proposed by the government outweigh the huge disadvantages.\n“Those disadvantages are numerous. First, there’s the whole question of whether the reorganisation will save any money at all. Nobody really knows. Second, we know that residents will be against this. Any polling that’s been done has shown that residents are against bigger councils, because they understand the value of local representation. Undoubtedly, it reduces democracy, that’s just an objective fact\n“Third, there will be huge transition costs for both local government and national government at a time when there is no money in the pot. Yet suddenly we can supposedly afford a multi-billion pound pointless transformation for local government. Then there is the massive amount of work involved for our officers and the civil service, which means they can’t be doing other things, which should be higher priority.\n“We’ve seen that other councils around the country are coming out and explicitly saying that they oppose this proposal. Doing so is not radical – it’s a perfectly reasonable response to a white paper that affects us as a council.\n“We need to stand up and be counted and have our voice heard on this. We need to say to the minister that this council is opposed to these proposals, at the very least in their current form.”"
