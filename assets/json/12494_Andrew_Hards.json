At that time, she stated the costs would be around £500,000 so it is pleasing to find that the vast majority of trees on this street can now be saved at no extra cost to the council.\n“It is a pity that so much time and money had to be spent on this issue by the campaigners, by the Independent Tree Panel, by the Scrutiny committee and its working group, to get to the point where Amey just has to carry out ordinary street repairs.\n“Of course, if the Western Rd trees can be retained, there is absolutely no reason why hundreds of other, equally healthy trees should not be saved too. Once again, we see the Labour Administration determined to play politics with our environment.\n“Campaigners have been calling for a sustainable tree management strategy for years now. Other councils successfully manage their urban trees responsibly – why can’t Sheffield?”\nCampaigners for the Western Road trees include 83-year-old ex-serviceman Roy Millington, who has become a familiar sight on the Town Hall steps in his campaign for the trees to be maintained as a fitting memorial.\nCllr Rob Murphy, Speaker for the Sheffield Green and member of the Western Rd Working Group, added,\n“This new information directly contradicts what was said during the scrutiny process and in the December 2017 Cabinet report. Questions need to be answered about the statements given by officers at that time. Since then, the contract target for felling 17,500 street trees has been revealed to the public.”\nNotes\n- The trees on Western Rd were originally planted as memorials to commemorate the boys of the adjacent school who had died in the First World War. Other war memorial trees were planted on Tay St and Oxford St (to commemorate boys from Crookesmoor School) and on Binfield Rd.\n- Sheffield City Council originally proposed to fell 23 of these trees under its Streets Ahead private finance programme. Of these, 20 were agreed to be healthy mature trees.\n- The Council rejected all the Independent Tree Panel’s recommendations to keep certain trees.\n- Cabinet on 13th December 2017 received a report from the Scrutiny committee’s working group on War Memorial trees but decided to continue with the fellings, with Cllr Julie Dore saying, “it will cost around £500,000 of work to carry out engineering solutions.”\n- The new information show proposal to save the 20 healthy trees using the engineering solutions specified in the Streets Ahead contract. The proposals consist of tarmacking around 16 trees and enlarging some of the tree pits. These solutions are within the contract and therefore come at no extra cost to the council. For four trees, the plan is to construct build-outs into the street, which does require additional spending.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

I very much welcome this, even if the details aren’t yet clear. I suspect it won’t be straightforward as blocks of flats come in all shapes and sizes.\nPlease look out for changed bin collection days over Christmas – some are earlier; some are later.

Over 75% of people responding to the consultation backed these proposals, so it is a popular initiative as well as one that promotes highways safety. If this trial is successful there is a real opportunity to extend these enforcement powers across the whole city and that is something I and my Green colleagues would very much support. ”",

Carbon Trading, Carbon Markets, Nature Based Solutions, have been built in to any actions, and all these do is allow the polluter to carry on polluting while indigenous communities experience land, ocean and forest grabs, and subject to dangerous geoengineering experiments.

However, this cannot be allowed at the expense of quality. Poorly designed and built housing with no balconies or green space not only impacts residents’ mental health and well-being, but diminishes the character of the areas in which they are constructed.\nElecting more Greens in May would allow us to push for full adoption of South Yorkshire’s own housing standards; currently only used as ‘guidelines’.

The previous Labour mayor, Dan Jarvis, massively underachieved in building, or even protecting public transport infrastructure.\nIn Hillsborough, the frequent and well-used 52A service now goes no further than Hillsborough Interchange. It has been replaced by the unreliable, hourly, 31 through to Wisewood and Loxley with no evening or Sunday service. Similar changes have happened to many services across Sheffield and South Yorkshire damaging the economy and people’s lives.\nNow, with South Yorkshire’s Bus Services Improvement Plan receiving no government funding in 2022, there’s not only a huge public transport funding gap between the South and the North. There’s a growing divide between northern regions too and South Yorkshire faces yet more cuts.\nLessons can be learnt from other councils to help fund public transport. A workplace parking levy in Nottingham has raised almost £90 million over the last 10 years which has been re-invested into sustainable transport across the city. Green Party proposals to explore this in Sheffield continue to be blocked by Labour and Lib Dem councillors.\nWe must get buses back under local control. Dan Jarvis dithered before finally starting the legal process in March 2022, the last month of his 4-year term. Greater Manchester begins to get services back into public control this September. It’s going to take time in South Yorkshire and the Mayor must work hard to secure the funding needed for a successful transition when it finally happens.\nThe Tory government has created an appalling system that pits regions against each other. It causes great economic and social problems for those areas that lose out. We have no choice but to radically improve the quality of our funding bids and negotiation skills with the Government. But we also need to reverse a decade of tax cuts for the rich to properly fund all public services, including a public transport system in meltdown.\nFind out more about the Green Party’s vision for transport in Sheffield and South Yorkshire here www.getsheffieldmoving.org\nCouncillor Toby Mallinson, Hillsborough Ward Green Party",

Councillor Johnson said,\n“Just putting a bit of insulation in the roof or walls is not going to deliver the sort of savings we need to take tenants out of fuel poverty permanently. We need a whole house approach which can be delivered quickly with significant and substantial reductions in energy demand while delivering warm homes that are cheap to heat”.\nThe Green Group of Councillors on Sheffield City Council has been researching cutting edge, best practice from around the country and propose to use the Energiesprong method (developed in Holland) where whole wall and roof components complete with solar panels are produced, made to measure, in factories and installed in little more than a day. This approach is being developed by a consortium of councils including Nottingham, Exeter and a number of London boroughs who are all part of the Retrofit Accelerator Homes Innovation Partnership.\n“Not only will this benefit tenants in terms of reduced bills but also presents the prospect of establishing a new manufacturing facility, with new skilled green jobs, in Sheffield, for assembly of the components, if we can generate enough work to justify the investment.” Said Councillor Johnson.\nThe finance model for Energiesprong produces savings for the council in maintenance, replacement and servicing costs of council homes. In addition, tenants will have to pay a comfort charge which is guaranteed to be less than the cost of the energy that the householder saves off their fuel bills.\nCouncillor Johnson said,\n“Not only does this approach stack up financially for the householder and the Council it also makes often tired and outdated housing look new and up to date. It is effectively a new home for the tenants who live there”\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson went down to Nottingham earlier this week to look at both completed work on some of the improved homes and work in progress.\n“It was impressive seeing how different the houses looked and we heard how satisfied tenants were with the work carried out. If we can develop this approach to dealing with the problems of council homes and build the capacity and capability to deliver this work at scale then we have the very real prospect of being able to offer this approach to help improve the homes of owner occupiers and private rented dwellings in Sheffield.”\nAt the Cooperative Executive meeting Councillor Johnson said,\n“At the next Full Council meeting I will be submitting an amendment to the Housing Revenue Account detailing this proposal to allow all members to see the detail of what is involved and the real benefits of this scheme.”\n(Picture of Councillor Douglas Johnson visiting properties improved to the Energiesprong standard in Nottingham)",

The Green’s plan would scrap Universal Credit and the cruel benefit sanctions regime, which push people further into poverty and destitution.\nThe plan would eliminate the cruelty of the current benefits system and liberate people from the anxiety of job insecurity. The Conservative Government has targeted and demonised people who face unemployment, disability and low incomes while making the rich even richer. The switch to Universal Credit and unfair benefit sanctions have caused huge suffering for so many people. A basic income would be available to everyone as a right and would not be removed when you get a job. There will be additional payments for groups of people who experience barriers to working, including disabled people, single parents and people of pension age.\nThe Greens support a £15 per hour minimum wage and are supporting Trade Unions in their struggles for fair pay increases at least in line with inflation.\nThe Greens want a new emergency tax package which will see both polluters and the richest pay their fair share to enable a nationwide insulation and renewable energy programme that will provide people with warmer, more comfortable homes, bring bills down permanently and reduce inequality.\nThe package includes a wealth tax on the richest 1% of households, raising at least £70 billion, alongside closing the loopholes in the Conservatives’ windfall tax on oil and gas companies and backdating it to January 2022.

"Amendment to be moved by Councillor Douglas Johnson, seconded by\nCouncillor Angela Argenzio\nThat the Motion to approve the recommendations of the Strategy and Resources\nPolicy Committee at its meeting held on 21 February 2023, as relates to the City\nCouncil’s Revenue Budget and Capital Programme 2023/24, be amended by the\nsubstitution of the following resolution:-\nRESOLVED: That this Council:-\n(1) understands this is one of the most challenging budget situations ever, with\na total budget gap to be filled of £80m, even after a decade of government\ncutbacks on essential council services;\n(2) believes that the committee system, together with the Council being in no\noverall control, has played a very positive role in making parties work together\nto agree the vast majority of the Council’s budget this year, as noted in the\npeer review;\n(3) notes that the bulk of the core budget was agreed between all party groups\nby December 2022, something that has not previously been achieved;\n(4) conveys its gratitude to all this Council’s direct and indirect workforce, as well\nas its partners in the voluntary, community, faith and commercial sectors, for\ntheir actions in making Sheffield a better place in the face of the huge\nfinancial challenges that have had an impact on everyone in the workforce\nand in the city over the last decade;\n(5) believes that austerity was a political choice made by the bigger political\nparties and that the massive government intervention to address Covid\ndemonstrates how the money is available if the political will is there;\n(6) believes that, instead of cuts to public services, real investment is\ndesperately needed to address inequality and urgently decarbonise our\ncountry to address the climate and nature emergency, which is an existential\nthreat described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as\n‘Code Red for Humanity’ and is already affecting food supply and causing\nextreme weather events, in particular in the Global South;\n(7) believes, however, that long-term, outsourced contracts with big private\nbusinesses have not taken an equivalent share of the cuts to Council services\nover the last 12 years; and that long-term costs of finance stretch into\nSheffield’s future until 2057;\n(8) therefore, believes it is the duty of all elected members to take on the\nresponsibility of running this Council in the best interests of Sheffield’s\nresidents, prioritising the available resources to protect communities and the\nmost vulnerable, and working towards a more equitable and resilient city;\n(9) welcomes the all-party agreement on the financial proposals for the Housing\nRevenue Account, as voted on unanimously at Full Council on 20 February\n2023;\n(10) welcomes this year’s new approach to recognising the need for structural\nchange and the allocation of £4.3 million revenue funding for a\nTransformation Investment Budget;\n(11) notes that in line with the decision of Strategy and Resources Policy\nCommittee this funding is for the 2023/24 Delivery Programme to ensure in\nyear budget delivery and covering many of the Council’s services to ensure\nthat the changes required for that purpose are delivered in a consistent and\ncoherent way and the 2023/24 Design Programme which is developing the\nwork that will need to be done over the subsequent few years to deliver the\nCouncil’s longer term ambition;\n(12) believes that in line with those purposes and having sufficiently secured\ndelivery of the Business Improvement Plans, then to ensure the long-term\nrevenue and financial stability options should be considered to promote:-\n(a) substantial investment in the city’s transport through an Employers\nWorkplace Parking Levy\n(b) methods to address health, warm homes and the cost of living through\nlarge-scale housing retrofitting and energy generation schemes\n(c) recognition of the importance of local authority ecology work in view\nof the Nature Emergency and new and forthcoming duties under the\nEnvironment Act 2021, together with the prospects of generating\nrevenue by promoting the natural assets uniquely available to the\ncouncil;\n(d) developing a model of community care co-operatives to reduce\nreliance on profit-making staffing agencies by removing the profit\nmotive from the care sector;\n(e) improved services to householders, such as gardening, household\nrepairs, heating system servicing and replacement and retrofit works,\nthrough a model like Oxford Direct Services, which could provide\nservices that local people need and value whilst also providing a\nuseful income stream for the Council;\n(f) external training and support to promote the use of Plain English in\ncouncil reports, thus aiding effective decision-making and monitoring\n(g) external experts to commission a review of the use of Equality Impact\nAssessments;\n(13) believes that the principle of encouraging renewable energy generation\nmeans the council should develop a climate- and inflation-beating offer to\nhouseholders and will therefore carry out a feasibility study into providing a\nsolar panel offer to owner-occupiers and private landlords to unlock the city’s\nprivate capital in a significant contribution to tackling climate change;\n(14) in order to take advantage of new and innovative technologies, will carry out\na feasibility study into the newly developed “electric wallpaper” using\ngraphene for more effective space heating of our tenants’ homes;\n(15) recognises that promoting safe and affordable walking, cycling and public\ntransport over private car use is critical to both the climate emergency and\nthe deep-rooted inequality in our city;\n(16) therefore, will provide funds to revitalise the former Walking Forum (including\nupdating the website) and shape it in order to make Sheffield an Active Travel\ncity;\n(17) will support the school streets initiative and especially those where parents\ntake part in staffing the street closures to make their children safe, by\nproviding camera enforcement at 4 schools;\n(18) will act on regular complaints of illegal and dangerous parking by creating 6\nnew jobs in parking enforcement;\n(19) recognises that many more people would cycle if they had somewhere\nsecure to keep a bike and will therefore begin an annual programme of\ninvesting in secure cycle storage in residential areas, beginning on the\ncouncil’s own housing estate;\n(20) wishes to promote the uptake of public transport and will therefore subsidise\nfree buses and trams on both Saturdays and Sundays in the 4 weeks running\nup to Christmas;\n(21) will increase parking fees in order to fund these improvements;\n(22) will develop proposals to introduce a workplace parking levy for larger\nemployers, in order to generate additional long-term revenue to invest in the\ncity’s public transport, whilst improving air quality and encouraging more\nactive forms of travel to work, noting that the smaller city of Nottingham raises\n£9 million a year to invest in public transport improvements, active travel and\ngrants to businesses;\n(23) welcomes the take-up of the e-cargo bikes promoted in the Green Group’s\nearlier budget proposals and the development of a zero-emission last-mile\ndistribution hub, and will seek to expand this idea through working up further\nideas to create to allow the Council, businesses and organisations to deliver\ngoods around the city in a cleaner, quieter, more sustainable way;\n(24) recognises the need to address congestion, blocked pavements and access\ncaused by home deliveries, taxis and street clutter and so will commission an\ninvestigation into finding solutions that will benefit residents and businesses\nalike;\n(25) recognises the importance of expert ecologists in the local authority and will\ntherefore invest in a further post of a leading ecologist to drive forward the\ncouncil’s work in this area;\n(26) will initiate a feasibility study to develop a tree nursery, hence supporting our\nlong-term growing programme, helping address the ecological emergency\nand being a potential source of future income to the Council;\n(27) will reallocate the funding for so-called “green” electricity into a skills and\ntraining programme to train a new generation of apprentices in skills for the\nfuture such as renewable energy, installing solar panels and heat pumps;\n(28) recognises the benefits of locally produced energy and will therefore commit\nto the initial work to investigate the potential for a large-scale solar farm,\nincluding looking at locations such as park and rides;\n(29) recognises that the school pupils of today are the citizens of tomorrow and\nthat a demonstration of renewable technologies should be provided for\nmaintained schools in Sheffield to give them hope for the future, showing\nthem that renewable energy helps power their school, be it from wind, solar\nor other renewables;\n(30) therefore, will promote energy efficiency schemes and renewable generation\nin maintained schools with £500,000, making this a positive for learning as\nwell as providing a source of sustainable energy;\n(31) will set aside an additional £500,000 to create a Carbon Reduction\nInvestment Fund, to complete new sustainability projects that reduce carbon\nconsumption in order to avoid unnecessary delay in achieving our 2030 net\ncarbon zero target;\n(32) recognises the power of local councillors being able to support their\ncommunities with relatively small sums of local spending and therefore will\nincrease ward pot sums, for this year, by an average of £10,000 per ward,\nbut allocated in proportion to levels of social deprivation;\n(33) will also create a Parks Safety Improvements Fund for improvements such\nas new lighting, to enable all, especially women and marginalised groups, to\nfeel safer to use parks during winter and evenings, such funds to be spent\nfollowing open consultation;\n(34) recognises growing concern about the negative impact of alcohol abuse on\nphysical health, mental health and on crime levels and violence, so supports\na feasibility study into introducing a night-time levy on licensed premises to\nprovide support on alcohol recovery and addressing addiction;\n(35) welcomes the increase of the Council Tax Hardship Fund, in line with\nprevious Green Group budget amendment proposals, together with the\ntripling of the hardship fund available in the Housing Revenue Account;\n(36) furthermore, will directly tackle the impact of the cost-of-living crisis by\nproviding additional £200,000 funding to Citizens’ Advice for this financial\nyear;\n(37) therefore requests the Interim Director of Finance and Commercial Services\nto implement the City Council’s Revenue Budget and Capital Programme\n2023/24 in accordance with the details set out in the reports on the Revenue\nBudget and Capital Programme now submitted.\nReferences\n2023 Sheffield city Council Budget Amendments (Public Pack)Budget Motion and Amendments 1 March

Their Transport team were at a recent Kelham Island Community Alliance (KICA) meeting to answer questions. Residents told them that this would worsen air pollution which already breaches maximum legal limits in the area. The plans bring no real benefit to residents of the area who will have to put up with more traffic.\nMany studies have shown that widening roads just increases traffic so they are still congested. At the same time, tram services are to be run less frequently from January because of the increase in cars on the road.\nSheffield Green Party is calling for a hold on the project and review of these proposals to find long term solutions that will actually reduce congestion and not make air pollution worse in and around the city centre.\nPeople urgently need better public transport and safer cycling and walking options so they can choose to leave their cars at home.

Unfortunately, our current way of living is heading us in that direction as climate change and nature depletion will lead to food and energy shortages, civil unrest, wars, and eventually the collapse of our civilisation if we do not urgently change course.\nOur focus is not to campaign for a change in individual lifestyles but rather we need Governments and Corporations to change the system so it is easier for all of us to do the right thing for the planet. We have a vision for a much better society, where public transport is so good people prefer not to have a car, where everybody has a secure income to meet their needs, where schools are communities of learning, not exam factories, where agricultural land currently used to grow crops for livestock can be rewilded to save nature that is currently so threatened, where rich individuals and corporations pay a fair rate of tax to contribute to society.\nTo take his individual points, no, driving a car is not a shameful act. Our whole society has been built around car ownership and with public transport currently being cut even further, we acknowledge many people would currently find life impossible without a car.\nBut car use is a major contributor of greenhouse gases so we need Government to urgently improve the alternatives, with massive investment in public transport, including making this accessible for disabled people. Reclaiming streets for children to play in and cyclists and pedestrians to walk in leads to far healthier communities.\nThe way we heat our homes also has to change if we are to reach net zero emissions. Again it is the Government that needs to act to facilitate this. First priority should be a national street-by-street insulation programme because the cheapest bill is the one you don’t have to pay. Secondly, the Government must provide generous incentives to convert homes to heat pumps which are currently unaffordable for most people.\nMeat eating too is a major source of emissions and the country does need to move to a more balanced diet. Education and school dinners need to play a major role in helping this transition.\nIn a recent Jeremy Vine show sausage expert Mike Perry declared a vegan sausage delicious. He said he could taste the meatiness, it was luscious and lovely and tasted like the one he had this morning! So there are now plenty of good alternatives to meat for people to try.\nYours sincerely\nAsh Routh\nWalkley Green Party",

Shamefully both the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives failed to provide a speaker despite being invited.\nHere is a transcript of the initial part of the debate.\nChair Nigel Slack\nIntroductions\nCraig Gamble Pugh Labour\nBiggest issue facing us is the Climate and Nature Emergency-astonished only 2 candidates have shown up.\nInvolved in SYCA-Chair of board for some time- but tonight only speaking for Labour Party. No longer debating if there is a crisis. Goal to be net zero city by 2030. Debate now about how we achieve that. Debate is about who is best placed to tackle the climate emergency. Labour has it at the heart of everything they do in the city. Parties that haven’t shown up are not addressing the issue. National Government presiding over crises of their own manufacturing. Sleaze and economic collapse. Not the climate and ecological emergency. When we have a national Government who are ripping us all off –mega profits from fossil-based energy at over-inflated prices have no incentive to change to clean renewable energy. The government literally pumping effluent into rivers and waterways. They are not going to be part of the solution, they are part of the problem. Lib Dems have made themselves irrelevant on all fronts. Labour Party’s purpose is to achieve fairness. Social and Economic Justice so we have a society and an economy that caters for everybody, where nobody is left behind. With the impact of climate change already hitting there is no social and economic justice to be had unless it goes hand in hand with environmental justice. The Labour Party can no longer do the job it was established to do and strived to do over many decades unless tackling the Climate and Nature Emergency is at the heart of everything we do. It is crucial to Labour’s purpose of being\nAlexi Dimond Green Party\nThe climate emergency is the biggest issue facing us today. All of our futures are at stake. The climate emergency is the reason I decided to stand for election in 2021 and become a Councillor on Sheffield City Council, to try and get the Council to take the action we need to take if we are to have any chance of a future. Since I’ve been elected and been on the Council what I’ve found is it’s been very frustrating in terms of trying to get the Council to adopt the policies that we know are necessary if we are to become net zero by 2030 if we are going to tackle the biodiversity emergency in Sheffield and I think what has been lacking the political will by the other parties, the established parties in Sheffield, so I’m here to convince you why you need Greens in the room on Sheffield City Council if we are to have any hope of tackling the climate emergency locally. On every issue, it has been a struggle. We’ve faced kickbacks on what might seem like the smallest changes to get over the line. It has been a real frustration. I hope we are going to speak today about those local issues, the things that we can take action on, locally in Sheffield, rather than dwell on what the national Government is or isn’t doing. Because we all know that the Tory Government is woefully inadequate, is exacerbating the climate emergency not making it better. However, we can’t afford to wait for them to do the right thing and we can’t afford to wait for another Government to come in and save us because there is no guarantee that they will anyway. There are Councils around the country, even very close to us, that have more ambitious targets and have made much more progress on the climate emergency than we have done in Sheffield. I think we need to emulate Councils like Nottingham, and I’m here to convince you that Sheffield Green Party is the only party in Sheffield that has the political will to do that. Greens on the Council make all the Councillors up their game on climate and ecological issues. We are the ones that first proposed declaring a Climate and Nature Emergency, which was at first rejected and then brought back by a Labour Cabinet member later so he could claim the credit. We got the Council to declare a Nature Emergency as well. I’d like the Greens to be able to take control of the Council but that is very unlikely, but what I will say is the more Greens we have on the Council, the more we can push Labour and the other parties in the direction that we need to be going to take action on the climate emergency. A balanced Council, a hung council, with Greens on the administration means that Greens can push the green policies and we can get them supported by means of one of the two other parties and they will be heard and debated not rejected out of hand. I think the big challenge with the climate emergency is the implementation. Without Greens on the Council, there wouldn’t be significant green policies to implement. I think we can point to times when have been prepared to make the difficult decisions to get things over the line, for example, the Clean Air Zone, when Labour and the Lib Dems sought to delay the CAZ we forced that over the line even though it wasn’t perfect and we thought it could have been better designed and go further, but it was really important that we did. There were other examples like the pedestrianisation of Pinstone Street, which again may be a small thing but was a huge battle. So I hope over the course of this debate I can show you the Sheffield Green Party has positive policies which we will fight for and we will have the political will to act on.\nQ1\nThere has been a lot of talk and not a great deal of action since the Council declared a Nature Emergency. What hard targets with deadlines and supporting finance is your party committing itself too.\nAD\nThis is a real key issue, which is why we forced the Council to declare a Climate and Nature Emergency, with pressure from local activist groups. It is really hard to talk about hard targets and supporting finance without having feasibility studies and briefings from officers to look into how much things would cost. There already have been things put in place by Sheffield Green Party when we were on the Executive. For example we really pushed hard on trying to ban Glyphosate. We’ve had some success there, particularly in Parks and there has also been a feasibility study on banning Glyphosate, which we are waiting to hear the results from, on the Streets Ahead team. We’ve got much further to go. We need to get Housing on board to stop the use of Glyphosate. I’ve been on the Waste and Street Scene Committee this year and we’ve adopted a new grass verge policy which will make it a lot easier for residents to be able to plant grass verges with wild flowers without having to go through the difficult process of getting insurance. We’d like to see things adopted in the local plan such as Ecological Impact Assessments on all new planning applications. We’ll talk about that more later.\nCGP\nLabour is making a commitment in this manifesto in the local elections that we will establish Sheffield as a centre of excellence for retrofitting skills working in partnership with the Colleges. I think that is a really crucial thing I want to talk about because I know from looking at the very different teams of officers in the Council and organisations and businesses, that one of the things that are stopping the people from taking the actions that they need is there’s a gap in the skills and therefore in the supply chain. So even when we have seen action teams from the national government like the Green Homes Grant to try to pump prime the market for people to be able to do the kind of climate action that they can do to make their homes warmer and cheaper to heat because their skills aren’t out there, the companies aren’t out there to do the work and therefore that halts progress. We know that’s a national situation and it’s quite an exciting prospect to build on Sheffield’s past as being a leading light on the provision of energy. Nobody knows how important energy can be to a local economy and to communities and culture than if you speak to people that have been living in coal and mining communities. We’ve been a leader in energy and those skills and industries and actually investing in retrofitting skills and other green skills is a key thing that we want to push as part of Labour’s agenda and that fits alongside Labour’s traditional emphasis on education. Now we are bringing education in alongside tackling climate.\nQ2. The Lowcock Report on Sheffield’s Street Trees drew attention to poor local engagement practices and a lack of accountability. What is your party committed to doing to ensure this isn’t repeated in relation to the development and implementation of the decarbonisation route map?\nCGP\nI think it is really important to say that the publication of that report was a real shocker, it was a moment where all of us who were involved in public life in local government were needing to draw some sharp breaths and really look in the mirror and face up to just how inadequate that whole situation had been dealt with and I think it is really positive that the Council I think is united across the political parties that we have to apologise for the things that went wrong and to accept in full recommendations that Sir Mark Lowcock has made. And part of that I think needs to be a culture change across the organisation about how we tackle things. I know my first stint on the council was in a ward where the trees were an absolutely huge fundamental issue and I lost my seat when I defended it in 2018 and missed that whole debate so I’ve been on the sharp end of that as an illustration of an issue of where you don’t find as representatives a way to hear the solutions and the input. And in actual fact, a lot of terrible things have happened and a lot of people have suffered as a result and the net result is we’ve done all the things that people were pointing to before so I was down Western Road the other day and low and behold, all round these beautiful memorial trees are these big patches of flexi-pave, which is exactly what residents and campaigners were saying at the time would be the solution. Why did we have to go through that whole disaster in order to get to the right solution? We haven’t got time to make these kinds of mistakes again and I think you can see in the way that a lot of the conversations about some of the traffic schemes were undertaken during covid lockdown, the engagement wasn’t as good as it should have been and therefore there has been resistance. So we can’t keep affording to make these mistakes.\nAD\nThank you very much for the question. Contrary to what Craig has said we didn’t learn much that we didn’t already know from the Lowcock Report. But I agree that it is damming and I am a bit worried that there hasn’t been that culture change that we need, due to the same people who oversaw the lies and the misinformation, doubling down to attack local residents still being in positions of power. There hasn’t been that accountability. That’s why we’ve called for an EGM to discuss that. We were hoping that it would be heard before the election but it will be after the election. I think where there has been culture change this is because we moved to a committee system that replaced the strong leader model and this was a result not of a change of heart by the ruling Labour Party at the time, it was the result of the hard work by campaigners working to change how Sheffield was run. They were successful in persuading thousands of people to vote for change in a referendum. This could have happened a long time ago if it had been supported by the Labour Party and we could have worked with a committee system over a longer period of time and it could have been the best it can be. I’m glad it’s here now but what we do need to do in order to make sure that this sort of thing does not happen again is to fully commit to the committee system, make it work, ensure that we bring the public into committees more effectively than we have done and make sure we also hear from experts in their field by inviting them to committees. There needs to be more engagement with local people. I support the Committee system as a way of having more accountability and decisions being made with the consent of the public\nQ3. What will you and your party do to make it easier to cycle in Sheffield?\nAD\nThis is something I am passionate about. I think in Sheffield what we really need in order to be able to encourage more people to cycle is to have safe segregated cycle routes that you see in many other countries and cities and even in the UK. To do that we need more investment in cycle routes and to do that we need to raise money and make sure we have the political will to follow through with changes that may be initially unpopular but everyone will see the benefits of. We also need to commit to not spreading misinformation and whipping up hysteria on what the potential impacts on businesses might be on having cycle routes because all the evidence suggests, in studies across the country, that actually active travel is really good for business. We would hope to raise millions of pounds a year for investment in public transport and active travel by looking at a Work Placed Parking Levy similar to what they have in Nottingham which raises £9 million every year so they can put it into active travel and public transport. This would allow us to invest heavily in routes that would be safe, segregated and accessible. I like to call cycle routes “mobility routes” because they don’t have to be exclusively used by cyclists, they can also be used by mobility vehicles and scooters. You can have lots of other alternative ways of travelling in segregated cycle routes.\nCGP\nWe’ve got some exciting cycling schemes and modal shift schemes in the works. The Little Holland Scheme is in and around Darnall. That’s a really good example of a community with relatively low car ownership, and quite a lot of people isolated. There’s a lower-than-average degree of economic engagement, Getting people active, getting people able to get around, get out of that air polluted choked up part of town and take ownership. For years we’ve been trying to slow people down going through there on the M1, and actually giving people the tools and giving people the freedom to be part of the solution themselves is empowering. And I think some of the schemes that people harangue me about when I talk to constituents at surgeries and on the doorstep where cycle schemes have been put in and they’ve not been quite right so they’ve had to be changed or whatever. There are two things I would say to that. First of all, it’s perfectly fine, When these low-traffic neighbourhood schemes are being trialled and they go through experimental road closures, the clues in the question. They are experimental. And if we don’t experiment with things how are we going to find new ways of solving these problems? The second thing is the way that the funding works for these schemes, it’s so stop-start and sporadic, there’s no strategy from Central Government, and that means we have to put a scheme together because there’s some money on offer, there isn’t the time to do all the engagement which we’ve talked about and that creates an environment where we get things wrong.\nQ4. What commitments will you give to community groups that want to use their green spaces for nature recovery and well-being?\nA lot of us are ward councillors and a lot of our candidates across the city are very involved in things like Friends of Parks groups. I think it is really positive within Nature Recovery Sheffield network and you look at some of the local organisations doing things like planting trees locally, clearing paths allowing bits that were green deserts before to rewild and provide better biodiversity services for us all. So I think increasing the way we support those community groups, friends of groups etc, and also I think looking at how we use the policy frameworks that we’ve set out in the Local Plan. So for example we had a really excellent presentation at one of the committees I serve on from a group that was campaigning for swift boxes to be incorporated into new build properties. So engaging with those groups. This is how people are passionate about things across the city and they’ve got the solutions to stuff that otherwise we might overlook, so enabling an open culture where people can have that dialogue with us and provide the solutions for us is actually a quick win.\nAD\nSo in our ward in Gleadless Valley, we are really proactive in supporting and working with community groups. We have a really amazing network of community gardens, We are really lucky that we’ve got Gleadless Valley Wildlife Trust to work with and there’s lots of exciting things going on. I think it is really important for Councillors to support these groups with ward pot and Council wise as well we’ve recently made it a lot easier for people to get trees in their local area on their streets. If you go to a website called Trees for Streets you can get a tree planted on your street via this app which is really useful. We’ve been working to try and get trees for places where there is not much greenery, such as the bottom of Chesterfield/London Road, which will help with urban drainage as well, so it is really important to get more trees for flooding reasons and climate mitigation. To work with organisations like Regather on the sustainable food strategy to help local people grow more in Sheffield. We’ve got a lot of farmland in Sheffield. Sustainable farming which will benefit the local community is something that we really want to support and Craig mentioned Swift boxes and that’s another thing we would like to see in the local plan and in the new build. Another thing we try to do is protect local urban green spaces in the Local Plan but we were outvoted there, but it is something we will still push for, making sure that any ecology impact and climate impact assessment and biodiversity net gain is actually real and measurable rather than tick box.\nQ5\nThe science is clear that we need to reduce meat consumption or switch to plant-based options in order to tackle the climate crisis and enable nature recovery. What measures will your party take to influence meat consumption patterns in Sheffield?\nAD\nSomething we have already done is school dinners, ensuring that one day a week is a meat-free day. I think making that 2 days would be really good. There is also the plant-based treaty that other councils have signed across the country that commits all meals at Council functions, which there aren’t that many of and we certainly don’t get any free lunches at the Council now! But I think if there are any functions that the Council is putting on if they offered a plant-based meal at them that’s already doing a small thing to reduce consumption but also sets a really good example that other groups can emulate. It’s all about education and having those conversations. It is not something that the Council could enforce. We obviously couldn’t say “We are going to ban meat” but by adopting a plant-based treaty in Sheffield and encouraging a meat-free day in schools every week, people will be having those conversations and asking why are you doing this. I think it is nudging people in the right direction. Encouraging Vegan markets as well, they are always really popular.\nCGP\nI’ve had some contact with the plant-based treaty organisation and when we first started to correspond I think the expectation was that if the Council just cuts out meat and dairy from its catering operation it will make a massive difference. There’s a jug of milk that we get once every 6 weeks at full council meetings, we could swap that for non-dairy but I don’t know how much of an impact it would make. This is not something we have talked about as a party group and we’ve not got anything in our manifesto specifically, but as an individual member of the relevant committee, I have asked officers to have a look at what the total catering output is so we can make an assessment about what the impact would be and what the implications of it would be. One of the things that we can do to encourage people to make those behavioural changes, I’ve actually already talked about the need for a sustainable food strategy and if we can support food producers and organisations. manufacturers and suppliers in the local economy not only are we building up our ability to do community wealth building and develop that doughnut economics where things aren’t being imported from all over the place and the carbon footprint of our food is going down but we are also meaning that non-meat plant-based food produce is going to be in more ready reliable supply, more locally, which then reduces the price which then means its more attractive to buy local produce that’s cheap and affordable rather than the price of meat is astronomical. Before you look at the real cost of meat, if you actually factor in the proper ethical treatment of animals and ethical production methods so actually sustainable food strategy is one way to lead people away from Meat and towards plant-based.\nQ6\nHow does your party intend to improve recycling provision in Sheffield in general and to reduce the use of single-use plastics in particular?\nCGP\nIn terms of recycling, there was a recent Council meeting where people got very excited and started to wave around the different-sized receptacles that different parties have introduced for recycling in different administrations over the last 15 years. So we don’t want to get into that kind of debate today. I think this is one which needs to be done in a way that brings the public with us, So there are some people in my ward who find it arduous to find the space to store the different containers and wheelie bins to sort it all out. The people who are living in flats and communal buildings who don’t have the same access to the kerbside collections that many of us do. So we can look at pushing forward with those things. We can also look at pushing our private sector contractors to actually take more of a variety of plastics and look at where we can unblock things which means its too selective., At the minute we have to put certain categories of plastics in our brown bin and the rest we have to collect up and take to the collection points. The other thing is that we have supported on the Waste and Street Scene Committee this year representatives from the Labour Party were very keen to support the trial of the food waste collections. I argued for my ward to be one of the trial areas for the city. On the whole, we have had no complaints. People were saying there would be rats and maggots and foxes and all kinds of biodiversity that people aren’t so keen on. That doesn’t seem to have happened. People have been really keen and we’ve actually got people now saying why have we not got it. When can we have it back? I think there’s probably a general agreement that we need to push for it to be brought in on a general basis. That’s a good example of bringing people with you.\nAD\nI’ve been on the Waste and Street Scene Committee this year. The food waste trial was really successful and exciting. The issue that we are waiting for is that Central Government are supposed to be bringing out a White Paper on this telling us what we have to recycle which should include lots of different types of plastics because at the moment we don’t recycle enough plastics in Sheffield. We are really keen to get that food waste trial extended to the whole city and adopted as soon as possible. We’ve also supported different approaches to collecting waste. In my ward, we’ve got the Gleadless Valley master plan. We’ve been working really hard to ensure that waste management is on to look at collecting waste much more effectively. In different communities-high rise flats, and maisonettes. Other things we’ve looked at the Green Party generally support the plastic-free pledge, So we’d like to remove single-use plastic from all council operations and premises and encourage plastic-free initiatives, There is a group called Plastic Free Sheffield Central which I have met with a few times and I’ve been working with the Waste and Street Scene Committee for the markets to ban single-use plastics from any food markets that they have so that is something that I am advocating for. Another thing we would look at is community composting and whether that could work alongside any food waste trial. So basically plastic-free pledge, and make sure that we recycle as much of our waste and also reduce waste by promoting the right to repair.\nQ7\nIn 7 years time, all new cars must be electric. What plans do you have for facilitating electric vehicle charging for Sheffield residents with no off-street parking?\nAD\nThe Council has already started to roll out more electric vehicle charging and we’ve got some charging points in our ward. Some of that has been done by the Mayoral Authority and some has been done by the Council itself. And that could be in all the council-owned car parks, we’d also encourage private car parks to have charging facilities. But I am clear that electric cars are not the answer to the climate emergency. The embodied carbon in new cars is not sustainable, Cars clog up our roads, they are dangerous, and they are far less efficient than reliable public transport. So we would be looking to make sure far more that the alternative to the car is our priority. We would try and electrify the buses and install more infrastructure for taxis to go electric as they have in Nottingham which has a far more ambitious carbon neutral by 2028 target. I think we could have made a lot of ground on this already. We haven’t done this because of the lack of political will by the other parties. We do need to roll out more charging points and I agree that they need to be accessible to everyone, not just those with a drive. Also, we need to make clear that cars are not the answer. The future is public transport, active travel, electric bikes, cargo bikes and all the other options.\nCGP\nA lot of the work to find solutions to this has been done already by our peers in other local authorities across the country. I was lucky enough to represent the Council on UK 100 Climate Leadership Academy the network of local government leaders who are committed to tackling the climate emergency and through that network as a politician and officers in the council who are implementing solutions who have access to this incredible wealth of experience and good practice so there are things that are out there. New technology for people who live in houses that don’t have driveways and need to park on the street where there are channels that can go through the pavement from the street that has been trialled. There are solutions that involve electric hook-up points being built into the street lights, and the lighting columns, there are things like local charging hubs, and there are things like getting the infrastructure so that the new generation of car charging points will be not very much longer when you are standing holding the plug to your car like you do topping up with petrol or diesel now –its so quick and so rapid. Our public transport infrastructure has just crumbled under a lack of investment nationally and the unhelpful policies that have been pursued so what’s the alternative? We’ve talked already about incorporating segregated infrastructure for active travel routes and cycling and walking routes. Getting people off the main highway some of the time so they can see our blue-green infrastructure and be going on the canal bank and river bank and through the parks and pockets of green space. But actually, we need to be fundamentally reforming the bus system and that’s why Labour, through the Labour South Yorkshire Mayor has initiated the process of bringing buses back under public control because until we have got that accountability in the public transport system we’ve just not got the levers at our disposal to get people out of cars. Part of the issue of transitioning away from cars is not just the embodied carbon that Alexi talked about it’s the particulate matter that’s thrown up from car tyres and brake pads and the friction of the vehicles going along the roadway and increasing street tree cover is one of the ways that means there is the tree infrastructure there which can capture and take a lot of that particulate matter, so its sitting on the leaves of trees and not swirling around and going into our lungs and blood system.\nQ8\nHow will your party ensure there is joined-up planning and delivery for the training and skills required for nature recovery and climate action?\nCGP\nIt’s one of the resounding things that smacks me in the face whenever I’m talking to different teams and different industries and parts of the Council about what the barriers are, is that we don’t have the skills or people qualified to work in the green industries that we need. I talked earlier about Labour’s manifesto proposal to establish Sheffield as a centre of excellence for retrofit skills. Also, we’ve talked about looking at a specialist business zone to invest and provide a home for firms with green manufacturing skills across the Sheffield to Rotherham corridor. We’ve built that into the local plan that has gone through its public consultation process. They are just a couple of clear examples of how we do it. For my part, I think we need to be building these kinds of skills into the core curriculum. We know that children and young people in schools in the education system are really passionate about tackling this kind of crisis. We need to also be building them the skills so that they can come out of it with the qualifications to be part of the solution and take the actions that we need to restructure the economy and society so that we are tackling it and it works for everybody.\nAD\nI think the most important thing is to have joined up planning and delivery so as to get everyone in the room at the outset and coproduce the solutions. We’ve got loads of trusted and talented and dedicated organisations in Sheffield that we can work with to make these things happen, So Development Trusts in different areas of the city, the Wildlife Trusts, lots of community partners, and local businesses that actually care about Sheffield. So it is really about getting everyone in the room when we are designing these things, It’s also in the Local Plan for example, ensuring any new build has guaranteed jobs for local people. And also rewilding is another way that we can make sure a lot of people have good jobs in the local area. I’ve talked about the sustainable food strategy. I think that would be another key part of that. Retrofitting our houses with the community. Making sure that we have put into place criteria that mean local people have to be employed in any development and ensure that they are sustainable and of a really high standard.",

All money raised from a WPL must be ring-fenced for investment in local transport improvements. It is not a tax on spaces in public car parks.\nWhy is it needed?\nFunding for public transport is under pressure. Costs for fuel and wages are rising which threatens services and drives up costs for passengers. It is right to ask the Government for more funding but introducing a Workplace Parking Levy in Sheffield is something the Council has the power to do. Other Councils have or are planning to introduce it, why not Sheffield?\nWhat improvements could it pay for?\nIn Nottingham where the Levy was first introduced it has paid for improvements and extensions to tram services, improved bus services and better cycling and walking infrastructure. It has also helped support the introduction of an electric taxi fleet, over 200 electric charging points and reduced congestion and air pollution. In Nottingham the funding from the levy has helped draw in matched funding from other sources,\nHow much will it cost the employer?\nIn Leicester where the Levy will be introduced this year, it will cost £550/ parking space, so just over £10/week/space. It is generally larger employers who will be affected, The levy in Leicester only applies to larger employers who have 10 or more spaces and doesn’t apply to spaces for blue badge holders or to parking spaces for emergency services employees.\nHow much does congestion cost Sheffield?\nIn 2018 it was calculated that congestion was costing £1101 for every driver in Sheffield. More recently in 2021 TomTom’s Traffic index worked out that Sheffield drivers spend an additional 82 hours (3 days and 2 hours) stuck in traffic. A better public transport and active travel network would cut this frustrating and unproductive time for Sheffield’s commuters.\nWhat benefits does it bring to business?\nBusinesses will be able to apply for grant funding from the proceeds of the levy to improve their facilities for public and active travel: e.g. bike storage, real time transport info boards etc. EV points can also be funded through the levy.\nWill employers pass on the cost to workers?\nThey don’t have to. That would be a decision for the employer and if they did that cost would be in the region of £2/day.\nWhen would it come in?/timescales\nThe time needed to establish an Employers Workplace Parking Levy scheme is around 2 years in preparation once the decision to proceed has been made. So it would not add to the impact of the immediate Cost of Living crisis.\nWhy can’t the council get money for transport from central government?\nIn theory the money needed could come from the Government but experience shows us that getting the funding needed is very difficult and funding for public services is under immense pressure. It is right to ask the government for funding but introducing a Workplace Parking Levy is a power that local councils already have. It would be wrong to ignore a source of funding when it could be used to help local people.\nWhat other benefits are there?\nThere are other benefits as well as improved public transport and better facilities and infrastructure for walkers and cyclists. Having a new funding source to support transport initiatives eases pressure on public funds and frees up more funding for things like adult social care and childrens’ services which are constantly under threat of cuts.\nEveryone benefits from better air quality, better road safety, better use of land, less pressure on green belt, better use of the city centre’s land space. A more compact city is easier for public transport to serve and easier for active travel.\nNottingham has benefited from increased inward investment, as businesses have recognised the value of a good quality public transport network.\nSign the Petition for an Employers Workplace Parking Levy HERE",

It is wrong to say that children are not receiving an education. They have simply been learning in a different way.\nIt is not safe or necessary for more early years children to go back to school. We must wait until an effective system of contact tracing and testing is in place. The only year that really needs to be in school this summer is Year 6, as they will be making a major transition to high school. For many of them, it will be the last time they see each other. Even so, they can’t return until we can be assured adequate measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the virus. These are not currently in place.\nWe therefore call for schools in Sheffield to keep operating as they are, instead of risking the health of staff, students and relatives by physically re-opening on 1st June.\nWe are calling for the administration in Sheffield to show the same courage as Liverpool and other councils.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We know we need to make it cheaper and more convenient to come to town on the bus instead of by private car. We need to set aside space for green space for the public, not storage for private vehicles.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson is the council’s Executive Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport and Leader of the Green Group.\nCllr Ruth Mersereau is Executive Adviser to Douglas Johnson. Ruth spoke on the need for a city centre designed for people. See her speech here.\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n- The Greens amendment proposes that the council:\n(h) believes that Sheffield must look forward to a vibrant city centre that supports Sheffield’s local businesses, has a good quality of life for an increasing residential population and is an enjoyable place to visit\n(i) believes that good access into the city centre is vital and we should aim to increase the numbers of people visiting on foot, by bike, by bus, tram and train\n(j) therefore believes that the best way to support a good bus and tram network is to make it cheaper and more convenient to arrive by public transport than by private car.\n(k) believes that we need to improve air quality and should therefore reduce the number of unnecessary journeys by private car;\n(l) believes that reducing congestion in the city centre will make streets safer as well as cleaner and more pleasant to enjoy.\n(m) recognises that the city centre and its residents are desperately short of green spaces and outdoor public spaces, and that we need to free up some car parking spaces for use as public green/outdoor space to make the city a more attractive and healthier place to visit and to live in\n(n) welcomes independent shops and would like to see more neighbourhood shops and services, so that a wide range of shops and services is within 15 minutes walk.\n(o) notes that research by the London Borough of Waltham Forest showed that people walking to their high street spent 40% more than people who drove but that business owners massively over-estimated their customers’ car use;\n(p) recognises that whilst blue badge parking is still necessary for some, believes that a modern, Electric FreeBee bus would make the city centre more accessible to many disabled people, recognising also that car ownership is lower among disabled people.\nMost of the amendment was passed but Labour and LibDem councillors joined to vote against (m) and (p).",

I was a secondary school teacher for 16 years and for the past seven years I have worked in the voluntary sector: for five years for a disability charity and for the last two for a homeless charity. I’m also the trustee of a local human rights organisation.\nI’m an EU citizen who moved from Italy to Sheffield 26 years ago and have raised my family here. I love how diverse the ward is and I am engaged with many community groups in all parts of the ward: in the nearly four years since being elected, I have supported the volunteer group BBEST to get their Neighbourhood Plan to the referendum stage and finally passed in 2021. I support the Hanover TARA in all their dealings with Sheffield City Council and I was instrumental in the publication of the report about the cladding of the Hanover Tower in 2020. I regularly support litter picks in Broomhill, Broomhall and Hunters Bar as well as attending as many community meetings as I can.\nSince being elected in 2019, I have been a member of various SCC committees: Health Scrutiny, Licensing and Audit & Standards. I am particularly interested in governance and finance so I am pleased to still be a member of the Audit & Standards committee. In the municipal year 2021-22, I was the Adviser to the Executive Member for Inclusive Economy and skills, taking particular interest in the skills and adult education side of the portfolio and concentrating on expanding the offer of training for green jobs in Sheffield.\nSince May 2022 I have been the Co-chair of the Adult Health & Social Care Policy Committee and a member of the Strategy & Resources Policy Committee. I am also the Deputy Speaker for the Green Group at Sheffield City Council.\nAs Co-chair of the AHSC Policy Committee, I have set the tone for our work ethics by co-chairing with a Councillor from another group and involving the deputy (from the third group) from the very start. The three groups have been involved in every single decision and we have made every single one by consensus. The AHSC Committee is often used as an example in SCC of how well the committee system can work despite the fact that we had to find the most savings for the 23-24 budget (47% of all SCC savings for the year)!\nI am a team player: I work extremely close to my ward colleagues, Brian and Maleiki. We speak to each other virtually daily and meet at least once a week. We share the workload and we always try to do our best to support our constituents.\nI also work closely with the whole Green Councillor Group and I am well respected by colleagues in other political groups.\nI am very proud of my record as a councillor: I work hard and I am totally committed to the role to ensure that we get the best outcomes for a greener future for the citizens of Sheffield. If elected again I will continue to work hard to ensure that we achieve climate and social justice for our citizens and close the inequality gap in the city. In my role as a councillor, I am most happy when I am able to help residents.”\nUpdated May 2023",

The surgery hopes to offer more services and take on more patients.\nStation actions\nRail fares went up on 2nd January. Greens were out speaking to passengers about their travel frustrations. Councillor Douglas Johnson said, “Passengers can claim for delays of 15 minutes or more. The refunds might be small but, if more people make claims, it lets private rail companies know they must act to improve public services.”\nGritting in icy weather\nGreen councillors have been asking the Council to make sure the station forecourt is gritted when snow and ice are forecast. Cllr Douglas Johnson commented, “There’s something wrong if council policy says no pedestrian areas are gritted in advance, even when it’s the main way in and out of the city for thousands of commuters every day.\nYour Voice Matters\nWe run regular drop-ins for anything you want to discuss with your councillors, at the Harlequin pub on Nursery St (6-8pm, first Thursday of the month) and now also at Union St Co-working Space (1 2:30-1 :30pm, third Wednesday of the month).\nBetter ideas than widening roads\nGreens have criticised new plans to spend millions on widening the Inner Ring Road because of the impact on air quality and access for local residents. Green activist, Emily Brooke-Davies said, “As someone who walks through this area, I know how difficult it is to cross here already. I feel the money would be better spent to make it easier to use other forms of transport.”\nGreen councillors have now secured a committee session to examine how the impact on residents can be made better.\nCitizen science – air quality\nResidents around the ward have been measuring air quality levels, thanks to some “ward pot” funding. We hope to have some results soon but the results so far show some worrying levels of everyday pollution.\nLet us know if you want to know more.\nKelham Island planning\nResidents and businesses in Kelham Island have been working to set up a neighbourhood planning forum to have more say over the development of the local area.\nWe are now waiting for a formal decision from the planning department.\nUniversal credit\nIf you need to claim universal credit, check out our factsheet at www.sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/uc Or phone us.\nOut & About\nYou might have seen us out and about in the area.

But other venues have attracted big events – the Sheffield Olympics GB National Summer Games are very welcome here from August 7 to 12.\nClive Betts MP commented in 2011 “Labour borrowed money to provide facilities that are extremely well-used, and an asset for Sheffield.” The question is whether or not they have provided value for money. Debt refinancing means a final cost of £650 million with annual repayments of up to £30 million continuing to 2024.

Green councillors voted against the budget after Labour councillors had voted to reject the Green councillors’ amendment.\nBy contrast, Green councillors had voted for the Labour amendment in order to secure a substantial investment in community renewable energy generation, something the Green Party has long campaigned for.\nWhat happened next? Cllr Douglas Johnson explains,\n“After Labour failed to get its budget passed, the LibDems offered to change their vote if Labour would drop its amendment. However, Greens fought to keep the amendment with its significant investment in community renewable energy and we then formally abstained on the budget so that this could be secured.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“The Green Group looked at all the amendments. Though there were things in the Labour amendment that we had reservations about, we thought it was important to recognise the good things in Labour’s amendment and not make the mistake of just voting along party lines. That sort of tribal politics should be the politics of the past and is no good for the people of Sheffield.”\nThe Labour Group and the Lib Dems all voted against the Green Party Amendment, however.\nCouncillor Johnson said\n“I was disappointed that Labour were unable to see beyond party politics on something as important as the City Council’s budget. I firmly believe that the spirit of our Cooperative Administration should be about being open to ideas from outside our own political groups”.\nOne of the sticking points for Labour in the Green Amendment was support for establishing an Employers Workplace Parking Levy to help pay for improvements. In Nottingham, the levy on large employers raises more than £9 million each year, with the revenue used to fund tram infrastructure, a smart card scheme, electric buses, cycling facilities and grants to businesses. Leicester City Council are also looking at introducing a levy based on Nottingham’s success.\nCouncillor Johnson said\n“We believe that establishing a workplace parking levy to support public transport and active travel is progressive and vital if we are going to have the investment to deliver the public transport system we need to address the climate emergency. Small employers with fewer than 10 parking spaces pay nothing at all. It is the larger employers offering more than 10 parking spaces who pay a fee of £1.17 per day per parking space. There are exemptions for local emergency services, NHS frontline staff and blue badge holders. What is really important to understand is that funding improvements to public transport and facilities for cyclists and pedestrians in this way means we have more flexibility in council budgets to pay for things like Adult Social Care where the demand is huge and finance is limited.”\n“It is astonishing that councillors would rather cut social care than put up parking charges.”\n“I am aware that for the Labour Party this is a real problem and I have to confess I’m perplexed by that. I would love to say this is a scheme dreamed up by the Green Party but actually both Nottingham and Leicester Councils are led by Labour Administrations. It is an example of best practice that we should follow. I don’t care where good ideas come from, I think we should back them. That is what all forward-thinking, responsible councils should be doing.”",

It makes vast areas more susceptible to the wildfires seen during the recent heatwave and increases the real risks of flooding in Sheffield. There are also clear links to the illegal killing of birds of prey which are largely missing from the Peak District.\nOwnership exacerbates the problem. Did you know that five moorland owners in the Upper Don Catchment received £3.15 million in Government grants and High Level Stewardship payments over a two-year period for moorland restoration work and environmentally beneficial management practices? And that those same owners over the same time burned large areas of these moors, damaging fragile vegetation. Farcically, Natural England says flood risk is not within its remit while The Environment Agency says land management is not within theirs.\nI have written “Report From the Front Line – What’s Happening on the moors near Sheffield” with the support of Sheffield Green Party – you can read it at https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2018/08/09/sheffield-greens-release-report-about-destruction-and-slaughter-on-the-moors/\nSheffield Council must have proper support from statutory bodies to ensure natural flood management measures are urgently put in place across all the moorland surrounding Sheffield. And we need a complete ban on heather burning and driven grouse shooting. The industry has shown itself to be incompatible with management of the moors for public.\nBob Berzins\nReport From the Front Line: What’s happening on moors near Sheffield (pdf)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Some of the courses provided by WEA may not lead directly to jobs and work but are highly likely to provide people with the wherewithal to pursue further learning, jobs and work.\nEducation can boost wellbeing, confidence and enrich lives. A healthy confident society will enrich the region and lead to social and economic progress.\nFurther to this, there seems to have been very little in the way of big picture thinking with the awarding of grants. With national, profit seeking organisations being successful at the expense of the WEA. These national, profit seeking organisations appear to be offering packages that we already offer, so, the overall provision of the city region’s adult education is that we will now have chasms in the offerings and too much in other areas. It will also lead to competition between providers which could ultimately mean a loss in future funding if there is a surplus in a particular area or subject.\nSome training that WEA offered, that I have been contacted about, is to train people how to be interpreters. There is a shortage of people with this skill and charities caring for refugees and asylum seekers have accessed this, and other courses, frequently. To the point it has become an integral part of their service.\nThere were courses on democracy and politics, art and history, that I would hope you see the very real value of, to people and society. They will no longer be available. How do you propose we improve civic duty and political awareness now?\nI am told there will be around 60-100 educators made redundant. Can you explain to me how this will help meet our employment ambitions for the region? Can you see these skills draining from our region to places with greater respect for education and educators?\nFinally, I ask what you can do to keep WEA active in our region and what funding they can receive to replace the £1.7 million lost.\nYours,\nPaul Turpin\nGreen Councillor for Gleadless Valley Ward\nExecutive Member for Inclusive Economy, Jobs and Skills",

But First and Stagecoach will maximise profits by just running full buses at peak times with lower demand services gradually disappearing. It forces people to use cars, adding to congestion and air pollution, while cutting off those who can’t afford a car.\nClean, safe, accessible public transport and more walking and cycling could make us all healthier and happier. We need a public transport system that takes us where we need to go, affordably and reliably. It should be easy to choose to leave the car at home – or not have one at all.

They will still need to claim it to have some money to live on. This factsheet from Sheffield Green Party is to give you as much practical help as possible.\nIt is not legal advice. Some sources of advice and help are listed at the end of this factsheet.\nDownload this Universal Credit factsheet (pdf)\nKey points\n- The rules on Universal Credit (UC) in Sheffield are changing from 7th November 2018.\n- This factsheet is for people claiming benefits in Sheffield after 7th November 2018 and for frontline workers helping them.\n- You may be better or worse off on UC. Many people will be worse off. On average, the DWP will pay out less under UC than under the old system.\n- You will have to wait at least 5-6 weeks for a payment after you apply.\n- The rules on UC are very complex and keep changing. A lot will depend on your individual circumstances.\n- You should try to get advice if you can. If you have a support worker or anyone helping in a community setting, please mention it to them if you have any difficulty getting UC.\n- If you are in social rented housing, it is a good idea to let your landlord know too.\nWhat is UC?\nUC is the DWP benefit that will replace:\n- income-based jobseeker’s allowance;\n- income-related employment and support allowance;\n- income support;\n- child tax credit;\n- working tax credit;\n- housing benefit.\nYou do not have to do anything if you are on one of these benefits now and your circumstances haven’t changed. The DWP will write to you in the future but this is not expected to be before July 2020.\nWho does this affect?\nYou will be affected if you are thinking of claiming one of these benefits.\nYou will also be affected if you are on these benefits already and report a change of circumstances.\nYou will only be affected if you live in certain postcodes – see below.\nWho does it NOT affect?\nIt will NOT affect you if you have three or more children. You cannot claim UC in this case.\nIt will NOT affect you if you are only claiming contribution-based jobseeker’s allowance or contribution-based ESA – i.e. benefits paid for out of national insurance you have paid and which aren’t affected by your income or savings. This could apply if you have recently lost a job after a long spell of work or with a good redundancy payment.\nWhat postcodes are affected?\nIt depends which Jobcentre you go to.\n| Jobcentre | When the rules start |\n|---|---|\n| Bailey Court | 7th November 2018 |\n| Cavendish Court | 7th November 2018 |\n| Chapeltown | 7th November 2018 |\n| Hillsborough | December 2018 |\n| Woodhouse | December 2018 |\nYou can check your postcode online at www.universalcreditinfo.net.\nWho is eligible for UC?\nYou can claim if you are on a low income and have saving under £16,000. You can get it if you are in or out of work.\nBoth members of a couple have to claim – income and savings are assessed together.\nYou normally have to be over 18 and under pension age but some 16- and 17-year olds can get it.\nYou normally have to be resident in Britain and have a “right to reside.”\nYou normally have to accept a “claimant commitment” to get UC. This is usually about proving you are looking for work, or more work, either now or in the future.\nThis may apply even if you are sick or if you already have work. You have to agree the “claimant commitment” with someone from the jobcentre.\nHow do I claim UC?\nYou normally have to claim online at www.gov.uk/universal-credit. There are no paper forms.\nYou normally have to provide an e-mail address to claim and have a UC online account. This also means you have to check your e-mails regularly so you can reply to the DWP.\nOnline accounts are at www.gov.uk/sign-in-universal-credit.\nEven though you claim online, you will normally have to go in to the jobcentre in person as well. You have to discuss your “claimant commitment” and other matters with jobcentre staff.\nYou should claim on the first day you are eligible. If you don’t claim, you will lose pay. If you can’t claim online straight away, you can make your claim by phoning and then provide the rest of the information later.\nYou can ask for it to be back-dated. You can only get a maximum of one month back and the rules are quite tight.\nWhat if I don’t have a computer or if I don’t know how to use one?\n- You might have someone to help you get online, whether it is family, friends or a support worker.\n- The DWP has a helpline where you can make a claim. Telephone: 0800 328 5644 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 4pm). These calls are now free from all phones.\n- The jobcentre will also provide computers so you can go online and make your claim. They have to offer you help if you need it.\n- Some libraries have computers but these can be very busy\n- Citizens Advice may also help people make claims online.\nWhat do I get?\nUnder universal Credit, you get one payment each month. This is for your living costs, rent, council tax etc. You can work out how much you should get at www.entitledto.co.uk\nThe payments are made in arrears. Your first payment is due one month and 7 days after you make your claim.\nUC is paid into a bank. If you don’t have a bank account, you could try opening a “basic” bank account. These do not have any credit checks. There is more information about these here:\nwww.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/choosing-a-bank-account-for-your-universal-credit-payment\nWhat do I live off in the meantime?\nYou can ask for an advance payment. This is a loan that is taken off your regular payments when they start.\nYou get this by asking at the jobcentre at your first Universal Credit interview, or by calling the Universal Credit helpline.\nOnce the DWP have agreed to an advance payment, you should get the money in 3 working days. Tell the DWP if you need it sooner than this – they can pay you on the same day if you’d have no other money to live on.\nWhat about my rent?\nYou have to pay your full rent to your landlord out of the monthly payment of UC. You will no longer have benefit paid directly to your rent account, even if you are a council tenant.\nIf you don’t pay enough to cover your rent, you could lose your home. If you live in council or housing association property, it will help you if your housing officer knows you are claiming UC.\nIf you are living in interim or temporary accommodation because you are homeless or if you are in supported accommodation, you may still have to claim housing benefit. You should ask your support worker or housing officer to help with this.\nUnder UC, you get paid the same amount, regardless of “rent free” weeks.\nIf you get 2 months or more behind with your rent, your landlord can ask the DWP to pay your UC to them directly.\nWhat if I can’t manage my money?\nThe DWP can make “alternative payment arrangements” if necessary. The DWP will not normally do this so you need to show you have a good reason:\nAlternative payments arrangements could be:\n- being paid twice a month instead of once\n- rent being paid to a landlord\n- splitting payments between two members of a couple\n- something else\nFactors that make a difference\nIf any of these apply, you should make the jobcentre aware if you:\n- are in debt or rent arrears\n- have a disability – including a mental health condition\n- are homeless or are at risk of losing your home\n- have experienced domestic violence\n- have a learning difficulty, like problems with reading or writing\n- are in temporary or supported accommodation\n- are 16 or 17 or leaving care\n- have an addiction to drugs, alcohol or gambling\nHow do I check my award is right?\nYou should make sure the DWP gives you a written award notice and should read it carefully to make sure it is all correct. You can ask someone else you trust to read it too.\nDo this as soon as possible because there are time limits to appeal.\nIf anything is wrong, you should ask the DWP to look at it again. This is a “mandatory reconsideration.”\nMake sure you get another written decision from the DWP. If it is still wrong, you can appeal to a tribunal. You need to make sure you submit an appeal within the time limits but you should also try and get advice as soon as you can.\nWhat if I can’t appeal?\nThere are some things you can’t appeal. These include delays, the DWP losing things or not getting a written decision.\nYou can still make a formal complaint. It is easiest if you can do this online at https://makeacomplaint.dwp.gov.uk/. Or ask at the jobcentre. They should respond to your complaint in writing.\nOther sources of help\nDiscretionary Housing Payments\nThese are extra top-up payments to help towards your rent. They are administered by the council. You can apply once you have an award of UC that covers some of your housing costs.\nYou can claim a DHP at www.sheffield.gov.uk/dhp or by phoning 0114 273 6983\nCouncil tax support\nUC does not cover council tax bills so you need to apply for council tax support separately. Apply at www.sheffield.gov.uk/benefits or by phoning 0114 273 6633.\nFree School meals\nYour UC award notice will tell you if you can claim Free School meals. Some people will get these when they didn’t under the old system. Having more children on free school meals also means your school gets more funding so it helps them if you apply too.\nPrescriptions etc.\nYour UC award notice will tell you if you can claim help with prescriptions, dental costs, sight tests etc.\nWelfare assistance\nThe Council can provide grants under the Local Assistance Scheme. This replaced the former DWP Social Fund. The grants do not have to be repaid.\nFor more details or to apply, ring 0114 273 4567 or see www.sheffield.gov.uk/home/benefits/local-assistance-scheme.html\nOther sources of help and advice:\nThe Government has stopped legal aid for benefits advice, except for a very few cases of appeals to the Upper Tribunal and for cases of unlawful discrimination.\nThe Government has taken away legal aid for most welfare benefits problems. This means there is less advice available from solicitors and advice centres. However, some legal issues with UC are difficult. The Government has already lost important cases in the courts because some of the rules are unlawful.\nYou could try the following\nCitizens Advice\nAdvice line: 03444 113 111\nwww.citizensadvicesheffield.org.uk\nShelter\n0344 515 1515\nDrop-in: Furnival House, 48 Furnival Gate, Sheffield, S1 4QP\nhttps://england.shelter.org.uk/get_help/local_services/sheffield\nMoney Advice Service\n0800 138 7777\nwww.moneyadviceservice.org.uk\nGovernment websites:\nwww.understandinguniversalcredit.gov.uk\nSheffield Credit Union\nOffers a budgeting service for people on UC:\nhttps://sheffieldcreditunion.com/services/scuba-budgeting-accounts/\nYour local councillors\nIf you live in these wards, you can contact your councillors for help:\nPhone 0114 273 5380\nCity Ward\ndouglas.johnson@sheffield.gov.uk\nrobert.murphy@sheffield.gov.uk\nBroomhill and Sharrow Vale ward\nkaltum.rivers@councillor.sheffield.gov.uk\nmagid@sheffield.gov.uk\nNether Edge and Sharrow ward\nalison.teal@sheffield.gov.uk",

However, they have found that the wording of the motion has been altered by Council Officers without their permission. The edited version of the motion removes reference to the Administration’s attempt to incarcerate Alison Teal.\nAt November’s Sheffield council meeting the Green Party group also attempted to submit this as an emergency motion, but it was was blocked on the advice of officers. This represents a pattern of recent efforts to shut down debate and marginalise opposition voices – including suspending the constitution to restrict the ability of opposition parties to present motions.\nSpeaking on the motion and its alteration, Councillor Rob Murphy said,\n“We are shocked and alarmed at the Council’s efforts to silence opposition voices. A strong opposition is vital to good democracy, and without proper scrutiny the Council runs the real risk of becoming unaccountable for its actions.\n“Their most outrageous attempt to shut down their opponents was the failed attempt to commit Cllr Teal to prison. The reputational damage that this attempt to jail an opposition Councillor has done to the city is huge, and cannot go ignored.\n“My motion is intended to shine a light on the culture of secrecy amongst the small group of councillors and officers running Sheffield Council. That this motion has itself been edited without my consent, in an attempt to hide the truth, is unacceptable.\n“Further, the Council continues to attempt to avoid scrutiny by restricting the number of motions we are able to submit to Council, and continually debating national issues of which they have no control over. This attempt to deflect criticism and avoid talking about local issues shows a lack of responsibility.\n“The case against Cllr Teal was rejected by the High Court judge without her even having to take to the witness stand.

Trades Unions are essential to organising and lobbying on behalf of workers, from baristas to barristers, pushing back against exploitation. Yet the role of trades unions in relation to the climate crisis is less clear, as many represent the interests of workers in carbon heavy industries. Our speakers explored how unions and the Green movement can tackle the climate crisis together.\nSee the presentation slides here:\nSGP Unions and the Climate Crisis Ben Manovitch\nSGP Unions and the Climate Crisis Jenny Patient\nAnd the full recording here:\nBen Manovitch spoke on the importance of trade union renewal for a socially just society and why strong unions would help the Green Party. Ben is a solicitor, co-founder of the Bread & Roses Project, and a member of the unions ACORN and UVW.\nJenny Patient spoke about her research on the roles unions can take in tackling the systemic and social roots of climate change. Jenny’s research came out of her campaigns work with Sheffield Climate Alliance, and is being put into practice in her current work with TUC in Yorkshire and the Humber.\nMark James spoke about the new Sheffield Green Party Trades Union Group. Mark is a former branch officer of the NUT and Unite and member of the Working Class Studies Association.\nIf you are interested in joining the SGP Trades Union Group, get in touch with Mark at mdjames30@icloud.com",

The first initiative she proposed was to develop a Cost of Living Crisis Action Plan within 4 months, saying,\n“Rising costs for food and fuel are not being matched by rising incomes and the poorest are suffering disproportionately because more of their income is spent on the essentials of life. Though many of the policy solutions to the current crisis are the responsibility of national government, that does not mean that we should do nothing locally. That is why we called for a Cost of Living Crisis Action Plan so the Council can lead, along with our other public and voluntary sector partners, in agreeing effective action at a local level to address this crisis.”\nThe second initiative Cllr Angela Argenzio proposed was to be the first Council in the country to introduce a Corporate Opportunities Register.\n“All Councils are required to have a Corporate Risk Register, where senior officers of the Councils demonstrate that we are properly prepared for things like changes in legislation that impact on the Council, emergency situations, things like cyber attacks and natural disasters. What we don’t have is a Corporate Opportunities Register where our senior officers report on new funding streams from Government and other sources to help us achieve the council’s objectives and on partnerships we can develop with the private and voluntary sectors to help us to work together effectively. We have a structured approach to dealing with risk and we need one to identify the opportunities we can take.”\nThe third area the Greens identified was the need to improve the service that people receive from Sheffield City Council,\nCouncillor Marieanne Elliot, newly elected Green Councillor for Gleadless Valley, seconded the motion in her maiden speech saying,\n“Many people are unable to access the council’s online and phone services. There are numerous reasons for this and we need to take responsibility for removing the barriers.\nI’m pleased that our proposals for a Customer Services Action Plan were supported, and hope that we can improve accessibility to services for everyone.”",

He was first elected as a councillor in May 2021 and was re-elected again for a second term in May 2024.\nMaroof is a proud immigrant and a dedicated public servant with a passion for education and skills. He can speak a number of languages, has a background in education, has worked with many different cultures around the world, and brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the Council Chambers; experience which has been crucial in ensuring progressive policies have been put forward during his time in post.\nMaroof is deeply committed to serving the needs and wants of the community of NE&S and works tirelessly to improve the lives of its residents. He has shown he is dedicated to listening to the concerns of the community and taking action to address them. He has assisted residents with concerns around litter, bins, parking, public transport, parks, and many other issues.\nMaroof champions holding people in power to account and has regularly challenged the Council Leader on his inaction in ensuring the city is listening and acting upon the concerns of its amazing residents. He strongly supports the rights of the Palestinian people to exist and their right to return to their homelands, he has been active in speaking up about the genocide being committed on Gazans by speaking at many protests and bringing their causes to wider attention. He has said “that by actively showing my support for Gaza, I am standing up for human rights, justice, and dignity for all oppressed people around the world”. By supporting Gaza, Maroof is sending a powerful message that he will not turn a blind eye to injustice. Maroof says he “understands that I may not be able to change the world, but I can help to change minds”.\nMaroof sees a future where education is “not seen as an assembly-driven provision, stifling creativity and the huge potential children have”. He believes that “school league tables need to be scrapped as they give an over-inflated impression of schools that have a higher ability intake. Our children’s achievements should be celebrated without turning it into a game between schools”. Instead of league tables, he suggests a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to evaluating school performances, “one that takes into account a broad range of factors and acknowledges the complexity of education”, he is committed to making this vision a reality by continuing the good work he has contributed to during his time as Vice Chair of Education, Children, and Families.\nPlease contact me if you have any enquiries about my candidacy or if you would like to display a poster in support of my campaign maroof.raouf@councillor.sheffield.gov.uk or 07367123276",

We are fully behind the implementation of Clean Air Zones. Thanks to long-running national campaigns on air pollution, these are now a legal requirement in cities like Sheffield, to improve the quality of life for residents in the shortest possible time.\n“Removing polluting vehicles from the inner ring road will have a positive impact on the health of residents across the whole city. It will also save the hard-pressed and under-funded NHS from treating people with chronic respiratory conditions.\n“Millions of pounds in grant funding have sat in the council’s bank account due to prevarication. We want this money to be allocated without further delay to taxi and van drivers so that we are meeting our legal commitments on air quality and getting important cash to local businesses.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson added,\n“As the former Executive Member responsible for promoting the Clean Air Zone, I was very pleased when the Labour–Green Executive approved the CAZ in October 2021 and accepted £24 million of government money to offer grants to upgrade taxis, buses and vans to cleaner vehicles. It is disappointing that these grants to small businesses are now being delayed again after sitting in the council’s bank account since 2020.”\nNOTES\n1.

The Sheffield Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid is an umbrella group and includes the Sheffield Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, Sheffield Trades Council, Kairos Sheffield, and Sheffield Labour Friends of Palestine. Sheffield Green Party members voted to join the Coalition in March 2023\nOfficial advice to councillors was that the Council would be “at risk of” acting unlawfully. Councillor Johnson addressed this, prior to the meeting, by saying,\n“For the council to join the Sheffield Coalition against Israeli Apartheid, it would be a powerful symbolic statement that we stand against division and for human rights.\n“Just as in the days of apartheid in South Africa in 1981, it is right for this council to make a stand, just as the full council voted for in November 2023. I fully accept we have to comply with democratic laws – even the ones we disagree with. However, in this instance, I do not believe the legal restrictions prevent us from joining the Sheffield Coalition.\n“I believe the duty is on all of us to stand up and say that the awful death-toll in Gaza and the total displacement of an entire population is wrong. If we don’t stand up and say this now, who will and when?”\nLib Dem and Labour Councillors voted against joining the coalition at the Strategy and Resources Committee, with only the Green councillors supporting it.\nREFERENCES\n1 – The Council resolution in November 2023 noted that “Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, B’tselem and the South African government recognise that the Israeli Government is enacting a system of apartheid” and requested that the Strategy and Resources Policy Committee consider whether the Council should join the Sheffield Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid.

Detailed work by Councillors across the political divide has made this year’s council budget meeting a relatively smooth one.\n“This is even more noteworthy when you consider this was one of Sheffield’s toughest budgets ever with the Council having to find nearly £80 million to make the books balance. Under the previous cabinet system we would most likely have had no agreed decisions till budget day itself.\n“It is not just the Committee System though that has had a positive impact. it is the fact that we have a Council where no party has overall control. Different political groups have had to engage with each other to achieve agreement. They have had to understand the issues and not just oppose for the opposition’s sake. I’m not saying everything is perfect. We still have politicians who are tribal in their approach to politics but under the current arrangements that doesn’t get in the way of the council making the decisions it needs to make to function properly.\n“As natural co-operators, Greens work well in a Committee system and we have played an important role in helping get agreement on the detail of the budget.”\nAll Parties on the Council put forward amendments at the Council meeting to express what their priorities would be if they had a majority. There was a debate and all the amendments were voted on and each was defeated in turn. There was then a vote on a joint Labour, Lib Dem Green Amendment which was then passed. This amendment to the budget proposed an additional £25,000/per ward (£700,000 in total) to be used to address local priorities and a further £400,000 to help address poverty and the cost of living crisis. Thanks to Green Party requests, this is to be allocated according to the levels of deprivation in the city.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“Knowing the likely outcome of the vote. Parties wisely came together in advance of the meeting to ensure that they were able to get some additional funding for the people they represent and also to direct more support to those in the greatest need. This is so different from last year. It shows that, when politicians decide to work together, local people are the ones who benefit.\n“I’m proud of the role the Greens have played in this, as supporters of the committee system and as councillors who can help bring other parties together. We need to ensure that this change in Sheffield politics is something that we keep and that we don’t go back to the bad old days.”",

Liberal Democrat and Labour Cllrs voted to pass the application with only a sole representative from each of their parties voting against it.\nCllr Brian Holmshaw said,\n“The 35,000 square metres of concrete, tarmac and brick of the Meadowhall extension represents a danger to Sheffield’s city centre, to our small businesses and to our environment.”\nThe Council report on the development admitted that the city centre is fragile with high shop vacancy levels, including the Debenhams and John Lewis sites. Despite this, Council Planning officers recommended expansion at Meadowhall. Up to 2 per cent impact on city centre trade was forecast, resulting in dozens of family-owned businesses and jobs lost, and more indirectly affected.\nCllr Holmshaw said,\n“The new retail park and leisure development will damage Carbrook retail centre, Valley Centertainment, Rotherham and Barnsley town centres, Parkgate shopping centre and small businesses in South Yorkshire”.\nFollowing the vote Green Party Councillor Brian Holmshaw said:\n‘”I simply could not vote for this application. Those of us around in the 1990s saw how damaging Meadowhall was to city centre trade then, a legacy that lives with us now. Why would we want to further damage our city’s economy well into the future?’\n‘Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council objected to this application. If Rotherham Council can stand up for its town centre then why can’t Sheffield stand up for its centre too? The dubious claim about the 2029 start date to help Sheffield city centre recover from the pandemic does not wash either. In reality, it will take that long to build a new expanded Meadowhall anyway.’\nIt is worrying that the developers are not interested in increasing the site’s biodiversity by installing bat boxes, swift bricks and bird nesting sites and increasing wildflower planting. This would improve the biodiversity of the woodlands and green river corridors that run by the site. Instead, Biodiversity Net Gain can only be achieved through ‘off-site provision’. That means somewhere else. That is concerning and sets a dangerous precedent for other riverside developments in Sheffield”\nFurther Information\nFrom Sheffield Retail and Leisure Study 2022\n1. ‘[Our] survey of the centre has demonstrated that since 2016 the comparison goods offer of Sheffield city centre has deteriorated considerably. This is exemplified by the closure of the John Lewis department store at Barker’s Pool and the Debenhams at The Moor (alongside the loss of a number of other high profile comparison goods national multiples).’\n2. ‘[We note] the significant increase in vacant units. Our survey recorded a total of 139 vacant units, accounting for 25.3% of all units in the city centre. This figure is significantly in excess of the current national level, which equates to 14.1% of all commercial units being vacant. The 2022 vacancy rate also represents a slight increase on the 23.7% of vacant units recorded at 2016.’\nFrom the planning officer’s report to planning committee\n3. ‘The most recent (October 2022) footfall report for Sheffield City Centre, published by Sheffield BID, identifies that notwithstanding some peaks (May and July) where 2022 footfall levels exceeded 2019 levels, the overall year on year comparison predicts that total annual footfall in 2022 is likely to be 19.4% lower than was the case in 2019.’ (page 172)\n4. ‘the proposed retail floorspace on Plot 5 can be seen as a potential further risk to retaining a healthy level of comparison goods retailing within the City Centre. Moreover, the trade draw of the development overall can be seen as a risk to addressing the current issue with reduced footfall, the high proportion of City Centre units which are vacant and the attractiveness of marketing City Centre vacant units for refurbishment, re-use and investment, including opportunities for re-purposing large vacant retail units to leisure use’ (page 172)\n5 ‘It is also acknowledged that many of the existing centres which the proposed development will draw trade from, including Sheffield City Centre and Rotherham Town centre, are in a relatively fragile ‘post-pandemic’ condition, with relatively high vacancy rates, a struggling comparison goods retail sector and footfall which is only now beginning to rebound following the pandemic (although remaining C. 20% below 2019 levels upon the basis of Sheffield BID’s October 2022 2019 v.s 2022 year on year comparison). The issues affecting the existing centres within the Meadowhall catchment is compounded by a general restructuring of the retail (comparison goods) sector in recent years which has seen the withdrawal of several significant retailers from the units which they previously occupied in existing centres, including the Debenhams and John Lewis units in Sheffield City Centre.’ (page 182)",

Sheffield Council, along with High Peak Borough Council and Tameside Council, has already declared a climate emergency.\nSheffield Greens are concerned that improving the attractiveness of the Snake Pass will mean more cars squeezing through Broomhill and Malin Bridge to reach the A57.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“Heavy traffic through Mottram, on the Sheffield to Manchester route, has been a long-term issue. But rather than more road-building and private car mileage, we would prefer to see the money spent on better public transport links between the two cities. There must be an incentive for more people to travel by rail and not by private car.”\nChristine Gilligan Kubo, Hillsborough Green Party commented:\n“This council must prioritise public transport, walking and cycling; and stop nodding through damaging planning applications that bring many more car journeys to blight local communities. Coming soon to this area are a new Lidl at the bottom of Stannington Rd and a retail park with an Aldi opposite the Wednesday ground on Penistone Rd. All these direct more traffic through an already clogged and polluted Malin Bridge gyratory. Malin Bridge and Hillsborough Corner face gridlock and the trams are also delayed by this congestion which needs to be addressed urgently.”\nRoy Morris, of Sheffield Green Party, said,\n“I frequently shop in Broomhill and am very aware of the bad smell and the effect the poor air quality is having on our health. Therefore, I am strongly opposed to anything that would increase the volume of traffic through the neighbourhood. So, if this Mottram by-pass is going to get more people giving up on the train and going by car, and driving through Broomhill, then I’d be against it. as well as the train, there is the SnakeX57 bus they’ve just started, that comes through here empty. But more traffic through here? No thank you.”\nENDS\nFor more information please contact Douglas Johnson on 07981 860 662 or at douglas.johnson@sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nSheffield Green Party’s response to Highways England states:\nI am writing to respond to the consultation. I am the leader of the Green Party group of councillors on Sheffield City Council. This response includes some expert views of our local members which we trust is helpful in explaining why we oppose this road expansion.\nWe believe that a reduction in road transport and radical moves towards a transport network, based to a much greater extent on public transport, are essential to meet the challenges of air pollution and climate change. Therefore, all new road expansion proposals need to be examined especially carefully at a time when travel habits and policy are rapidly changing.\nHeavy traffic through Mottram, as a route from Sheffield to Manchester, has been a long-term issue. The link roads are designed partly to relieve this but would push the most serious congestion further east. Tintwistle and Glossop, particularly Dinting Vale, already have serious, almost continuous, day-time congestion which, to a large degree, is independent of the Mottram congestion. It is, however, worsened by the latter. Given that new roads attract greater volumes of traffic, we should assume those areas will suffer even more. It is naïve – negligent even – to assume otherwise. The tranquillity of the Peak District National Park in between them would also be clearly harmed.\nYet, there is a much more serious and wider issue that is not being addressed. This is to urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the climate emergency that Parliament and numerous local authorities across the country, including Sheffield City Council, have recognised.\nIn October 2019, High Peak Council also declared a Climate Emergency and “pledged to work towards a carbon neutral High Peak by 2030.” In November 2019, Derbyshire County Council pledged to become carbon neutral by 2032. In February 2020, Tameside Council declared a Climate Emergency and is now committed to become ‘carbon neutral’ by 2042 target with 13.1% year on year reductions in climate emissions.\nThe link road proposals should be assessed against these ambitions. Yet Highways England’s Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) Vol 1 dismissively states: –\n“14.3.11 There is no accepted technical or policy guidance on how to determine the significance of a project’s effects on climate. “\nHowever, the Government’s own official Climate Change Committee has repeatedly warned that current policies will not put the UK on a path towards meeting the legally binding Climate Change Act. Its recent recommendations for more rapid emissions reductions (by 68% rather than 61% by 2030) have been accepted. The Government clearly accepts the need for more rapid action but there still a wide gap between the targets and the policies designed to meet them.\nWe therefore believe it appropriate to compare the stated impacts of the scheme to The Tameside Council climate ambitions, which are supported by recent robust evidence. Some of the scheme would be in High Peak so, in practice, the impacts would be divided between the two Local Authority areas. [https://carbonbudget.manchester.ac.uk/reports/E08000008/ ]\nThis Tyndall Centre report shows that Tameside has a carbon budget of 4.57 MtCO2e for the period 2025-2032 [this figure is derived from Figure 1]. If the proportion of this for surface transport is 27%, as it is nationally [PEIR 14.4.1], this would be 1.23 MtCO2e.\nThe emissions attributable to the scheme over this period are given in Section 14.6 of the PEIR. If the construction emissions are accounted for evenly between 2025 and 2032 and in the transport sector, total emissions from the scheme up to the end of 2032 (the end of the national Fifth Carbon Budget period) would be 110757t. This represents 9% of Tameside’s notional transport carbon budget. For just two link roads, that is clearly a disproportionate share of the total emissions targets for an entire Local Authority area (or more accurately, a smaller share spread across two).\nThe various authorities in the area need to develop a coherent transport strategy which recognises how quickly greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced. It would also bring air quality within legal limits. These new link roads cannot reasonably fit with any such plan. New road building will have to be minimised, in common with everywhere else in the UK.\nAuthorities and their partners in both Manchester and Sheffield are developing transport strategies that involve reductions in road traffic. These involve a much greater emphasis on providing facilities local to where people live, active travel and public transport. These plans would be hampered by increased road traffic between the two cities.\nPublic subsidy for this road-building scheme would tilt the attractiveness of the choice between road and rail travel between Sheffield and Manchester in favour of more private motors. This would inevitably worsen air pollution and climate change at all points along the route overall. It would also increase the knock-on effects of congestion in the Sheffield districts of Malin Bridge and Broomhill at the entrances to the A57 route.\nWe urge that this scheme be withdrawn because of the wider climate change issue and also because of the local impact on Sheffield residents.\nYours faithfully,\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We’ve got to a stage where if a developer says jump, the Council says “how high?” “22 storeys?”\nIn late 2017 the council advised that Castlegate was to be developed as a digital quarter. However, quoting property consultants Lane Walker: “Leisure operators were thought to be far more appropriate for the hotel units than shops. It’s not really a retail pitch. This is more of a restaurant-based pitch, in my opinion. That’s where Castlegate is going.” Are they right?\nThe plan is for the new easyHotel on the site of the old C&A to have commercial units in “the basement, and ground and upper floors that agents are hoping to fill with up to five operators such as gyms, bars and restaurants.” Plus a new block of residential flats at the western end of the old Primark building that could reach 22 storeys. That puts paid to any pretence of a tall-buildings policy in the city. Or concentrating them in one area so they don’t break up the skyline and views – one of Sheffield’s best attributes in my opinion. Is this what we want for the historic centre of our city?\nStatistics just released show only 1.4 % of houses built in Sheffield in 2016 and 2017 met the government’s criteria of affordable homes. With a real need for good-quality, affordable housing, Sheffield has brought in an “affordable-free zone” for developers in the city centre and the profits will go out of the city.\nSheffield Green Party has pushed for many years for a city centre that has a good balance between affordable living accommodation and retail, office and entertainment spaces while supporting small businesses.\nThere is no community involvement in this plan. Even planners have been sidelined. There is nothing that is human-scale or about local investment. It does not respect the urban environment, existing buildings or established businesses in the area.\nOnce again this is a top-down decision making, knock-it-down, build-it-new scheme.\nMartin Phipps\nGreen Party, City ward\nLetter to the Sheffield Star in response to https://www.thestar.co.uk/business/22-storey-tower-of-flats-on-the-way-for-sheffield-city-centre-along-with-boost-from-shops-restaurants-and-leisure-venues-1-9050466\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

South Cambridgeshire District Council brought in a 4 day week over a 15 month period saving this small Council £370,000.\nCouncillor Toby Mallinson said\n“The principle of a 4 day working week is that 100% of the work is done in 80% of the hours. Flexible working means that the Council operations will continue to be delivered throughout the traditional working week. It does not mean that the Council will close on one day per week. There is strong evidence that people get more done in less hours by working more efficiently.\n“A 4 day working week could be attractive to employees as it means those with caring responsibilities have more flexibility and it also helps people who volunteer in the community. The shorter week helps people’s health and wellbeing, meaning less staff sickness and greater staff retention. This reduces the cost of replacing and training new staff and of recruitment. Being able to employ and retain more permanent staff means the Council doesn’t have to use expensive agency staff and so saves the Council money.\n“The UK suffers from chronic low productivity alongside high levels of stress at work. A lot of people work very hard in systems that are very inefficient. Moving to a 4-day working week without reduction in pay or benefits has been shown to create a big change in the way employers operate with huge benefits for their employees.\n“A recent trial with 61 companies found that 56 continued after the trial. Benefits included improved productivity, well-being, work-life balance, recruitment & retention, sickness absence, and carbon emissions.\n“An Independent report by both Salford and Cambridge University, into a 4 week trial at South Cambridgeshire District Council found improved performance across a range of Council performance indicators including staff turnover, number of calls answered, number of planning applications processed, invoices paid on time and the percentage of complaints responded to within timescale.\n“The new Labour Government no longer supports a block on Councils introducing a 4 day working week, which was the position held by the previous Conservative Government.This gives Sheffield City Council an opportunity to introduce a 4 day week trial and assess what savings can be realised and performance improvements can be achieved under these new working arrangements.\n“Sheffield Green Councillors believe that our Council should investigate the experience of other Councils who have trialled the 4-day week with a view to trialling the idea in Sheffield. As a lead employer in the city, the Council should be forward thinking and demonstrate well researched good practice to other employers. Such change could also reduce costs through improved productivity.”\nThe Labour Party voted against the proposal and the Liberal Democrats abstained. This meant that the proposal was not passed on this occasion.",

Like many, I’ve followed developments in the news, but also in text messages with friends out there. One of my friends fled Kharkiv only a few days ago, after over a week of shelling from Russian armed forces. It’s wonderful that people across Sheffield have worked to help Ukrainians, collecting for aid, raising funds, offering shelter for refugees.\nAnother thing that we can do is turn down the amount of gas we use, which turns down Putin’s cashflow for invasions. Individually, we can set the thermostat lower and switch to energy suppliers who don’t use gas-fired power stations. But most important are the actions we need to take together.\nTo cut their own dependency on Russian gas, Germany has set an ambition for being renewable powered by 2035. We can show the same ambition in Sheffield and the UK. The first step is to make sure that any firms profiteering from high energy prices are taxed fairly. The second step is using those windfall taxes to help people suffering from fuel poverty, including by properly insulating homes. The third step is to get energy to heat our homes from renewables. People have raised fracking and nuclear energy as alternatives, but those take at least a decade to get going. Renewables work right now. Sadly, the UK has been heading in the wrong direction. Employment in the renewable energy economy fell by about 28,000 jobs since 2014 along with a massive fall in home insulation. We need to turn it round. If Germany can wean themselves off gas then so can we.\nSheffield Greens are pushing in Council for super insulated homes to guarantee low energy bills. The ‘Energiesprong’ scheme has run successfully in other areas, rapidly fits new insulated wall and roof sections, complete with solar panels and triple glazing, to give a warm, comfortable home with virtually no heating bill. We need these measures now more than ever. We need to have the ambition to tackle the climate crisis, create jobs, and cut bills. That will stop money flowing from our pockets into those of Vladimir Putin and other profiteers and tyrants. Now is the time to turn down the gas.\nLogan Robin\nWalkley Ward candidate for Sheffield Green Party",

But also that a further £2.5 million of taxpayers money will be paid to Stagecoach to compensate them for the 3 year delay. Originally, South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive built Supertram at a cost of £240 million and, in 1997, just 2 years after it opened, sold it to Stagecoach for just £1.15 million. Stagecoach are now seeking more compensation for delayed upgrades on the East Coast main rail line.\nGreens believe we need to act urgently to get public transport back into public hands. By taking back individual rail franchises when they expire, or when a company fails to meet its franchise conditions, the government could save £1 billion a year. That could be spent on improving services and reducing rail fares. We also need to re-regulate buses, investing in increased bus services especially those at risk in rural and other poorly served areas.\nEamonn Ward\nSheffield Green Party\nIn reply to ‘Ministers considered scrapping Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train scheme due to ballooning costs says report‘, Sheffield Star.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Sheffield Green Party is joining the call for Vaccines for All, regardless of immigration status and without the need for ID or proof of address.\nThe Hostile Environment creates a culture of fear and discourages people from getting vaccinated.\nTherefore, the Department of Health and Social Care must:\n-\nGuarantee a firewall that prevents any patient information gathered by the NHS or Test and Trace being used for the purposes of immigration enforcement.\n-\nEnd all Hostile Environment measures in the NHS, including charging for migrants, to combat the fear and mistrust these policies have created.\n-\nProvide specific support to all GP surgeries to register everyone, including undocumented and under-documented migrants and those without secure accommodation, and ensure that all other routes to vaccination are accessible to everyone.\n-\nFund a public information campaign to ensure that communities impacted by the Hostile Environment are aware of their right to access the vaccine and the steps taken above.\nAlexi Dimond, Green Councillor for Gleadless Valley said,\n“Sheffield Green Party are proud to be a signatory to the demands put together by Patients Not Passports Campaign Network. A health worker’s duty is to care for their patients, not to act as border guards. The UK is one of the wealthiest countries in the world; so the denial of healthcare to anyone is a political choice. Healthcare must be available to all, free at the point of need. The Hostile Environment has a devastating impact on peoples’ health and the NHS itself, as treatment is often delayed until there is acute need, or worse.”\nMaroof Raouf, Green Councillor for Nether Edge and Sharrow said,\n“Sheffielders would be shocked at the trauma inflicted by the Hostile Environment, which discourages people from accessing healthcare. Helping everyone get vaccinated against Covid-19 keeps us all safe. The “Vaccines for All” campaign sets out how to do that. Hopefully the Department of Health and Social Care will follow their lead.”\nENDS\nFor more information please contact Alexi Dimond on 07766 541 528 or at alexi.dimond@\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n1.

They presented the report to this month’s council meeting.\nIt surprised many people that the report merely set out calculations of the amount of CO2 emissions to be reduced. There was no suggestion how it was going to be achieved. As I pointed out in my speech, one thing was missing – what the Council was going to do about it.\nHowever, it seems that some Labour councillors still need to be convinced that climate change is real. One veteran councillor stood up to argue that global warming was natural and not man-made. I believe it is wrong to play with our children’s futures by pretending climate change isn’t real.\nThe other debate responded to the It’s Our City petition. This campaign aims to change the council to something better than the “strong leader” model of local government, where almost all decision-making is in the hands of the Leader of the Council. There are now nearly enough signatures to force the council to hold a referendum on the matter.\nThe Green Party has long advocated this change. It is an opportunity for the council to modernise the way it approaches decisions. Under a new model, all 84 councillors could have some sort of responsibility for decision-making. After all, that is what we are elected for.\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

In the last few weeks, Israel has launched an aerial bombing campaign and ground invasion of Lebanon, attacking residential tower blocks, hospitals, journalists and UN peacekeepers in an illegal and indiscriminate campaign similar to its assault on Gaza. So far over 2000 people are reported to have been killed and over 1 million people displaced.\nLast night, the world awoke to the sight of Palestinian civilians being burnt alive in their tents as Israel escalates its genocide in Gaza – attacking hospitals, encircling Jabalia refugee camp, and ordering 400,000 people to leave the north of Gaza despite there being no safe route to do so. This is amid reports that it has decided to “ethnically cleanse the entirety of northern Gaza through a campaign of starvation and extermination” known as “The Generals Plan”. The World Food Programme reports that no food has reached northern Gaza since 1st October.\nWe also note with horror, the UN’s Third Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel . The report details attacks on hospitals and the use of violence, torture, rape and sexual assault against Palestinian detainees, including children and medical personnel.

That’s a decade of missing jobs, lost opportunities and lost business rates. After our long campaign, these new council plans are a huge step forward.”\n“There is room for further improvements and Green Party councillors will be keeping a close eye on the scheme’s implementation.”\nNotes\n- Cllr Jillian Creasy’s letter of 18th September 2008 regarding the original New Retail Quarter is at http://archive.sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2008/09/18/will-the-nrq-have-room-for-local-shops/\n- The Council’s new city centre development plans are at: https://www.heartofcity2.com/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Green Councillors argued that developers need to show what they are doing on the climate crisis and help improve building standards, with a majority of Sheffield City Councillors backing the proposal.\nGreen Councillor Angela Argenzio who led the proposal said “COP26 fell well short of what was needed to maintain a stable climate so at the local level we need to work even harder to reduce carbon emissions. Energy efficiency standards in UK building regulations are poor compared to many places across Europe. New homes are using more energy, producing more greenhouse gases and costing the people who live there more than they should to heat and power them.”\nGreens called on the Council to ensure that all developers submitting a Planning Application complete a Developers Climate Change Declaration detailing what they will do beyond the minimum requirements of building regulations to address climate change.\nDevelopers would be required to specify how they would reduce energy demand in new homes and buildings, what local and low carbon materials they will use, how they will reduce the risk of flooding and how they will protect nature in their development. Evidence gathered from the submissions will be used to lobby Government for improved building regulations.\n“What we really need is for the Government to simply improve the law so developers are required to build to the very highest standards. In the absence of strong government policies the Council can highlight and promote the very best practice of developers locally and also shine a light on those builders who are doing the bare minimum.” said Councillor Argenzio\n“The Developers Climate Change Declaration is both a carrot and a stick” said Cllr Peter Garbutt who seconded the Green Group motion in Council. Peter argues that “It will encourage developers who go the extra mile to super insulate and use renewables as well as ensuring those who build to the lowest standard are visible to local people. It also makes no sense to build to a low standard now and then come back in a few years to make them energy efficient at great expense. We want all homes to be Green homes and this motion is an important step in that direction.”\nThis is just the latest initiative by Green Councillors, following measures aiming to improve public transport, promote grants to help small businesses cut carbon-emissions, and implement a Clean Air Zone.",

It’s no longer just rural services under threat. Now all areas of Sheffield are suffering bus service cuts.\nThe high-frequency, double-decker, 52a no longer goes beyond Hillsborough Interchange. The replacement is the daytime only, unreliable, infrequent, low capacity, 31 service which does not run on Sundays. This has hit all groups of bus users in Wisewood and Loxley communities very hard:\n– For working people, the loss of a frequent, reliable, direct service to the city centre and key employers like Hallamshire Hospital. It will force some people to drive when we need to reduce car use to meet the city’s climate change targets.\n-For many older and vulnerable people, the loss of a frequent, 7 days a week option for daily shopping, medical appointments or just getting out of the house. If the 31 fails to turn up or is full, you have a one-hour wait. This happens frequently and is particularly harsh in cold weather.\n-For school students and parents, the loss of their direct 52a service to central secondary schools.\nManchester mayor Andy Burnham has taken more control over buses in his region by introducing franchising. South Yorkshire’s new mayor, Oliver Coppard, has understood how bad our buses are unlike his predecessor Dan Jarvis. He’s started applying for similar franchising powers but it’s a long process. We must keep up the pressure on Coppard and the councils which make up the mayoral authority to ensure we get back public control, rather than the unregulated chaos we have at present.\nI’d like to thank local community activist Nicola Feetham whose 52a petition with more than 2300 signatures has kept up the pressure to provide vital services in the Hillsborough area. Also Better Buses for South Yorkshire who continue to campaign relentlessly on our behalf.\nHillsborough Greens have asked the mayor to make a more frequent 31 service a funding priority. Greens across South Yorkshire will not give up pushing the mayor, bus companies and the Tory Government to provide the investment and services we need across all local communities.\nToby Mallinson\nCouncil Election candidate, Hillsborough Green Party",

We should be proud that Sheffield has retained its 39,000 council homes in public ownership and control.”\nHe also commended the cross-party working that had helped the committee overcome the huge funding gap of £23 million and agree the best proposal that could be had. In spite of rising inflation, the council had:\n– provided nearly 1000 new council homes,\n– Improved its repairs performance, even though there was a long way to go\n– Reduced the number of empty council homes\n– Re-roofed and insulated 7000 council homes\n– Started to put solar panels on council housing roofs\n– Tripled the hardship fund to help tenants with the cost of living\n– Mobilised resources to respond to the large-scale emergency in Stannington in December.\nHowever, Cllr Johnson called out Labour Party criticisms that there was not enough money to build as many houses as desired, saying,\n“In view of their somewhat point-scoring press release, it was disappointing that Labour failed to offer any proposals to meet the £200m funding gap in the stock increase programme. That may explain why they had in fact already voted to reduce the housing target.\n“Labour councillors claimed that cities like Bristol, which still has Labour Party overall control, were spending more on their stock increase programme until I pointed out that Bristol City Council had actually reduced their target from 2000 to 1700 homes.\nAfter an extended debate , the full council agreed unanimously to the proposed budget.\nSpeaking after the budget had been passed, Councillor Douglas Johnson said\n“No one wanted to reduce the number of houses we committed to build but the reality is that rising construction costs have made it impossible to keep to the original target. Councillors from all parties, including Labour Councillors, understood that. Greens only have 2 votes on the Housing Committee so seeking to blame the Greens for taking responsibility in a difficult financial climate is clearly nothing more than politicking.\nLabour could come up with no examples of any other Council which had not had to reduce its ambitions due to rising costs. They did mention Bristol City Council as an example but failed to mention that the Bristol Stock Increase programme is being reduced from 2000 to 1700 units due to 20% increase in building cost inflation and that the cost of build per unit has risen from £220k to £270k, similar to Sheffield’s.\nThe time for doing the detailed work on the issues the council faces is the Council Committee meetings. Hand wringing about problems that they have no answers to in Full Council is clearly just for show. We all care about the problems but we must equally take responsibility for finding solutions.\nReferences\n1 -The Housing Policy Committee has nine members: 4 Labour, 3 LibDem and 2 Green Party.\n2 – The Housing Revenue Account is the ring-fenced account for council tenants. It works on the principle that council tenants should not subsidise, or be subsidised by, other council taxpayers\n3 – The Housing Revenue Account includes money to put towards capital expenditure on new council houses, housing improvements, home insulation and retrofitting.\n4 – The Stock Increase Programme is the council’s strategy to build or buy more council homes. Due to rising costs of inflation, the budget will no longer stretch to build the original target of 3,100 homes. In December, all party groups voted to reduce this target to 2310 new homes to contain the programme within its budget.",

Sheffield City Council officers have been developing this policy.\nThe policy, approved by the Finance Committee today, is welcomed by Green Councillors Marieanne Elliot and Toby Mallinson.\nRecent research by AdFree Cities evidences that advertising and inequality go hand in hand. A case study in Sheffield shows that 56% of outdoor advertising is in the 3 most deprived areas and there’s only 8% in the 3 least deprived areas.\nCllr Elliot said;\n“Advertising has a direct effect on the way we make decisions and children are particularly vulnerable to marketing techniques that promote unhealthy diets.\n“I’m pleased that the policy recognises that it is irresponsible to promote food and drink with little or no nutritional value that’s high in sugar and fat. It also recognises that gambling is a public health issue.\n“The policy even goes as far as stating that high carbon/ fossil fuel organisations and products can influence opinion by using greenwashing to mislead people. This is real progress. Introducing this policy is a strong move for Sheffield as it tackles some of the impacts of consumerism, advertising and injustice. If we seriously want to move away from greenwashing and promoting products and foods that are making our health worse and negatively affecting our wellbeing we need policies like this.\n“If I were to draw out any areas for improvement, I’d like to see restrictions on fossil fuel financiers like the big banks – Barclays and HSBC for example.\n“The new policy will not be binding on the advertising companies straight away as their existing contractual terms still apply, until their renewal/ expiration date. This means that we might not see the changes as quickly as we would like.\n“The inconsiderate positioning of advertising boards is not something that this policy deals with. We have advertising boards obstructing pavements and cycle lanes in Sheffield and we need to deal with that. Also, the positioning of boards can cause light pollution and detrimentally affect wildlife, this should be a planning consideration.\n“A further step would be a moratorium on new digital advertising boards. These boards can use as much electricity each as 4 average homes. Unfortunately there was a missed opportunity by not including this in the new local plan. I am pleased that council officers will now take away my request to look at this.\n“JCDecaux and Clear Channel currently have a total of 146 advertising boards across the city. This number does not include adverts on bus stops (controlled by the region), phone boxes or privately owned property. The policy will not address those. It would be great to see the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Mayoral Authority follow suit with a review of its bus stop advertising Hopefully other local authorities will be inspired by Sheffield’s progressive policy too.”\nCllr Mallinson said;\n“The policy recognises that outdoor advertising affects and influences people. Large multinational companies spend millions on advertising for a reason. Advertising can promote products which are damaging to our environment and our wellbeing and the council has a responsibility to put measures in place to address this.\n“The concentration of advertising in particular areas is a real concern – you can’t escape it! City, Darnall, Burngreave, Hillsborough and Broomhill & Sharrow Vale are the five most affected wards.\n“An important aspect of the new policy is that it differentiates between advertising that local businesses may need locally, and advertising from national and multinational corporations on large illuminated bill-boards. In order to support a transition away from a throw-away carbon intensive culture we need to progressively reduce and even eliminate advertising from national and multinational corporations in line with the aims of the Adfree Cities campaign.”\nVeronica Wignall, co-director at Adfree Cities said;\n“This is a bold and common sense policy that firmly prioritises climate action and the health and wellbeing of people in Sheffield over the financial profits of advertising companies and global brands. Sheffield has set a standard for other councils across the UK – we hope to see many others follow suit.”\nMedia reports;\nSpecialist media:\nand for pure entertainment\nReferences\nSheffield’s Advertising Policy – Item 10 on Finance Committee Agendas\nAd Free Cities Campaign https://adfreecities.org.uk/unavoidable-impact/",

The government has also published plans for a ‘sunset clause’ on environmental protections introduced when the UK was in the EU. In addition, reports have suggested that the planned Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) is to be scrapped. This would have paid farmers to improve nature on their land.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Green group leader, said\n“Our local conservative MP represents many rural voters, and people who enjoy our local countryside, who will be up in arms about the government proposals. They should not feel duty-bound to back the government over plans that are almost the direct opposite of manifesto promises and have never been put to the British people. We need all our local politicians, whichever party they come from, to stand up for nature, and to make plain that we can have robust local economies whilst also helping nature to recover. Our local Tory MP has a special responsibility to say NO to her new leaders, on behalf of our community.”\nThere is widespread anger in response to government plans to remove fundamental legal protections for our environment. Opposition has come from many organisations ranging from the RSPB and National Trust through to the Wildlife Trusts and Friends of the Earth.\nIn a three-pronged assault on nature, Ms Truss and Mr Kwarteng plan to;\n• Scrap planning rules that protect nature in new ‘investment zones’ covering huge areas of the country.[1] [2]\n• Rip up environmental protections introduced by the EU, without plans for replacement.[3]\n• Withdraw plans to help farmers to protect nature [4], with reports suggesting the ‘Environmental Land Management Scheme’ (ELMS) has been ‘put on hold’ whilst a return to a Common Agricultural Policy type per acre payment is expected, which will break a specific manifesto pledge [5].\nCouncillor Johnson said\n“Of course just before these announcements we also saw Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg open the door to environmentally damaging fracking, a policy that is widely opposed, will do nothing to reduce energy bills and which the founder of Cuadrilla himself says is unviable [6].\nThe responses from those who care for nature have been overwhelming. Joan Edwards, director of policy for The Wildlife Trusts, says these policies will mean “polluters can get away with poisoning our rivers and countryside – even more than they are doing already.” [7] Hilary McGrady of the National Trust says, “environmental protections are dismissed as ‘burdens’, while investment and growth are pitted against nature and climate action.”These proposals come as part of a ‘dash for growth’ package which is also spooking markets and ruining government finances. There is no mandate for these measures: they actually reverse the direction of travel on the environment in your 2019 manifesto and have never been put to the British people. Locally we have large parts of the Peak District National Park within Sheffield City Council’s boundaries. This is used for recreation, farming for local food and as a habitat for local wildlife. These are all threatened by these Government proposals.\nYet we know people’s livelihoods and local economies can be put on a sound footing with a three pronged approach to investment: in nature recovery, in renewable energy and in home insulation to reduce energy bills. Research has shown that “Protection and use of environmental assets is key to evening out economic imbalances between metropolitan and rural areas”[8]. In other words, the recovery of nature and the revival of local living standards should and can go hand-in hand.\nWe call on Conservatives to make plain to your party leaders that these policies must be reversed. We ask for a public statement from Miriam Cates MP on these policies.There is no case for staying silent, and every reason to stand up for your communities and for your local environment by making it plain that you will not support the tearing up of environmental protection and the reversal of attempts to help nature thrive.”\n________________________________________\n[1] https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-growth-plan-2022-factsheet-on-investment-zones/the-growth-plan-2022-investment-zones-factsheet\n[2] Map of investment zones: https://twitter.com/RSPBEngland/status/1573366828222808064\n[3] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-environment-laws-under-threat-in-deregulatory-free-for-all\n[4] https://www.edie.net/reports-defra-set-to-scrap-plans-to-pay-farmers-for-nature-restoration-and-creation/\n[5] ““in return for funding, [farmers] must farm in a way that protects and enhances our natural environment” https://www.conservatives.com/our-plan/conservative-party-manifesto-2019\n[6] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/21/fracking-wont-work-uk-founder-chris-cornelius-cuadrilla\n[7] https://www.birdguides.com/news/uk-government-launches-all-out-assault-on-environment/\n[8] https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/research/title_918714_en.htm",

There is no good reason for demolition of this core piece of Sheffield’s heritage, a decent, solid, not-very-flashy building that epitomises so much of the Sheffield that residents, young and old, find attractive.\nIt was no coincidence that 20,000 people signed a petition against its demolition in 2015. As a direct result of the council granting planning permission then, the independent shops were pressured to leave, the site looks run down; it is detrimental to the area.\nNevertheless, the answer is not to flatten it and finalise the tragedy of its loss but to revitalise it. Overlooking the popular Devonshire Green, there is hope for this fine setting if only its Sheffield heritage were respected. It could be a superb backdrop to those summer afternoons on the grass; it could be the reassuring brickwork to huddle against on wet autumn evenings.\nA soulless office block does none of this.\nIt is quite right that our officers recognise that this proposal goes contrary to the Devonshire Quarter Action Plan and draft City Centre Plan – a plan that makes the bold claim:\n“The Council wants to retain the distinct character of this area and will continue to support independent retailers to thrive.”\nIt is significant that the City Centre Plan was drawn up after the 20,000 signatures opposing the demolition of this block, such was the concern about the loss of these unique and quirky premises. That policy was adopted to address the deficiencies in the previous policy that allowed the 2015 planning permission to be granted so it should carry significant weight if it is to be meaningful.\nPlanning policy is meant to balance the needs and desires of local people against the demands of property developers. This is an opportunity for the council to demonstrate that support for its population.\nThe City Ward Councillors,\nDouglas Johnson\nMartin Phipps\nRuth Mersereau\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This means that the Council remains in “no overall control” with no party having a majority\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“Greens proposed that the Council has a Leader from one party and two Co-Deputy Leaders from the other two Party groups. This would have created a balanced Leadership Team to work together, providing direction to the Council on the important issues facing the city.\n“Greens also wanted to see Leaders come together on a weekly basis to agree on how to address strategic issues affecting the city. This would reflect the wishes of the voters of Sheffield who did not provide any party with an outright majority.\n“This also represents a further move away from the old “Strong Leader” model that was so decisively rejected by the electorate in the governance referendum in 2021 and in local elections where the public voted the council into no-overall-control.\n“Given the new Labour Leader was not even elected by a majority of his own Council group then he clearly does not have a strong mandate to lead the Council on his own. For the stability of the Council, it is important that Party Leaders work together to provide the certainty that local people and council officers need to give them a new sense of confidence in Sheffield City Council.\nThere were 3 nominations for Leader of the Council. Labour proposed Cllr Tom Hunt, the Liberal Democrats proposed Shaffaq Mohammed and the Green Party proposed Cllr Douglas Johnson.\nAll nominations were voted down.\nNew Labour Leader Tom Hunt was elected Leader of the Council following a run-off vote against Shaffaq Mohammed. The Green councillors didn’t support either candidate. As Tom Hunt got the support of the Labour Group and had the most votes, he became the Leader of the Council.\nUnfortunately, the Green Party proposal for one Leader and Co-Deputy Leaders was rejected but in a positive new development Party Leaders and Deputy Leaders will now meet together regularly with senior council officers to discuss current issues facing the Council and provide a steer on a cross-party basis.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“This is definitely a move in the right direction and will further strengthen the cross-party working that has been developed in the first year of the Council’s Committee system. More consideration of issues facing the Council across political divides will help us make better decisions.”\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nThe Council’s rules for selecting a leader are:\nIf there are more than two people nominated for any position to be filled and there is not a clear majority of votes in favour of one person, then the name of the person with the least number of votes will be taken off the list and a new vote taken. The process will continue until there is a majority of votes for one person. In the event of a tie between the last two persons, the Chair shall have a second or casting vote.",

Driven grouse moors occupy 21% of the Peak District. The government pays millions to moorland owners to fund supposedly “environmentally beneficial management practices”. That consists of burning vegetation, which damages vital peat bogs, to create breeding conditions for grouse to be shot at £3000 a day events. Meanwhile, birds of prey are a rare sight in the Peak District, with a huge number of tracked birds disappearing over grouse moors.\nThis madness has to stop. Rewilding Britain wants 10% of the Peak District as a core rewilding area with nature recovery goals set in a further 50%. Ecologists in Sheffield also have great ideas for work on the moors that also contributes to the “Outdoor City.”\nUnfortunately, a lot of the moorland is privately owned. It’s encouraging to see Yorkshire Water ending grouse shooting tenancies on their land. The National Trust has just announced it is considering this for leases that cover 13% of the Peak District.\nWe need to end grouse shooting in the Peak District and restore sustainable environmental practices. More rain falls on the moors than anywhere else, so good management of moorlands is critical to stop our town and city centres flooding. The risk of moorland fires will also be reduced and peat will be protected – all helping address the rapidly accelerating climate emergency.\nIt’s also quite clear that the illegal persecution of the hen harriers, goshawks and eagles we want to see flourish in our national parks will stop when grouse shooting stops.\nIf you want to help achieve these goals, please support the excellent local work of Moorland Monitors and Rewilding Britain’s “Wilder National Parks” campaign.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Executive member for climate change, environment and transport, Sheffield City Council",

I’m going to introduce myself, tell you why transport is close to my heart and talk about how we revolutionise the way we live, work and play with energy, jobs and skills leading us to a better future.\n“My name is Bex Whyman, I am a full time Senior Analyst and mother. I have experience in being the only woman in a room and making my voice heard. Coming from a journey of going green and pushing through barriers and expectations, I can be an excellent Green Mayor giving South Yorkshire a full-time effort dedicated to challenging the status quo.\n“As a Green Mayor I won’t have Party bosses telling me what to think and how to vote.\n“Transport is integral to how we move as a county, it’s close to my heart as I desperately want to follow my dreams and be able to visit family in the most sustainable way I can. We need to bring buses under public control and support this with improved infrastructure. Say no to more road schemes and create better, integrated tram and rail services in South Yorkshire.\n“Energy has caught my attention since moving into the Sheffield area, my bills are no longer tied to the locked-in rates of the past. The future of energy is green, and I will fight to reduce energy bills and emissions. We need an insulated Britain, more clean renewable energy and absolutely no fracking.\n“It is vital to develop Jobs and Skills that support this period of energy transition, undertaking the important work of conserving energy by insulating homes. We want to achieve this by building more energy efficient homes and retrofitting the places we live and work. Following on from COP26 we know that there are challenges in all industries to meet emissions pledges – and the Green Party have a long history of meeting these challenges head on. The answer is to follow our core values and work with nature, not against it. Acknowledging the interdependence of transport, energy and jobs we can create a harmonious and just economy.\n“I am free to stand up for local people and truly represent the communities of South Yorkshire. Can Labour really say the same? In place of party bosses, I will be accountable to the people that make this county so vibrant. Instead of consultation, as mayor I will insist on conversation. By pooling knowledge and combining willpower, we will work together to honour and embrace the opportunities presented by greening the interconnected systems that sustain our livelihoods – greater conservation of energy coupled with lower impact energy sources, a transport system that gets us all moving, and jobs and skills that will support a thriving future for the county.\n“In summary, I want to serve the people and industry of South Yorkshire by harnessing the power of sustainable energy, transport and jobs.\nIf, like me, you believe we can do better…\nIf, like me, you believe there’s a local spirit of innovation and resourcefulness…\nIf, like me, you believe we need to stand up for ourselves and for our future…\n…then I look forward to starting conversations with you that will disrupt the status quo and inspire the freedom within us to create brighter futures.”\nBex Whyman for Mayor\nEmail: Hello@bex4mayor.org.uk\nTwitter: @Greenwhyman\nFacebook: Bex Whyman\nInstagram: Bex4Mayor\nTiktok: Bex4Mayor",

May’s meeting was the largely ceremonial AGM and June’s was cancelled because of the general election. This was the first under a new Lord Mayor – and of course a new Deputy Lord Mayor, Cllr Magid, Sheffield’s first Green in the position.\nThe new Lord Mayor set out her commitment to clamp down on disrespectful behaviour by members of both the council and the public. Standards of respect for each other’s views have been very much a part of the Green councillors’ campaign to clean up the quality of debate (Cllr Aodan Marken took a big lead on this) and we are pleased a working group is now looking at how to make council meetings more effective and more welcoming to the public.\nA special item about the Grenfell Tower fire and the implications for Sheffield brought sympathy from all sides and gratitude to the people who have been directly affected. In Sheffield, staff have been checking all council-owned tower blocks and residents of Hanover have been affected by the major decision to remove the cladding urgently. We now know that the contractor had not fitted the solid aluminium panels the council had ordered but some composite made of a soft plastic interior. Outside council-owned buildings, there is even less certainty. In my speech, I questioned the effectiveness of the buildings standards framework in view of the fact that local authorities no longer have control over it. I reflected on the Chief Executive’s comment that he expected to have “a high level of trust in state regulation.” I think most people expect that and would be concerned to find out that a system that permits property developers to hire their own building inspectors independently may be far less rigorous check on building standards.\nThe Green amendment was to call for action, in the form of a specific report, to be brought back (and therefore made public) to a future council meeting. The amendment was passed successfully and will be presented to a Scrutiny committee for discussion.\nThere were a number of petitions and public questions but the petition for debate was a repeat of a previous petition of Anthony Cunningham calling for a night-shelter. There are problems with this. I pointed out that “homelessness” is not the same as the most visible impact of seeing vulnerable people begging, sleeping rough or problems linked to physical and mental health, substance abuse or violence.\nPeople sleeping on the street are only a tiny fraction of the people who are homeless within the legal definition. And whilst I think we are right to be sceptical about the Administration’s statement that everyone sleeping rough has been offered temporary accommodation, the big issue is about the lack of long-term, patient, tolerant support. I pointed out that the Supporting People framework had been dismantled in the name of austerity, losing lots of local jobs and cutting a lot of people off from support when they really need it. Referring to people coming into Sheffield city centre from other towns, Anthony confirmed, “people are coming from other towns because of the cuts.”\nHowever, for a night shelter to do more good than harm, it needs proper staffing. And if the money is available, it would be better spent on expanding existing services rather than trying to set up yet another new project.\nThe matter was referred back to the Cabinet Member.\nPeaceful protests and democracy were not overlooked. Alison Teal spoke at a rally before the meeting. In public questions, Mark Banner asked how the council’s actions taking injunction proceedings against peaceful protestors protecting trees squared with its commemoration of the Kinder Scout mass trespass. In response to Nigel Slack’s question, Cllr Lodge informed the meeting that it was the protesters’ choice whether they suffered the consequences of the council’s actions. Nick Jordan asked whether the council was now a Thatcherite regime, referring to aggression he had been subjected to from Amey workers brought in from Birmingham and suggesting a link to Thatcher’s tactic of bringing in police from far outside South Yorkshire to crush the 1984 miners’ strike.\nWhen it came to motions and amendments, we were surprised when Labour refused to extend their best wishes to Nasima Akther, Leigh Bramall and Nick Clegg for no longer being councillors and MP.\nStill, at least the meeting ended without a big bust-up this time.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

And we’re learning more all the time about the impacts on health throughout our life, from babies in the womb through to increased cases of dementia.”\nLocal Green councillor Alison Teal, who helped community members arrange the first Play Street in Sheffield, said: “We know from experience that this is great opportunity for building communities and helping people get to know their neighbours. Small children rode their bikes and scooters, loving the freedom outside their front gates, children and adults enjoyed a friendly tug-of-war, and adults got to know each other over a cuppa.”\nThe Green Party marked the day around the country, while it calls for the government to increase spending on walking and cycling to £30/person/year, up from the current £6.50.\nCaroline Russell, Green Party transport spokesperson and London Assembly member, said: “Car-Free Days are just one way we can show that our cities can be places to live, work and play free from the threat of road danger, congestion and pollution. With 40,000 lives cut short every year by toxic fumes the Government has a duty to explore new ways to meet everyone’s right to breathe clean air.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

But not his suggestion of “relaxing safety requirements for nuclear power stations and building new ones as quickly as possible”.\nEven with existing safety standards for nuclear power stations, there’s always a significant risk of another Chernobyl or Fukushima plus the expensive and dangerous problem of disposing of nuclear waste. Sellafield is only 160 miles from Sheffield.\nRenewable energy is becoming cheaper all the time compared to expensive and dangerous nuclear power. A World Wide Fund for Nature report outlines that investing in a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic could create 210,000 green jobs by 2030, bringing £90 billion a year to the UK economy and getting us on track to achieve net zero emissions.\nThe Government has pledged to “build back better” and deliver a green recovery. The Green Party believes it must ditch fossil fuel subsidies and invest in clean, renewable energy that can meet our future needs safely.\nCallum Sweet\nStannington ward Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It has been a lot of hard work and put pressure on me and my family but I think it will be worth it.\nOn the day we won I felt the weight of expectation heavy on my shoulders. I knew it was a big achievement and lots, literally thousands, of people had put their faith in me. There were hundreds of messages wishing me well, congratulating me and among them were warnings of “you’d better keep your word now we’ve voted you in!”\nI have had some pretty immediate small victories which are a great boost and give me the feeling I really can make a difference. Things such as preserving the colour of some garage doors as requested by the residents, the location of bins, tree work, rewilding of verges and dealing with abandoned vehicles.\nAll this time I have been working towards larger gains, with my Green Councillor colleagues, like how the council deals with school dinner debt, the new school dinner contract, recycling, air quality and of course the climate crisis, among others.\nCrucially, I am scrutinising every step of the development of the GV masterplan to save GV from privatisation and the bulldozers.\nDuring the last few years campaigning for the Green Party I have made no secret of my opinion that Sheffield Labour party can be crap and useless, but I have been shocked at just how crap and useless they can be! Some local Labour councillors are less effective than I could have imagined. If there was an interview process in front of residents they wouldn’t get the job, picked as they are for their loyalty, not ability. Sadly, ideas are not judged on their merit, but cooed over or disparaged, based on who has suggested it.\nOfficers are shackled by the lack of political will, ambition, vision and confidence of the elected members. For example, school dinners are to meet Bronze medal standards! Do they really think our children are third rate?! Another example is the 22 EV charging points being planned for Sheffield while Nottingham plans over 200.\nThe current council system is deeply flawed and not conducive to everybody working for the betterment of Sheffield. The current Labour administration has an obsession with power over democracy and is implacably opposed to the It’s Our City campaign which wants a change to a more accountable modern committee system. Recently constitutional changes were made that limit motions the Greens are allowed to raise to just four a year with only two of them ever likely to be debated. The system of scrutiny allows councillors to scrutinise the cabinet’s decisions but the cabinet have no problem overturning objections from these committees. They recently cancelled a public meeting with twenty odd members of the public present because Cllr Alison Teal was kindly attending in my absence to take notes for me. More petty authoritarianism.\nThere is hypocrisy and, at best, a lack of joined up thinking. I was shocked by the number of 4×4 vehicles in the council car park when the cabinet meet up. It just shows how little air quality and climate breakdown matters to the cabinet. There is at least one climate change denier in Cllr Peter Price.\nBut here and there they have started saying the right things. This does, at least, show that they are feeling the pressure of the growing Green movement making its voice heard in Sheffield. But they need to act now: The Tyndall centre says we will use our next 80 years CO2 budget in only 6 years at the current rate of emissions. Labour want to take two years to set up a citizens assembly, a great idea and something the Greens have been suggesting for years but we need to be acting now too.\nI really feel that I’ve grown into the role of councillor in my first three months. I’ve worked incredibly hard for my constituents and the city, learning a lot as I go along. I’ve been busy in the wider community with public appearances at Camp Disco festival, appearing on an electoral reform panel for Sheffield For Democracy, done umpteen interviews and written several press releases. I’ve met school heads, student councils and spoke about single use plastics with Y2 students. I’ve been to coffee mornings with pensioners, drinks evenings, TARA meetings, helped out at the Gleadless Valley Food Bank, and much more.\nAt the full council meeting I wanted to get my maiden speech out of the way early so that I could participate fully in meetings. I had the honour of speaking on an amendment to a Labour business motion where we presented a green ideal of how business should work in Sheffield. Naturally Labour voted it down.\nDue to Labour’s inaction and inertia over the years, there have been many missed opportunities to make simple and effective improvements for Sheffield. I’m trying to address some “quick-fix” solutions while building the more long term campaigns needed to deal with our toxic air quality and damaging private contracts. With growing Green support across the whole city, next year’s elections will prove decisive. These are exciting times and change is just around the corner!\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Cllr Alexi Dimond opened the event with this speech. (see below for text version)\nOn Sunday six Sheffield Choirs combined forces to sing You’ll Never Walk Alone in a moving climax to the weekend. The song was live-streamed to people in Palestine.\nMany thanks to everyone who took part and especially all the organisers. You can donate to the charities the Big Run was supporting here.\nHere is Alexi’s speech.\nIt is my great privilege and honour to once again open the Small Park Big Run. This event is in my view one of the most beautiful and certainly one of the most vital events in Gleadless Valley ward and in Sheffield as a whole; as it highlights and combats one of the most stark issues of injustice of our time; but it does so in a joyous way, involving the community and linking us in solidarity to people in Palestine who are in a daily struggle against oppression and military occupation.\nThis year’s event seems even more crucial than ever following the election of the most far-right Israeli government in years, some of the ministers of which are openly racist and described as fascist even by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. There has been an increase in settlement expansion, backed by the full force of the government, and against a backdrop of an intensification of the media campaign against Palestine solidarity.\nThe focus of this year’s event is Israeli Apartheid. In Feb 2022 Amnesty International released a report in which it recognised the regime in Israel for what it has always been. The report was entitled “Israel’s Apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of domination and Crime against humanity”, and I would encourage everyone to read it. The report found that a system of apartheid, defined as an “institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group”, extends from inside the borders of the Israeli state established in 1948, to all the occupied territories, and also outwardly through Israel’s discriminatory “law of return” and the denial of the right to return to Palestinian refugees and their descendants. This has been confirmed many times by the pronouncements of Israel’s leaders. For example in 2019 Israeli PM Netanyahu declared that “Israel is not a state of all its citizens… [but rather] the nation-state of the Jewish people and only them”.\nDespite this, speaking the truth about Palestine has become a revolutionary act in the 21st Century. Frequently the media describes how unarmed Palestinians are killed in “clashes” with Israeli tanks or snipers’ bullets. Just last week in the Guardian there was a particularly egregious example of biased reporting with a story about the shooting of Palestinian journalist Moamen Sumreen titled: “Palestinian journalist hit in the head by bullet”. Pink Floyd’s popular Rock Opera The Wall, recognised for decades as a powerful critique of fascism, is now mischaracterised as the opposite, and lifelong anti-racist campaigners can be ostracised as racists for speaking out on Palestine.\nIn Sheffield, we have seen the Council censor a public question referencing Israeli apartheid (due to the Council’s previous adoption of the IHRA’s flawed definition of antisemitism) and a Palestinian lecturer and refugee was hounded out of her job at Sheffield Hallam – which purports to be a “University of Sanctuary”.\nSo what can we do about this? The answer is to raise our voices louder and to collaborate more to ensure that people rise up against this long-standing oppression. In Sheffield this year the Sheffield Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid was launched, seeking to emulate Sheffield’s contribution to the ending of apartheid in South Africa. I am pleased to report that since its launch many individuals and organisations have signed up including my union branch – “Sheffield Unite – Not for Profit” and the Sheffield Green Party. Please consider signing up individually and/or taking a motion to your union branch, political party or organisation. Please see the Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign website for details or ask one of the organisers of this event about this.\nThis year’s Small Park Big Run also focuses on the ecological impact of the occupation. Many here will be aware of Israel’s land grabs, the separation wall, and the continual demolitions of houses and entire villages. But what is less well known is the impact of water apartheid – with Palestinians forced to pay for water to be delivered to fill their roof-top water tanks, to have to go buy it in tankers for their farms, and to have to pay for and drink bottled water, whilst the water of the land is piped to illegal Israeli settlements for their domestic use and used for industrial agricultural production and the upkeep of golf courses. Some may also be unaware that untreated sewage and rubbish is often dumped by settlers to contaminate Palestinian farming land, or of the deliberate burning of Palestinian olive groves by settlers. Please join us at 3pm outside Meersbrook Hall for a tree planting and a talk on Climate Justice for Palestine by academic and activist Mahmoud Zwhare.\nPlease also join the BIG SING at Midday on Sunday which will bring together 6 Sheffield choirs for a rendition of “You’ll never walk alone” which will be live-streamed to Palestine.\nThanks again for all the hard work of the many organisers and contributors and of course, everyone taking part in this year’s event. Let’s continue together the struggle for equal rights and justice for Palestine!",

The streets are currently closed due to Covid-19.\nReopening the streets to buses would put at risk a city-wide improvements plan tied to millions of pounds in investment. Not only that, it would greatly undermine the Council’s declaration of a climate emergency made in 2019.\nAllowing a bus route would require the removal of the existing walking and cycling arrangements. It would also mean abandoning or cutting back the £13m Connecting Sheffield scheme to improve routes for walking, cycling and public transport across the city.\nPlans to upgrade Fargate would have to be abandoned and the move would fragment proposals under the cross-city Connecting Sheffield project.\nThe notion that buses have been slower since the introduction of cycle and pedestrian lanes on the two streets is not backed up by evidence. In fact, a survey shows buses have run faster through the city centre, improving the whole network’s reliability.\nThe evidence from disabled people, for example through the Access Liaison Group, a council-facilitated group that gives disabled people a say on changes that affect them, is that there are lots of problems with access in the city centre. But the group did not recommend reintroducing buses to Pinstone Street. Other access improvements could be made if the Connecting Sheffield scheme goes ahead.\nThe argument that closing the two streets to traffic is responsible for a downturn in business doesn’t hold up, given that Fargate and Pinstone Street had lots of empty shops before the pandemic. The council report shows the city is recovering slightly better from Covid -19 than the UK average.\nAll in all, Sheffield has the prospect of exciting changes to its urban landscape in the city centre after years of decline, funded by millions of pounds of government money. Let’s not throw that away.",

They were motivated by the air pollution from so-called “controlled burning” on private shooting estates that engulfed the city over the last week.\nGreen Party activist Peter Gilbert, who coordinated the volunteers, told how, “People contacted me saying that they had been struggling to breath due to the smog. They wanted to do something positive and planting moss was a practical way they could help our moorland.”\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), burning the moors damages peatland, emitting CO2 and reducing biodiversity.\nPeter said, “Sphagnum moss is an essential part of healthy peatland and planting it can help degraded sites recover. It plays an important role in the creation and continuation of peat bogs. The spongy moss holds water long after the surrounding soil has dried out, helping to prevent the decay of dead plant material. It is this preserved organic matter that gets compressed over hundreds of years to form peat and store carbon. It also helps reduce the risk of flooding by slowing the downhill flow of water from the moors during storms.”\nThe Eastern Moors Partnership, who the volunteers came to help, is a joint venture between the National Trust and the RSPB, managing the Eastern Moors on behalf of the Peak District National Park Authority and Burbage Moors on behalf of Sheffield City Council. In these areas, burning is no longer carried out. Instead, the emphasis is on “rewetting” areas of bog and mire so that they store water, increase flood and fire resilience, and capture carbon. This is done through blocking ditches and gullies, raising the water table, cutting dominant vegetation such as heather, and planting sphagnum moss.\nGreen Councillor Toby Mallinson was among the volunteers on Sunday and said, “blood sports are banned on Council-owned land but there is still burning happening on private shooting estates within the City boundaries, affecting residents across the city.”\nAfterwards many of the volunteers went to see TV presenter and conservationist Chris Packham as part of Off The Shelf festival. Packham raised the issue of moorland burning and afterwards tweeted, “They just don’t care at all. Not about the planet, not about ecology and not about all the kids with asthma in Sheffield. It’s time to shut this down.”\nNotes:\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) UK Peatland Program says the overwhelming scientific evidence base points to burning on peatlands causing damage to key peatland species, peatland ecosystem health, and the sustainability of peatland soils. https://www.iucn-uk-peatlandprogramme.org/about-peatlands/peatland-damage/burning-peatlands\nThe Eastern Moors Partnership is part of a wider vision for the area under the Sheffield Moors Partnership (SMP). This enables joined up thinking between adjacent land management, benefiting wildlife and people on a greater scale. https://www.visit-eastern-moors.org.uk\nChris Packham comments on the recent moorland burning around sheffield.",

It’s a job that has taught me about the importance of community. A school is a community, but there’s not much outside of school for young people, nor indeed for people of any age, to get involved in.\nThat’s why one of my major focuses, if elected, is to help build community capacity, with a common aim of improving everyone’s quality of life in these stressful times. Whether it’s community gardening in Batt Street. the Lansdowne or Common Ground, sharing our favourite songs together, litter picks on Leyburn Road or South View Road, or street art on Abbeydale Road, I want to help grow it.\nOne of the most positive ways our community has come together in the past few years is over the street trees issue. I’m proud to have been a part of the way the protectors have changed the council’s actions for the better. As a councillor, I will be well placed to ensure our streets flourish.\nOne of the major problems of our times is the extent to which we depend on the car. Neither our failing public transport nor our almost non-existent walking and cycling infrastructure make getting around without a car easy. This has created huge issues around air pollution, parking and general gridlock. Air pollution around Lowfield School, Sharrow School and Abbeydale School is a scandal I will devote time and energy to tackling. Councillor Alison Teal and I have been looking at ways of stopping anti-social parking, on Hill Street, in the Empire Road area, and at the school drop-off at Sharrow School. As a driver myself, I’m desperate to leave my car at home when possible, and I’m determined to find ways to make it easier for everyone to do that.\nWhen I first joined the Green Party, my main reason was our systemic way of tackling climate change. Over the thirteen years I’ve been a member, I’ve come to recognise the central part communities have to play in our personal, city-wide, national and international efforts to address the issues.\nI am, therefore, committed to helping our communities in Nether Edge and Sharrow develop their own responses and thereby creating a better and more sustainable life for us, for our children, and for generations yet unborn.\nIf you have any questions please contact me at peter.garbutt@\nFollow me on Twitter\nFollow Nether Edge & Sharrow Greens on Facebook\nFollow Sheffield Green Party on Twitter\nFollow Sheffield Green Party on Facebook",

This government has done nowhere near enough to support those affected.\n“Residents in these buildings are blameless and should not be made to pay for developer cost-cutting and poor fire safety legislation. Lax government regulation ultimately led to this situation and the government should be stepping in to make sure residents can live in safe buildings”\nSheffield Green Party has actively supported the Sheffield Cladding Action Group and have pushed for a resolution for people who are affected in Sheffield. Sheffield Green Party also exposed the failings of the previous administration with regard to transparency over cladding contracts. Phipps was positive about how Sheffield Council could now move forward to back those affected:\n“In the new co-operative Sheffield council, we wanted to support the request from campaigners by lighting up the Town Hall and Winter Gardens in green in remembrance of those who lost their lives in the Grenfell tragedy, and in support of those affected by the building safety crisis, as other places will be across the country on the 4th anniversary of Grenfell.\n“I was pleased to see cross party support of the Green amendment to the ‘Demanding an end to the national cladding scandal’ motion in March. We supported the motion and wanted to see the council make sure developers planning to build in Sheffield are suitable, by asking the developers if their existing buildings still need fire safety work.

While this was welcomed, it was understandably viewed with suspicion by anti-fracking protectors. Was it just an election ploy? Why did they not go straight to a ban on Fracking, like Ireland, Wales and Scotland?\nThe fracking industries failure to avoid earth tremors is the stated reason for calling a halt to further drilling. There are equally valid reasons the government could have given: contamination of water supplies and soil, destruction of wildlife habitat, the fact that there’s a Climate Crisis and we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground, etc. The list is long.\nPublic opposition has grown against this filthy industry. The increasing policing costs to attempt to control the creative and courageous campaigners keeping watch night and day at the remote sites, coupled with technical difficulties, has made this industry financially inviable.\nOver the past few years, I’ve visited active and planned sites across the north where anti-fracking protectors set up camp, including Kirby Misperton (Third Energy), Preston New Road (Cuadrilla), West Newton (Rathlin), Tinker Lane (IGas), Marsh Lane (INEOS). Some of the fracking companies obtained Injunctions against campaigners in an attempt to prevent peaceful nonviolent direction action (NVDA), however, protectors did not give up.\nWe had the same challenge in the Sheffield Trees campaign, except it was Sheffield City Council who took us to the High Court. They applied for an injunction to prevent us using NVDA to stop them felling healthy street trees. In the end, their Injunction didn’t work either.\nI know from personal experience that people power works. There’s a great camaraderie amongst people who put their liberty on the line for something greater than themselves. We only have this one, beautiful blue planet to sustain us. We must respect and nurture the Earth.\nAs XR call for ‘System Change, not Climate Change,’ and the Youth Strikes gain momentum, there’s a child whose voice of reason has miraculously cut through to the global media with her truth, “I want you to act as if the house is on fire, because it is.” Greta Thunberg – World Economic Forum, Davos, 24 January 2019.\nCampaigners have stopped fracking, hopefully for good, but we still have so much work to do, and as Greta says, the house is on fire.

Maybe it was just good to know she wasn’t in prison and didn’t get thrown out of the meeting. A number of questions from the public asked the council to explain various decisions around the council’s application to the High Court to have her imprisoned and the court’s rejection of it. In response, Cllr Bryan Lodge confirmed that the council “accepts the words of Mr Justice Males” but that he was “pleased Cllr Teal has been to court.” There was however, absolutely no recognition of just how bad it looks in 21st Century Britain to try to jail your political opponents.\nEarlier in the meeting, the Council had agreed unanimously to remove the Freedom of the City from Aung San Suu Kyi, which had been granted on International Women’s Day in 2006 for “commitment to secure democracy and human rights by non-violent means.”\nLabour’ decision to suspend the constitution meant we had not been permitted to put even one motion forward this month. Rob Murphy proposed an emergency motion to call for an independent inquiry into the failed case against Alison Teal but this was request was rejected by the Lord Mayor, to cries of “shame” from the public gallery.\nInstead the meeting debated issues of national policy rather than anything much to do with Sheffield. We had issues about charges for service in the NHS, universal credit and a round-up of national housing policy issues. None of this had any particular relevance to Sheffield any more than for any other town or city.\nWe moved a formal amendment to say there should be “no place for private profit in NHS hospital services.” Both Labour and LibDems revealed their true colours by opposing this. We have to remember that both those parties have been complicit in bringing the market into the health service during their terms in government.\nWe commented on the universal credit motion by saying it was not enough for Labour just to “note” these issues. We said the Administration should draw up an action plan to protect Sheffield’s citizens from the full roll-out of Universal Credit. That too was rejected by Labour. Heaven forbid they should actually use the Council’s resources to limit the hardships facing our residents!\nOn the LibDems’ transport motion, Rob Murphy commented that when money is so tight, road safety has to be a priority. The recent 20mph zone in the city centre is where the most road accidents are. However, he noted that, with the Amey contract, the cost of doing road improvements has gone through the roof.\nWe had at least had some success with Members’ Questions. These are written questions submitted by councillors a week before the meeting and with written answers given at the meeting. Councillors can then ask supplementary questions. It’s not quite Prime Minister’s Questions but it is a very important way for the Opposition to call the Labour Administration to account. As part of suspending the constitution, Labour had moved these to the end of the meeting so that there was no time to ask extra questions. For this meeting, however, they were brought to follow on from public questions.\nWe asked questions about fire safety in tower blocks (still waiting for an answer), Sunny Bank meeting rooms, the deal for the Central Library, volunteer libraries, pension fund investments, output under the Streets Ahead contract – and leafblowers. Amey have 38 apparently.\nWe also asked “urgent questions” asking for a comment from the Leader of the Council on the court’s decision to refuse the application to commit Cllr Alison Teal to prison. We were refused permission to ask the questions on the grounds it was not ‘urgent.’ The meeting then ended early for once.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Since 1935 not one of the single party majority governments elected by our current First Past The Post voting system received a majority of the votes;\nUnder the current system the largest two parties appeal to voters in “swing seats”, taking votes in “safe seats” for granted.

But that’s what Patrick Properties, a purely profit driven subsidiary of private equity group company Latium Enterprises, wants to build.\n18 months after a climate emergency was declared we have seen no significant council action. The council must not be building housing on high risk flood plains. It must stop granting permission for developments that bring more traffic and pollution to the residential area in and around the Malin Bridge gyratory.\nThe council must be resolute with consistent decision-making that ensures our city becomes future-proofed over the next decade. It must not set us adrift in a city designed by developers driven only by profit. The council must refuse this application which fails to engage with the unique considerations of this green belt site in a special setting.\nWe agree with the Friends of Loxley Valley that all stakeholders should engage in further dialogue to find a collaborative solution outside of the current adversarial planning system.”\nNotes\n- The planning application reference is 20/01301/OUT. The deadline for public comments was July 30th.\n- The applicants Patrick Properties are a subsidiary company of Latium Enterprises, a private equity group with headquarters in both the UK and USA. Patrick Properties bought the site from Bovis Homes in August 2018 for just under £1.6 million.\n- The full text of the objection submitted by Brian Holmshaw is:\n“Brian Holmshaw objecting for Sheffield Green Party. We support the case for refusal outlined by many local residents, Friends of the Loxley Valley, The Peak District Park Authority and other stakeholders. We object to the use of an outline planning application which the council should not have to consider after clearly indicating that a full application was appropriate. In this basic outline application, the developers look to avoid future council and public scrutiny in seeking an easier route via “reserved matters” once outline permission is achieved.Clear choices for the council emerged in the December 2018 Hepworth site stakeholder workshop. Will the council stick to the requirements they outlined – “a full planning application that specifically addresses the problems of sustainability, and so that all the unique considerations of the site can be fully considered”. Or cave in to the alternative that was outlined – “a generic, volume housebuilder solution that would not be appropriate.”This is a non conforming green belt site on a flood plain, parts of which are classified as high risk for flooding. Torrential rain last November brought the site to the brink of flooding while in 2007 parts of the site were under several feet of flood water. All climate indicators suggest the UK faces increasingly frequent severe weather events with massively increased flood risk. A council that has declared a climate emergency must not be building housing on high risk flood plains.\nThe quoted site clean up costs are likely to result in expensive houses with the applicants very likely to claim unprofitability to justify severely limiting or avoiding the provision of affordable housing. Sheffield desperately needs affordable housing but developers continually try and wriggle out of providing it or paying for it to be built elsewhere. There is nothing in the application to indicate that houses will be built to the standards needed, including suitable insulation, in a development likely to be completed close to 2030. Sheffield is pledged to be a zero net carbon city by 2030.\nThis is clearly going to be a high end development with many 2 car families. Suggestions that many people will walk to local shops and amenities are simply false. Active travel will be very limited in this remote location – few would brave the narrow bridge, steep zig zag, pavement free, Spout Lane to access Stannington Village.\nEverything points to a lot more vehicles heading up and down Loxley Rd to join the growing queues into the Malin Bridge gyratory – a standing traffic air pollution hot spot. The health of local residents, including those whose children walk to Forge Valley School from the Wisewood estate, is not being protected. At a single planning meeting in January, a Lidl store was approved at the bottom of Stannington Rd plus a retail park opposite Hillsborough football ground with an Aldi. The council must stop granting permission for developments that bring more traffic and pollution to the residential area in and around the Malin Bridge gyratory.\nNow is a vital time for the city. More than a year after a climate emergency was declared we have seen no significant council action. The council must be resolute with consistent decision making that ensures our city becomes future-proofed over the next decade. It must not set us adrift in a city designed by developers driven only by profit.\nThe council must refuse this application which fails to engage with the unique considerations of this green belt site in a special setting. We agree with the Friends of Loxley Valley that all stakeholders should engage in further dialogue to find a collaborative solution outside of the current adversarial planning system.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

These improvements will often be needed if they are to be sustainable for the long-term benefit of the community. We need to strengthen community ownership across the UK and the social infrastructure that helps communities to thrive.\n“However there is currently no access to community funds for community organisations. The Labour government cut funding to the Community Ownership Fund last month.\n“This decision highlights how Labour is making knee jerk reactions that damage the fabric of our communities. The result of this decision restricts communities in Sheffield from being able to take forward their plans to take on buildings and make them economically viable.\n“There was no reason at all to get rid of the Community Ownership Fund. Its purpose was for community organisations to be able to apply for funding to take ownership of assets at risk of loss to their communities. Without this support only wealthier communities will be able to take on community ownership projects. Struggling communities with people on lower incomes will have no public funds to draw upon.\n“Incorporated voluntary and community organisations, and parish, town and community councils could apply for Capital funding of up to £2 million for assets. However most awards were under £250,000 and much smaller groups made use of this. But it’s gone now leaving many communities with plans to take on buildings, high and dry.\n“The Community Ownership Fund was closed with £15 million still in the pot, something that community businesses, including those in Sheffield, could have made good use of. Improve by all means, but don’t just close access to funding down.\n“We are unlikely to get anything more on what’s replacing this scheme until the government spending review in early summer when budgets for government departments are set for the next few years.”\nReferences\nAmendments to motions – Sheffield City Council 5/2/25\n(Public Pack)Amendments – 5th February 2025 Agenda Supplement for Council, 05/02/2025 14:00",

This vote marks a small step on the road to justice and equality”.\nCouncillor Toby Mallinson said:\n“This month Sheffield will welcome a delegation from the Palestinian city of Nablus with which we recently entered into a friendship agreement.

If there is a strong enough response to the consultation, the council may bring in a new bye-law allowing them to enforce an anti-idling scheme and issue fines to motorists caught idling their engines for no reason.\nMany people are in the habit of doing this, perhaps in the belief that it helps to protect the engine. In fact, the reverse is true: letting a modern diesel engine idle actually does more damage to the engine than starting and stopping. Much more importantly, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends anti-idling schemes for public health reasons. So a properly enforced scheme requiring engines to be turned off when the vehicle isn’t moving would benefit everyone, at no hardship to drivers. (Running the engine of a stationary vehicle is already against the Highway Code.)\nSheffield Green Party is in favour of any new scheme that would stop motorists endangering other people’s health for no reason. However, we feel that the consultation was badly designed, with the requirement to choose which locations most deserve to become “no idling” zones (question 5). Why did the format of the consultation force residents to prioritise hospitals over primary schools, or train stations over nursing homes? We believe that clean air for everybody is achievable.\nThis consultation and the proposed new bye-laws are a small step in the right direction, but it comes in the context of a very poor track record on air quality.\n- Sheffield city council is now nationally notorious for cutting down mature street trees that do so much to cleanse the air we breathe.\n- Amey, the council’s chosen contractors, have been spotted many times running the engines of their works vehicles.\n- Taxis licensed by the city council drive the equivalent of 20 round-the-world trips each week and spend much of their time waiting for pick-ups. Why isn’t the council already using its powers to enforce anti-idling for the hundreds of taxis in the city?\n- A Freedom of Information request reveals that the council has never enforced any anti-idling measures before. Would a new bye-law change this?\n- The approach to pollution from the M1 has been inconsistent.\nMeanwhile, the Green Party has led the way on air pollution in Sheffield. Green Party member Graham Turnbull has raised awareness of dangerous pollution levels and attempted to reduce idling outside schools as well as idling from bodies such as Yorkshire Water. Cllr Alison Teal has worked to stop Amey contractors running their engines for too long. Cllr Magid visited Hunters Bar school and talked to idling drivers outside, then followed it up with the council. Countless Green Party members and supporters have fought to save our mature street trees. All this with very little help from the ruling Labour group – and in the case of the trees, active opposition to our work.\nIf you missed out on completing the consultation, you can still make your views heard. We would urge residents concerned about air quality to contact Cllr Jack Scott, Cabinet Member for Transport & Sustainability, on jack.scott@sheffield.gov.uk.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Over 240 local councillors from across the UK and from different political parties have pledged to fight for all of their residents – including those seeking asylum – in the face of government plans to house people on old barges and former prisons.\nThe pledge comes as the Government pushes through legislation that would see children and pregnant people locked behind bars and would amount to an effective ban on the right to claim asylum. This breaks the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and must not be allowed to happen.\nPlans to house people seeking asylum in disused army barracks and offshore on barges and boats have been criticised by charities and housing organisations as “abhorrent” and “deeply concerning.”\nThe group of councillors said:\n“As a group of local councillors from across the UK – and from different political parties – we are appalled by this Government’s latest abhorrent plans for people seeking sanctuary in our communities.\n“The Home Office is recklessly endangering people’s lives by placing them in accommodation that is manifestly unsafe and leaving them at the mercy of private companies that treat them as commodities. We will stand up for everyone in our communities, and fight for their right to safe and welcoming housing.\n“The Home Office’s calculated strategy of division and disdain will not work – our communities, and their care for one another, are stronger than that. As local councillors, we pledge to work tirelessly for the good of all our communities, to ensure that all our residents can live safely and with dignity.”\nThe councillors are from 65 different local authorities from across the UK and have pledged to stand up for their communities and use council powers to ensure that all residents – including those seeking asylum – are supported.\nThe government is currently at loggerheads with several local authorities over asylum accommodation plans and is attempting to push through emergency legislation to allow it to shortcut council planning processes. Local authorities have a broad set of decision-making powers, and resistance from councillors to the latest asylum plans could cause further headaches for central government.\nCouncillor Doctor Hosnieh Djafari-Marbini of the Migrant Champions Network, the organisation supporting the letter, said, “The fact is that communities up and down the country want to stand in solidarity with people seeking sanctuary and provide them a warm welcome. And it’s clear that councillors from across the country are equally committed to ensuring that people arriving here have the support they need.\n“But decisions taken by central government too often make that impossible. We hope that the Government will listen to the voices of these councillors, and equip local communities to provide a warm welcome, instead of pursuing an agenda of hostility and division, and lining the pockets of private companies.” The full text of the letter and list of signatories is available here.\nThe Bill was opposed in the House of Lords where Baroness Natalie Bennett of Manor Castle spoke against it as did fellow Green peer Jenny Jones.\nCaroline Lucas was so incensed by the bill that she ripped it up in Parliament, saying “The Home Secretary on the face of this bill invites Parliament to rip up international law. The only Act of a parliament that has some kind of moral Integrity is to rip up her illegal and immoral bill which has no place in our statute book.”",
  "https_sheffieldgreenparty_org_uk_council-election-and-referendum-2021_andrew-hards_/https_sheffieldgreenparty_org_uk_2018_12_11_total-disunity/content_514.html": "So, what happened at December’s meeting of the full Sheffield City Council?\nRob Murphy described the way Labour leaders in South Yorkshire had handled the South Yorkshire devolution deal as making the Government’s handling of Brexit look like a masterpiece in international diplomacy. The LibDems’ Paul Scriven was shouted down by repeated “points of order” by Labour councillors who didn’t like what he said, in retaliation for his point of order correcting Labour’s factually incorrect statement about school funding cuts. The scenes summed up Labour’s chaos.\nThe motion on the devastation and loss of lives in Yemen was brought up the agenda, as there were several members of the public asking questions about stopping the arms trade to the Saudi Arabian government. Labour’s Cllr Abtisam Mohammed, herself the first female councillor of Yemeni origin, spoke movingly of what is happening in Yemen now and we gave her a standing ovation.\nOur amendment proposed adding some action to the Labour motion. We called for an immediate halt to arms sales to Saudi Arabia, reflecting local campaigners and the letter signed by Caroline Lucas MP and other party leaders to the International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, who could use his powers over export controls.\nFortunately, all councillors voted for our amendment, so our message will now be sent to the government.\nOther motions were on inequality in the schools system, where we were successful in replacing part of the LibDem motion, and on devolution. We took issue with the LibDems placing responsibility for a school’s success or failure on the staff and students, pointing out that the quality of a child’s education in Sheffield still depends too much on where they were born and where they live.\nThe devolution motion was all about Labour splits and led on from Cllr Iqbal’s “blistering attack” on regional mayor Dan Jarvis. We urged Labour in South Yorkshire to stop supporting the Conservative government and instead look to Yorkshire-wide devolution. Unfortunately, the LibDems joined the Tory-Labour coalition and voted against our amendment.\nGreen Party member Graham Turnbull brought a petition of 1415 signatures with a request to close off roads to cars at school entrances at peak times for better safety and air quality. Cllr Jack Scott made promises to meet with him and other interested councillors.\nJohn Grayson of SYMAAG brought a petition, which referred to the previous promises by Cllr Jackie Drayton about placing refugee families with children in B&B accommodation – specifically the Earl Marshall Guest House in Burngreave – which is generally against the council’s legal duties to homeless people. He spoke passionately about the experiences of distraught families having to share small kitchens and bathrooms with vulnerable, single men. He also pointed it was BME families who were treated this way. In answer to public questions, Cllr Jim Steinke said that the council had no record of any of the families’ ethnicity. In reality, applicants for housing are always asked to supply equality monitoring data for just this reason. Cllr Steinke admitted that, as of today, there were still 9 families being accommodated in B&B. He made further promises to help them move on.\nA fourth petition complained that the council had reneged on promises to help keep facilities at Woodbourn Rd athletics stadium, describing the first students from a state school winning at national-level competitions but having to train by parents shining their car headlights onto the pitch.\nA public question from Graham Wroe about the problem of slippery pavements not being swept led to Lewis Dagnall assuring the public that it is much easier to walk on Amey’s new smooth pavements. He said Streets Ahead will respond to complaints within 14 days and felt the city is now a much better place for “active travellers.”\nIn the half-time break, councillors were treated to some incredibly moving and challenging music from the highly-talented Matt Howden of Sieben, who was present with some of his sound technician students from Red Tape Studios. It was great to chat to them in the break about their growing confidence over the course of the year.\nAt the reconvened meeting, Members Questions continued the theme of the Labour Cabinet avoiding giving answers to topical questions. It seems a common tactic is to answer any question other than the one asked. Another is to shout abuse at the questioner. Cllr Jack Scott evaded my question about seeking protection for heritage in the Castlegate development area. He also refused to answer my question on allocations of the community infrastructure levy (CIL) to wards – despite the fact that officers posted the information on the council’s website later that same day.\nThere were interesting answers on the cost of replacing defective cladding on the Hanover Tower Block. Cllr Jayne Dunn had previously stated that the cost of its removal and reinstatement was estimated at £425,000. Cllr Jim Steinke now admitted the actual cost was nearly ten times that – almost £4 million. No-one had been held accountable for the decision to install the wrong cladding and – well over a year later – we were told there was still an “ongoing investigation.” However, the council has no plans to reclaim the cost of defective cladding from the original installer and in fact has even given them the new contract without going out to tender or getting other quotes.\nThe council ended the meeting with what should have been a routine vote on a report from a Scrutiny Committee about the role of the Lord Mayor. The Labour Whip, determined to underline the voting record, called for a roll call vote … but then things went wrong: some Labour councillors voted “for” and others said “abstain.” Urgent complaints came from the Labour front bench that they didn’t know what they were voting on and, whatever it was, they thought they should be voting on something else – or not voting on it – lead to chaos and confusion. It became obvious they had not read the committee’s recommendation before being told what to vote.\nThe chair of the Committee the report had come from (Cllr Denise Fox) attempted to clarify that she thought the report was just for information. Unfortunately, even she was mistaken. Further attempts to propose an alternative motion whilst the vote was under way led to advice from officers to sort out the mess. Ultimately, most Labour councillors abstained and the LibDems voted against it – so Labour lost the motion they had called for a recorded vote on.\nThis must have made no sense to anyone still in the public gallery. Fortunately, like so many other things debated in the council chamber, the outcome has no real consequence.\nSomething that did have a consequence was Labour’s Cllr Maroof somehow managing to send a pornographic picture to “Mums United.” This happened just after the group’s Sahira Irshad had presented a petition to council. Cllr Alison Teal has been doing a lot to support Mums United (a group that Cllr Maroof claims to have set up) because of really serious issues of intimidation and targeted attacks carried out by gangs in the Abbeydale corridor and Lansdowne. It’s unclear what will come of the petition but, by the end of the meeting, Cllr Maroof had been suspended from the Labour group.\nSo no-one can say councillors don’t live in the real world: like so much of life, this council meeting swung between grotesque tragedy and confused absurdity.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Trade Unions had lodged a “collective dispute” on their behalf and it was heard by a panel of two elected councillors – one Labour and one Green.\nAfter hearing a full day of evidence, the Green Party councillor, Ruth Mersereau, decided that the trade union’s case was made out and the council management’s wasn’t. However, the council management issued a “decision letter” to unions, saying that the panel had agreed to continue with the staff restructure. When Ruth Mersereau asked for this letter to be retracted, no response was received. She therefore notified the unions directly on 26th November that she supported their case and the purported decision letter did not reflect the views of the panel.\nSubsequently, Cllr Mersereau was informed by the Administration that she had been removed from the panel as a result.\nCllr Mersereau said,\n“Having heard over seven hours of evidence and witness testimony at the panel meeting, I realised that these catastrophic job losses were not just unnecessary, but would have a devastating impact on Planning staff, on the safety of the public and on Sheffield’s landscape.”\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, leader of the Green group of councillors, added,\n“It is a bad sign when the Administration wants to get rid of experienced staff and divert more resources to supporting major commercial developers at the expense of smaller businesses, householders, disabled people and the general public. It is worse still when council processes are manipulated to thwart the decisions of elected members that do not sit well with the Administration.\nIn this case, HR staff have falsified the views of elected members to issue the Administration’s preferred decision, despite it explicitly not being agreed by the panel.\nI have called for disciplinary action to be taken. The Council’s governance system desperately needs reform. Although the 15 members of the “Appeals and Collective Disputes Committee” are politically\nproportionate to the number of seats held by each party, the sub-committee members are hand-picked from this pool by the management.”\nNotes\n- Up to 41.8 full-time equivalent jobs are at stake\n- The original Collective Dispute Panel met on 22 nd October 2019. The Chair of the meeting was absent so it proceeded with just 2 councillors, Cllr Ruth Mersereau and Cllr Jackie Satur. Council staff issued the “decision letter” on 30 th October despite Cllr Mersereau withholding her agreement to it.\n- Cllr Satur was removed from the Committee at the full Council meeting on 6th November 2019, leaving Cllr Mersereau as the only member of the committee who had heard the oral evidence.\n- The text of Cllr Mersereau’s explanation to the unions on 26th November 2019 is:\n“I am writing in respect of the Collective Dispute and the letter of 30 October 2019, which has been said to contain the decision of the Panel.I would like to make clear that I explicitly have not agreed to the decision, that I have not consented to it being issued in my name and that I have asked management to retract it.I note this request has not been accepted. Only Councillor Satur agreed to the letter going out and to the process continuing.\nI would also like to confirm that, having listened to the evidence of the seven witnesses, the unions and management, that I fully accept the Trade Union case and reject the management case. In particular, I note that management declined to provide adequate evidence of a business case in support of the proposal to make workers redundant.\nI have also expressed my disappointment that the whole day proceeded on the basis of officers’ advice that the principle of job cuts had already been decided by elected members. After further probing, it appears that this is not the case. In my view, this is fundamental to the scope of the panel’s decision.\nIn the circumstances, I cannot support the Administration’s proposal for redundancies.\nSince the letter of 30 October 2019 did not accurately reflect the decision of the panel, I would ask that you note this and convey this message to all staff affected by this dispute.”\n- Cllr Mersereau was notified she was removed from the sub-committee on 3rd December 2019.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

In previous budgets, the Green councillors repeatedly proposed extra resources to help tenants and take enforcement action on substandard rented housing in the private sector.\n• £1.1 million for community safety. In March 2020, Green councillors proposed to employ four “Safer Neighbourhoods Officers,” with a focus on youth work, to support young people and their families. They also found funding for 4 extra PCSOs.\n• £500,000 for new neighbourhood working. In their March 2020 budget proposals, Green councillors said the public wanted to see more active work in local areas and proposed to reverse the Administration’s cut to locality working.\nDouglas Johnson, Green Councillor for City Ward, said,\n“These are all good spending proposals and align with proposals in our previous budget amendments which Labour councillors have repeatedly voted against.\n“We want to see more council resources put into working in communities, enforcement of private tenants’ rights and safer communities.\n“Better local working is a key demand of the It’s Our City campaign for better governance of the council. The irony is that this spending decision was made a fortnight ago by the Labour group, without opposition councillors being made aware of the new funding.\n“What’s disappointing, however, is the absolutely zero resource put in to sustainability and achieving a zero-carbon city. There still needs to be a substantial change in Sheffield’s actions to address climate change and we would like to see this brought in to the council budget.\nCllr Alison Teal (Nether Edge and Sharrow ward) added,\nIt’s great to see Labour have taken on Green ideas and we are pleased they will be adopted. Imagine how much better the people of Sheffield would be served if all of their elected councillors worked together!\nThere is a glaring problem which Labour have failed to understand, however.\nThis budget ought to reflect the seriousness of the climate and ecological crisis we are facing. For example, where is the money to fund the new officer positions we need, with the expertise and knowledge to enable the city to realise our carbon reduction targets?\nThe emergency is real and yet it is not accounted for in Labour’s spending plans. Bob Johnson is setting us up to fail, and this is profoundly unacceptable.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The group was set up by the full council meeting on 17th May 2017 and will continue to meet throughout the year.\nThe Green Party suggestions for improvements are:\nReview of council meetings – Comments from Green Party councillors, 14 July 2017\n1. We are pleased the discussions to date in the Members Working Group have been constructive.\n2. Our view remains that a committee system is more inclusive and democratic and our position is that this should be re-introduced in place of the “strong leader” model.\n3. We feel there should be at least some degree of public consultation, since the aim is to make meetings more accessible to the public.\nBroadcasting\n4. We are strongly in favour of openness and transparency and therefore support full broadcasting using the public-I TV system at the earliest opportunity. We believe this to be only a modest cost but urge officers to obtain further details as soon as possible, given that the existing microphone system needs replacing.\n5. All other local authorities in South Yorkshire put their council meetings online and this is now becoming the norm.\n6. As an interim measure, we think the audio recording that is currently available should be streamed to the council website at the best quality the existing system can manage.\nLayout of the room\n7. We would like to see how the proposed layout works in practice. It would be a concern if the layout contributed to a more aggressive, confrontational approach between two physically separated halves of the Chamber. It may be that the seating can be angled slightly towards the Lord Mayor.\nTime of the meeting\n8. We have no firm views on the best time but do not object to a proposal to move to 5pm, subject to the issues below. The guillotine should be retained (provided there is no limit on the number of motions).\nLength of the meeting\n9. We agree with the aim of making the meeting shorter and accept an aim of about 3 hours in length. Again, this is subject to the proposals for changing the content of the meeting.\nPetitions and public questions\n10. We would like to maintain the current time of up to 1 hour for petitions and public questions.\nOrdinary petitions\n11. We think there should be no formal change to the current scheme for petitions. We strongly feel it should be the right of the public to bring any petition or any question to any public meeting of the council.\n12. Where petitions are presented, we would like Cabinet Members to shorten their responses just so that they just respond to the request in the petition briefly without making a speech. This is to save time in the meeting and to get to the point, for the benefit of members of the council and of the public.\n13. Whilst the public should not be restricted from bringing petitions to the full council, it may be that some members of the public do not realise the full council is not a decision-making body. We therefore suggest that better information is given to petitioners as to possible committees and the advantages of each option so the petitioners can make an informed choice.\nPublic questions\n14. There has been slippage into members of the public regularly making speeches from the gallery. Whilst some context may be required, we would like to see a clear expectation that questions are limited to questions only. July’s council meeting was better than usual in that the Lord Mayor actively called the public’s attention to the need to ask questions. This could be supported by written guidance to questioners.\n15. As with petitions, we would like to see Cabinet Members respond as concisely as possible, by answering the question rather than by making a speech.\n16. Both these steps will save time in the meeting and help retain the public’s interest in proceedings.\n17. Where a Cabinet Member decides to respond in writing, a copy of the response should be placed on the website as a matter of routine.\n18. We do not see any need to change the petitions scheme in respect of the 5,000 or 2,500 – signature thresholds.\nMembers’ questions\n19. We think these should be held immediately after public questions with at least some time (say 20 minutes) for supplementary questions, as these are often topical and of interest to the public.\nMotions and amendments\nNumber of motions\n20. We do not agree with the proposal to limit the number of motions that Members can put and would prefer the issue of the proliferation of motions to be dealt with less formally – see below.\n21. We agree with others that motions and amendments are the main system by which parties set out their political visions in the Council.\n22. The practical effect of the proposal to permit only 3 or 4 motions on a ‘politically balanced’ basis is that the smaller parties would be muted in being unable to put forward any motions at all except once every two years.\n23. We accept that not every item can be debated in full but we believe in principle that motions by all Members should be allowed. The real issue is which motions are selected for debate (currently, on the basis of a formula) and the quality of the debate. At present, there are no Independent Members but any change to the constitution would need to cater for this possibility. We think the other proposed changes would help to make meetings more effective. However, we think it is necessary to keep the guillotine.\nTime limits on motions\n24. We agree with the proposal to reduce the time spent on each motion, for motions and amendments to be brought together where appropriate and for speeches to be limited. We agree with the proposal of 3 minutes for the proposer of each motion and amendment and 2 minutes for the seconder.\n25. To avoid the concerns of repetition, we suggest the parties take steps to discourage members speaking unless, in exceptional cases, they really have something to add to the proposer and seconder’s speeches.\n26. We agree with the suggestion to have all the votes on a debate held together rather than after each amendment, as at present.\nVoting in parts\n27. We believe that voting in parts is essential, although other proposals may reduce the need for this.\nNumber, length, and order of speeches\n28. Where motions are put as an amendment to another party’s motion and vice versa, we suggest these should be voted on together.\nMotions – content\n29. We would like a “no bitching” rule: content that just criticises other national parties or their leaders has no place in a council debate. This should also have the effect of reducing the need to vote in parts.\n30. Motions should not be brought unless their content is both relevant to Sheffield and relevant to the powers of the Council.\nMotions with cross-party support\n31. Where motions have cross-party support– e.g. symbolic or congratulatory ones, we agree with the suggestion to have a declaration by the Lord Mayor. It is unhelpful to have a party debate, which makes it look to the public as if there is a dispute between the parties, when there is not.\nDeadline to submit motions\n32.We think there is benefit to more discussion between the parties before the agenda is published. We therefore suggest we bring the deadline for submitting motions a couple of days earlier so that the parties can see where there is agreement before the agenda is published.\n33. If at all possible, the amendments should be submitted before the agenda is published. Members of the public cannot get a true picture of the issues in debate unless both sides of the argument are shown.\nAgenda\n34. Motions and amendments should both have descriptive titles. Both the proposer and seconder should be named on the agenda and the party of each member should also be specified, as this helps the public understand the proceedings without having to be familiar with each member.\nMotions in the guillotine\n35. We believe time could be saved by dispensing with the formality of the Lord Mayor reading out the names of the proposer and seconder of each amendment, thus getting to the vote more quickly. This will be easier if the suggestions above are implemented\nWe therefore suggest the following order of events:\n- Parties draw up motions, as currently. Motions must not contain party-political sniping directed at national parties or leaders.\n- Parties should ensure motions are reasonably short (3 or 4 paragraphs)\n- Draft motions submitted – 2 days before the present deadline\n- Parties review each other’s motions and agree which attract cross-party consensus (possibly with agreed modifications). They should also agree any motions which should be consolidated or dealt with together – i.e. if covering the same topic.\n- Parties submit amendments\nAgenda published\nPrior to council meeting:\n- Petitions received – petitioners given advice and options on which meeting they want to present their petition to.\n- People in public gallery given information on only being able to make a speech if presenting a petition. Otherwise, limited to asking questions.\nCouncil meeting:\n- Lord Mayor reminds all to be concise etc.\n- Public petitions and questions – up to an hour\n- Questions to be actual questions\n- Cabinet members to respond briefly to the question and without making a speech.\n- Members’ questions – including supplementary questions on topics not on the agenda for debate.\n- Motions where consensus is reached – announcement by Lord Mayor (possibly with formal proposer and seconder)\n- Motions for debate\n- Order of speakers for each debate:\n- Proposer and seconder of motion (3 mins and 2 mins)\n- Proposer and seconder of first amendment (3 mins and 2 mins)\n- Proposer and seconder of second amendment (3 mins and 2 mins)\n- Etc\n- Other speakers – 1 minute each (parties expected to avoid repetition)\n- Vote on all amendments and then substantive motion\n- Guillotine on any remaining motions if needed – Lord Mayor to dispense with formally calling on proposers and seconders for each motion and amendment and move straight to vote.\n- Other business like minutes etc\nDownload Review of council meetings – Green Party comments (pdf)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This is completely inappropriate for a city the size of Sheffield, one that has been named the Greenest City in the country and a City that has declared a climate emergency where we are aiming to be Zero Carbon by 2030. 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 just isn’t credible. The developer needs to do more. What we definitely didn’t need was just another car park. We know that even at peak times car parks are well below capacity. Surveys in 2019 pre-pandemic found that peak short stay car parking was 60-65% of capacity and peak was 70% to 80%. Evidence that we don’t need yet another car park.”\nCllr Brian Holmshaw asked the Developer to withdraw the application and come back with one that would take into account the climate emergency target set by the Council. This was rejected by the applicant and the motion passed, with the support of Labour and the Lib Dems.\n“I’m disappointed that this short sighted planning application was passed. The Government has said it is going to phase out the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030. This car park proposal simply does not take that into account. It makes poor business sense. They could be getting an additional revenue stream from electric car charging. Instead they are clinging onto the past and not taking the opportunity that the switch to more electric vehicles will bring. The private car park providers are completely missing a trick with regards to bike parking. Secure storage for bikes and e-bikes is severely lacking in Sheffield and there is huge demand for this. For a relatively small fee, I think many would pay to store their bikes. There’s potentially more money to be made from bike storage, because of the volume/numbers of bikes stored in a single car parking space.”",

Tired of years of abuse, university staff have finally decided to strike, and demand a re-think on the cynical marketisation of higher education.\nThis strike has occurred in response to yet another attack on staff pensions, which the University College Union (UCU) has estimated could mean a loss of about £10,000 per year for an average lecturer. People who have worked very hard for decades may end up on the verge of poverty, while private pension scheme and university top managers earn obscenely high sums of money.\nThis proposal typifies how university staff have been exploited for a long time, with overwork and mental health issues now having become endemic. Though the axing of the pensions represents the most immediate reason for the strike, the response has been of such scale – the largest academic strike in living memory – that it has shaken the very foundation of the currently hyper- commercialised university world.\nThe protest is about the soul and ultimate purpose of the university, to be regained as a genuine place of learning, as opposed to a business in which students are treated as customers and colleagues as competitors.\nThe students have fully understood the purpose of the action, and its importance for future generations, and have valiantly supported their teachers. Students and staff have worked closely together on picket lines, while universities became hubs of alternative teaching, creative activities, chants, dances and emotional displays of solidarity.\nIn this national dispute, Sheffield has represented a tower of strength, contributing to re-establish its role at the forefront of the fight for civil liberties; a role that has been much threatened by the recent reactionary attacks on peaceful protest. A common thread now unites many different strands of protest in their demand for a fairer society. There is a thirst for justice that can no longer be ignored.\nUmberto Albarella\nSheffield Green Party and Reader in Archaeology at the University of Sheffield\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

A FreeBee bus is now set to be introduced, on a new route from Fitzalan Square to Moorfoot, following a formal decision of the council.\nMartin Phipps, Green Councillor for City Ward, said,\n“It’s great to finally see sign-off on keeping Pinstone St closed to motor traffic.

It’s joined up the Moor to Fargate and High Street, as well as allowing more reliable and faster bus services to pass through the centre.\n“The delay of this sign-off by Labour has held up and caused uncertainty around the active travel and public transport schemes for the centre. It’s good we can now move forward with upgrading bus stops and with the city centre Connecting Sheffield scheme, which will be a big improvement.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Executive Member for Climate change, Environment and Transport, said\n“This project will transform the city centre, offering a good-quality, attractive environment in place of a line of motor traffic. It will actively promote walking and cycling and will join up public transport links in the city centre. It will improve biodiversity, the appearance of the streets and resistance to flooding. The improvements to Fargate, Pinstone St and Arundel Gate and beyond will also make the city centre more accessible to disabled people. It will help make people healthier and enjoy the city more. It will include a major contribution to the creation of the new Pounds Park.\n“This project allows us to invest multi-million pound awards from central government into Sheffield. It is a pity this project has been delayed by opposition from LibDem, Conservative and Labour councillors who opposed walking and cycling routes. However, it is a victory for cross-party working. Various claims opposing the improvements made at last September’s scrutiny committee were debunked with carefully-compiled evidence and public support.\n“I would like to thank all the people and businesses who showed their support for progress in the face of opposition. Together we can make the city a better place. This decision is a big win for everyone in Sheffield city centre now and in the future.”\nThe Connecting Sheffield improvements are funded through the Transforming Cities Fund. The city centre scheme joins up long-distance walking and cycling routes into the city centre from Nether Edge, Kelham Island – Neepsend and from Attercliffe / Tinsley. This element is an ambitious scheme to transform Sheffield City Centre into a greener, more accessible and attractive place to live, work and spend time. Proposals and images of the scheme can be seen on the Connecting Sheffield site.\nThe report agreeing to the funding of the scheme is available on the Sheffield Council site.\nThe decision accepts £1.4 million of grant funding to work up the detailed design of the scheme. This will trigger government funding for construction works of about £16 million for this city centre improvements alone.",

We are fully behind the implementation of Clean Air Zones. Thanks to long-running national campaigns on air pollution, these are now a legal requirement in cities like Sheffield, to improve the quality of life for residents in the shortest possible time.\n“Removing polluting vehicles from the inner ring road will have a positive impact on the health of residents across the whole city. It will also save the hard-pressed and under-funded NHS from treating people with chronic respiratory conditions.\n“Millions of pounds in grant funding have sat in the council’s bank account due to prevarication. We want this money to be allocated without further delay to taxi and van drivers so that we are meeting our legal commitments on air quality and getting important cash to local businesses.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson added,\n“As the former Executive Member responsible for promoting the Clean Air Zone, I was very pleased when the Labour–Green Executive approved the CAZ in October 2021 and accepted £24 million of government money to offer grants to upgrade taxis, buses and vans to cleaner vehicles. It is disappointing that these grants to small businesses are now being delayed again after sitting in the council’s bank account since 2020.”\nENDS\nFor more information, please contact Douglas Johnson on 07981 860 662 or at douglas.johnson@sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n- The council’s executive approved the Clean Air Plan on 26 October 2021 – see https://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=24042\n- Sheffield City Councill approved a Class C Clean Air Zone.

What we actually need is housing for people who want to live longer term in the city centre, and to build stronger longer-term neighbourhoods and communities.\nThe room sizes proposed by the developer are really poky. Living in spaces that are too small has a negative impact on people’s health and well-being. The proposed sizes for flats are very concerning. 16.3m2 for a corner studio flat is less than half the recommended size in the South Yorkshire Residential Design Guide, (which suggests 33m2 for a studio). The most common studio in the application is only 18.48m2, barely above half the recommended studio size, and even the accessible studios at 23.6m2 and 27.7m2, are all well below the recommended size. The 2 bedroom flat at 37.9m2 is also significantly below the 62 square metres recommended. It really looks like the developer is trying to cram as many units in as possible for financial reasons and to the detriment of the people who have to live there.\nOne thing that would really add to the quality of the development would be easy access to a pleasant open space, but there is insufficient open space or greenery for residents, both in the block itself and nearby.\nThe cycle provision doesn’t meet with Sheffield City Council guidelines for student accommodation – there should be at least 685 long-stay spaces, but this application only provides for 500. Also, there is no provision for tricycles/hand-cycles.\nI have strong concerns about the extra traffic generated – the travel plan calculates about 196 two-way trips per day to the block for refuse collections, taxi drop-offs, deliveries, etc. I feel this is a huge underestimate. I am also concerned there is no provision for loading bays etc, and there could potentially be multiple vehicles pulling up on the pavements nearby – causing obstruction and danger for people on foot.\nIf we are to truly regard ourselves as a ‘green city’, as Sheffield promotes itself, then this development simply doesn’t belong here”.\nReferences\nPlanning Application for a mixed use building to form 963 co-living residential units on land bounded by Rockingham Street, Wellington Street and Trafalgar Street",

As a result, several members of Nether Edge and Sharrow Green Party spent time talking to drivers over the course of several days, gently reminding them of the dangers to children of cars near the school.\nPeter Garbutt, Green Party candidate in the May council elections, said:\n“Parents were very pleased to see us,”\n“Some questioned how they could do otherwise than drop their children off by car, and their frustration is plain to see. But the safety of the children must come first.”\n“Getting children to school in the morning can be an event fraught with difficulties, matched only by picking them up again in the afternoon.”\n“Many parents take their children to school in the car because of fears of other dangers on the streets. Unfortunately, this leads to huge congestion outside schools before lessons start and after they’ve finished. The risk of a young child being hit by a car is very great at this time.”\nThe warnings earlier in the week were proved right when a near miss took place on Thursday 10th January. The group returned on Thursday evening, with Councillor Alison Teal saying,\n“We were shocked to hear a young girl had had a near miss in the morning,”\n“It really brings it home to you just how dangerous the situation is.\nWe’re so thankful the girl is unharmed.”\nThis same danger exists at almost every school in Sheffield.

The investment would lead to savings with fewer cases where housing and social services staff have to step in.\nIf accepted, Sheffield would join over 60 local authorities which have already taken this step, recognising this vulnerable group.\nCouncillor Alison Teal said\n“Getting into Council Tax arrears can mean fines, court summons and bailiffs. Young people who have left foster care or care homes need time and space to gain skills around managing money. They might not have the same support from family as many other people the same age but that’s where the Council can help. Exempting young care leavers from Council Tax is just giving a bit more support where it’s really needed.”\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson added,\n“This is an investment in a particularly vulnerable group where poor outcomes in future would mean council and social health services having to step in at far greater expense. The exemption would also underline the corporate parental responsibility that Sheffield City Council has for care leavers, giving them a fairer start in life.”\nNotes\n- The award-winning Children’s Society campaign begun in 2016, with 1 in 6 councils now putting the exemption in place https://www.childrenssociety.orguk/what-you-can-do/campaign-for-change/a-fairer-start-for-care-leavers/\n- There are around 440 young people between the ages of 18 and 25 who have left the care of Sheffield City Council and have to pay Council Tax. The exemption might lead to lost revenue of around £75,000, though the actual amount is likely to be lower, given the difficulty some care leavers have with paying.\n- The numbers of care leavers in Sheffield has been estimated following the Children’s Society method: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/children-looked-after-in-england-including-adoption-2016-to-2017/\n- The local authority has legal corporate parental responsibility for care leavers\n- The submitted motion is as follows:\nProposed by Cllr Alison Teal; Seconded by Cllr Douglas Johnson\nThat this Council: –\n(a) Notes that last year around 75 young people (aged 16 or over) left the care of Sheffield City Council and began the difficult transition out of care and into adulthood;\n(b) Further notes that a 2016 report by The Children’s Society found that when care leavers move into independent accommodation they begin to manage their own budget fully for the first time and can find this extremely challenging, often with no family to support them and insufficient financial education;\n(c) Further notes research from The Centre for Social Justice, which found that over half (57%) of young people leaving care have difficulty managing their money and avoiding debt when leaving care;\n(d) believes that as national welfare cuts are removing financial support and the national strategy on Care Leavers is inadequate, Care Leavers are a particularly vulnerable group for council tax debt\n(e) notes that Sheffield City Council has statutory corporate parenting responsibilities towards young people up to the age of 25 who have left care;\n(f) further notes that there are around 440 care leavers in Sheffield liable to pay Council Tax at any one time;\n(g) believes that, to ensure that the transition from care to adult life is as smooth as possible, and to mitigate the chances of care leavers falling into debt as they begin to manage their own finances, they should be exempt from paying council tax until they are 25.\n(h) believes that the lost revenue of around £75,000 in council tax receipts is excellent value given the positive impact that exemption will have for this vulnerable group, the duty the Council has under its corporate parenting responsibilities and the savings in reduced instances of housing and social care staff input;\n(i) therefore requests officers to take steps to exempt all care leavers from council tax up to the age of 25.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Times have changed, and now our throw-away culture is creating an unnecessary financial burden on consumers and wasting the finite resources of the planet. The Green Party wants local and national government to take action.\nUK consumers top the league in Europe as buyers of single-use, irreparable goods, according to scientist Professor Mark Miodownik, who presented the programme ‘Dare to Repair’ on BBC Radio 4 in May this year.\nThe solution is to change our habits and repair and reuse far more often than we do now. On a community level, Sheffield has embraced the idea.\nRepair Sheffield, a “repair café”, was launched in 2014. It is part of a movement of repair cafés popping up around the world, with over a hundred in the UK. The Repair Sheffield fixers mend anything from computers to bicycles, radios or even lawnmowers.\nMovements like repair cafés are slowly changing attitudes, but are unlikely to solve the problem without action from our leaders. This is why campaigners are calling on the Government to invest in industry and training for ‘resuse, reskill, recyle’ services.\nA report published in August calculates up to 50,000 new jobs could be created in Yorkshire and the Humber by 2035 in repair and recyle services. The study, by think tank Green Alliance, argues new roles could be created for repairers who fix electronics and machinery, remanufacturers, recycling operatives and biorefinery experts.\nGreen Alliance calls on the Government to set a target for the UK to halve its resource use by 2050, set up a £400m starter fund to stimulate the circular economy and retrain workers in declining industries.\nTougher government action is essential to limit the environmental cost of squandering finite resources. The key is to force manufacturers to stop building obsolescence into products in the first place. In July a step was taken towards tackling this when a new UK law, the Right to Repair Act, came into force enabling us to get appliances fixed rather than replace them.\nThe new law requires manufacturers to make spare parts and maintenance information available for products with the aim of extending their life. Currently, the law only covers lighting, washing machines, dishwashers and fridges, but campaign group Restart Project wants this extended to tech products such as mobile phones and computers.\nThe Green Party wants products and materials to be kept in use for as long as possible. The party calls on the Government to make recycling and repairing easier for all, reducing the need to buy new expensive products on a regular basis.\nThe Government must go further than toughening ‘right to repair’ legislation. It must follow through on its own rhetoric and divert investment away from projects with a high carbon footprint and towards sustainable industry.\nWe can all play our part as citizens and consumers, by ending our addiction to shiny new things. If we don’t act soon our legacy to future generations will be a planet that is itself beyond repair.\nA longer version of this article was published in the Sheffield Telegraph\nFurther reading:-\nhttps://www.",

Currently the NHS is at breaking point picking up a massive bill for pollution-related health issues.\nWe hope that a rapid transition to electric or hydrogen powered cars will make a big difference although they are are not pollution free. We would like to have seen the Chancellor increasing incentives to help people take diesel vehicles off the roads in the recent budget.\nOverall, people urgently need better public transport and safer cycling and walking options so they can choose to leave their cars at home.

We need a free electric bus that links all parts of the city centre.\nOther cities have benefited greatly from reducing the numbers of private cars visiting their centres.\nThis Council has declared a climate emergency. Transport accounts for a third of greenhouse gas emissions. We have a responsibility to enable people to travel in less polluting ways. Air pollution is dangerously high in parts of the city centre, having a terrible effect on people’s health.\nLast month we declared an ecological emergency. Sheffield is rightly proud of its parks, but the city centre is desperately lacking green space and tree cover. We can help to address this by turning concrete spaces into green spaces. We already have a wonderful example of this in Sheffield – the “Grey to Green” schemes – providing safe and efficient walking and cycling, beautiful plants and important flood protection.\nThe city centre can become an even better cultural, leisure and shopping destination, and, for its residents, we’d like to see it become a liveable neighbourhood, with a full range of independent shops and services within easy reach.\nThis is a fantastic opportunity to transform the centre of Sheffield, whilst dealing with the challenges of inequality, and the climate and ecological emergencies.",

Cllr Douglas Johnson has written to the inspector in support of the planning committee’s decision:\nDear Mr Cannon,\nIt has just been brought to my attention that the developer has appealed. As an objector on the original planning application, I understand the local authority should have informed me of this appeal. This did not happen but I hope you will take these comments into account. I am therefore writing with brief comments in support of the decision to refuse planning permission.\nI am a councillor for the ward where the Old Coroner’s Court is situated and I also have an interest in heritage issues. This area is close to the original heart of Sheffield, which is currently the subject of much professional and political discussion as to its future redevelopment. Indeed, this has been so contentious that a formal consultation on a proposed Castlegate Conservation Area, which would have included the Old Coroner’s Court, was cancelled abruptly on the instruction of then then Cabinet member, Cllr Mazher Iqbal, after “vociferous challenge” from developers.\nAs set out in my objection letter – which summarised informal feedback from constituents – I noted the design was “frankly, uninspiring and look like a multi-storey car park.” Its location, as planning committee members will have known, overlooks an important and new public riverside park.\nIn my view, the proposed development would be a significant, adverse effect on the setting. For that reason, I think the committee was entitled to come to the view that it did. It was clearly within its discretion.\nIt seems to me that the developer’s main ground of appeal is that he had met with the cabinet member and with officers and he implies he had been promised the result he sought. The developer is entirely mistaken [5.19 of the grounds] when he states the design “was agreed by the delegated planning officer.” The decision was one for the Committee, after hearing from the developer and reading the officers’ advice- it was not delegated to the officer.\nI trust this is of assistance.\nDouglas\nCllr Douglas Johnson, (Green Party)\nCity Ward, Sheffield\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This comes after months of severe disruption brought about by the catastrophic May timetable change and weekly strikes by RMT staff on Northern Trains.\nGreen Party campaigners across Yorkshire will be speaking to rail users across Yorkshire making sure rail passengers are aware of the “Delay Repay” compensation scheme to “‘make the rail companies pay”.\nSheffield Green Councillor Douglas Johnson said “Opinion poll after opinion poll [1] has shown that the British public know that railway network isn’t fit for purpose and change urgently needs to happen.\n“But that doesn’t help rail users here in Sheffield when they are stood on the platform waiting for a late – or worse still cancelled – train. There feels like there is little we can do except wait – or if you can, ditch the train altogether.\n“Rail users must make the rail companies pay for their incompetence – literally. The Delay Repay scheme lets passengers claim compensation for late-running services.\n“Yes, the compensation doesn’t make up for being late for work, or missing an important meeting but it is only right that we are compensated for a service that does not get to the destination on time. The more it costs the companies who are being paid to run these inadequate services, the quicker they will act.”\nFormer Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who will be at Sheffield Railway Station on Wednesday morning said: “Many of our cities here in Yorkshire are some of the most congested and polluted in Western Europe.\n“We all know that the current system has failed, but we need to take a step back and look at how rail fits in with our transport policy as a whole. We must prioritise clean and cheap public transport that mean people can get around without having to rely on cars.\n“The Green Party is calling for sweeping changes to transport policy including ending the expensive franchising system and instead co-ordinating national train services with profits reinvested back into the network – as happens across most of Europe.”\n“We also want to see better co-ordination of public transport and a significant increase in investment to reduce pressure on our congested roads and offer a real alternative to car travel.\n“Having just been at the UN climate talks in Katowice, I saw first-hand just how behind our trains are those on the Continent. German trains have large, comfortable seats, with space to stretch out and toilets that don’t smell. I saw Polish trains with ample cycle provision, and a Czech Pendolino with a dedicated children’s space with carpeted seating and big screen for cartoons.”\nNotes\n1. https://fullfact.org/economy/do-public-want-railways-renationalised/\nSheffield Green Party campaigners will be at the station from 7am to 11pm.

I use the parks, shops, cafes and pubs. I’ve grown my life here with my family. We had our children here at home in Meersbrook. My daughter goes to school here at our local primary school. My life is this area and this area is part of us.\nI grew up in a single-parent family on a Northern council estate in a safe Labour seat. I understand what it feels like to be ignored by politicians who take people and their votes for granted. I understand the plight of those who need the help of organised communities and trustworthy politicians the most.\nI feel compelled to stand for election, not because I want a career in politics (I wouldn’t be in the Green Party if I wanted that) but because I can’t resist standing up to the current administration. Like many people in Sheffield, I am angered by the way the local council operates: entitlement to rule, sham consultations, a relentless desire to accommodate big business at the expense of Sheffielders, the lip service to democracy and the environment. Their hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me.\nI want to stand for what matters; to be the voice of the people, not the voice of the leader of the council. I will stand up for Green politics; having decisions made as locally as possible, genuinely protecting our environment and fighting for our future.\nThere is so much to do in this ward and many good people are trying to make the place even better than it is. I feel my ability to bring people together to achieve a common goal will give these local voices a chance to be at the forefront of local politics.",

The proposal was to remove the existing 3 storey blocks and build a much higher building in its place. Following representations by Green Councillors in the City Ward the proposal reduced the number of storeys from 10 to 7.\nCouncillor Martin Phipps who represents the Greens in City Ward said,\n“It is not just people’s light that needs to be considered but their privacy as well. The windows of officer workers will be directly opposite the living rooms of people living in Berona House and St Paul’s Chambers. That is simply not acceptable. Residents have made a strong case to the Council regarding their right to direct sunlight and privacy and I wholeheartedly support them.”\nGreen Cllr Peter Garbutt said,\n“Even at 7 storeys the building is still oppressive and overbearing to its neighbours. Imagine if someone built a tower block in front of your kitchen window. It simply wouldn’t be allowed but somehow because it is in ‘The Heart of The City’ it is deemed acceptable. It is not fair to existing residents. City dwellers deserve just as much consideration as the rest of us. It’s their homes and their well being we are talking about after all.”\nThe Application was lost. 7 voted against the application and 6 for. So Councillors rejected the proposal by officers to accept the application.\nCllr Martin Phipps said,\n“I am really pleased that the majority of the Committee understood and appreciated the strong case put forward by residents and supported by local Green City Ward Councillors.”",

Many businesses said it had a positive impact. People of all ages reclaimed the street for walking, cycling and mobility scooters.\nCllr Ruth Mersereau commented,\n“It was great to see people enjoy having more space to browse the shops and businesses on Division Street.\n“Without cars, the street space was much easier to walk around and more pleasant to be in.

I have got to know some very committed front- line workers, who deal with people with very complex needs.\n“I also lead the Green group of eight councillors, who have been effective at making the Council leadership more accountable. Together, we make full use of our place in the Town Hall and speak up for residents. We campaign for a safer, healthier city that is just more pleasant to live in, with less traffic, better local services and good community spirit.\n“Before being a councillor, I worked as an advice worker and legal aid lawyer, saving people from eviction and using the law to fight discrimination.

This would mean an end to political debate that could criticise or offer alternatives to Labour. Green councillors are proposing to keep motions on the agenda to restore local democracy.\nCouncillor Martin Phipps, Sheffield Green Councillor for City ward said,\n“At the November 2019 Full Council Meeting Green councillors embarrassed the Labour group by highlighting their practice of deleting all of the text of our motions. Now, we have lost the opportunity to submit and publicise motions entirely.\n“Sheffield Labour and the city council are well known nationwide for their devious, top-down approach, lack of transparency and lack of accountability from the tree felling saga. This is not an isolated case, but their general way of working spilling out into public view. Despite the backlash against this and falling vote share across the city, they continue to push ahead avoiding debate because they have run out of ideas.\n“Councils across the country continue to hold meetings and debate issues, despite the lockdown. Sheffield Labour instead uses the pandemic as an excuse to shut down democracy, accountability and scrutiny.\n“During their time in power, Labour have reduced the number of motions that Opposition groups can submit – the Green group of 8 councillors is now only permitted to put 4 items on council agendas each year. Now, even these are benign removed. They are now openly abandoning any democratic pretence and are pushing for motions to be suspended. This administration is obsessed with power and control.\nCouncillor Angela Argenzio, added,\n“What they are doing is outrageous. Surely in these exceptional times, they should be seeking experience, advice and ideas from outside their bubble, not excluding everyone.\n“What Labour are doing in Sheffield, in terms of their resistance to scrutiny, is straight out of the Tory government playbook.”\nNotes\n- The agenda for the full council meeting on 7th October 2020 is at: http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=7673\n- Labour councillors will propose that no debates are held at council meetings in November, December and February and will be replaced by a presentation from officers. Traditionally, no motions take place at the January meeting. March is the budget-setting meeting.\n- The Green councillors’ amendment calls for:\nthe ordinary meetings of the Council to be held on 4th November and 2nd December 2020 and 3rd February 2021, will include Public Questions and Petitions, and Members Questions”;\nthe time limit for Members’ Questions at those meetings be extended to a period of up to one hour to allow for scrutiny of the Executive; and\nbelieves that debate is vital for democracy and accountability and therefore agrees to include at least one notice of motion on topical local issues from each group at each of those Council meetings. - For previous comment on the Labour Administration restricting Opposition voices, see https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2019/03/29/councillors-must-be-able-to-represent-electorate/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has an arrest warrant against him from the International Criminal Court.\n“South Yorkshire Pensions Authority should amend its Responsible Investment Policy to explicitly add exclusions and a policy of divestment from states and companies committing or profiting from human rights abuses and breaches of International Law. They should publish their holdings in states involved in human rights abuses, companies which produce weapons and companies which produce fossil fuels.\n“If we are really going to make the world a safer, more peaceful place then the financial choices that we make should be ones that protect our environment and oppose injustice and war.”\nNotice of Motion Regarding “Opposing Sheffield Council Taxpayers Investments In Israel, Weapons Manufacturing and Fossil Fuels” – Given By Councillor Paul Turpin And To Be Seconded By Councillor Toby Mallinson\nThat this Council:-\n(a) welcomes the ceasefire in Gaza but condemns Israel’s mass killing of civilians up until implementation of the deal;\nnotes:\n(b) that over 46,000 people in Gaza, including 14,000 children, have been killed by Israel, and 90% of homes have been destroyed, with the help of UK-made weapons;\n(c) the body of evidence and reports, including by Al Haq, Amnesty International, the UN, Human Rights Watch and Médecins Sans Frontières, saying Israel’s actions have been consistent with genocide;\n(d) the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for the Israeli Prime Minister;\n(e) the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that Israel must end its occupation of Palestinian territory immediately;\n(f) that the South Yorkshire Pensions Authority (SYPA) maintains investments in Israel, weapons manufacturing companies, and fossil fuel companies, and believes this contradicts its Responsible Investment policy principle to “do no harm”;\n(g) Sheffield residents campaigning for the Council and SYPA to end contracts and investments in Israel, weapons manufacturers and fossil fuel companies profiting from conflict;\nbelieves:\n(h) that war crimes must be investigated and perpetrators brought to justice;\n(i) that only justice, equality and an end to occupation can bring peace;\n(j) the UK Government’s military co-operation with Israel means it risks being complicit in war crimes, including genocide;\n(k) stemming from obligations laid out by the ICJ, councils and Local Government Pension Schemes (LGPS) must avoid procuring from or investing the funds they manage, in companies that facilitate Israel’s breaches of international law, including arms companies producing weapons used by Israel, companies conducting business activities in the occupied territories, and financial institutions which finance these companies;\nresolves to:\n(l) demand the Government ends all arms trade with Israel; stops supporting its military campaigns in Palestine, Lebanon and Syria; and supports accountability at the ICJ and ICC;\n(m) call on SYPA and the Border to Coast pension pool to oppose investments in Israel, arms companies and fossil fuel companies and for them to:-\n(i) amend their Responsible Investment policies to add exclusions and a policy of divestment from states and companies committing or profiting from human rights abuses and breaches of international law;\n(ii) clearly publish holdings in states involved in human rights abuses, companies which manufacture weapons, and companies which produce fossil fuels; and\n(iii) conduct rigorous due diligence to ensure that its funds are not being invested to profit from human rights abuses or war crimes;\n(n) ask the Chief Executive to forward a copy of this motion to the SYPA and Border to Coast Pensions Partnership; and\n(o) ask the Finance and Performance Policy Committee to ensure that this Council’s Ethical Procurement policy is robust to prevent contracts being awarded to companies which finance states in breach of ICJ rulings, arms companies and fossil fuels.",

That strategy will guide investment and that investment will determine, to a large degree, what happens in our local area.\n- It is important that TfN now strengthens the strategy to deliver the cuts in carbon emissions required. Transport in a network of relatively close towns and cities is an enormous opportunity for the government to achieve significant reductions in carbon emissions as well as the opportunities of levelling up and supporting economies.\n- The net zero date should be moved forward from 2045. Sheffield City Council has set a net zero date of 2030 to reflect the people’s determination to properly address the climate emergency with the priority it requires.\n- It is good to see the importance of bus, rail and active travel acknowledged but it needs stronger commitment to rail electrification, to buses, trams and to moving freight by rail\n- The strategy is too focused on new electric vehicles and new roads and it is not clear how emissions from new local road schemes are considered. Electric vehicles are not a panacea: they do carry a significant carbon footprint; they place a significant load on renewable energy generation; they do not reduce congestion; and, they will continue to produce particulate matter – pollutants from brake linings. Manufacturing the batteries depletes supplies of rare materials and high costs are involved in recycling these complex electrical systems. EVs are also as potentially dangerous/lethal as any other vehicles when involved in collisions.\n- The strategy needs more detail on reducing car use through things like; pricing car travel, including parking charges, and making space for buses and trams, including integrated ticketing, walking and cycling\n- An opportunity to link to inequality, public health and other benefits that arise from less traffic and cleaner air has been missed\n- Although 15-20 minute neighbourhoods are promoted, the interaction with Local Plans to reduce the need to travel is unclear – too much development is car based and getting worse\n- Active travel is integral and key to every strategic public transport journey and needs more strategic oversight from TfN. This strategy, however, delegates action to local authorities.",

This is not a surprise as working conditions and pay has been deteriorating since Conservative and Lib Dem’s imposition of austerity in 2010. Taking the example of nurses, pay has fallen in real terms by 20% in this period, leading to many having to access hardship funds, use food banks or simply walk away from the profession. In roughly the same period, the wealth of UK billionaires has increased by nearly 300%. Make no mistake, austerity and entrenched inequality are political choices.\nThese strikes are about far more than pay, as, in all sectors, conditions for work have deteriorated. New pay offers are being tied to measures which are likely to make them deteriorate further, such as longer hours, 7-day weeks, weaker pensions and compulsory redundancies. Again, people are voting with their feet. There are now 47,000 vacancies for nursing roles in England alone, with 40% fewer working in social care than 10 years ago. This is all a far cry from Sunak’s statement in 2020 saying that the NHS will get “whatever it needs” to deal with the country’s impending health crisis.\nInstead of dealing with this confluence of crises, the current government intends to stifle dissent, crucial to any properly functioning democracy, whilst simultaneously blaming the workers most affected by their own policies and their refusal to negotiate. This can be seen in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act which would give police the power to break up protests if they are deemed too ‘noisy’, and with the promise of ‘tough new laws’ to prevent and restrict further strike action by unions trying to protect their jobs.\nIn Sheffield, and nationally, the Green Party is proud to support those on strike. We recognise that it is the 12 years of wilful neglect that has caused the current situation we find ourselves in, not the strikers themselves who, after all, are part of the working public the government are claiming to protect. We recognise that it is not the demands of the unions which cause inflation to rise, but profit jumps of oil and gas giants and other large corporations, as well as ‘external forces’ the Tories blame it on. We know that public sector pay rises are both deserved and provide long-term security to the services we cherish. Even if an inflation-matching pay award of 11% was given to all public sector staff, this would still be less than what the Tory mini-budget cost the UK economy in September. It will also reduce the huge amounts of funding currently being squandered on absurdly high agency fees to cover unfilled posts.\nBut more than all of this, we recognise that fully functioning public services are the bedrock of a more just and equal society, one in which opportunity and access to services, work, wealth and information are afforded to everybody, not just the privileged few.\nCllr Marieanne Elliott, Sheffield Green Party",

According to their profiles, we have a Cabinet full of saintly public servants.\nThe sincere apology for collective Cabinet support for totally unacceptable actions relating to street tree campaigners was missing from them all. This apology is needed for any possibility of mending fences but clearly it won’t be given.\nNone of them chose to explain why Cabinet members secretly colluded with Amey and the police on the pre-dawn Rustlings Road tree-felling operation. Why they collectively supported the use of anti Trade Union legislation to seek imprisonment of peaceful tree protesters, incurring more than £413,000 in legal costs for taxpayers. Why Cabinet members sought to deride tree campaigners in the local press with unsubstantiated and untruthful claims. Why Cabinet members consistently offered “fake news” about the Streets Ahead contract and falsely claimed “trees are only replaced as a last resort” and “there are no targets for tree-felling”.\nDemocracy continues to plumb new depths in Sheffield as a dictatorial Labour Cabinet imposes decisions on us without any meaningful consultation.

The worry is that the ‘leading national occupiers’ interested in the Gilders site will simply continue this trend towards our local centre becoming a clone-town street of national chains. Local independent businesses help knit an area together. They tend to have close links with other local businesses and services. They are more likely to provide jobs where employees can have a real say over the business. They also keep money circulating round the local economy, rather than seeing it disappear off into the pockets of distant shareholders. It can be difficult to make time for shopping outside the big chains, but buying locally benefits us all.

The other is Eamonn Ward.\nI moved to Sheffield 44 years ago to work in the engineering industry and it’s been my home ever since. I retired several years ago and have given a lot of my time to voluntary work, mainly living overseas in Asia: that has given me insights into non-white, non-western cultures and something of what it’s like to be ‘a minority’ or ‘an alien’.\nHere in Sheffield, I’m a non-car user and have been active in campaigning for safer streets and cleaner air, for better public transport and to improve the conditions for those who walk, wheel and cycle in the city – with the council’s cycle forum and the Sustrans charity.\nI have two daughters and three grandchildren; and I’m concerned to ensure they have a sustainable, greener, cleaner future. If elected, I would also work with other Green councillors to bring more action on warmer homes with reduced energy bills, through improving insulation and other measures.\nIn my spare time, I enjoy cycling and walking in the Peaks and the trails in the north and east of Sheffield; and I’m keen to see everyone in all parts of Sheffield enjoy the health and well-being benefits of green public spaces and a better environment.\nI’m also deeply concerned at the inequality and poverty that is forced on so many of us by an unjust economic and political system. I regularly help Green party collections for the S6 Foodbank, but we need to do more than just give immediate help to those in need.\nIf elected I can promise to be available, to listen and to work hard to deal with the needs and concerns of the people of Firth Park.\nGreens welcome agreement on City Budget",

I was a secondary school teacher for 16 years and for the past seven years I have worked in the voluntary sector: for five years for a disability charity and for the last two for a homeless charity. I’m also the trustee of a local human rights organisation.\nI’m an EU citizen who moved from Italy to Sheffield 26 years ago and have raised my family here. I love how diverse the ward is and I am engaged with many community groups in all parts of the ward: in the nearly four years since being elected, I have supported the volunteer group BBEST to get their Neighbourhood Plan to the referendum stage and finally passed in 2021. I support the Hanover TARA in all their dealings with Sheffield City Council and I was instrumental in the publication of the report about the cladding of the Hanover Tower in 2020. I regularly support litter picks in Broomhill, Broomhall and Hunters Bar as well as attending as many community meetings as I can.\nSince being elected in 2019, I have been a member of various SCC committees: Health Scrutiny, Licensing and Audit & Standards. I am particularly interested in governance and finance so I am pleased to still be a member of the Audit & Standards committee. In the municipal year 2021-22, I was the Adviser to the Executive Member for Inclusive Economy and skills, taking particular interest in the skills and adult education side of the portfolio and concentrating on expanding the offer of training for green jobs in Sheffield.\nSince May 2022 I have been the Co-chair of the Adult Health & Social Care Policy Committee and a member of the Strategy & Resources Policy Committee. I am also the Deputy Speaker for the Green Group at Sheffield City Council.\nAs Co-chair of the AHSC Policy Committee, I have set the tone for our work ethics by co-chairing with a Councillor from another group and involving the deputy (from the third group) from the very start. The three groups have been involved in every single decision and we have made every single one by consensus. The AHSC Committee is often used as an example in SCC of how well the committee system can work despite the fact that we had to find the most savings for the 23-24 budget (47% of all SCC savings for the year)!\nI am a team player: I work extremely close to my ward colleagues, Brian and Maleiki. We speak to each other virtually daily and meet at least once a week. We share the workload and we always try to do our best to support our constituents.\nI also work closely with the whole Green Councillor Group and I am well respected by colleagues in other political groups.\nI am very proud of my record as a councillor: I work hard and I am totally committed to the role to ensure that we get the best outcomes for a greener future for the citizens of Sheffield. If elected again I will continue to work hard to ensure that we achieve climate and social justice for our citizens and close the inequality gap in the city. In my role as a councillor, I am most happy when I am able to help residents.”\nUpdated May 2023",

These include:\nAll Councillors now take part in the decision-making of the Council;\nThis makes Councillors more accountable to the electorate due to their involvement in decision-making;\nautocratic top-down decision-making is reduced by the Committee system;\nthe successful work, across the committees, to address the Council’s current financial crisis, with Councillors having worked together to reach an understanding of the issues and consensus over the ways to address them;\nDespite the hardest ever budget shortfall this year, cross-party working has achieved a broadly balanced budget to stabilise the council for the next financial year.\nCouncillor Angela Argenzio who is proposing the motion said,\n“No political system is perfect and the Council still has a long way to go, but the fact that most of the Council’s financial difficulties have been debated and agreed, across party, before the crunch Budget meeting on March 1st is a major achievement. This has never been achieved before and would not have been possible without the Committee system. It has brought Councillors together, across the party divides , to put tribalism aside, to understand the issues and to come to a consensus on how to address difficult problems.\nSome Councillors were comfortable with the old way of working, where backbenchers and opposition parties had no say over decisions and a small elite of Councillors called the shots. Some have not understood the difference between a Cabinet member in the old system and a Committee Chair in the new system.\nOne area that we have not properly developed is how we engage the public in Council decision making. That has to be a strong focus for the Council going forward. Improving the way the Council works is good but if we are not properly engaging with the public then decisions are not always understood, can be misinterpreted and can be subject to political manipulation.\nGetting some political groups to accept that we have a more democratic council, and that we have joint responsibility for decisions, is still work in progress. We can change the way the Council conducts business but changing the culture of the Council is still work in progress. I am optimistic and I believe we can have greater collaborative and consensual working across political groups.”\nNOTES\n26,419 people signed the petition to call for a referendum on changing the council’s governance system. This forced the council to hold a referendum. The previous Administration declined invitations to move to a committee system voluntarily.\n89,670 people (65%) voted for and 48,727 (35%) voted against a change to a modern committee system in the referendum held in May 2021.",

The Government plans to cut this £20 a week on 31 March 2021.\nBenefit rates in the UK, for those of working age, are extremely low compared to those in Europe. The £20 uplift stopped some people falling into the most dire of financial circumstances but it is nowhere near enough to avoid people experiencing significant hardship, with people often being unable to feed their families or pay their bills.\nAccording to the Resolution Foundation, pressing ahead with the £20 cut would see the level of unemployment support fall to its lowest real-terms level since 1990-91 and its lowest ever, relative to average earnings. The basic level of out-of-work support prior to the March boost was – at £73 a week (£3,800 a year) – less than half the absolute poverty line. Even if the £20 stays, the level of benefits will not provide enough income to meet basic needs.\nSheffield City Council has reported a fourfold increase in use of foodbanks since the start of the Covid crisis. Spires Foodbank in Arbourthorne reported a 1000 % increase in demand for food aid in the first lockdown. The council has now set up a Working Group on Food Poverty.\nSheffield Green Party calls on the Chancellor Rishi Sunak to announce in the budget on 3 March that the £20 uplift will be maintained. We also want the government to recognise the need to introduce a Universal Basic Income as a long term solution to poverty. Sheffield City Council has already passed a motion in support of UBI and it has long been Green Party policy. We must address the injustice of income inequality.\nAlexi Dimond,\nGleadless Valley\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Much of our public land has already been transferred to the private domain, so it is imperative this issue receives parliamentary scrutiny and proper debate on the ramifications for the many who enjoy and deserve access to land, rather than serving a few individuals, or private entities.\nNatalie Bennett, Green Party member of the House of Lords, commented\nAccess to Nature is a human right and one we should not give up lightly. I’ve often focused on that right for children , but it must apply for all ages. Our understanding of how vital this is for health and wellbeing just keeps growing. If Scotland can protect its moors and respect the right to roam alongside private property rights, why would we seek to act differently?\nAlison Teal, Green Party councillor for Nether Edge and Sharrow said\nFor Sheffielders, the legacy of the 1932 Kinder Scout Mass Trespass is part of our local history and also testament to the power of peaceful civil disobedience, arguably leading to the creation of National Parks and our much loved long distance walking trails such as the Pennine Way.

A report to the committee said that the regeneration project was “no longer deliverable within the allocated Council budget” and a new approach and delivery plan was agreed.\nCllr Alexi Dimond said:\n“The Council has now admitted that the original Masterplan that was promised can’t be delivered and has committed to a new ‘whole council approach’. This will finally see senior officers taking responsibility for progressing the project – which is what councillors have demanded. The council now needs to demonstrate that it is committed to Gleadless Valley residents, as promises have been broken because the council announced a timeline with no means to deliver. We are pleased that the council has now committed to residents and local partners being included on the new board which is to be set up and must ensure that there isn’t a ‘top down’ approach.”\nCllr Paul Turpin said:\n“I’m really angry about how the Masterplan has failed but I do hope this will unlock its potential. We will keep fighting for the residents and it is vital local councillors are included in the new system and that democratic accountability is at the heart of how we move forward.\nIt’s also vital that local people are involved at every step, alongside their local elected representatives. As ward councillors who care about the area, we are all committed to ensuring that the refreshed plan will retain at least the same level of social housing that people can afford and that no one will be asked to move before new housing is built. We will also demand that people’s priorities such as warm, efficient homes, clean and safe green spaces and communal areas, effective waste management and better local services and shops are prioritised.\nCllr Marieanne Elliot said:\n“The Masterplan was approved in March 2022, but with no plan for delivery, or staff in place to deliver it. Residents were told that their homes would be demolished and they are, understandably, very upset as they have been left in limbo. This was irresponsible and should have been handled much better.\nPeople feel that their homes have been neglected by the council during this time so we are pushing for repairs to be done and there is now a dedicated fast-track repairs team to deal with repair work. If any Gleadless Valley resident has an outstanding repair please contact us and we will try to help.”\nReferences\n- The Gleadless Valley Masterplan was announced in 2017 and eventually approved in 2022, under the former Cabinet regime.\n- The estimated costs of all the work required has since doubled.\n- A cross-party Gleadless Valley Members’ Board has included councillors from each party as well as all three ward councillors. It has discussed progress on many projects in Gleadless Valley, including play space, wildlife, shopping centres, engagement with schools, repairs and maintenance, jobs and skills, food projects and establishing sites for new homes in place of abandoned care homes.",

People are so friendly and supportive. I moved around a lot during the time that I ran for South Yorkshire Mayor and it gave me an understanding of the different areas around Dore and Totley\nStanding for South Yorkshire Mayor in 2022, where I was in second place in Sheffield, opened my eyes to the clear difficulties with public transport. I have a passion for improving public transport and I will do everything I can to change the way business is done and ensure that buses are run for people not profit. Transport is integral to how we move in this county, it’s close to my heart as I desperately want to follow my dreams and be able to visit family in the most sustainable way I can. We need to bring buses under public control and support this with improved infrastructure. Say no to more road schemes and create better, integrated tram and rail services in South Yorkshire.\nI’m free to stand up for local people and truly represent the Dore & Totley community. In place of party bosses, I will be accountable to the people that make this area so vibrant. Instead of consultation, I will always insist on conversation. By pooling knowledge and combining willpower, we will work together to honour and embrace the opportunities presented by greening the interconnected systems that sustain our livelihoods. Greater conservation of energy coupled with lower impact energy sources, a transport system that gets us all moving, and jobs and skills that will support a thriving future.\nYou’ll sometimes find me in Coffee on the Corner, always happy to have a chat about what needs improving and how we can continue to support each other. I’ve recently volunteered at Transport 17 who provide group transport services to older and vulnerable people.

It has been left behind as 20mph schemes were developed around other residential areas. Slower vehicle speeds mean not just safer roads but less air pollution and noise, which is very important in built-up residential areas.\nPortsmouth’s citywide scheme cost just £573,000 in 2008. A similar trailblazing citywide scheme then would have been massively more cost effective than Sheffield’s piecemeal approach. But this scheme covers a large, clearly defined area so drivers will be aware of the consistent speed limit.

The Sheffield Youth Cabinet is beneficial to Sheffield, as it means that our young people’s voices are not only heard but listened to. It provides a platform for young people to engage in the democratic process, express their views, and contribute to policy making.\nThe Sheffield Youth Cabinet has been involved in a variety of different campaigns aimed at making Sheffield the best place it can be for our young people. I have met some of these amazing youngsters in the past and seen the great work they do. For example, they have set up a Sheffield Youth Police Independent Advisory Group (SYP YPIAG); a group that allows young people to give direct feedback to the police on issues that matter to them.\nAnother example is the SENDing Voices group for those who are aged 13 to 25 years with a special educational need or disability (SEND). This group amplifies the voices of those who have additional needs and gives them a seat at the table – making things better for all young people with SEND in Sheffield.\nThese are just some of the issues that the Sheffield Youth Cabinet is involved with. Our young people are all about representing the voice, views, and opinions of their peers in this great city. My ask to the amazing young people in this city who are passionate about an issue and want to be part of the conversation, is to get involved with the Youth Cabinet, as it is a great way to make a difference!

Unfortunately the Labour Group joined with the LibDems and didn’t support the forward-looking ideas in the Green Party amendment .\nCouncillors who have left Labour this year did support the Green budget amendment, however.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson , Leader of the Green Party Group said,\n“The Labour Group amendment made only one small change to the budget by increasing the penalty charges for fly-tipping and littering, which the Green Group supported. We are happy to support good ideas from other parties.\n“We were disappointed that Labour did not reciprocate by supporting the Green Amendment. There were no immediate financial implications in our amendment and it would have asked the Council to investigate the viability of new significant sources of funding – the sort of funding we will need if we are to address the rising cost of energy, the need for clean affordable public transport and to tackle climate change. We hoped Labour might have seen beyond tribal politics and might have worked cooperatively with us in the interests of the city.”\n“The positive thing is that the Council has a budget that is agreed by all political groups on the Council. This is due to the new way of working, with a Committee System and no single party is in charge of the Council. This means political parties have to work together. The Green Party believes in working collaboratively with other parties is a good thing and we have never believed in tribal politics.

The risk is that those who can least afford it, like bin-workers, care-workers or cleaners, will bear the burden. The recent successes of workers in Sheffield, pushing Veolia and the University to improve pay, shows how important unions are.\nLike any political party, the Green Party doesn’t agree with every position taken by every union. But whatever your political colour, or even if it’s none, we all need to recognise the unions play in making our country a fairer more equal place. Unions are a voice, sometimes the only voice, that speaks up for the people turning up day-in day-out to keep our city going.\nThere are businesses that stand with workers through difficult times, who care about the quality of life, not just the bottom-line. Unfortunately too many employers\nfail to do that, offering poverty pay, contracts that offer no guaranteed wages, and workplace bullying. There is a union for everyone, in work or not, even if it is sometimes a battle to be recognised by employers. If you are stressed about low pay or conditions in your workplace, join a union!\nLetter published in the Sheffield Star, Saturday November 6th\nFor more on unions see our meeting on Trades Unions and the climate crisis",

The response was submitted to the council’s formal consultation on planning.\nHeadline points:\n- A “compact city” within 30 minutes walk from the city centre – where it is more convenient to walk than to drive, and easiest to cycle\n- New housing areas between Kelham Island and Hillfoot Bridge; the Wicker to Norfolk Bridge; Queen’s Road to Heeley Bottom\n- Better use of land must not mean lower standards: new housing must be good housing – big enough, warm enough and affordable to run, so people have decent places to live and work.\n- Designs for new housing must include shops, services and open green space; and be carbon-neutral\n- Opening of waterfronts and restoring moorland to soak up excess rainwater\n- Protecting the Green Belt\n- Better public engagement\n- Supporting good developers with a long-term commitment to the city and better enforcement against bad ones\n- Where proposals do not meet standards, we should not be afraid to refuse them\nDouglas Johnson, Green Councillor for City Ward, said,\n“Cities are uniquely placed to respond to climate change – good planning decisions can literally save the world. Commuting to work is bad for climate change, air pollution, people’s health and productivity– so we support more, good quality housing close to the city centre where people can both live and work.”\nBrian Holmshaw, Green Party candidate for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale ward is raising the question of tiny apartments with the scrutiny committee, saying,\n“In one recent local planning application, “substandard living conditions” were not considered to be grounds for refusal. In another application for “student residential accommodation,” the developer defended tiny room sizes as not being intended for “long-term student occupation.” This is not acceptable for the wellbeing of current or future residents.\n“Why have Sheffield City Council never put minimum space standards for housing in place and are they going to do it now?”\nENDS\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nThe Scrutiny Committee meets on Tuesday 19th January 2021 at 4.30pm. Agenda here: http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=7747\nThe Sheffield Green View is available at: https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2021/01/18/sheffield-green-view-2020/. The introduction states:\n- The Climate Emergency has utterly altered the way we need to see city growth and infrastructure. Cities are uniquely placed to help us respond to climate change. With a concentration of population, cities’ buildings, energy and transport account for 62% of the UK’s carbon emissions.\n- Sheffield Green Party aims to identify Sheffield City Council policies that will tackle the climate emergency; raise the standards of design, development and quality of life of Sheffield people; improve health and job opportunities; and provide homes which are accessible and more affordable. We agree with the statement in the consultative document for the Emerging Sheffield Plan 2020 that we believe in homes that are fit to live in – in an environment that is fit to work in – for many decades to come.\n- Consequently, Sheffield Green Party wants to see every council policy and decision make a contribution to tackling the climate emergency, including the objective of the city reducing carbon usage as early as possible. Plans and policies should be carbon-audited so that the zero-carbon target by 2030 can be achieved and subsequent carbon targets can also be reached.\n- Sheffield Green Party recognises the need for new infrastructure, housing, industrial and commercial land, and social facilities in local communities. Traditionally, this has meant increasing work-to-home travel time by expanding the geographical extent of the city. This is dangerous, because it worsens carbon emissions and health inequalities. Instead we believe Sheffield should concentrate less on growing its geography; and instead create more locally and neighbourhood-based economic, social and cultural networks.\n- Urban planning balances many competing interests, not least those of property against those of society. Better community engagement in planning and development issues will mitigate tension and conflict when balancing social, economic and environmental concerns relating to development.\n- We recognise there is a balance to be struck in ensuring that good standards of future sustainability and climate change-related considerations do not prevent development happening at all. However, we want to encourage developers with a long-term commitment to the city. We are aware that some developers will threaten to take their business elsewhere: if so, that is not a reason to foist substandard housing on future generations. Where proposals do not meet important standards, we should not be afraid to refuse them.\nRead the full document at: https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2021/01/18/sheffield-green-view-2020/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The source said that Cllr Mason is the Chair of the Campaign Improvement Board for Sheffield Labour.”\nLabour’s Campaign Improvement Board was set up by the Labour Party nationally to “support Labour Groups that require improvement” (1)\nCouncillor Alexi Dimond who represents the Gleadless Valley Ward said,\n“I asked these questions because I thought Sheffield people would want to know if the people elected locally were in fact controlled by shadowy figures in London who have no connection with our city.. I wanted to know what role the Labour Campaign Improvement Board played in local decision making and how often Sheffield Labour Councillors were meeting with them.”\nCllr Paul Turpin, Green Councillor for Gleadless Valley asked if the Labour Leader of Ealing Council would come to Sheffield to meet Councillors of all parties. His question was also ruled out of order. He commented,\n“ It is important that local people know what is going on behind the scenes, and how our local democracy is being subverted by people who live hundreds of miles away and who no one in Sheffield ever voted for.”\nGreen Councillors Maroof Raouf and Alexi Dimond also asked a number of questions regarding the war on Gaza. This followed the controversial raising of the Israeli Flag on Sheffield Town Hall on the 10th October and public statements by Labour Leader Keir Starmer where he said it was Israel’s right to cut off power, water and food to millions of Palestinian civilians. Councillor Raouf also asked whether Councillor Hunt would support the raising of the Palestinian flag, following a request from Green Party Councillors on Friday 20th October. These questions were all ruled out of order.\nCouncillor Maroof Raouf, a Green Councillor for Nether Edge and Sharrow Ward, said,\n“Many local people are very concerned about what local politicians think about the war in Gaza and the collective punishment being heaped on the Palestinian people. Hundreds of people came to a rally for Peace in Gaza in front of Sheffield City Hall on Saturday. I was asking the questions that many of them would want answers to. Is the local Labour Leader following the line from Keir Starmer nationally? I, like many others, wanted to know whether he regarded the raising of the Israeli flag on the Town Hall on the 10th of October as a mistake, Though my questions were ruled out of order, Cllr Hunt has the opportunity to answer those questions in the debate on the Green Party motion on the war in Gaza on Wednesday”.\nReferences\nLabour’s plan for councils: authoritarian, or a mechanism designed to help? – LabourList | Latest UK Labour Party news, analysis and comment\nCouncillor Alexi Dimond’s disallowed questions to Councillor Tom Hunt\n1.

The sourcesaid that Cllr Mason is the Chair of the Campaign Improvement Board for Sheffield Labour.What is the role of the Campaign Improvement Board and is Cllr Mason the Chair?\n2. What role does the board have in decision making in Sheffield, including those of each policy committee?\n3. How many meetings have you or other Sheffield Labour Councillors had with Labour’s Campaign Improvement Board since the May Local Elections?\n4. It has been reported by ITV that the national Labour party has instructed Councillors that “they must not, under any circumstance” attend any protest or demonstration opposing Israeli war crimes in Gaza.\nHas the leader of this Council instructed any Sheffield Councillors in this way?\n5. When asked by Nick Ferrari on LBC during the Labour conference if Israel has the right to cut off power and water to Gaza, Sir Keir replied: “I think that Israel does have that right… It is an ongoing situation. Obviously, everything should be done within international law.”\nDo you believe that Israel has the right to cut off water and power to Gaza?\n6. Does the Council support international law and how can Keir Starmer’s views be compatible with international law?\n7. Does the Council still recognise the state of Palestine and believe that its capital should be East Jerusalem, and that all of Gaza and the West Bank should be part of this state?\nCouncillor Paul Turpin’s disallowed question to Councillor Tom Hunt\nWill you arrange for the Leader of Ealing council, Cllr Peter Mason, to visit Sheffield in order to meet the councillors. I would certainly like to meet the new Leader of Sheffield City Council and it is long overdue for him to meet the elected members in Sheffield.\nCouncillor Maroof Raouf’s disallowed questions to Councillor Tom Hunt\nOn October 11th, the leader of your party went on national radio and said that Israel has the right to cut off power and water to the Palestinians. Do you agree with those same remarks?\nYou addressed the appalling attacks that took place in Israel as terrorism, you called them out for what they were, however not once have you called out the massacre taking place in Palestine as genocide, would you now like to do so?\nDo you agree with the relocation of Gazan civilians amounting to the war crime of forcible transfer?\nIsrael has not only bombed mosques but also bombed churches too, do you agree that this is disproportionate action taken against the Palestinians?\nGiven the war crimes Israel is committing in Palestine at this current time, would you now like to take the opportunity, along with the Chief Exec, and say that you were wrong to raise the flag of Israel above the City of Sanctuary?\nWould you agree that what we’re seeing in Gaza amounts to the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian peoples from the region of the world?\nWhat steps are you taking, along with your Party, to support a lasting peace between Israel and Palestine?\nFor the fifteenth consecutive day, Gaza remains under full electricity blackout. Given Israel’s strong willingness to withhold food, water, electricity, and medical supplies, including baby formula, would you now like to say you were wrong in choosing Israel over Palestine?\nDo you and your Party call on Israel to stop the bombing of Palestine?\nDo you still continue to have the support of all Sheffield Labour councillors?\nOn October 11th you said that “…Sheffield City Council displayed the Israeli flag to show solidarity with the innocent people in that country who faced appalling acts of terror”. Would you now like to honour our request that you fly the flag of Palestine to show solidarity with the innocent people in that country who have faced appalling acts of terror from Israel since her creation?",

I’d urged everyone who can to take the time to visit one of them to show their support for the struggle, and to urge everyone to use social media to express their disgust at today’s sentences.”\nThe defendants’ lawyer argued the ‘political process has been exhausted’ adding that the right to freedom of speech goes beyond ‘simply standing and shouting’.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

They are working towards gaining certification for ISO 14001 Environmental Management, which is a framework that will ensure they continually improve their environmental performance.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group on Sheffield City Council, said,\n“What impressed me most about the visit to Daver Steels was that the company’s very clear commitment to achieve environmental goals matched the financial benefits of doing so.\n“With rising energy prices, the payback on their solar panel investment has reduced from six years to three. This demonstrates that actions that reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions also make good business sense. They are looking at every element of their business from how they generate their energy, their transport use and how they recycle their waste.\n“Sheffield City Council and South Yorkshire’s Mayor need to be promoting environmental best practice like Daver Steels are already doing and make it commonplace. We need to see what we can do to make it easier for companies to get advice about reducing their emissions and costs; and also assess what can be done to help with financing the move to install renewable energy and energy efficiency measures for those who need that support.\n“Sheffield City Council has set a target of being a zero carbon city by 2030. This is a target for the whole city, not just the Council. So trailblazing SME companies like Daver Steels are important to show the way for others and demonstrate that a green future is not just possible but profitable too, no matter what the size of the business or organisation .”",

He has served Nether Edge and Sharrow as Councillor for the last four years and has been an active member of the party for 17 years. In 2015 he stood for parliament in Sheffield Hallam. This is the earliest photo I can find of him, at the Sharrow Festival in 2013, with Cllr Rob Murphy and Eamonn Ward. Here is his election address from 2019. Peter was active in the tree dispute and the It’s Our City Campaign. He was a founding member of Sheffield Extinction Rebellion and his social media is an excellent source of information on the climate. He was often to be found carrying the Green Party banner at demos, speaking at rallies. and organising litter picks in the community. Peter worked in many fields but for most of his career, he was a teacher. I am sure you will all join with me in thanking Peter for his service to the party and the community of Nether Edge and Sharrow, and wish him a very happy and well-deserved retirement from the Council.\nPeter writes about his experience on South Yorkshire’s Police and Crime Panel.\n“I sat for four years on the Police and Crime Panel. The purpose of this Panel is to hold the Police Commissioner to account for the way he holds the police to account. This was difficult to frame at first but became easier as time went on.\nThe Panel is made up of 12 councillors from across South Yorkshire – Sheffield has 4 – plus 3 Independent members.\nIt meets once a quarter for its official update meetings, but there are many others – notably the Public Accountability Boards, once a month. During the quarterly update meetings members are presented with a thick briefing paper with reports on Crime figures, police staffing, budgetary matters, etc. Each meeting lasts anything from two to three hours, usually held in Barnsley Council Chamber. We go through each report, with someone from the Commissioner’s office presenting, and members asking probing questions.\nDuring my time, I tended to concentrate on three topics. The first was the high and mounting figures on domestic violence; it represents about one in six of all police cases. I tried – with limited success – to get the Commissioner’s Office to dig more deeply into the figures – how many were repeat call-outs, how many were female victims/male victims etc. That’s an ongoing piece of work that needs following up. The usual response from the Commissioner was that the rising figures were good, because it meant more people were coming forward rather than hiding it, but could offer no evidence of this. In my final meeting, I made this point; what if more people were reporting it because more people were suffering from it? I received no satisfactory response.\nThe second field I covered was the force’s record on discrimination, both within the force and as regards its relationship with the public. I was able to be satisfied by the rising numbers of female officers, at all levels, and their retention; but not of ethnic minority officers, a figure which remains stubbornly low, with a high leaving rate. The same is true of LGBTIQ officers. Where the relationship with the public was concerned, I concentrated mainly on the figures for Stop And Search, which sees disproportionately high numbers of Black and Asian people stopped. The Commissioner informs me they’re trying to get to the bottom of why that is, but they’ve been trying for four years… He also says communities want MORE stop and search!\nThe final point I concentrated on was how environmentally aware the Police were, and have been encouraged to see more EVs as police vehicles, more solar panels on Police Stations, etc. However, when I asked whether the Commissioner was satisfied with the Police’s plans to deal with the effects of Climate Change, I was met with a blank look. This, too, requires following up.\nI dealt with several complaints regarding police behaviour at various events. When the main game shooting organisation gave demonstrations to various primary schools, the police partnered with them. I pointed out that shooting game is a contentious activity, which may give rise to political demonstrations, which the police would need to oversee; their endorsement of game shooting in this matter meant they would be unable to police it “without fear or favour”. I was gobsmacked to hear him say he hadn’t thought about it from that point of view.\nOf all the committees I’ve sat on this is the one I could make my voice heard most usefully; a Green voice, the only one they’ve ever heard.",

This prospect is particularly worrying for some, coming at a time when many households are already experiencing a cost-of-living crisis. We hope at least some of those affected are able to benefit from Manchester Airports Group’s offer to interview all staff directly employed by the airport\nHowever, the proposed closure of DSA does provide an opportunity to redirect public funds earmarked for the airport towards more environmentally and socially sustainable infrastructure projects. This might include restoring and improving South Yorkshire’s decimated bus services, extending Supertram, and further investing in clean technologies. This will not only give the region a much better chance of achieving it’s ‘zero carbon’ target by 2040, but also in providing meaningful and well-paid jobs for years to come.",

Government standards say that a one person dwelling should be a minimum of 37 square metres. The size of these studios does not allow for comfortable, reasonable living standards”\nBizarrely, the developers had said they didn’t want to build student accommodation in their planning statement as they said they ”are not comfortable with the small size of the units and it is not in line with their premium brand”. The development is said to be aimed at post-graduates, empty nesters, young professionals and ‘downsizers’.\n“Actually this development seems to be aiming at cramming as many units as possible into Rockingham House to maximise their profits and minimise space standards.”\nCllr Mersereau expressed concern that the increase in height of the building was not in keeping with the nearby conservation area – and the loss of light would negatively impact residents in neighbouring properties. She also referenced the lack of cycle parking with only 64 spaces for 162 apartments.\nCllr Mersereau also has some real concerns about fire safety in this block of cramped apartments; “as this is a change of use from office accommodation to residential accommodation, particular attention needs to be given to fire safety as there is no permanent protected shaft forming the central stair core. As the development is over 18 metres we need to ensure that cladding on the external wall is compliant with the latest building regulations. If it is not it should be removed. If we are serious about learning from the Grenfell tragedy then we need to ensure we have the very highest standards of fire safety in all apartments.”",

Jack Scott, Cabinet member for Transport and Sustainability, highlighted the need to change people’s ‘hearts and minds’. But we continue to see actions that do the opposite.\nI recently went to the Council’s Economic and Environmental Wellbeing Scrutiny committee. They were examining a report proposing changes to Environmental Maintenance Services that will reduce clearance of fly-tipping and standards of cleaning maintenance still further. Within those proposals is the removal of shrub beds along many city highways to make grass easier to cut. Numerous studies show that concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and particulates are reduced significantly by well-placed shrubs and trees to remove them from the air. We need to be increasing tree and shrub ground cover in Sheffield, not reducing it.\nGreen councillor Rob Murphy asked for the report to be referred back to be reconsidered in consultation with the Director of Public Health so the impact of removal could be assessed. Looking round the table he was the only councillor who voted for this to happen. The report was accepted and the changes will now go ahead.\nWithout thinking through and understanding how decisions made in one part of the authority affect other parts, air pollution will get even worse.

The playground is still there but a few years ago it was substantially reduced by a highly controversial school merger and now, not content with the damage that has already been done, the school has submitted a planning application for the construction of a new Multi Use Sports Area (MUGA), which will cover most of the remaining green area. Basically, grass will be replaced by whatever synthetic material they will decide to use. It is an environmental crime, which we can hardly tolerate in view of the current climatic crisis and due to serious concerns about the loss of biodiversity in Sheffield and elsewhere. The educational message that the school is giving to its students by wiping out most of its green area is very concerning.\nPeter Gilbert from Ecclesall Greens said “Most parents, pupils, and residents are appalled as many highly articulate and deeply felt objections demonstrate (versus only a handful of messages of support). Parents and residents have pointed out the educational and health benefits of children enjoying creative play in green spaces. Many chose Ecclesall just because it had this green space.”\nIt is also highly questionable that primary school children will benefit from a hard eight-lane athletics track more than from an open green field to run in and explore. There is also a great deal of perplexity about the behaviour of the school management, which has failed to consult children and their parents before moving forward with their planning application.\nOne further consideration is that a large amount of money is going to be spent on an unpopular project in a relatively affluent area, while many schools in Sheffield cannot even afford to repair their often-derelict buildings and facilities.\nPeople in the community are very concerned about the gradual disappearance of green spaces in Ecclesall and are determined to object to this further assault on the natural world in all possible ways.\nPlease, do register your objection by logging in here, where you’ll also be able to check previous comments. The current deadline for comments is 26 July but the sooner the comments are sent the better.",

If the Council regards health and air quality as high priority, why isn’t it being tougher with them on air pollution?\nThere appears to be deliberate silence on the air pollution impacts of the many developments coming soon close to M1 junction 34. The locations are chosen to bring in customers and stock via the M1. Everyone knows that people living in Tinsley suffer maximum exposure – Darnall council ward has very high levels of asthma, respiratory and circulatory disorders and cancer linked to high levels of poverty.\nSheffield Green Party is currently drafting a submission to the Meadowhall Leisure Extension planning application. This is the key question we will be asking the planning committee to consider:\n“At the IKEA decision meeting in 2014 the Council’s Director of Public Health stated ‘The exacerbation of poor air quality will undoubtedly cause more illness and very probably a small number of premature deaths. The adverse consequences are very unlikely to be outweighed by improvement in employment prospects and improvement in the economy.’\nSheffield Council’s Public Health Strategy, approved at Cabinet on March 15th 2017, states: ‘We will adopt a principle of health in all policies & systematically consider health and wellbeing outcomes, and inequalities across all of the decisions.’\nHow can this application proceed without major health impacts on vulnerable people in the areas affected by the business undertaken on this site?”\nEamonn Ward\nSheffield Green Party\nIn response to http://www.thestar.co.uk/business/ikea-and-meadowhall-pay-30m-to-cut-jams-in-sheffield-1-8718756\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It will also serve as a reminder to all Councillors and members of the public that this failure of leadership should never happen again.

Or is it?\nA third of Sheffield is within the Peak District national park, 60% is green space and we have 250 parks, woodlands and gardens plus 4.5 million trees – the most per person in Europe. We all benefit from this.\nBut the phrase “Europe’s greenest city” has been used too often in the past by political leaders running Sheffield to muddy the waters on climate emergency action. We have a massive head start and with more ambition could be one of the world-leading cities whose actions inspire others to follow.\nOpportunities were missed, like fitting thousands of council homes with solar panels at no cost when the Feed In Tariff made this more financially viable. The felling of street trees saw the national spotlight fall on a council disconnected from nature and the climate emergency.\nThe previous administration sat on £24 million government funding to implement a Clean Air Zone for 18 months. Current council leader Terry Fox argued to bring motorised traffic back to Pinstone St and Leopold St. Greens in the council executive, backed by officer reports and public support, have ensured that decisions have now been made on both that will move the city forwards, not backwards.\nThe Grey to Green project in Castlegate has shown what’s possible. Cities of the future need to be clean, attractive places to visit for leisure. We should be creating safe, traffic-free, walking and cycling environments in city centres with electric buses and taxis accessible within walking distance.\nWe can’t rely on current world or UK political leaders to take the urgent action needed to address the climate emergency. It’s down to us to act in our communities while collectively pushing all councillors of all parties to embrace the clean and healthy future we need.\nActing on the climate emergency must now drive all council actions if Sheffield wants to describe itself as a sustainable green city with real conviction.\nThis letter was sent for publication, to see all our letters to the press click here",

The Green Group has previously proposed the establishment of an e-cargo delivery hub in its amendments to the council’s budget.\nCouncillor Mersereau said,\n“With the introduction of Clean Air Zones in many cities, new ways of delivering goods to shops using electric vehicles and cargo bikes are being trialled. This is something we should be doing in Sheffield.\n“In Glasgow, a last mile delivery hub launched in September as part of a £300 million investment in electrification of delivery services (1). In London, after four months of operations, the e-cargo bikes operating from the Pimlico hub travelled nearly 6000 miles, which led to a reduction in emissions of CO2, NOx, and harmful particulates when compared to petrol and diesel van deliveries.(2) There are other trials being undertaken in the London Borough of Wandsworth and in Holmfirth (3).\n“There are now a variety of electric powered cargo bikes available, each with the capacity to deliver 190kg of goods to businesses in city centres. (4) E- cargo bikes will not be the only solution, but can play a big role, alongside electric delivery vehicles.\n“It is not just air quality that improves by using e-cargo bikes. It also means safer and quieter city streets with less heavy, noisy and polluting vans and lorries. It can also reduce the number of delivery vans parked on kerbs, making our city centre a healthier and more pleasant place. That has to be good news for our environment, for people and for business.\n“This is exactly the sort of project that funding from the Clean Air Zone should be used to support. We can reduce the number of polluting vehicles in our city centre and at the same time time enable viable, less polluting, quieter alternatives.\nReferences\n- Amazon launches electric cargo bike deliveries with Glasgow micromobility hub (fleetnews.co.uk)\n- Launch of e-cargo bike ‘last mile’ delivery hub will help improve Wandsworth’s air quality – Wandsworth Borough Council\n- How an e-cargo bike is delivering for environmentally-conscious businesses in the Holme Valley – Huddersfield Hub\n- Vehicle Solutions – e-cargobikes.com",

It’s great to see so many people here passionate about addressing it and acting now.\nOne Health isn’t a term I’d actually come across before, but I think it perfectly encapsulates the approach that is needed to address the climate crisis. Much like we have seen in the spread of covid during the pandemic, we are all interlinked. Climate change does not have borders.\nIn Sheffield we can expect: wetter winters and more intense rainfall, meaning higher flood risks and, due to more surface water, higher and more severe flash flood risk, warmer and drier summers that may affect our food and water supply, as well as damaging buildings and infrastructure, ecosystems and biodiversity to be hugely impacted due to the changing climate and price increases of energy, unless we successfully switch to renewables.\nNationally and regionally we can also expect rising sea levels, with reports suggesting that Doncaster could be on the seaside in 30 years, with significant parts of it underwater, as well as more extreme storms.\nInternationally we can expect more drought and famine, with rising sea levels set not to just flood settlements, but whole countries. I’m sure many of you will remember the passionate press conference the Foreign Minister of the pacific island Tuvalu, Simon Kofe, gave to COP 26, standing at a podium in the sea to highlight rising sea levels. We can expect huge numbers of climate refugees, people leaving their homes which have been made no longer habitable.\nBetween 2030 and 2050 climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, diarrhoea and heat stress. The direct damage costs to health is estimated to be between 2 – 4 billion dollars a year by 2030.\nInequality has fueled climate change, in 2019 it was revealed in a report that 20 companies were behind a third of all climate emissions. We know the richest companies and individuals in the world are disproportionately the largest contributors to the climate crisis, with Oxfam estimating that the richest 1% caused double the CO2 emissions of the poorest half of the world from 1990 to 2015. We also know that it is the global south and the poorest countries that are going to be hit the worst by climate change, those with less money and less money in health systems will be the least able to respond to its impacts, as well as geographically being the most impacted by rising temperatures and sea levels.\nWe cannot address the climate crisis without addressing the inequity that fuels it and is being fueled by it. Countries that are bearing the brunt and expected to face the worst of the climate crisis must be supported by the wealthier countries that have been the largest contributors to the crisis, both in supporting adaptation and mitigation as well as in reducing their emissions.\nAs a wealthy city and country we must be leading the way in decarbonising, and in raising people up in doing so. Climate justice is social justice. This is why we brought a motion in 2019 to Sheffield council declaring a climate emergency and that we must act to be net zero carbon by 2030.\nInsulating houses and fitting solar panels and heat pumps will not only reduce household emissions, it will save people money. Improve public and active transport will reduce car dependency and enable those on the lowest incomes who are unable to afford a car to get around better, as well as the health benefits from walking and cycling.\nWe know the role all of these play in health, with air pollution in Sheffield contributing to the early death of 500 people a year. The driving causes of climate change are driving causes of health inequality. To address one we must address another.\nA concept that we’ve been pushing as a group and I’ve personally been pushing in my role as a health committee member in the council is of a well-being economy. This is a way of looking at our economy not just in terms of GDP, but in terms of health and well-being outcomes, judging a successful economy by these and making decisions to improve health and well-being.\nNew Zealand, Scotland and Wales are just 3 countries that have adopted this model, and addressing the climate crisis has been Central to this health\nGoing back to the One Health approach and our interconnectedness, I was recently messaging someone I know who works in the NHS about the NHS Green plan. The council cannot address climate change on it’s own, and neither can our health organisations, we need a One health approach desperately to do this. We have seen how humans can adapt and act in the face of crisis over the recent years, it is critical we do this at pace now for the climate crisis in the face of an ever narrowing window of opportunity, as stated by the latest IPCC report. We must act now to stay within a 1.5 C rise from pre industrial levels.",

These 3 officers are paid by the Council but do research and press work for the Labour and Lib Dem groups. That amendment was rejected by the majority vote of Labour councillors.\nSince the pre-dawn raid on Rustlings Rd in November 2016 we have seen the Labour spin doctors go into overdrive. “Trees are only replaced as a last resort” is trotted out again and again despite clear evidence to the contrary. We see more and more attempts to defame and deride tree campaigners with many unsubstantiated and untruthful claims. In October, a judge rejected the Council’s attempt to send Cllr Alison Teal to jail. The court found she had not broken the injunction and the council were wrong. A Freedom of Information request has since uncovered e-mails showing that council officers conspired to spin the case dismissal as “on a technicality.”\nGreens will put a similar proposal to be voted on at the Sheffield City Council budget meeting on March 7th. The cost of 3 Group Policy Officers in 2018/19 is £112,000. For comparison, the cutting of 3 ½ full time equivalent library staff saved £98,000 in this financial\nyear.\nThe last 15 months has seen a dysfunctional and dictatorial council increasingly use spin doctors to try and cover up their failings. One truth outlined by the Labour-run council is that council budgets are under pressure as never before. Council taxpayers facing a 5.99% increase in bills cannot continue to fund political spin while vital services are cut. Councillors must do the right thing on March 7th.\nEamonn Ward\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

If you want to watch the full council meeting and look at the Agenda, here is the link\nPetitions\nA petition with 11,127 signatures was presented titled “Make the council repair, not demolish, Rose Garden Cafe, Graves Park. The building, constructed in 1927, was described as “iconic” by the petitioners. Green Cllr Marieanne Elliott said the issue should be referred to the Communities, Parks and Leisure Committee to be considered as that would be the best place to equitably seek a decision on the cafe’s future. This proposal was rejected by Labour and Lib Dems. Instead, they referred it to the Charity Trustee Sub-Committee, which has no workforce and no budget.\nFormer Burngreave Labour councillor , Ibrar Hussain, had a petition asking to cancel the Clean Air Zone due to the additional costs to Taxi drivers of purchasing cleaner taxis. However, responses to written questions showed that a third of the taxi fleet already complies with CAZ standards and another third is 12 years old , which is the maximum age permitted by licensing policy.\nLabour Cllr Julie Grocutt, Co-Chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Committee responded by saying they had committed to deliver the Clean Air Zone “in the Spring”. Sheffield already offers some of the highest grants in the country for improving vehicles. There has been pressure from some Labour Councillors to delay the introduction of the Clean Air Zone but Greens have been pushing back on this and asked several questions to try to get Labour to unambiguously commit to starting the CAZ on time next year.\nPublic Questions\nQuestions were asked regarding the progress of the Street Trees Inquiry, the poor treatment of asylum seekers in Sheffield and the Council’s plans for the Rose Garden Cafe in Graves Park.\nOn the asylum seekers question, Green Cllr Angela Argenzio, responded saying that the Council needed to put pressure on the Government as they managed the programme and that she would liaise with the NHS over their treatment of asylum seekers. Cllr Douglas Johnson also responded saying 1300 people seeking asylum were in Sheffield currently and that Government were bypassing local democratic control with regard to the accommodation for asylum seekers,\nLabour proposed shifting the members’ questions till the end of the meeting. This would have effectively meant that they would not be heard as the Council meeting is guillotined at 6.00pm. It would have meant that Committee Chairs would not have been held properly to account. Greens and Lib Dems defeated this Labour proposal.\nCllr Johnson challenged Cllr Fox on Investment Zones asking if he was aware that the South Yorkshire Combined Authority had not challenged the Government on the lifting of protections to the environment that are implicit in the proposals for Investment Zones. Cllr Fox responded by saying these would be addressed should the Government allocate any Sheffield land for Investment Zones.\nMotions\nCllr Christine Gilligan Kubo proposed the Greens motion for a Sheffield Renewable Energy Strategy making the links between the cost of living crisis and our reliance on fossil fuels. Cllr Douglas Johnson seconded the motion, saying we need to act locally to address the global problem pointing out that some other Councils are doing more than Sheffield. The motion was passed with a Labour amendment which the Green Group largely accepted. A wrecking amendment by the Lib Dems was defeated. The motion as amended was agreed unanimously, Full details of the motion can be found here\nLabour presented a motion on the stigma of menopause and period poverty. Greens supported the motion including an amendment asking the Council to support the promotion of reusable period products such as moon cups. Cllr Marianne Elliott presented the Green Amendment which was seconded by Cllr Maroof Raoff.\nMotions on “Best Value Services for the People of Sheffield” from the Lib Dems and from Labour on the “Cost of Living Crisis – National Failings and Our Local Response”\nThough these motions weren’t debated they were voted on along with their amendments. On the Cost of Living motion Cllr Martin Phipps said,\n“I was disappointed but not surprised to see Labour abstain on Green proposals to support policies that increase the minimum wage to £15 an hour, restore the £20 universal credit uplift and double it to £40 and increase tax on the wealthiest 1% to address rising inequality and to support those on lowest income, as well as voting against our proposal for an employer’s workplace parking levy once more.\nThe Green Party have consistently stood against austerity, championed fair pay, support for the most vulnerable and real action on inequality. Labour are showing themselves to be the party for the wealthy, not working people and those in poverty.”",

We are getting more bins but fewer collections, and no overall change to what can and can’t be recycled. Some households will have trouble finding space for another bin. It’s hard to see how the council thinks this will help us to recycle more.\nSheffield has one of the worst recycling rates in the country. It’s not surprising when you realise that other councils will recycle yoghurt pots and many other plastics, as well as taking food and garden waste for compost. Meanwhile the council here have to feed the incinerator as part of an inflexible contract we are stuck with until 2036. So they burn recyclable plastics to increase the private profits of Veolia.\nWe’ve seen the unpleasant impact private contracts have on public services, nationally in the NHS, and locally with street trees (Amey) and maintenance of council housing (Kier). Our waste and recycling is no different. Decisions made on the basis of private profit alone are not good for us, or for the environment.

They then passed it on at Bedford and the plug continued in a relay all the way to Sheffield.\nLocal groups all the way along the route called on the Government to reverse the decision made in July to cancel plans to electrify the Midland Mainline beyond Kettering. They asked the Government to ‘plug in’ their trains to reduce air pollution and carbon emissions.\nOn the day, both on the trains and at stations, campaigners collected signatures on a petition asking the Government not to go back on their promise to electrify the railways. The petition was created by two national organisations, 10:10 and the Campaign for Better Transport.\nAfter the green plug arrived at Sheffield station there was a rally calling for electrification organised by the Sheffield Climate Alliance, Sheffield Friends of the Earth and Sheffield Green Party.\nBeatrice Greenfield, from Sheffield Friends of the Earth said:\n“Electrifying the railways would reduce the carbon footprint of travel because electricity generation is rapidly becoming cleaner. Diesel trains also contribute to air pollution, which is estimated to cause 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK. Switching to electric trains would lead to substantial improvements in air quality in Sheffield, where it contributed to 500 deaths last year.\nNatalie Bennett, former leader of the Green Party and Sheffield Green Party member said:\n“This decision is a further blow to the North, while the government continues to pour money into transport infrastructure in London and the South East. The Government talk about ‘rebalancing the economy’ and the ‘Northern Powerhouse’ rings particularly hollow in the light of this decision, while we are also seeing a failure to invest in essential east-west services that should link Hull and Liverpool and all the points in between. New diesel trains are no way forward – we need the reliability, speed and cleaner option; we need electric trains.”\nNotes\nThe 10:10 and Campaign for Better Transport petition is online here: https://secure.1010uk.org/electric-trains-not-diesel-trains\nThe following groups were involved in the relay: Bedford Green Party, East Midlands Rail Campaign, Northampton Friends of the Earth, Sustainable Harborough, Leicester Friends of the Earth, Transition Town Chesterfield, Sheffield Climate Alliance and Sheffield Green Party.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Much more Government support for residents is required, both to ensure residents’ safety and to release them from flats they cannot sell.\nThe Green Party are committed to a better quality of housing, supporting and proposing insulation programmes for warmer homes, lower energy bills and lower carbon emissions. We support action on unaffordable rents by using rent controls, more council housing built to the highest energy efficiency standards, and city-wide landlord licensing.\nAs my colleague Cllr Douglas Johnson, chair of the Housing committee, said in his budget speech, “We believe in good public services”. This is one of the reasons that we believe public services should be in public ownership, a view unfortunately no longer shared by Labour who, under Keir Starmer, have abandoned commitments to bring into public ownership services such as energy and water.\nAs City Ward councillors, we are regularly in touch with residents, attending regular community group meetings across the ward, and contacting residents about proposals or ideas.

Detailed work by Councillors across the political divide has made this year’s council budget meeting a relatively smooth one.\n“This is even more noteworthy when you consider this was one of Sheffield’s toughest budgets ever with the Council having to find nearly £80 million to make the books balance. Under the previous cabinet system we would most likely have had no agreed decisions till budget day itself.\n“It is not just the Committee System though that has had a positive impact. it is the fact that we have a Council where no party has overall control. Different political groups have had to engage with each other to achieve agreement. They have had to understand the issues and not just oppose for the opposition’s sake. I’m not saying everything is perfect. We still have politicians who are tribal in their approach to politics but under the current arrangements that doesn’t get in the way of the council making the decisions it needs to make to function properly.\n“As natural co-operators, Greens work well in a Committee system and we have played an important role in helping get agreement on the detail of the budget.”\nAll Parties on the Council put forward amendments at the Council meeting to express what their priorities would be if they had a majority. There was a debate and all the amendments were voted on and each was defeated in turn. There was then a vote on a joint Labour, Lib Dem Green Amendment which was then passed. This amendment to the budget proposed an additional £25,000/per ward (£700,000 in total) to be used to address local priorities and a further £400,000 to help address poverty and the cost of living crisis. Thanks to Green Party requests, this is to be allocated according to the levels of deprivation in the city.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“Knowing the likely outcome of the vote. Parties wisely came together in advance of the meeting to ensure that they were able to get some additional funding for the people they represent and also to direct more support to those in the greatest need. This is so different from last year. It shows that, when politicians decide to work together, local people are the ones who benefit.\n“I’m proud of the role the Greens have played in this, as supporters of the committee system and as councillors who can help bring other parties together.

Whether or not the Telegraph should provide a prominent platform for these views is another matter entirely.\nIf a reader wrote suggesting that covid vaccinations are harmful, the editor would have qualms about publishing it. If someone else wrote suggesting wearing a seat belt in a car is dangerous, I don’t think the editor would publish. Suppose someone wrote explaining how smoking is good for you. Again, I think the editor would not give it space on the letters page. The editor would be sensible not to publish all these letters because printing them gives credibility to false ideas that will endanger lives if they are taken seriously.\nThe science is just as clear with climate change as with all these issues. The 2022 IPCC report found that climate impacts are already more widespread and severe than previously expected. Climate change is causing dangerous disruption in every region in the world with just 1.1 degrees C (2 degrees F) of warming.\nDroughts, extreme heat and record floods already threaten food security and livelihoods for millions of people. Since 2008, devastating floods and storms have forced more than 20 million people from their homes each year. Since 1961, crop productivity growth in Africa shrunk by a third due to climate change.\nWe are locked into even worse impacts from climate change in the near term.\nEven if the world rapidly decarbonizes, greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere and current emissions trends will make some very significant climate impacts unavoidable through 2040. The IPCC estimates that in the next decade alone, climate change will drive 32-132 million more people into extreme poverty. Global warming will jeopardize food security, as well as increase the incidence of heat-related mortality, heart disease and mental health challenges. Migration, between countries and within countries is bound to increase.\nWe know risks will escalate quickly with higher temperatures, often causing irreversible impacts of climate change. For instance, with just 1.5 degrees C of global warming, many glaciers around the world will either disappear completely or lose most of their mass; an additional 350 million people will experience water scarcity by 2030, and as much as 14% of terrestrial species will face high risks of extinction.\nThere is a rapidly closing window of opportunity for Climate Action.\nThe science is unequivocal: Climate change endangers the well-being of people and the planet. Delayed action risks triggering impacts of climate change so catastrophic our world will become unrecognizable. Those that legitimise opinions questioning the need for climate action are endangering billions of lives.\nGraham Wroe\nSheffield Green Party",

I was able to vote because I had an older person’s travel pass.\nIn many places a student at a UK university or college who is eligible to vote, their student ID card despite it having a photo ID is invalid. A young person’s rail card is not acceptable.\nThe Electoral Commission reports that: “In the past 5 years, there is no evidence of large-scale electoral fraud. Of the 1,462 cases of alleged electoral fraud reported to police between 2019 and 2023, 10 led to convictions and the police issued 4 cautions.” The Commission estimates that 8 million people are missing from the electoral roll which disproportionally affects private renters, young, Asian and black people.

As the lockdown eases, the need for precautions will remain a feature of life. Safely enabling social distancing will require some level of ‘thinking outside the box’ through creative and sustainable changes to public spaces. Your article questioning whether the ruling Labour group’s pavement widening is just a “pointless spin” exercise (Robert Cumber, 21st May) therefore raises a number of important questions that extend well beyond the short term.\nSheffield Green Party has long called for a strategic focus on making our streets safer for people and for more reliable and affordable public transport. The pandemic provides a unique opportunity to rethink our street spaces. We can and should place people and their safety at the heart of this strategy, not least because of the deepening climate emergency.Having a plan for evaluating what works best and what could be improved is essential if the City Council are to deliver sustainable change that meets people’s aspirations and addresses public health challenges.\nGreen Party Councillor, Douglas Johnson, observed in your article that the scope of current measures is very limited; offering solutions that often appear hasty or ill-thought through. Some might say it is a sticking plaster. Half measures will not deliver changes that inspire confidence. On the other hand, this is a once in a generation opportunity to think again about streets that can be vibrant, less polluted and safer for us all.\nLet’s have proper investment that all Sheffielders can be proud of, both now and in decades to come.\nRichard Ward\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

I was a secondary school teacher for 16 years and for the past seven years I have worked in the voluntary sector: for five years for a disability charity and for the last two for a homeless charity. I’m also the trustee of a local human rights organisation.\nI’m an EU citizen who moved from Italy to Sheffield 26 years ago and have raised my family here. I love how diverse the ward is and I am engaged with many community groups in all parts of the ward: in the nearly four years since being elected, I have supported the volunteer group BBEST to get their Neighbourhood Plan to the referendum stage and finally passed in 2021. I support the Hanover TARA in all their dealings with Sheffield City Council and I was instrumental in the publication of the report about the cladding of the Hanover Tower in 2020. I regularly support litter picks in Broomhill, Broomhall and Hunters Bar as well as attending as many community meetings as I can.\nSince being elected in 2019, I have been a member of various SCC committees: Health Scrutiny, Licensing and Audit & Standards. I am particularly interested in governance and finance so I am pleased to still be a member of the Audit & Standards committee. In the municipal year 2021-22, I was the Adviser to the Executive Member for Inclusive Economy and skills, taking particular interest in the skills and adult education side of the portfolio and concentrating on expanding the offer of training for green jobs in Sheffield.\nSince May 2022 I have been the Co-chair of the Adult Health & Social Care Policy Committee and a member of the Strategy & Resources Policy Committee. I am also the Deputy Speaker for the Green Group at Sheffield City Council.\nAs Co-chair of the AHSC Policy Committee, I have set the tone for our work ethics by co-chairing with a Councillor from another group and involving the deputy (from the third group) from the very start. The three groups have been involved in every single decision and we have made every single one by consensus. The AHSC Committee is often used as an example in SCC of how well the committee system can work despite the fact that we had to find the most savings for the 23-24 budget (47% of all SCC savings for the year)!\nI am a team player: I work extremely close to my ward colleagues, Brian and Maleiki. We speak to each other virtually daily and meet at least once a week. We share the workload and we always try to do our best to support our constituents.\nI also work closely with the whole Green Councillor Group and I am well respected by colleagues in other political groups.\nI am very proud of my record as a councillor: I work hard and I am totally committed to the role to ensure that we get the best outcomes for a greener future for the citizens of Sheffield. If elected again I will continue to work hard to ensure that we achieve climate and social justice for our citizens and close the inequality gap in the city. In my role as a councillor, I am most happy when I am able to help residents.”\nTo volunteer to help the campaign or display a poster please contact Brian Holmshaw holmshawbrian@gmail.com\nSheffield Council agrees budget in first budget meeting since committee system.\nNews from Broomhill and Sharrowvale Ward (includes recent newsletters)",

The Government still has to pay the money to Universities. On the other hand, very many students won’t be able to pay off the thousands of pounds of debt.\nThe problem lies in the principle of treating university education as a commodity, only for the benefit of the individual. Medical students are the doctors of tomorrow; can we say their education is solely for individual gain?\nWhat students do with their education benefits everyone in society. Some end up earning good money and could pay a fair share of tax based on income; others contribute to society in other ways.\nThe Labour Party should be ashamed of its decision to introduce tuition fees in 1998.\nThe Green Party’s policy is to cancel tuition fees and write off outstanding student debt. We need to give our graduates a hope for the future and allow them to flourish free of society’s debt.\nMartin Phipps\nSheffield Green Party candidate for City Ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It’s a pollution-busting wall of carefully selected plants that stretches the 60-metre perimeter of the school playground.\nAlison Teal and other Green councillors joined residents, parents and volunteers to help with the planting the previous week\nHunter’s Bar Infant school is surrounded by busy roads with traffic that generates high levels of pollution. It is hoped that the mix of plants selected to make up the wall will make a positive difference to the quality of air in the playground and make it a safer place to play.\nRowan Hall, parent governor at the school started the ball rolling back in 2017 when she looked into pollution levels. The school became aware that nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels had exceeded the WHO guidelines twice in two years. The school then partnered with the University of Sheffield’s Department of Landscape Architecture and became the case study for a PhD student and the Breathe Project.\nThe school’s GoGoGreen project is a shining example of community grassroots action. It has involved the whole school community, children, staff, parents, governors and in addition the business community. Over 50 businesses and organisations have got involved with donations of time, expertise, money and help in kind. £20000 has been raised by the school through activities like bake sales, a fun run, corporate sponsorship of advertising panels and a David Bowie Tribute gig.\nThere were planting parties in October where volunteers helped with the planting.\nAmongst the volunteer planters were several Green Party councillors: Douglas Johnson and Martin Phipps (City Ward), Alison Teal (Nether Edge and Sharrow) and Kaltum Rivers and Angela Argenzio (Broomhill and Sharrow Vale).\nPollution levels have been monitored since April 2109 and will continue to be monitored to assess the impact of the wall. The hope is that this project will become a blueprint for schools everywhere.\nFor more information please visit the school website https://huntersbarinfantschool.co.uk/gogogreen/ and #GoGoGreen on social media.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

There will be exemptions for Hackney Carriages and Light Goods Vehicles registered in the Sheffield area up until the 5th of June 2023. These vehicles will have nearly 6 months to apply for a grant to change their vehicles to cleaner models to be compliant with the Clean Air Zone. Private cars are exempt from the charge.\nA range of grants are available from £2000 to £16000 depending on the type of vehicle being replaced or upgraded to a less polluting model. Full details are on the Council’s website (1)\nCouncillor Christine Gilligan, Green Spokesperson on the Transport, Environment and Climate Committee said,\n“I am really pleased that the Clean Air Zone is finally coming to Sheffield, as Green Councillors have played a key role on the Council in championing the scheme, for the health of local people and our local environment. The grants to support local businesses and other vehicle owners eligible for the charge are very welcome and will ease the transition to a cleaner city.”\n“It is about reducing emissions from polluting vehicles, but it is also about saving lives. Respiratory illnesses are well documented in our city, with over 500 deaths per year attributed to poor air quality and its impact on a range of conditions (2). Young children with developing respiratory systems and frail, elderly people are particularly vulnerable to polluted air. This is why Greens have pressed hard against attempts to delay the introduction of the Clean Air Zone.”\nReferences\n2 – More information about the Clean Air Zone | Sheffield City Council",

The plans will mean dirtier streets and less pollution absorbed by plants, and were opposed by local Green councillors.\nCllr Rob Murphy said, “Clearing litter is a core council service, but due to the eye-watering cost ofthe PFI (£79 million next year), we will be paying more money for a worse service. Sheffield Greens opposed the PFI from the start, as a bad deal for taxpayers.”\nBin problems\nWe helped residents get bins emptied properly at Cromford St in Highfield and at Kelham Mills.\nBins at the popular Nursery St pocket park will now be emptied more often next summer, after Green councillors took up residents’ complaints.\nSafer City Streets\n20 mph limit at last\nAfter a long campaign by Green councillors, the Council has agreed to a 20 mph speed limit for most of the city centre and Kelham Island, off main roads.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said, “Experience in other areas shows a lower speed limit reduces the number and severity of road accidents. We are glad the Council has finally listened and look forward to safer streets.”\nHowever, Sheffield Council is working on plans to widen the Inner Ring Road near Kelham Island. Residents say traffic, noise and pollution will increase and the plans neglect pedestrians and cyclists.\nGreen campaigner Martin Phipps said, “The last ring road scheme was massively over budget. Widening roads is not the answer when trams are to run less often from January because of increased road traffic. The Council has to learn and not make the same mistakes twice.”\nSaved from prison!\nDouglas Johnson helped fellow Councillor, Alison Teal, in a High Court case when the Labour Administration tried to imprison her for alleged breach of an injunction. The judge said the Council was “mistaken.”\nGreen Action in City Ward\nCity centre\nGreen Councillors are still pushing for a policy on off-licences around West St. The aim is to reduce street-drinking and associated anti-social behaviour and crime. We have also promoted a generous offer from Killi’s Cleaners on West St to help businesses remove graffiti.\nBus stops\nAfter a Green petition signed by many local residents and councillor lobbying, the missing bus stop on Charlotte Road has been returned.\nTwo new bus stops are planned for Mowbray St in Kelham Island. Green Councillors asked for a replacement near Brewery Wharf after a previous one had been removed.\nCity development\nGreens have commented on a redesign of Fitzalan Square. City centre campaigner John Wraysaid, “Anti-social behaviour has been a problem but we want to keep the trees and the setting of the Old Post Office.” Greens have also called for a review of the number of new-built blocks of flats.\nCity Centre Health Service closures\nGreen councillors have objected to plans to close the Walk-in Centre on Broad Lane and the Minor Injuries Unit at the Hallamshire Hospital. Cllr Douglas Johnson said, “TheseservicesareheavilyusedbyresidentsofCityWard.”\nPreventing floods\nTrees at Kelham Mills have been pruned back after Cllr Douglas Johnson negotiated with landlords over duties to maintain the riverside.\nAs well as helping residents with light and TV signals, cutting back willow trees is important to help prevent flooding.\nGreen Spending\nYour Councillors have used money from City Ward funds to pay for:\n- Artwork on telephone cabinets to help tackle graffiti in Kelham Island\n- A river clean-up\n- Litter-picking\n- Health walks\n- Christmas events\n- Basketball sessions at Duchess Road\n- Planters at St Matthew’s Church\n- Canal trips on the “Ethel” community barge to reduce isolation for older people\n- A fence to stop cars churning up grass at the Charlotte Road car park\n- Support for Shoreham St Tenants and Residents Association and Kelham Island Community Alliance\nWater and Air\nWe are looking at funding free air pollution monitoring kits.

This is one of the few examples of an early 19th Century furnace made to mass produce steel. The site is already overgrown and in a poor condition. This damaged fencing just makes the site more vulnerable. Until I raised this, the Council’s Insurance Department was unaware of the damage to this historic site. I will be pushing for urgent action to get the railings fixed.\nA short walk away is the Daniel Doncaster cementation furnace which, though in a complete condition, is showing signs of neglect\n“The Daniel Doncaster cementation furnace is a Scheduled Historic Monument. It is the single best example of this type of steel making furnace to survive in Great Britain. It is obvious that it has not been well maintained. It has saplings growing out of its sides, damaging this historic structure.\n“ I am pleased the council has issued a Section 215 notice that requires remedial works to be carried out. I will be keeping a close eye on the building to help ensure work is carried out swiftly to protect this unique part of Sheffield’s heritage.”\nAcross the road is another Grade 2 listed building, the Don Cutlery works on Doncaster Street.\n“The Don Cutlery Works was one of the first integrated cutlery works in the world. It is clearly in a poor condition and covered in graffiti. There are also reports of holes in the roof of the building. I am pleased at least that, following my raising the issue at Council, that City Council officers will be in contact with the owner regarding the work needed to ensure it is properly maintained.\n“Heritage-led regeneration has the power to improve an area, both economically and in the way that it looks. We have seen this at the Kelham Island Conservation Area nearby. The area around the Cutlery Works and the Daniel Doncaster Cementation Furnace are both part of a major 825 home development being overseen by Homes England. Given that this is a sensitive site, it is vital that both these historic assets are not just protected but improved and preserved for future generations. This should be a significant consideration as part of any planning application for the site.\n“Sheffield’s heritage will not be preserved and protected if we aren’t vigilant and raising issues with the council and other bodies responsible for our historic sites. Once these places are lost they are lost forever and it is vital that the authorities know these places are important, cared about and that we speak up for them.”",

Sadly, this was voted down by Labour at the time when they had a majority on the Council.\nCouncillor Brian Holmshaw, Broomhall and Sharrow Vale Councillor said,\n“We are really pleased that the Free Bus Service around the City Centre, now rebranded Sheffield Connect has been launched. It will be completely free from Monday 8th April and will be a low emission, electric bus service.\n“When we originally proposed this back in March 2019. It was opposed by the Sheffield Labour Group, but we have continued to press for its reintroduction. Now that Labour no longer has a majority on the Council it is much easier to get good ideas, like this one progressed.”\nCouncillor Ruth Mersereau, City Ward Councillor said.\n“This bus service will make it easier for people to get around the City Centre. It provides a link between Sheffield Station and key parts of the City at no cost to passengers. This will help make the city more accessible to people who don’t own a car or who would prefer not to use one for City Centre journeys. It is good for the environment, for local businesses and for people’s pockets. The service is also a good way to connect to other buses. The increased frequency will help with those connections, making overall journey times shorter.”\nSheffield Connect service details\nSheffield Connect has two routes. The existing city centre loop (renamed SC1) will use 3 new EV buses at an enhanced service frequency (of 7-8 mins Monday – Saturday, every 10 mins Sunday) and also extended hours of operation from 7am-7pm Mon-Sat and Sunday 9.30am-4pm. The route is Sheffield, Interchange – Fitzalan Square – High Street – Leopold Street/Orchard Lane – City Hall – West Street – Carver Street – Rockingham Street – Cumberland Street/Moor Market – Eyre Street – Paternoster Row/Sheffield Station – Sheffield, Interchange.\nThere will be trial of a second City Connect route (service SC2). It will be a circular route going almost to Shalesmoor/Kelham Island. It will use a new EV bus at a 20-min frequency, also operating between 7am -7pm Mon-Sat and Sunday 9.30am-4pm. There will be a second circular route launched on 8th April, to go between Sheffield Interchange, The Moor, Arundel Gate, Bridge Street (West Bar) and Haymarket. This route will operate up to every 20 minutes Monday to Saturday daytimes.",

In the budget amendment in March, Green councillors again proposed reducing the pay of senior officers on salaries over £50,000 a year. Reducing inequality between the highest and lowest paid is important for a fairer society.\nA further Green proposal was to “cut political spin from the Town Hall.” by cutting all the paid political assistants from the Council payroll and requiring politicians to do their own research and press work. This would have saved £73,000 in 2018/19 and £150,000 in future years. It’s no surprise that the party that benefits the most from this political expenditure, Labour with 2 posts, doesn’t want to cut them. The Lib Dems, with 1 post, did at least support cutting one of the Labour posts.

Council tenants in Hanover Tower in Broomhall have still not had their homes fully restored – and many private renters are still left in limbo.\nCllr Rob Murphy, Green Councillor for City Ward, said,\n“We now know that, despite concerns raised about fire safety at the time the cladding was installed in 2012, someone authorised a switch from the original, aluminium cladding on Hanover Tower to a flammable version. The council has confirmed it has not sought to recover any money from the contractor but has refused to say who it thinks is at fault. The investigation is still ‘ongoing’.”\nCllr Kaltum Rivers, of Broomhill and Sharrow Vale Ward, said,\n“Residents tell me they are worried about fire in the flats but also about the cold after the cladding was removed. When one resident complained of damp, she was told it was because of her “lifestyle choice” because of condensation.”\nNotes\n- In written answers on 4th October 2017, Cllr Jayne Dunn stated that the cost of removal and reinstatement would be £425,000. However, on 5th December 2018, Cllr Jim Steinke admitted the total cost of removal and reinstatement work is £3,920,000.\n- Sheffield Green Party’s motion says:\nMotion on fire safety work\nProposed by Cllr Rob Murphy; Seconded by Cllr Kaltum Rivers\nThat this Council\na) Notes that re-cladding work on Hanover Tower is still not complete.\nb) Is pleased that residents will soon have safe cladding and restored insulation to keep their homes warm and fuel bills down\nc) Notes that one firm of private contractors was paid to put the cladding up in the first place, then paid again to take it down, then paid a third time to put the right cladding up;\nd) Notes that the cost of the removal and reinstatement of cladding is costing council tenants across the city (through the Housing Revenue Account) almost £4m, after councillors were originally informed the cost would be a tenth of that amount.\ne) Notes that the council’s investigation into who signed off the original, defective cladding is still ongoing, nearly two years after the Grenfell Tower disaster, with no answers as to who was responsible.\nf) Believes that other residents in private sector high-rise housing across the city may remain in buildings with flammable cladding that has been signed off by building inspectors at some point and that their situations remain unresolved;\ng) Notes that the council has the information as to which buildings are at risk but has declined to release it;\nh) Therefore, calls on the Administration to ensure residents have accurate and up-to-date information about the safety of their homes; and\ni) Resolves to write to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government to call on the Government to fund replacement cladding which is a product of a failed building regulation system.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

In-fighting and self-interest has driven us into a dead end. With the poor getting poorer, the rich getting richer and a growing number of people feeling like their needs and opinions are being ignored, our electoral system leaves millions of people with wasted votes, it creates mistrust in politicians and keeps the same old types in power.\n“Government isn’t taking the climate crisis seriously. Politicians from every party jump on the bandwagon to win votes but have little understanding of what it means. The Government should have been acting on climate change twenty years ago when the Green Party was already speaking out about it.\n“Rising racism and gender prejudice angers me. People are people no matter who or what they are and have the right to be treated fairly and equally. Growing hate in our society is a worry but I’m invigorated by the growing hope we have too. It is inspiring to see my friend Magid, our Green Party MEP, tackling hatred head on.\n“I want to stand for what matters; to be a voice for the people. I will stand up for Green politics; having decisions made as locally as possible, genuinely protecting our environment and fighting for our future.”\nPaul has lived in the Heeley constituency for 20 years and is married with two young children. After growing up in a single parent family on a Northern council estate, he made Sheffield his home. He joined the Green Party in 2014 after feeling compelled to do something to build a future for his children.\n“I looked at what the main parties were offering and a neoliberal, austerity-laden country, with fracking and nuclear weapons, terrified me. I had to do something about it!”\nPaul was elected as a City Councillor in Gleadless Valley in 2019. In the short time since then, Paul has made waves in the council and has gained a reputation of a hard working community leader who can hold the administration to account.\nNotes\n1.

Nonetheless, we have to address the need for skilled, well-paid jobs in the post-industrial north. A ‘ just transition ‘ means developing strategies that will enable us not only to move away from coal mining but also from nuclear power and nuclear submarines which have provided employment for working-class communities in Cumbria in recent decades\nThe skills to develop the renewable energy sector already exist. The state should intervene to support places like Barrow, Workington and former coal mining areas like South Yorkshire in their ‘ just transition’, working with unions to do this. For instance, a plan was put together to help aviation workers at Gatwick transition to green jobs with Green New Deal UK working with the Public and Commercial Services Union. We need similar plans in South Yorkshire for workers at Doncaster/Sheffield airport and in other fossil fuel-intensive industries so they can be employed in green jobs. Further Education Colleges need to be training our young people for these opportunities now.\nThe TUC estimate that 60,000 green jobs could be created in Yorkshire in 2 years, building energy-efficient homes, retrofitting social housing, reforesting, upgrading public transport and improving cycling and pedestrian routes.\nOnly an alternative vision of what a sustainable and just society might look like will enable us to address the issues areas like Cumbria and South Yorkshire face at a local, regional and global level\nHillsborough Green Party",

I was a secondary school teacher for 16 years and for the past seven years I have worked in the voluntary sector: for five years for a disability charity and for the last two for a homeless charity. I’m also the trustee of a local human rights organisation.\nI’m an EU citizen who moved from Italy to Sheffield 26 years ago and have raised my family here. I love how diverse the ward is and I am engaged with many community groups in all parts of the ward: in the nearly four years since being elected, I have supported the volunteer group BBEST to get their Neighbourhood Plan to the referendum stage and finally passed in 2021. I support the Hanover TARA in all their dealings with Sheffield City Council and I was instrumental in the publication of the report about the cladding of the Hanover Tower in 2020. I regularly support litter picks in Broomhill, Broomhall and Hunters Bar as well as attending as many community meetings as I can.\nSince being elected in 2019, I have been a member of various SCC committees: Health Scrutiny, Licensing and Audit & Standards. I am particularly interested in governance and finance so I am pleased to still be a member of the Audit & Standards committee. In the municipal year 2021-22, I was the Adviser to the Executive Member for Inclusive Economy and skills, taking particular interest in the skills and adult education side of the portfolio and concentrating on expanding the offer of training for green jobs in Sheffield.\nSince May 2022 I have been the Co-chair of the Adult Health & Social Care Policy Committee and a member of the Strategy & Resources Policy Committee. I am also the Deputy Speaker for the Green Group at Sheffield City Council.\nAs Co-chair of the AHSC Policy Committee, I have set the tone for our work ethics by co-chairing with a Councillor from another group and involving the deputy (from the third group) from the very start. The three groups have been involved in every single decision and we have made every single one by consensus. The AHSC Committee is often used as an example in SCC of how well the committee system can work despite the fact that we had to find the most savings for the 23-24 budget (47% of all SCC savings for the year)!\nI am a team player: I work extremely close to my ward colleagues, Brian and Maleiki. We speak to each other virtually daily and meet at least once a week. We share the workload and we always try to do our best to support our constituents.\nI also work closely with the whole Green Councillor Group and I am well respected by colleagues in other political groups.\nI am very proud of my record as a councillor: I work hard and I am totally committed to the role to ensure that we get the best outcomes for a greener future for the citizens of Sheffield. If elected again I will continue to work hard to ensure that we achieve climate and social justice for our citizens and close the inequality gap in the city. In my role as a councillor, I am most happy when I am able to help residents.”\nUpdated May 2023",

We’re talking about levelling up on that.\n“People living in the most deprived areas have the lowest healthy life expectancy and the highest air pollution.

It’s all connected.\n“Fifty per cent of people in our ward don’t own a car and public transport is not fit for purpose. If we can sort out transport, we can sort out air quality.

They’re relying on a replacement service, the 31, which is too small, too inadequate and doesn’t operate out of hours. Older people are marooned.\n“It is an ongoing crisis that hasn’t been resolved. There’s not much I can promise as a councillor as the service is run by the South Yorkshire Mayor and private companies. We want the bus companies brought back under public control and to be a public service, not a profit-making enterprise.”\nBev Bennett is standing for the first time in Nether Edge and Sharrow, the area where she grew up.

It’s loved by large numbers of local residents and those from further afield. But this year, Hillsborough Park became a mud-bath. Restoring the park is going to take a very long time, with current estimates suggesting barriers will remain up until the end of October.\nWe are closely monitoring the repair and restoration work and are very concerned about the significant impact the required closure of large areas is having on park use during the summer holidays and on local businesses that rely on visitor numbers.\nWe are seeing more extreme rainfall events in the climate emergency. There is an increasing likelihood that similar weather will affect future festivals with similar impacts.\nThe park is important for the health and well-being of many Hillsborough residents. However, many community and sports groups, including Parkrun, have been unable to use the park, while families or friends have been unable to enjoy spending time together in the main grassed area.\nWe view Hillsborough Park as a public asset that should be used for public recreation – most of the park should not be closed during the summer school holiday period by large-scale commercial activities.\nTramlines arrived in Hillsborough Park in 2018 promising a boost to local businesses and community. Businesses close to the park struggle during the 18-day set-up and takedown period as park visitor numbers drop significantly while the fences are up – a drop currently continuing through the summer holidays and well beyond. The more recent removal of re-entry additionally prevents many businesses from seeing any benefits during the festival weekend.\nThere is a lack of transparency on the council’s contractual relationship with Tramlines with commercial confidentiality cited. We believe the economic and cultural benefits of the festival no longer outweigh the negative impacts combined with the risk of park damage.\nWe have requested an urgent meeting with the relevant Committee Chairs and council officers responsible for the Tramlines contract. We are also seeking urgent answers from council officers on how payments received from hiring the park to Tramlines will be used to compensate community groups and teams unable to use the park.\nConsideration must now be given to finding suitable alternative venues in the Sheffield area to host the event. If that were to happen, we would seek support for Tramlines fringe events to be held in Hillsborough venues. That would boost local businesses and provide options for local people to enjoy, including those who can’t afford Tramlines ticket prices.\nFinding an alternative venue may take time and it must be considered likely that Tramlines will be in Hillsborough Park next year. If this is the case, we are demanding:\n– A robust weather action plan that kicks in based on forecasts – not when forecast heavy rain has started to fall.\n– More temporary surfacing and walkways during the festival to protect the park surface.\n– A lower capacity. The park is not big enough to hold events attended by 40,000 people. Fewer people attending would help reduce the risk of damage and the areas removed from public use.\n– No additional similar-sized events. The Arctic Monkeys’ hometown return concerts were joyful, but these increased the total time when access was restricted to the parkland, and risked similar damage if there had been bad weather.\n– Restore the right of re-entry to all ticket holders to help local residents and businesses.\nOur belief that an alternative site is found is not made without full consideration – we know that many people love having a big festival within walking distance. But most of the park has been damaged this year and access will have been lost to many areas for close to 4 months in total.\nWe will update local residents on Hillsborough area social media groups on a regular basis as our enquiries continue and the repair work progresses. As always, we will take into account comments posted comments and discussions with local people and organisations across the Hillsborough council ward.",

We live in a world designed by able-bodied men for able-bodied men. From the huge steps down from trains to the lack of ramps in hilly cities, such as Sheffield, to only having one wheelchair space on the bus, the way we design our world largely neglects the needs of disabled people. Other countries are taking steps to rectify this, from appointing more disabled town planners to raising train station platforms to have level access, yet here in England, we make little progress.\nA few months ago I was in Edinburgh with my dad, who has Multiple Sclerosis and is in a wheelchair. They got a lot of things right, but equally a lot wrong. Their buses have two wheelchair spaces, an audio-visual system to indicate upcoming stops and fold-down rollover bars, but even on the shallower hills, it was impossible to get wheelchairs into shops, meaning we had to go back to Edinburgh station to have lunch. We have much the same problems in Sheffield.\nTake Esperanto Place, for example, there are stairs and grass to make it easier to get between Arundel Gate and Pond St, but no ramp. We design accessible homes that are still difficult to get around and we cut vital social care to save money. Until the need to centre accessibility at the heart of decision-making is accepted and written into law, those of us who are disabled, 18% of the UK population, will continue to be excluded\nThomas Atkin\nGraves Park Green Party",

(1)\nThe report made clear that further measures could be considered once an assessment of how effective these proposals were once implemented and said:\n“Any implementation of these works will trigger a subsequent review. This will be undertaken to determine if further bus priority measures are required. This may include options to amend bus lane hours of operation along these corridors and the enhanced enforcement of parking and loading restrictions with red routes. “\nCouncillor Christine Gilligan, Deputy Chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Change Committee said,\n“I welcome the unanimous support for the range of proposals, starting with the improvements to junctions and the introduction of camera enforcement on bus lanes. These roads are subject to serious congestion and this has severely impacted on the reliability of bus services which are subject to significant delays.\n“It is also important to acknowledge that Councillors of all parties have committed themselves to review the scheme and see if further bus priority measures might be required at a later date” (2)\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group said\n“It was nice to see an outbreak of cross-party working. Work can now go ahead on junction improvements and then we can consider further bus priority measures later should they be needed.\n“As Greens, we support measures that promote public transport, which helps with the cost of living as well as tackling climate change.\n“I am also very pleased to see the committee approve improvements to walking, cycling, traffic management and parking in Kelham Island. As a ward councillor, I have been discussing this with residents for many years. This will make Kelham Island more joined up with the city centre, promote walking, cycling and public transport and improve the local environment where so many people live.”\nCllr Ruth Mersereau said:\n“It’s very welcome news that the committee has unanimously approved further progressing the Kelham Island and Neepsend scheme. This has been designed to help to reduce bus journey times and to provide safer, more direct and attractive walking and cycling routes from these two neighbourhoods to the city centre.”\nNOTES\n2.Councillors endorsed the report that explains “a red route would include replacing yellow lines with red lines to allow more effective camera enforcement of illegal parking. Red routes are one option available to Traffic Authorities to enforce illegal parking or loading more effectively. However, parking, loading and unloading can still be accommodated on red route corridors during certain periods. The determining factor for the times that parking is allowed on red routes are normally the hours of operation of bus lanes, or those periods when corridors experience congestion. For example, a red route could be introduced on a corridor that has morning and afternoon peak period bus lanes.”\nThe report also confirms overall project sentiment from people living in the area 45% positive to 43% negative, despite a prominent campaign against bus priority",

Despite consultation with residents resulting in overwhelming support, a few drivers have resorted to criminal damage, vandalism and abuse of adults and children to express their anger.\nRecently traffic barriers were thrown into the nearby river and metal bollards sawn off overnight when the railway bridge on Little London Road was blocked to motor vehicles.\nIs this a reasonable response to the council’s attempts to improve road safety, reduce pollution, enhance health and encourage walking and cycling?\nSurely, we all have a right to clean air, quiet neighbourhoods, safe routes for children to get to school and safe travel for people on bikes, people on foot and disabled people? The convenience of drivers who use local streets as a rat-run should not come before the quality of life of people who live on those streets or want to use safe and clean modes of travel.\nOpponents of traffic restrictions in local neighbourhoods reel off a list of supposed disadvantages. They claim LTNs cause congestion on main roads, delay emergency vehicles and only benefit better-off areas.\nYet the evidence provides no support for these claims. In fact, government figures show most LTN schemes reduce traffic as a whole, while other research finds no negative impact on emergency vehicles, and that the schemes benefit disadvantaged areas most.\nResearch on LTNs in London has shown that cycle use rises, people walk more, traffic falls and there is a reduction in road casualties. Initial resistance is often overcome when the community sees the advantages of the schemes. The best way forward is to let the trials take place.\nCouncillor Ruth Mersereau, City Ward, Sheffield Green Party",

A range of Environment Organisations including the National Trust and the RSPB have written an open letter to the Government expressing concern about proposals like this that weaken the planning process and drop protections for nature and wildlife. (2)\nIn the Sheffield area, South Yorkshire Combined Authority has submitted a list of sites to the Government for Investment Zone status, with support from the four council leaders in South Yorkshire and the MPs. Expression of Interest do not commit the authority to the project at this stage.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group on the Council said,\n“We have significant concerns over the Government proposals for Investment Zones. They threaten to ride rough-shod over agreed local planning priorities, further damage the environment and nature, and reduce commitments to affordable homes and community facilities. Some Councils have already informed the Government that they will not participate in Investment Zones for these reasons, (3) and Sheffield should follow suit.\n“This is a landowners’ charter, which will mean local communities lose their rights to resist unsustainable development and allow developers to by-pass local objections entirely. The big winners will be the big estates that own large areas of urban land.\n“The Government wants to remove current legal requirements which protect nature during the planning process. Even worse, it suggests Investment Zones could be allowed in National Parks like the Peak District, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and other protected environments.The legal requirement to achieve Net Zero has also been completely ignored.\n“Although landowners and developers could make more money, it is not clear what the benefit to the council or the public is, nor how much it would cost them.\n“If we are to set aside planning rules in the Sheffield Local Plan, which have to be decided by the Full Council, then it should be the Full Council that decides if we proceed with Investment Zones or not.”\nReferences",

Conservation Groups have also expressed concern over the design of the buildings that they regard as detrimental to the City’s Conservation Area.\nCllr Brian Holmshaw who is the Green Party Councillor on the Planning and Highways Committee said\n“It’s a real worry that the Planning and Highway’s Committee are ramming through developments like this against the wishes and interests of local communities.\nResidents and local councillors were not informed in advance that this major application was coming to the November planning committee. So they lost their opportunity to speak out and make clear their concerns.\nThis was a key city centre development that in the end I voted against as it reduced light levels to flats and amenity space in neighbouring buildings. I also agreed with Historic England, the Sheffield Conservation Group. and the city centre residents group that the design was poor and not worthy of a strategic location in the heart of the city centre’s conservation area.”\nCllr Holmshaw requested a deferral of the Planning Application to allow residents to make their objections to the revised application but this was not supported by Labour and Lib Dem Councillors.\nCllr Martin Phipps who is a City Ward Councillor had also requested that the Planning Application be deferred to allow residents’ voices to be heard. He said,\n“I’m really disappointed that the application was not deferred until a later planning committee meeting, as we requested.\nResidents were not informed that the developer had updated the plans or that it was going to committee, even when they had selected to track the application.\nThe application went completely cold for months as the developer appealed their previous rejected application for a 7 floor office block, which is still ongoing.\nA site visit was requested so the committee members could see from the residents’ communal area the impact the development would have, as was done for the previous application, but a site visit took place without informing the residents and without visiting their side to see the potential impacts.\nResidents will feel they weren’t given a fair hearing: and I can only agree. It’s a shameful way for a decision to have been reached and I know has shaken the faith of residents in the council.”\nThe application was passed by Labour and Lib Dem Councillors with only Cllr Holmshaw, the sole Green Councillor on the Committee, backing local residents and voting against.\nReferences\nCharles Street Development Revised Planning Application",

But that was only the start. Here is a round-up of what our Green councillors have been doing in Sheffield Council and the city to change our city for the better…\nImproving our Environment\n- Our councillors entered into the first cross-party administration in Sheffield and are changing the culture of the Council. All major council decisions now have to consider the climate crisis. With Greens in the Executive, the Council has introduced a 10-point plan for Climate Action, covering all organisations in the city and looking at jobs, housing, waste, energy, food and more.\n- Green action has meant property developers and businesses applying for additional recovery grants will have to say how they will address the climate crisis. This will mean businesses across the city taking practical measures, from reduction in plastics to sustainable urban drainage to increased renewable energy use.\n- Green Councillors succeeded in getting the council to declare a Nature Emergency; this includes reducing the use of the harmful weed-killer glyphosate, with the Council now running trials to go Glyphosate-free.\nMaking Sheffield a Fair city\n- Greens have made the Council take action on the cost of living crisis, with our councillors fighting to protect services to the most vulnerable. We also initiated a green Jobs and Skills strategy focussed on retrofitting home insulation, and got the council to investigate the “energiesprong” approach, aiming to make large numbers of homes warm, healthy and affordable.\n- Greens are pushing for new ideas to address the Council’s social care crisis, such as social care co-operatives.\n- Green Councillors have supported residents affected by unsafe cladding on tower blocks; supported refugees; spoke up for stronger migrant rights; worked to make public spaces safe for everyone; improved security for council tenants; stood alongside striking Just Eat couriers, University lecturers, and NHS staff for better pay and conditions.\nKeeping Sheffield Moving\n- Our Green councillors have got the go-ahead for a Clean Air Zone and unlocked millions of pounds in government grants for taxi-drivers and small businesses. This will make the city cleaner and healthier.\n- Green councillors kept the city centre around Pinstone St safe for people to walk and cycle. The street remains pedestrianised and will be transformed in the future. Green councillors also won agreements for a FreeBee city centre shuttle bus and a pavement parking ban for the city centre, making getting about easier for everyone.\n- Greens have worked hard to get Active Travel cycling and walking improvements in place across Sheffield, linking up the city. We’re also actively supporting the Upper Don Trail which will offer a safe route to the city centre from Walkley, Hillsborough and beyond.\nListening to every resident\n- Greens backed the independent “It’s Our City!” campaign that called for the end to the ‘Strong Leader’ way of running the council. Green councillors have been pushing for more openness in the new ‘modern committee’ system to involve ordinary people more.\n- Green Councillors secured an independent inquiry into the Sheffield street trees felling scandal. Many Green councillors played a role in the protests. This inquiry will help achieve “truth and reconciliation”.\n- Our Green councillors have close links with voluntary groups and charities and have been pushing to make sure these groups are involved more in Council decisions and services. Our Green councillors also work hard for residents on everyday issues, actively making the Council work better.\nThis is what we did with just 13 councillors along with the Green Party activists and supporters across the city. Imagine what we could do with 13 more! Please vote for your local Sheffield Green Party candidate in the elections on May 5th and join us in working for justice, equality and protection of the natural resources that sustain us, to transform Sheffield into a fairer, greener place to live and work.",

(1)\nBroomhill and Sharrow Vale Councillor Brian Holmshaw said\n“There are already 926 advertising sites in Sheffield. They consist of billboards, bus shelter ads and increasing numbers of freestanding digital advertising screens. These digital hoardings on footways come with a series of issues.\n“I’m very concerned about any obstacles on the footway of a key pedestrian route such as this one. The siting, height, and bulk of the reinstalled digital advertising hoarding, outside the Hicks Building, and its brightness give an overly conspicuous and obtrusive visual impact on the character and appearance of the area.\n“The display will cause increased conflict with pedestrians on Western Bank by obstructing the footway.\n“Digital advertising screens significantly increase the number of bright, intrusive adverts local residents such as students, University staff and road users are exposed to. This will have an adverse effect on road safety. The most recent research suggests there is a direct link between roadside advertisement and car crashes. The main two reasons that make digital billboards more distracting are their brightness and the fast changing images, for example when transitioning from an ad to the next.\n“The energy consumption of an electronic billboard is estimated to be the same as six average UK homes. Advertising itself contributes massively to our collective CO2 emissions, and promotes unhealthy products, damaging wellbeing. Permitting these boards would be in direct opposition to Sheffield’s declaration of a climate emergency”\nCity Ward Councillor Ruth Mersereau said,\n“ In November the Council passed a Green motion agreeing to make Sheffield a Pedestrian Friendly City. The distracting, energy hungry, obstructions that these digital advertising displays represent are incompatible with a city that puts pedestrians first.\n“The Council has also recently passed a new Advertising and Sponsorship policy that says we shouldn’t promote advertising that poses a health and safety risk. For example, as a result of flickering or other visual imagery in the case of digital media. The evidence on the impact of these digital advertising displays is clearly at odds with their approval and the Council needs to ensure that its planning policies prioritise pedestrians not the private profit of the advertising companies.”",

Just one in twenty people of working age are unemployed and the experience is often one of pointless bureaucracy. People are required to apply for jobs even if they have already been offered (but not yet started) another job. People are required to apply for jobs even if their health would prevent them from actually taking it up. If they don’t, they get sanctioned, and can end up destitute.\nThe Green Party would get rid of the sanctions regime. Around a third of the people who claim unemployment benefit have been out of work for more than a year. They have often lost confidence and the skills to get and keep a job. They need support and guidance towards a hopeful future, but instead are made to fill out twenty random job applications a week and waste employers’ time. We need employers who are willing to invest the time to support people into valuable work.

This legacy of truth which his efforts have gifted to the city provides a clear picture of the Labour Council’s wrongful behaviour towards tree campaigners.\n“While an apology would be appreciated, the seriousness of leader Julie Dore’s mismanagement and ruthless approach to the public campaign to protect Sheffield’s trees has undermined any confidence in her ability to provide the city with the leadership needed to rebuild trust and faith in the Council.\n“The abuse of powers perpetrated by the leader and her ever-changing Cabinet warrant her resignation. She must bear responsibility for many mistakes including pursuing an Injunction at great public expense, and using the Injunction to threaten the loss of people’s livelihoods and homes, and of course, attempting to have some of us sent to prison.\n“Sheffield residents deserve a Council that listens to them and respects and incorporates the input of citizens who care deeply about their community and the future of this city.”\nDave Dillner, founder of Sheffield Tree Action Groups (STAG) and a Green Party member, said,\n“An apology would be a start but I am yet to see one. Having those responsible held to account is what I need to see before I can accept it’s over. Those who plotted to remove half of our street trees, hatched plans to frame members of the public and thought it appropriate to challenge citizens in the High Court, instead of talking to them, need to be returned to court themselves.\n“Without an inquiry Sheffield Labour and the council will never have clean hands.”\nCllr Martin Phipps added,\n“This Labour cabinet continues to defend their actions by failing to apologise and failing to hold those at fault to account, many of whom remain in post. Sheffield deserves better than this authoritarian Labour administration. We now want to see Sheffield move past its notorious past and into a greener future.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“This report reveals not just a single error or a badly-handled complaint but a system of deliberate misinformation and lies by a number of officers and cabinet members over a lengthy period. It was a sustained attack on what the people of Sheffield love.\nAs we have seen with the Hanover Tower cover-up, at the heart of this is a Council Administration that fundamentally distrusts its residents.”\nCllr Paul Turpin said,\n“Like many people in Sheffield, I am fully aware that the way the Labour-led council operated throughout the tree scandal was diabolical. Secrecy and lies permeated everything they did.\n“The attempts to jail an elected opposition councillor and other brave campaigners, to bankrupt them and have them lose their jobs, was reprehensible. The impact on people’s mental and physical wellbeing was devastating. It was so much worse than the many sleepless nights endured. The false accusations – the private security – the private investigators – the £25,000 a day barristers: for the Administration to admit they “got some things wrong” is an alarming understatement and is not an apology. They turned on the people of Sheffield with the full force of a twisted establishment hell-bent on tearing the community apart with intentionally divisive language used in the press and in the council chamber.”\nNotes\n1.

A population that was 95% white in 1991, even after decades of migration, dropped to 89% ten years later, then to 81% by 2011 and at the 2021 census is now 75%.\n“Ten years ago, most people still said they were Christian. That is no longer the case.\nSheffield has benefited from this: we have steadily improved our diversity and, in doing so, our outlook on the world.However, there are other facts we see with our own eyes, which may be uncomfortable when we talk about race equality.\n“If you see classes of primary children going to swimming lessons, you will observe there are classes of almost all white children’ and there are other schools with almost all black children.\n[I use the word “black” in a deliberately blunt way here]\n“And whilst most people – 60% – in England and Wales have a spare bedroom, 60% of Somali people live in overcrowded homes. 72% of Somali people live in social rented housing, compared to just 17% of the population at large. So, when it comes to rehousing overcrowded families, our policies and the individual decisions affect everyone – but the impact is clearly not the same. We need to use this data to drive change.\n“Finally, I want to say that I think the developing change in culture in this council is a welcome step. We have to accept that, try as we might, we will sometimes still make bad decisions.\n“In my time fighting unlawful discrimination, I often found that organisations, when faced with clear evidence of discrimination, would either clam up or aggressively deny they could possibly discriminate in any way. They ended up in court. A far better approach came from those organisations that accepted the challenge and looked at the objective data to see what they could do better. It resulted in a better outcome for the individual and a better outcome for the organisation.\n“For this council, the move away from its former culture of defensiveness will genuinely help us become an anti-racist organisation.”",

The communication has been shambolic. Many bus stops are still advertising services which no longer exist.\n“The withdrawal of the number 11 bus on Gleadless Road means that many residents of Heeley Green, Newfield Green and parts of Arbourthorne do not have a viable bus service.\n“The impact on older residents without access to a car is particularly stark. In Heeley and Newfield Green, 70% of pensioners who live alone do not have a car. In neighbouring Arbourthorne, the figure is 81%. The loss of the bus services means they will be trapped at home at a time when the Winter Fuel Allowance is going to be withdrawn.\n“It is vital that the bus companies are held to account and the South Yorkshire Mayor moves forward with franchising or public ownership. Funding plans must be urgently brought forward so Sheffield and South Yorkshire can have an affordable, reliable, accessible and clean bus service fit for the 21st century.”\nCity Ward Councillor Ruth Mersereau, who is also a member of the Committee, said,\n“Public transport is an equality issue that disproportionately affects women, those people in poverty and people with a disability. Roughly a third of Sheffield households have no access to a vehicle. They are now being offered a third class service or no service at all.\n“Offering such a scant service at night doesn’t help the night-time economy nor leisure industries, which are key to the regeneration of the city centre. Poor bus services don’t help people who finish work in the city centre after 6pm. There is a real lack of communication about these changes to bus services.”",

The problems are understood, chronic underfunding, a lack of trained, well paid staff and large private sector care providers driven by the profit motive. Many quality smaller care providers find it difficult to make ends meet with spiralling energy bills, often poorly insulated accommodation and fees that barely cover these costs”\n“We cannot wait 3 years to hear the Commission’s Report before we act. It will largely tell us what we already know, and then who knows how many years to see real action. We need proper investment in the care sector now.\n“The Green Party is calling for £20 Billion of investment in Adult Social Care funded through a Wealth Tax. The Wealth Tax we propose is 1% on assets over £10 million and 2% on assets over £1 Billion. This modest tax on the very wealthy levers significant funding for public services. So far, the Labour Government has refused to consider a Wealth Tax.\n“We need free personal care for elderly and disabled people and increased pay rates and a career structure for carers to rebuild the care workforce. Only in this way can we ensure we have a sustainable Adult Social Care sector that we all may need in the years to come.”",

I’m Douglas Johnson. I’m one of the Green Party councilors in Sheffield, and this week at Full Council, I spoke about our proposal for a new renewable energy strategy for Sheffield.\nIf you look at householders, being able to put solar panels on their roofs. And people do that for a reason. It’s about reducing carbon emissions. It’s about investing to save money and making the world a better place.\nWe think the city and in particular, the council needs its own strategy for renewable energy. And that’s why we’ve proposed this motion to get officers to start planning\nahead on how we do that. The first thing is always to insulate homes and buildings. But once that’s out of the way, we need to look at how we generate new, renewable, clean energy that benefits us all. So by having Greens in the room in the council chamber, we were able to lay out this motion, calling for a renewable energy strategy and debating that in full council, asking for the support of the other parties. And we’re pleased to see that the Labour Councillors put forward their amendment, which added to what we were saying and had some useful parts in it, and with the support of all parties, those proposals were agreed. And that means that it can now go forward and officers will do the work now of assembling what can actually go into a renewable energy strategy that can be delivered and make a difference to us in Sheffield.\nAnd that strategy can include things like using the council’s buildings and its estate to install solar panels so that we can be generating our power, making use of air source heat pumps, ground source heat pump technology, using battery storage, so we can store, distribute, and use that that will reduce the bills in the council. And we also look at extending out to looking at community-owned energy with support to organizations and the voluntary sector like Sheffield Renewables. They’ve got some great ideas about how they could use their expertise and ability, and their resources to work with the council if we’ll just give them that room to do some work. So this is all about distributing energy generation.\nThere’s a really important part to this as well, and that’s energy security. At the moment. If we buy gas and electricity, we’re beholden to big power distributors, generators, and, of course, foreign suppliers like Putin’s Russia. By building our own energy-generating facilities in Sheffield, it means that we use power in Sheffield that’s been generated in Sheffield, and it’s distributed across the city. And that means it can’t possibly be a target. It means the whole system is safer, more secure, and more resilient for the future. And that’s really important as we go into more turbulent weather events arising from climate change.\nSo now we pass over to officers who we rely on to do some of the detailed work around planning this whole strategy on power generation. And we look forward to when some fruits of that come back, and we’ll eventually come back to the policy committee that will look at it in more detail. And with all these strands of work that can be going on in parallel, we want to take every opportunity to increase the chances of getting more clean renewable power generated in Sheffield. And that’s got to be better for all of us. It’s an ongoing process, not pretending there aren’t challenges there.\nThere’s a lot to work through, and we need some determination. But the point is, we’re having greens in the room. We started off this process, and as long as we’ve got greens in the room, we’ll\nbe able to follow it up and do our best to make sure that this comes forward and makes everyone’s lives safer, better, and cheaper.",

The ‘Taxing Wealth Report’ (1) being produced by Economics Professor Richard Murphy of Sheffield University, shows that, by fairly taxing the top 1% of the wealthy and high earners, the Government could raise £83.3 billion each year. Unfortunately, this is something that both Labour and the Conservatives are unwilling to consider.\n“In the absence of a plan from both larger parties (2) the Council needs to develop its own plan to make it more resilient to funding cuts, whether it is a Conservative or Labour Government that is imposing them.\n“Greens are proposing three policies to bring much-needed extra cash to support local services.\n“Establishing a wholly-owned Council company to help deliver the council’s objectives and raise income by delivering reliable services for Sheffield residents. These could be useful services such as gardening, household repairs, heating system servicing and replacement and retrofit works. This has been successfully piloted by Oxford City Council where, this year, it will make a £600,000 contribution to council funds. (3)\n“We need to invest in renewable energy projects on Council land and buildings to generate energy and income. Cambridgeshire County Council will soon be receiving £1 million each year from a solar farm it has developed. (4)\n“Introducing an Employers’ Workplace Parking Levy to help fund public transport, road safety and active travel measures. This could raise around £10 million each year. This has been successfully trialled in Nottingham where they have raised nearly £100 million and attracted over £1 billion in investment for public transport and active travel over the last 10 years. (5)\n“Together, these measures will improve the standards of our homes, our transport and our quality of life for everyone in Sheffield.”\nReferences\n(1) Taxing Wealth Report – Professor Richard Murphy\n(2) Labour needs to level up its offer to local government\nLabour Needs To Level Up Its Offer To Local Government – The Social Review\n(3) Oxford City Council Medium Term Financial Strategy – Page 20\n(4) How Cambridgeshire Council is raising revenue with solar farms – Friends of the Earth\nHow Cambridgeshire Council is raising revenue with solar farms | Local action (friendsoftheearth.uk)\n(5) Nottingham’s Workplace Parking Levy – 10 year impact report\nWPL-10-Year-Impact-Report-Digital-Nov-22.pdf (transportnottingham.com)",

Pavements are for people, not cars, and I’m really pleased that with Greens in administration of the council we’ve been able to move this forward”\nThe Council’s Cooperative Executive report highlighted the impact of pavement parking on pedestrians, particularly people with visual impairment, wheelchair users and parents with buggies. The good availability of off- and on-street car parking in the city centre demonstrates there is no shortage of legitimate parking.\nTo enforce the pavement parking ban, the Council has brought in a new Traffic Regulation Order covering the city centre so the Council can issue Penalty Charge notices to drivers who park on pavements.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“Up to now, only the police could deal with vehicle obstructions on pavements. it was difficult to get swift action on inconsiderate and dangerous parking, despite it being a regular source of complaints from the public. Enforcement has been talked about for years and I am pleased we have finally been able to introduce the formal powers to take action.\n“This is a big win for people who just want to use pavements safely without being obstructed by a vehicle. For people who have poor mobility or who are visually impaired, being forced to go out into the road is not just an inconvenience but dangerous. Now we have the legal power we need to tackle this problem. People will now be safer in our City Centre.”",

This decision is the result of tireless campaigning by the people of Sheffield in solidarity with the people of Palestine.\nPalestinians have been the victims of a brutal occupation for 76 years, live under a racist apartheid system, and are being subjected to a genocide which has been going on for over a year.\nIt is now vital that the Council follows up this symbolic act of solidarity with concrete actions to help bring about an end to the occupation, apartheid and genocide in line with rulings from the UN, International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice. International law, conventions, and the institutions which underpin them, are in grave peril and must be restored and defended, especially in light of the reelection of President Trump.\nAll local and regional bodies and organisations, including the Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster Councils, the Combined Mayoral Authority, South Yorkshire Pensions Authority and universities must ensure that none of their partnerships or investments are contributing to the oppression of the Palestinian people and the gross violations of international law being carried out. Sheffield should once again declare an Apartheid Free Zone.\nIn light of the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, we repeat our call to all Sheffield politicians – MPs, councillors and the South Yorkshire Mayor – to end their silence about Israel’s clear breaches of international law and crimes against humanity and publicly call on the Labour government to end its participation in them.\nWe request that all Sheffield politicians demand that the UK’s Labour government:\n(a) Impose a two-way arms embargo on Israel.\n(b) End negotiations for a free-trade agreement with Israel.\n(c) Cease aiding and assisting in the commission of violations of international law through diplomatic support for Israel, the use of the UK Akrotiri military base in Cyprus, and intelligence sharing, reconnaissance and all other military support.\n(d) Investigate the Israeli ambassador to the UK, and dual-nationals returning from service with the IDF as potential perpetrators of international crimes and grave human rights violations, including the crime of incitement to genocide.",

The terrace was built by the Flockton family and was designed without offshot kitchens.\nSaid Brian Holmshaw,\n“I have a lot of sympathy for the applicant – everyone needs space to live and breathe – but this is a unique set of townhouses within the Hanover Conservation Area and the look and design of them is crucial. They were never intended to have extensions at the back.”\nThe Gell Street terrace is described in the Hanover Conservation Area plan as “possibly the oldest terrace” in the conservation area and recent research by Gell Street residents might make it the oldest brick terrace in central Sheffield, dating back to 1806. They showed it was not only built by Thomas Flockton but was actually in their ownership some years before his son set up the very first Flockton firm of architects in 1833.\nThe planning committee voted through the planning application unchanged and refused residents requests to take the new information into account, to ask for a heritage report on the terrace, to change the look of the extension to a more sympathetic one or even to visit the site to see for themselves.\nInstead the Chair of the Planning and Highways Committee praised the modernist design and assumed that the houses had no original features, including the claim that she was “sure they have not got 200-year-old window frames.” One resident was incensed by this as her Gell Street house does have 200-year-old sash window frames and many other original features.\nThe decision came soon after another decision to grant a modernist extension to a nearby listed building on Glossop Road in the same conservation area\nBrian Holmshaw said this was a sad and blatant attempt to downgrade the heritage of the conservation area.\n“Many councillors on the Planning Committee have a mindset that says that any development is good at any cost. Residents’ views mean nothing when faced with this but we will keep supporting them, putting forward the value of heritage and protecting historic buildings and attractive conservation areas throughout the city.”\nCouncillor Rob Murphy, the only Green Party councillor on the Planning Committee, was also the only councillor to vote against the extension plans.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said: “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything.” So far nearly 5000 civilians have been killed and the ground invasion has not yet started.\nInstead of supporting war crimes, our government must call for an immediate ceasefire. Electricity, food and water must be restored to Gaza. The killing of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank must be stopped. Further escalation makes a regional conflict increasingly likely. At the same time as killing innocent Palestinians, the actions of the Israeli government make Israelis less safe.\nWe have been consistent in calling for a release of all hostages and political prisoners, lifting the siege of Gaza and condemning all atrocities, both those that have been committed by Hamas and by the Israeli Government. It is innocent civilians who are suffering as a result of these actions.”\nCouncillor Maleiki Haybe, a Councillor for the Broomhill and Sharrow Vale Ward, said,\n“The Labour Leader, Keir Starmer has angered many people by saying in an interview with LBC, that Israel “does have that right” to withhold food, water and electricity from Gaza.The Green Party believes that this statement effectively supports collective punishment, and that Starmer should apologise and retract it. “Innocent Palestinians should not lose their lives because of the actions of the Israeli regime.\n“The only way to secure peace between Israelis and Palestinians is for a just political settlement based on the end of the occupation of Palestinian territories and an end to discriminatory apartheid policies, settler colonialism and ethnic cleansing.”\n“We strongly oppose Israel’s actions, which some describe as a ‘second Nakba’ or ethnic cleansing.\n“We’re calling for a complete military embargo on Israel, similar to what was applied to apartheid-era South Africa.\n“It’s crucial that the International Criminal Court conducts a thorough and quick investigation into possible war crimes, crimes against humanity, including genocide and apartheid.”",

They are ignoring millions of people across the country on lower incomes.\nWe need more support for people in our communities to help them through this.

Private developers are seeking to make as much profit as they can at the cost of residents by making flats as small as possible.”\n“Living in small spaces is bad for people’s mental and physical health and made worse by the lack of green space in the city centre.”\nCllr Martin Phipps said, “The council needs to do more for City ward residents and does not value them highly enough. There are plans to have more people living in the city centre, as higher density housing has a lower carbon footprint, but not enough thought is given to the conditions it is expected city ward residents should live in. Higher density housing should not mean substandard housing.\nIf the council truly wants more people to live in the city centre, then it should make it a city centre more people would want to live in. This means not making it a city centre full of undersized flats, but instead respecting the amount of space a person needs, listening to residents’ concerns and not retorting with ‘what did you expect living in the city centre?’.\nBars and nightclubs have had opening hours allowed to extend practically into daybreak. Applications for longer opening hours have been granted even when they are opposite social housing that predates the venue, has vulnerable people living there and against residents’ concerns. Sheffield has a fantastic night life, which city ward residents also enjoy, but opening hours and management must be balanced with residents’ needs.\nA city centre for people to live in should mean more green spaces, more parks, more cycle lanes, less traffic and less car priority. These things would also make it a city centre more people would want to visit and shop in, as well as a greener one. Many other city centres across Europe are full of great public spaces, parks, pedestrianised roads and less car priority.\nIf we are serious about more people living in the city centre it’s time we reject applications for small housing and start building the city centre we need to see.”\nThe City ward councillors submitted the following objection:\nRe planning app for flats at Garden St\nReference 20/01158/FUL | Site Of 52-54 Garden Street Sheffield S1 4BJ\nPlanning objection\nObjection from Martin Phipps on behalf of City Ward cllrs\n“The City ward councillors object to this planning application on the following grounds:.\n- The proposed sizes for the studio flats are significantly below the recommended South Yorkshire Residential Design Guide which suggest 33 square metres for a studio and 46/47 square metres for a one bed flat. One of the studios is only 19.5 square metres, and there are one bedroom flats of only 26.3 square metres, both close to half the recommended size in the guidelines. None of the flats suggested meet the design guide size guidelines.A bedroom and bathroom are expected to fit into a total size room of 10.6 square metres, close to 3 metres by 3 metres.\nLiving in spaces that are too small has a serious negative impact on people’s mental health and wellbeing, which can also affect physical health. High density accommodation is important to tackle climate change but does not and must not come at the sacrifice of health and wellbeing. It’s important to note that approving this small size of flats will be used in justification for further small flats, and we must avoid Sheffield city centre becoming a race to the smallest apartments.\n- Living in small spaces in the city centre is made even worse by the lack of green space, which is important for addressing air pollution and physical and mental health. We note that there is no green space proposed in the development. The application should be changed to include some green space/greenery in the courtyard. This should be publicly accessible, whilst respecting the privacy of residents, given the overwhelming amount of high-density housing and lack of public facilities in the vicinity.\n- We also feel it is important that previous conditions set out under grant 17/04202/FUL – on the complex having 16 suitable bike parking spaces – are retained and that the green / brown roof system should be maintained. ”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Gas boilers will be replaced with modern Air Source Heat Pumps that extract heat from the surrounding air to provide heating, where this is technically possible. Where it is not possible to install a heat pump, an energy efficient A-rated gas boiler will be installed instead.\nSheffield Council will also be insulating some of its least energy-efficient housing. Homes built in the 1940s and 1950s out of pre-cast concrete are cold, leaky and very difficult to heat. Costs for insulating these homes have risen due to inflationary press\nures.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“Improving the energy efficiency of homes tackles climate change and also helps address the cost of living crisis which affects those on the lowest incomes the most. Greens have been campaigning for improved energy performance standards of homes for many years, so this investment is very welcome. What’s more, this will be an opportunity for a new generation of apprentices to learn the skills of installing technology for the future.\n“We need to do a lot more, though. Greens have also proposed that the Council develops a scheme for private householders to help them upgrade their homes by releasing some of their equity to pay for measures such as insulation and solar panels with no upfront costs. This could be a relatively easy way of improving a large number of homes, reducing both energy costs and carbon emissions.”\nNOTES\nSheffield City Council – Agenda for Strategy and Resources Policy Committee on Wednesday 19 April 2023, 2.00 pm\nFind out about your election candidates here.",

That’s only going to get worse for local people as development is increasingly focused in the east end, drawing in more road traffic.\nThe Council’s decision to approve the Meadowhall Leisure Extension relies on two key actions to mitigate air pollution. Firstly, the council’s out of date Air Quality Action Plan with objectives to be achieved by 2015. It has failed to meet the key objective of reducing 500 premature deaths each year in the city. Secondly, improvements in vehicle technology to reduce emissions by 2021.\nNeither offers any robust, proven action that will address the air pollution and the linked serious health issues that blight the Tinsley area. This decision sidelines the Sheffield Council’s current Public Health Strategy which says “We will adopt a principle of health in all policies & systematically consider health and wellbeing outcomes, and inequalities across all of the decisions.”\nAir pollution and public health cannot be swept under the carpet. People who live in Tinsley cannot be sacrificed for east end development. Meadowhall will contribute £250,000 to the chimneys artwork as part of this decision. That amount of money and more really needs to be spent on public health in Tinsley.

This means the issue is now set to be examined at a Scrutiny Committee, which is open to the public.\nThe decision is to spend £4.6 million widening the inner ring road from Shalesmoor to the Wicker, from two lanes to three, even though the council admits it is not a long-term solution.\nCllr Martin Phipps, who led the call-in explained,\n“I have called for this decision to be scrutinised further on how these plans will impact on air quality in the area and people’s health, local residents and also those in their cars. We need to put health firmly at the centre of all our decisions.”\nCllr Phipps expressed his disappointment with the council’s approach, saying,\n“This is typical of a council whose first approach to transport is cars.\n“This is claimed to be necessary to accommodate new jobs in the city centre, but if the council was serious about its commitment to improve air quality, its alleged commitments to improving public transport and its alleged commitments to improving cycling infrastructure, then that is what it would be looking at. Instead, it’s another bid for a road change that will provide a short-lived flow improvement before the traffic rises to meet demand.”\nAir pollution sensors funded by the Green Party councillors in City Ward have shown that air quality levels are already at the maximum legal limit in nearby residential accommodation. Readings have reached 40µg of NO2 per m3 which is the maximum legal limit.\nGreen Party activists Ruth Mersereau and James Martin also commented, with Ruth saying,\n“This is money to benefit car drivers only and is a huge missed opportunity to improve cycling and pedestrian routes, which would be better for everyone’s health.\n“As a committed cyclist, I despair at Sheffield’s approach of always making the healthiest forms of transport more dangerous and less convenient.”\nJames added,\n“Residents in the area already know how disruptive the road is with poor air quality and noise. It is appalling that a plan to Increase traffic levels further is being pursued by the council on the same road as the proposed Clean Air Zone. People who need to use public transport and choose to live near the city centre should not be gassed out by commuter pollution where a good public transport system could serve businesses better.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson, of City Ward, said,\n“I would have preferred to see a simpler scheme to give more priority to buses crossing the ring road at Bridgehouses where, at present, they can be waiting a long time at traffic lights for cars to pass.”\nA date for the scrutiny committee hearing is awaited.\nNotes\n- Sheffield Green Party’s original comment on the consultation is at: https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2017/11/29/inner-ring-road-plans-will-worsen-air-pollution/\n- Further comment is at: https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2019/01/16/short-term-vision-doesnt-justify-ring-road-widening-scheme/\n- The reason given for the call-in is to “scrutinise the impacts of air pollution on the city’s priorities and the public’s health.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Instead of burning, grouse moor owners can now mow and shred the vegetation. In this way, they can reduce the fire risk and reduce the air pollution suffered by people living downwind. This could easily be extended to all moorland.\nUnfortunately, illegal burning continues with the owner of Bradfield Moors subject to an enforcement penalty for unlawful burning of deep peat. Three similar cases are under investigation on Sheffield moors.\nDuring the heather burning season, local communities such as Bradfield, Loxley and Malin Bridge are subject to intolerable levels of smoke and particulates which are extremely damaging to health.

Many are dismayed that there are no plans from them for a Wealth Tax. Green Party proposals to tax the wealthiest 1% more would raise £50 Billion for public services. We believe this would make us a fairer country, fit to fight the environmental challenges we face.\n“There will be no cavalry coming over the horizon to save the day after the General Election. Many fear that it will be a seamless continuation of failed destructive austerity policies.\n“The Nature and Climate Emergencies are not going away, neither is the Council’s Commitment to have a Net Zero Carbon City by 2030. There are huge benefits that we can realise whilst achieving this goal. With targeted investment we can achieve warmer homes, affordable energy bills, secure sustainable local food production, cleaner air, safer streets, affordable and reliable public transport and a rich diverse natural environment.\n“To address these huge challenges we need to generate new sources of funding to bring in the millions we need to upgrade our public transport, to insulate our homes, to generate renewable energy and to protect our city from the climate change impacts that are already happening and likely to get much worse.\n“We need to hardwire resilience into our local economy. A city that generates a large proportion of its own energy, produces more of its own food and a city that can withstand extreme weather events is a city that will have a more secure future.\n“In our amendment we are asking the Council to look beyond a one year budget. No more tinkering around the edges. We should set ourselves the task of identifying proven sources of income that can generate significant amounts and that will make our city ready for the future.\n“All of the proposals we are asking the Council to consider have been successfully implemented in other parts of the country but never have they all been brought together in such an ambitious programme. This is a huge opportunity for us to show we are boldly taking opportunities that are available to us. That we are real leaders in local government.”\nHillsborough Green Councillor Christine Gilligan who seconded the Green Party amendment said,\n“The proposals in our budget amendment could raise millions to tackle climate change, improve homes, generate clean local energy and will use the resources we have within the city to benefit the city\n“We are proposing that the Council investigate developing a model of a directly-owned company (like Oxford Direct Services that is wholly owned by Oxford City Council) It could provide services to householders such as gardening, household repairs, heating system servicing and replacement and retrofit works. Providing services that local people need and value whilst and a useful income stream for the Council;\n“Forest Heath District Council recoups nearly £400k per year in revenue from its Council owned solar farm. Other Councils have developed solar farm projects such as West Sussex County Council who have a 7.4 megawatt solar farm on a former landfill site. So why not Sheffield?\n“At least 9 Councils have raised funding to support climate change related projects from the community by issuing municipal climate bonds These have successfully raised millions of pounds of investment for several councils from community sources at a lower rate of interest than the Public Works Loan Board. Why not Sheffield?\nNottingham has an Employer’s Workplace Parking Levy that provides substantial funding to support public transport, active travel and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n“In Nottingham, the levy has raised more than £9 million each year, with the revenue used to fund tram infrastructure, a smart card scheme, electric buses and cycling facilities. It has also levered in 100s of millions of pounds of external investment.\n“South Yorkshire Pensions Authority has over £8 Billion of funding and some of this could be used to invest in large-scale energy-saving and power-generation schemes. This will bring steady financial returns to both the lenders and the council and keep the South Yorkshire pound in South Yorkshire.”\nYou can read more about Oxford Direct Services on their site, and get more information about Municipal Climate Bonds on the Green Finance Institute page. See the East Anglian Daily Times for more on how Suffolk council’s solar farm out-performs on predicted electricity output.\nOur website has more about the Employers Workplace Parking Levy and how the Corporate Opportunities Register was agreed by Sheffield City Council in June 2022 to encourage the Council to seek external sources of funding.",

There are many pensioners on similar levels of income who only just miss out on pension credit. There are also many who would qualify if they knew how to apply. The DWP estimates that £1.7 billion of pension credit is going unclaimed every year by people who are entitled to it.\nAt the same time, we desperately need the government to act urgently on home insulation schemes. This is the best way of keeping everyone safe, warm and out of poverty. Instead of cutting the Winter Fuel Allowance, it would have made more sense to give pensioners the option to use it to help finance the installation of insulation measures and solar panels to reduce their energy bills.

In addition to the welfare cuts, we have to consider the impact on Care Providers of the additional costs to the increases in Employers National Insurance contributions.\n“It would be irresponsible to ignore the negative impact of Government policy on local people. Government needs to know how the results of the decisions they make in Westminster affect residents here in Sheffield. That is why I have asked the Council to keep a close eye on the impact of the Labour Government’s decisions, so they can be held accountable. These reductions in funding for those in need will only add to the uncertainty and pressures on Councils like Sheffield. Decisions like this simply create more hardship for people who need support the most.\n“The Government clearly prefers to raise funds by taking money from people in the greatest need rather than asking the very wealthy to pay more tax. A 2% tax on assets over £10 million could raise over £24 Billion a year – almost five times the amount Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to save by slashing welfare for disabled people. That would be a fairer way of addressing the need for more public expenditure than putting the burden on those who can least afford it“\nResponding to the Chancellor’s Spring Statement, the Co-Leader of The Green Party, Adrian Ramsay MP, said,\n“The Chancellor had a choice today. To rebalance our economy by asking the very wealthiest to contribute more, or to remove vital support from ill and disabled people. That she chose to take from the most vulnerable to balance her books is a damning reflection of how out of touch this government is. It is morally repugnant.”\nHe continued, “And it’s not just ill and disabled people who will suffer as the Chancellor doubles down on cuts to frontline services. This will weaken our communities and leave us all poorer. Labour once claimed that they were for the many, not the few – it’s clear now that this is no longer the case.”",

She was re-elected with a big majority of nearly 1 400 votes. This reflected many local voters’ support for the way Alison has challenged unpopular decisions and actions by Sheffield’s Labour-led City Council.\nThe official election result was:\n- Alison Teal (Green): 3896 votes\n- Nadia Jama (Lab): 2503\n- Kyle Crossland (Lib Dem): 285\n- Joseph Busby (Con): 21 3\n- Jeffrey Shaw (UKIP): 52\nAlison said “I will do my best to continue to give a good service to everyone in our local area, whether they voted for me or not.”\nPositive action\nMothers, and some fathers, in our local community are getting together to help their sons avoid the gang culture affecting so many teenagers. They have called their group ‘Mums United’; and have already attracted the support of the city’s two football teams who will offer soccer training locally. The group is also organising language tuition for mums who need help to learn English.\nSchools funding\nSheffield schools receive less funding than schools in many other English cities, which means our children and teachers suffer. Alison Teal and other local Greens have been helping to collect signatures for the petition started by the Sheffield Star and Telegraph to press for more government funding for local schools.\nBad-smelling drains\nFollowing consultations with residents of Glen Road (off Abbeydale Road), we’re currently working with a resident to get Yorkshire Water to take action on foul- smelling drains and other drainage-related problems.

Local Green Jon Ashe commented “We’re glad to help make the Festival a success, and also raise awareness of the importance of recycling.”\nStreet trees\nIn summer 201 7, Sheffield City Council obtained a one-year High Court Injunction restricting peaceful protest against tree- felling. In July this year, the council returned to court to request a 3 year extension to the injunction; but Alison Teal and three other people challenged this in court.\nA compromise was reached in the end – the new injunction lasts 1 8 months and has cost the council £75,000. Alison commented “It is difficult to understand why the council wanted to renew the injunction. Especially when they are saying publicly that they wish to negotiate a resolution to the dispute over felling healthy trees.”\nA better city council\nDuring the past year, many residents have told us that they think Sheffield’s Labour-led City Council should behave in a much more open and honest way with local people. And important Council decisions shouldn’t be taken by a few people in secret. We agree. Local Greens are working with others to press for improvements in the way the Council works.

We put forward a simple list of examples of seriously over-priced work, mostly through the council’s deal with Amey.\n“Instead of looking to make money go further for the residents of Sheffield, rather than Amey shareholders, they have lashed out at the Greens and called the idea of better value for money ‘incredulous.’”\nHowever, the Labour Group has now committed the Chief Executive to respond to explain, “how the council has maximised value for money in relation to all the schemes listed in the original motion.”\nCllr Martin Phipps said,\n“We are very much looking forward to the Chief Executive’s explanations and are grateful to the Labour Group for agreeing that a response should be provided to address the areas of over-spending that we have highlighted.”\n“Local authorities have suffered staggering cuts over the last decade under austerity. The lack of funds make it all the more important that there is a solid system in place for getting the best value for money so we can support Sheffield and carry out our duty of care to residents of the city.”\nCllr Mersereau added,\n“It seems that often the response to requests for simple jobs is “we can’t, it’s too expensive”. If the Council took steps to get proper value for money, many more improvements would be made, and we could start to restore some trust from residents that their concerns are being listened to and that things actually get done.”\nNotes\n- The following Green motion on Value for Money is available at http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=7270#AI19842:\nThat this Council:-\n(a) notes that, despite the destructive cuts inflicted by the policy of austerity, this Administration is still responsible for spending hundreds of millions of pounds each year;(b) believes this Administration should get the best value for money it can because, if money is wasted, this means cuts to other areas of spending, especially at a time when budgets are under pressure;\n(c) also believes that a failure to do routine work quickly and cheaply leads to inertia and a lack of action;\n(d) notes the following examples of work that this Council believes is over-priced:-\n(i) £1m to install 500m of cycle lane on Trippet Lane;\n(ii) a further £700,000 to install a crossing on West Street;\n(iii) £3,500 to install just two cycle parking hoops;\n(iv) £20,000 to clear graffiti at Porter Brook Pocket Park; and\n(v) installation of park benches at £1,100 each; and(e) therefore calls on the Administration to examine areas of spending where more might be obtained for the Council’s resources.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

As Deputy Lord Mayor, this was the first time he had chaired the whole meeting and he certainly rose to the task. Magid reminded everyone – both councillors and members of the public – to show respect to the views of other people.\nThere wasn’t enough room in the public gallery so many people had to wait in the overflow rooms. The audio and visual feed broke down yet again, leaving many of the public in the dark as to what was going on. Staff did their best to fix it but it was yet another demonstration of why we call for broadcasting of meetings so that everyone can hear what is being said in their names.\nAnd there were certainly a lot of questions asked, plus seven petitions.\nPetitioners and questioners described the appalling temporary accommodation provided to nearly 100 homeless children in 2017, often sharing accommodation with single male ex-offenders. They had one cooker between 20 people. It is against the law for councils to put homeless families in B&Bs except in an emergency.\nOne petition was about the new slippery pavements. Another asked for safe houses for men fleeing domestic abuse. The young people who represented this petition reminded us that 6,100 men commit suicide each year.\nA new petition called on the council to limit work on the Chelsea Elm. The speaker said trust had broken down with the council but this iconic tree was a good place to start a process of change. In response, Cllr Bryan Lodge stated, “there’s no proposal to cut the tree down.” This may be the start of that change.\nhttps://youtu.be/LwZ0DQ9If8w\nMembers’ questions are where councillors get to ask supplementary questions, depending on the responses given by Cabinet members to written questions. We argued strongly that enough time should be given to this in council meetings. This month we learned:\n- That “Streets Ahead is a self-monitoring contract”\n- That Cllr Iqbal blamed the LibDems for signing the Amey PFI contract [it was actually signed by the Labour Administration in 2012, although the LibDems had agreed previous stages]\n- The Council is still “assessing” the impact on the city of Carillion’s collapse\n- The Council admitted it did not stop Sheffield Housing Company selling off residents’ leases.\n- The free public Wi-Fi contract was signed off without the Cabinet member being aware of any data protection issues\n- The Council is preparing a public consultation on the future of the Central Library, Graves Gallery and Library Theatre\n- 593 roads haven’t yet been resurfaced but should have been\n- The Council had 629 claims from trips and falls in 6 years but doesn’t have to pay anything because Amey deals with them. The number of complaints has gone up in recent years as Amey has worked on the roads\n- The council team monitoring the Amey contract has 5 vacant posts out 22\nIn the debate on the Housing Revenue Account, the cost of re-cladding Hanover Tower was put at £3-5 million but it won’t be done until after the final Hackett Report is published later in the year. Amongst concerns as to why the wrong cladding was installed in the first place, the cost of failed insulation and the delays, the good news is that tenants have “chosen the colour” of the new cladding.\nWe proposed an amendment to the LibDem motion, which called for a retired High Court judge to lead an inquiry into allegations around the Streets Ahead contract. We said the council should investigate bringing the contract back in-house if there was evidence of dishonesty. But of course, just “cancelling” the contract isn’t straightforward: Amey can’t put the trees back.\nOur amendment also called for full disclosure of the contract. As Cllr Rob Murphy explained,\n“The Labour group’s defence of commercial confidentiality has been blown out of the water. We’ve shown that it is a political, not a legal, decision not to release the contract.”\n“Councillors and members of the public want to know what has been signed in their name, what they are paying for over the next 40 years and what the Council is hiding.”\nhttps://youtu.be/n9mK6RVgSRU\nThere was no time to debate the other motions and they were just voted on. Ironically, there was a noisy outburst by Labour councillor Jackie Drayton at not being able to debate their motions.\nLabour voted down every opposition motion and amendment, so voting against:\n- publication of the council’s gender pay gap data\n- an enquiry into the conduct of the Administration that led to the application to commit Cllr Alison Teal to prison\n- a cross-party group to work up suitable proposals to commemorate the centenary of Votes for Women\n- Supporting care leavers with council tax exemption\nBut it seems our motions had some effect. The Council will announce more council tax help for care leavers soon. It has also promised to look into funding for the Women’s Vote Centenary – which was the substance of Alison’s proposal.\nAfter Cllr Magid had called the meeting to a close, there was more drama in the public gallery. As the councillor all left, campaigners unveiled a banner saying, “Show us the Contract please.” They later occupied the council chamber for a few hours.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

While it is important that we make room and adapt to our ‘new normal’, the lockdown must not be used to delay or roll back the essential action needed for the city, which declared a Climate Emergency in 2019, but is yet to implement significant changes.\nGreen Councillors raised concerns about the Clean Air Zone proposal back in 2019 with no consideration on the effect of private vehicles on air quality and the disproportionate impact on small local businesses. We noted then that the very need for a CAZ in a city the size of Sheffield was an admission of policy failure at local and national level. So to see an already flawed plan being halted, at a time when we desperately need to be building infrastructure that works for the good of all, is cause for concern.\nAir pollution already prematurely kills 500 people per year in Sheffield, with more than 28,000 deaths across the UK, making air quality a key issue for public health. These figures don’t exist in isolation either, with shortened lifespan and exacerbated health conditions for many, in addition to recorded fatalities. COVID-19 has already shown us how environmental quality, and inequality, plays a part in public health.\nIt isn’t enough to claim a short-term drop in emissions due to the lockdown as ‘progress’ – in fact postponing the CAZ has put the council in breach of its legal requirement to address the issue. If SCC are serious about tackling toxic air quality it’s imperative that, rather than putting off any action, they make a clear commitment and take full advantage of the £40 million in government grants available.\nSheffield is well placed to be ahead of the curve. We welcome innovations around walking and cycling infrastructure put in place during the lockdown. Now is the time to expand that program, to meet the target of being carbon neutral by 2030 and help small local businesses to reduce emissions.\nCouncillor Paul Turpin\nGleadless Valley Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

(1)\nThe Pathways to Decarbonisation report, commissioned by the Council, had indicated that it was possible to achieve an 85% reduction in emissions by 2030 (2). A report by the Tyndall Centre in 2019 said that the Council needed to achieve carbon reductions of 14% per year if it was to have any chance of being zero carbon by 2030. (3)\nCity Ward Councillor Martin Phipps said,\n“Green involvement in the Council Administration has been central to the climate action the Council has taken: from introducing Climate Impact Assessments, to the creation of the Ten Point Plan for Climate Action (4), to ensuring major schemes like Connecting Sheffield and the Clean Air Zone progress in the face of political opposition, but people in Sheffield need to see more action across the Council if it is to play its part in achieving a stable climate.\n“We need to take more action to improve public transport, improve the energy efficiency of homes and to invest in Green skills for the jobs of the future. As well as the actions that can be taken locally, we need Government to rise to the challenge of global climate change, in the way they addressed the banking crisis and the Covid pandemic\n“Keir Starmer’s refusal to ‘turn on the spending taps’ and Rachel Reeves’s comments on Labour’s commitment to fiscal rules over climate action have made it clear that whether the Conservatives or Labour receive a majority from the next general election, pressure on council budgets will continue. Therefore as a council we need to be focused on what we can do locally.”\nGleadless Valley Green Cllr Paul Turpin says,\n“More could be done by the Council and the South Yorkshire Mayor to invest in the Green jobs and skills that will provide secure employment for local people for years to come.\n“The Council has allocated £3.5 million to invest in local renewable energy projects. We need to see how this will be implemented to provide Sheffield with secure and stable energy prices.\n“Sheffield City Council could raise funds by establishing Green Bonds to lever in finance from the community. West Berkshire Council raised over £1 million on its first Green Bonds issues. This helped improve the energy performance of schools by installing solar panels and supported active travel and tree planting projects. (5)\n“The council could have an advertising policy which does not support high carbon industries and products harmful to people and nature.\nHillsborough Cllr Christine Gilligan-Kubo, Deputy Chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Committee said,\n“We could implement a workplace parking levy to leverage funding for active and public transport at comparable levels to Nottingham City Council, who raised around £680 million over 10 years; (6)\nBrian Holmshaw, Green councillor for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale, said,\n“The Green Party believes that all Policy Committees on the Council should have action plans to deliver targets to reduce their emissions and should report any increases. We need to be committed and relentless in our action to address climate change. Not only will this mean we have a clean and stable environment, it will also mean warm homes, secure jobs and cleaner air.”\nReferences\n- annual_climate_action_report_2022-23_executive_summary.pdf (sheffield.gov.uk)\n- Pathways to Zero Carbon in Sheffield – Arup\n- Tyndall Centre – Sheffield Report – Draft.pdf\n- PowerPoint Presentation (sheffield.gov.uk)\n- West Berkshire Community Municipal Investment (CMI) – West Berkshire Council\n- Ten years on: Nottingham’s Workplace Parking Levy keeps the city moving ahead – Transport Nottingham",

(1)\nGreen Party Deputy Leader Angela Argenzio said,\n“I’d like to thank the Care Quality Commission for their report and highlighting areas of concern.\n“The performance of the NHS Walk In Centre cannot be viewed in isolation from the under-resourcing of the wider NHS family.\n“With people finding access to their own GPs more difficult, especially personal appointments and with long waiting times at Accident and Emergency Departments, there is a knock-on effect on well used services like the NHS Walk-In Centre. In many ways the Centre acts as the canary in the coal mine, showing, through increased demand, the pressures that exist in the NHS as a whole.\nThe Green Party recognises the value of the Walk-In Centre which is why we have campaigned to keep it open. We also need to work with the NHS and the Council to see how we can improve the service and lobby for the funding it needs to be effective.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group said,\n“The finding that the Walk-In Centre is understaffed and overstretched should be no surprise after 13 years of Tory austerity and the creation of a health “market” by the previous Labour government.\n“A truly meaningful response to this judgement would be to properly fund the NHS. Viewing the performance of the NHS Walk-In Centre in isolation at best gives an incomplete picture and at worst completely ignores its relationship with other health services. Demand for services at the Centre would be a lot less if everyone in the city had good access to their own local doctors.\n“To respond to the CQC, we need to look not just at how we can improve the Walk In Centre but also how we can get the Government to recognise that all the customer-facing parts of the NHS should be funded and resourced properly to keep people out of hospital.”\nNotes\n(1) CQC Report into the NHS Walk-In Centre\nUrgent – 1-361166596 Sheffield City GP Health Centre (26/07/2023) INS2-15322122231 (cqc.org.uk)",

I was, until recently, a Green councillor for Walkley and Upperthorpe. I’ve retired through ill health. Tackling inequality is one of the main political objectives of the Green Party.\nWe all know what a scam looks like. But does our new chancellor, Rachel Reeves? Her claim that the 20 billion hole in public finances it creates is a surprise, is absurd. Utterly absurd!\nTo claim that she only just had sight of the figures that are prepared by the Department of Budget Responsibility every year for the last 40 years is not believable. What the hell was Labour doing when it was in opposition? Was it not scrutinizing what was going on, where the money was going?\nObviously, no, I knew about it. But I’m just an ordinary bloke. And now we have the Labour Party saying it can’t afford to scrap the Two Child Benefit Cap.\nAs was said earlier, we are the sixth richest country in the world. Our country has £15 trillion, over £15 trillion in wealth, in the hands of the very richest. We cannot put up with this. It’s outrageous. Yet, our compliant media, government, and big finance are giving away their pretence of having a moral compass. They no longer question what’s going on. So how could a government pay for decent public services, tackle inequality, and face head-on the climate and nature emergency?\nSo I’m going to quote from a report called the Taxing Wealth Report, produced by accountancy Professor Richard Murphy of Sheffield University. It’s called the Taxing Wealth Report and is highly recommended. It was produced before the General Election in the run-up to the General Election to challenge politicians, to say this is how we can have better public services. Up to £30 billion a year could be cancelled in terms of interest payments to the Bank of England.\nThe net benefit of that change would be over 20 billion a year, £20 billion. Would that make a difference? Of course, it would. If would end child poverty and the Two Child Benefit Cap. It will allow us to pay the whole of the backlog of pay due to junior doctors and restore their confidence in the National Health Service. So those doctors do not leave this country to go to Canada, Australia, or elsewhere.\nIt would allow us to pay for the special education needs of every young person at school, primary or secondary, across the whole of the UK. It would end the Bedroom Tax. It would restore most of the payments due to those with disabilities. These were lost during the period of the Tory government. It could restore the services provided by local government.\nHaving been a councillor, I have fought for the last three years to try and get decent public services for people in my ward, and it was very, very difficult to explain to people why on earth this was happening. £20 billion is a lot of money. It would mean a real change to the way our economy is run and our services are supplied. And right now it’s all going to the banks and it makes no sense at all.\nShould they, and the most wealthy be enriched at the cost to the people of this country who need government services. Services that enable people to enjoy a full life as part of their community.\nI’m a member of the Green Party, we don’t think so. Do you?\nThank you.",

We need more Green voices in Parliament to put the Climate Emergency at the heart of government decision-making.\n“I want a government that works for everyone, with policies focused on equality, where people’s basic need for a secure home is met. Carbon reduction policies are about creating excellent public transport, renewable energy, locally sourced sustainable food production, healthier and greener urban environments, a switch from consumer culture to a zero-carbon, zero-waste one. As these positive changes take effect, we will see improvements in health and wellbeing.\n“The Climate Crisis is frightening, but it also presents an opportunity. We have an urgent choice to make: we can rapidly implement zero-carbon policies which will improve everyone’s quality of life, or we can continue to allow large corporations and the super-rich to use up the Earth’s resources until there’s nothing left.”\nOriginally, from Royston, near Barnsley, Alison is a trained clinical psychologist and family therapist and worked in the charitable sector in Australia.\nWhen she was 25, she read “The Limits to Growth” and this started her interest in environmental politics. In 1996, she completed a master’s research project on people’s response to the climate crisis and found others shared her concerns.\nWhen she returned to the UK in 2013, Alison made a decision that she wanted to get involved with the only party that is serious about action on the environment.\nAlison was first elected as a Nether Edge & Sharrow councillor in 2016. She was re-elected in 2018 by a very large majority, reflecting her excellent reputation for hard work and personal integrity both in the ward and more generally.\nAlison has campaigned on climate change, social justice and for a People’s Vote on Brexit. She has been at the forefront of the street trees campaign, including the attempt by the Labour council to jail her.\nMamie Shafi, chair of Nether Edge & Sharrow Green Party, said,\n“Alison has shown through her actions as a local councillor in Nether Edge and Sharrow since 2016 that she is an effective and engaged representative who puts the needs of the people first. She has a reputation for standing up to people in power and holding them to account.”\nIn 2019, she stood as a Green Party candidate for the European Parliament, playing a strong role in getting Magid Magid elected as an MEP.\nMagid Magid, MEP, praised her, saying,\n“Sheffield Central deserves an MP who is not only grounded in the community but also has a wealth of experience in grassroots campaigning and activism. Alison has shown time and time again that she puts people before anything else. She has a heart of gold and I couldn’t think of anyone more suitable to represent the wonderful people of Sheffield Central than her”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

I missed the first hour covering the decision to approve a 38 storey tower on Rockingham St with tiny 4.5 metres square living spaces. I was there for 2 big decisions which will have a massive impact in and around Hillsborough.\nFor the Lidl store at the bottom of Stannington Rd next to the Malin Bridge gyratory, Planning officers offered reassurance on the impacts from traffic modelling undertaken. A Labour councillor who lives in Walkley offered a helpful, real world overview of the nightmare reality of traffic jams in and around Malin Bridge familiar to many. Green Cllr Peter Garbutt cast the only vote against as the application was approved.\nNext was the mixed development, including an Aldi store, on Penistone Rd on vacant land opposite Hillsborough football ground. In the real world every high street retailer and shopping centre wonders whether they have a viable future. But, looking at the cumulative impact of both applications, Planning officers outlined a thriving Hillsborough District Shopping Centre according to statistical analysis. Can it really take the £13.55 million annual hit outlined in the officer’s report and survive? Can Catch Bar Lane and Halifax Road local centres really lose 25% of their business and survive?\nMore than 5 hours into the meeting, I think 8 committee councillors remained to vote. At least 3 other councillors had wandered off during the meeting without any explanation from the Chair. With one eye on the clock after a far too long agenda, I was the only member of the public left to witness the final vote following a rushed process. Green Cllr Peter Garbutt abstained with enough others clearly going to approve the application – as they voted to do.\nOn May 7th you can turn around a broken democracy in Sheffield. You can vote for change in the Sheffield City Council governance citywide referendum. You can vote in council elections to end the Labour majority and create a “No Overall Control” council.

The decision of the Licensing Committee today (10/10/17) means the event nights run by CADS, the social enterprise, can now go ahead at their new venue at Eagle Works in Attercliffe.\nThe Council had objected to the club holding events because it is near the Outokumpu rod mill which handles large volumes of dangerous chemicals. However, Cllr Johnson argued that the stainless steel manufacturing business was operating safely.\nHis comments to the Licensing Committee are below:\nI fully support CADS, a social enterprise, in its ventures. The organisation has brought many regeneration benefits through its business in bringing disused buildings back into productive and enjoyable use. I am pleased they have expanded from their initial base at Smithfield, Shalesmoor to Exchange St shops, Waverley House, the Abbeydale Picture House and the Eagle Works on Stevenson Road, Attercliffe, where they intend to hold temporary events.\nEagle Works is close to Outokumpu’s rod mill, a long-standing business producing high quality stainless steel products. The mill uses large volumes of acid, including hydrofluoric acid, to clean black scale from hot-rolled products. It complies with the appropriate licences from the Environment Agency. Its public information leaflet makes clear that only “non-fuming” grades of acid are on site and, in a spillage, “very little acid vapour would be generated and its effects will be localised.”\nOutokumpu’s position is that “Outokumpu Stainless Ltd fully supports the establishment of new commercial ventures within our operating neighbourhood and we are more than happy to support the CADS organisation’s planned events within the Eagle Works.”\nIn supporting CADS, I want to recognise that Outokumpu confirms it manages its safety risks well: there have been no major incidents since the plant began these operations in the mid-1990’s. Whatever the theoretically possible risks, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest refusing this licence.\nHealth and safety is an important issue that workers have fought for over many decades. But it is undermined by scare-mongering about unrealistic risks.\nI hope the committee will support a progressive and industrious Sheffield business by granting the licence.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

They aim to reduce through-traffic in residential streets to encourage people to walk, cycle or use public transport. People who need to drive to their homes or visit friends can still drive to homes in an LTN.\nThey open up networks of streets so people can safely travel through the area on foot, bicycle, using wheelchairs or by bus. They can also create spaces to play and to socialise.\nReducing motor traffic, reduces air pollution, noise pollution and road collisions and makes the character of residential streets more pleasant, inclusive and safer for people to walk and cycle.\nMaking space on our streets is key to achieving cleaner air and a lower carbon footprint whilst building healthier, safer and more resilient communities.\nMany car journeys in Sheffield are under a mile and these short distances can easily be walked or cycled if people feel safer on their streets.\nRemoving existing LTNs and cancelling funding for future schemes is not harming the freedom of motorists.

A letter from Environment Secretary Michael Gove called upon the Council to immediately cease its felling programme and begin talks with local residents and campaigners. [1]\nCommenting on the development, Natalie Bennett said,\n“Sheffield Greens welcome Defra’s intervention, and we are delighted that the British government is siding with tree campaigners.\n“This latest development highlights how the Council’s blinkered and relentless tree felling is a story of national embarrassment for our city. This Labour administration are responsible for Sheffield now being known globally as the city where they cut down trees.\n“Contrary to what the Council claim, their disastrous and ill-fated tree felling programme is not supported by residents, does not make Sheffield a greener or safer city, and is completely and utterly unnecessary.\n“We hope that this latest intervention from a growing list of backers to the Save Sheffield Trees campaign – including charities, celebrities, journalists and local media, and of course thousands of Sheffield residents – will force the Council to abandon the felling of healthy street trees and get round the negotiation table with campaigners”.\nSheffield City Council have since released a statement in response to the letter, in which they falsely claimed multiple ‘inaccuracies’ in the story, and attempted to shift blame for the situation back onto local residents and onto the government itself. [2] Green Councillor Alison Teal, who along with two other campaigners is currently subject to a court case brought against her by the Council for peacefully protesting against the felling programme, commented on the Council’s response,\n“In their reply to this demand from the Government to stop the felling, the Council continue to misinform the public. Mr Gove has no more access to the PFI contract than I do, and to suggest that a majority of Sheffield residents are indifferent to the felling programme is nonsense. I receive email complaints almost daily, and thousands of residents have joined the Save Sheffield Trees campaign to object to the fellings.\n“Despite the best wishes of a blinded and untrustworthy administration, unscientific survey figures are fooling no-one, and cannot make this serious issue go away. The Council leadership must reappraise their attitude rather than riding roughshod over the community they are elected to serve.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This was debated at the Council’s Strategy and Resources Committee on 19/6/23.\nHere is Green Group Leader Councillor Douglas Johnson’s response to that apology.\n“I welcome the report of Sir Mark Lowcock, this council’s formal response to it and the detailed and thorough apology given to the citizens of Sheffield for the way the council treated them over many years.”\n“When Cllr Alison Teal and I negotiated the holding of an inquiry into the council’s handling of street trees, it was done in our knowledge of the real harm and upset caused to so many people in the city from the loss of magnificent trees, in many case, the very best physical things on the streets where they lived. Residents expressed this hurt eloquently and in detail at a very early stage of the tree-felling campaign.\n“Sir Mark Lowcock agrees those expressions should have been heeded. There were many voices that should have been heeded at the time.\n“In 2021, the context of setting up the street tree inquiry was that the council had already changed dramatically. It was immediately after the governance referendum where the people of Sheffield resoundingly voted for a change in the way the council was run. The ruling group had lost its overall majority control of the council such that the parties now had to work together.\n“The Lowcock report has exposed truths that are uncomfortable to some but which are absolutely the vital issues that demonstrated how the council got things so wrong for so long.\nIn the 2 years since then, the council has changed incomparably, with a near-total change of senior leadership at both political and officer levels. More to the point, this has triggered a welcome change in culture.\n“That is not to say that things are perfect – or even acceptable – in all cases. There is a lot more to do. However, the progress leading up to today’s apology reset the trajectory of the council’s future. That is something that the residents of Sheffield who became involved in campaigns over many years should be able to take credit for.”",

My family enjoy exercise with our dog and pass through the area frequently as it is the most direct and pleasant route for pedestrians to access amenities at Crystal Peaks. Last weekend my children enjoyed this space during the Covid-19 lockdown for a school project that involves nature. Nowhere else locally would we have found such an array of specimens without driving.\nThe impact on wildlife when the land was earmarked for construction in the 60’s might have been negligible. Now a developer has bought the land for a housing estate. The building work proposed on what is today a naturally rewilded biodiverse haven of life is a gross act of ecocide and is still being planned despite both parliament and the local council declaring a Climate Emergency. For over 20 years these fields have been left to nature, with self-set trees, beautiful wildflowers and grassland. They have become home to an extensive variety of birds, animals, and insects. Some are already depleted in England; many are constantly under threat from further development.\nIf Covid-19 is not a wake-up call to the urgency of protecting natural local green space, the flooding experienced in Sheffield in 2019 should be. Nature is a natural defence against flooding. Pouring concrete, tearing up trees and plants and overwhelming the defences you can visibly see when exploring the area will make us more vulnerable to the adverse weather conditions in our ever changing climate.\nSheffield City Council has stated previously that it wishes to build on Brownfield sites first. Yet this Greenfield space is under threat for hundreds of houses and car parking. This can only be a detriment to the wellbeing of current residents and add strain to local services, adding to the congestion on our roads. The residents need this natural space in an area that has already seen significant expansion in recent years.

I love how diverse the ward is and I am engaged with many community groups in all parts of the ward: in the nearly four years since being elected, I have supported the volunteer group BBEST to get their Neighbourhood Plan to the referendum stage and finally passed in 2021. I support the Hanover TARA in all their dealings with Sheffield City Council and I was instrumental in the publication of the report about the cladding of the Hanover Tower in 2020. I regularly support litter picks in Broomhill, Broomhall and Hunters Bar as well as attending as many community meetings as I can.\nSince being elected in 2019, I have been a member of various SCC committees: Health Scrutiny, Licensing and Audit & Standards. I am particularly interested in governance and finance so I am pleased to still be a member of the Audit & Standards committee. In the municipal year 2021-22, I was the Adviser to the Executive Member for Inclusive Economy and skills, taking particular interest in the skills and adult education side of the portfolio and concentrating on expanding the offer of training for green jobs in Sheffield.\nSince May 2022 I have been the Co-chair of the Adult Health & Social Care Policy Committee and a member of the Strategy & Resources Policy Committee. I am also the Deputy Speaker for the Green Group at Sheffield City Council.\nAs Co-chair of the AHSC Policy Committee, I have set the tone for our work ethics by co-chairing with a Councillor from another group and involving the deputy (from the third group) from the very start. The three groups have been involved in every single decision and we have made every single one by consensus. The AHSC Committee is often used as an example in SCC of how well the committee system can work despite the fact that we had to find the most savings for the 23-24 budget (47% of all SCC savings for the year)!\nI am a team player: I work extremely close to my ward colleagues, Brian and Maleiki. We speak to each other virtually daily and meet at least once a week. We share the workload and we always try to do our best to support our constituents.\nI also work closely with the whole Green Councillor Group and I am well respected by colleagues in other political groups.\nI am very proud of my record as a councillor: I work hard and I am totally committed to the role to ensure that we get the best outcomes for a greener future for the citizens of Sheffield. If elected again I will continue to work hard to ensure that we achieve climate and social justice for our citizens and close the inequality gap in the city. In my role as a councillor, I am most happy when I am able to help residents.”\nUpdated May 2023",

The Labour Council accused the Green representative of Nether Edge and Sharrow of breaching an injunction against peaceful tree felling protests in the city.\nCllr Teal denied breaking the terms of the injunction, and her innocence was confirmed by the Court without Alison even having to take to the witness stand. She is now calling for the Council to be held accountable for their expensive, politically motivated, and needless legal action against her and other Sheffield residents opposed to their tree felling programme.\nSpeaking after the case, Cllr Teal said,\n“I am of course delighted to be exonerated by the Judge, who was clear that I had not breached the terms of the injunction that he granted earlier this year.\n“But the case should never have been brought about. I have been and continue to be completely compliant with the terms of the injunction, and this was reflected in the quite frankly embarrassing and pathetic failed attempts by the Council’s 10 lawyers and two barristers to argue that I had. Further, I and the whole tree campaign have been consistently calling for dialogue and discussion with the Council, but they continue to be uninterested in talking to us.\n“Instead, the Labour administration prefer to waste enormous sums of money, time, and effort pursuing legal action and bullying tactics against those who oppose them, rather than sit down and talk to try and find a way forwards.\n“Sheffield City Council has spent a huge amount of taxpayers’ money attempting to convince the judge that I broke the injunction, assembling an enormous legal team with the aim of imprisoning me for something I did not do. I regret that they chose to take that needless, aggressive, and wasteful choice of action.”\nFellow Green Councillor Douglas Johnson, who supported Cllr Teal’s legal team, also commented,\n“We have seen no other cases where a local authority has sought an injunction and tried to imprison one of its own elected Councillors over a political dispute, which the court agreed was peaceful protest throughout. This action comes on top of the Labour Councillors voting Alison out of a full Council meeting, and complaints pursued against Alison by senior council officers.”\n“The court also heard how the Council had changed the words of the formal court order from what the judge actually ordered to what one officer described as ‘the spirit of the judgement.’ This attempt to mislead campaigners is dishonest and quite frankly disgraceful.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

For example, it is clear that Sheffield City Council will not meet their goals for de-carbonisation of our city by waiting for Central Government grants.

We opposed the Israeli state’s destruction of Gaza, the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory, and genocide. We opposed the flying of the Israeli flag above Sheffield Town Hall when Labour councillors insisted on it. We called for a show of solidarity by flying the Palestinian flag, when Labour opposed that. The Labour Leader has never supported the Palestinian flag. We called genocide for what it was – when Labour’s leaders, both locally and nationally, turned their backs on ordinary Palestinian people. They refused to acknowledge what we could all see on our TV screens, with Keir Starmer famously stating that Israel “does have that right” to cut off supplies of food, water and medicine.\nOur anger at turning a blind eye to human rights abuses does not stop us from welcoming Labour’s belated support for the Green council motions, such as those calling for a ceasefire, ending the arms trade and calling for a peace process. We are pleased these were passed by the full council in November 2023.\nWe welcome the fact that other councils, including Bristol City Council, Manchester City Council, Waltham Forest and Tower Hamlets (amongst others) have all successfully passed motions calling for their respective pension funds to divest from supporting the illegal occupation of Palestine, and from weapons manufacturers and fossil fuel companies.\nWe have become aware that Labour’s Cllr Fran Belbin has written on behalf of her Group to claim that our motion is “misleading and impractical.” We don’t think it is. In fact, all council motions are checked by senior officers of the council for such errors before being published. We take account of these rulings.\nFor instance, we removed the reference to Barclays Bank specifically, so that the motion calls for a change to the council’s ethical procurement policy in order to address any and all companies which finance states in breach of international court rulings, arms companies and fossil fuels.\nWe have written to Cllr Belbin to challenge what she says. We have asked her to back up the Labour Group’s comments with proof that the law stops councillors on the pensions authority from opposing investments in Israel, arms companies and fossil fuel companies.\nSouth Yorkshire Pensions Authority is made up of 12 councillors from across South Yorkshire and is responsible for where investments of its members’ money are held. At present, this includes the Israeli government, weapons manufacturers and fossil fuel companies.

It was to recognise that, for a city to be sustainable and live within its carbon means, high-density, city centre living must be made to work.\nI am pleased to see this is now being progressed through the council’s application to the Housing Infrastructure Fund for expansion of housing in Neepsend and Attercliffe.\nThis line no longer needs to be in our budget amendment.\nBut the expansion of renewable energy does. This is becoming more critical as the planet edges forwards towards an uncertain future of global warming. That’s why we are offering half a million pounds for energy efficiency schemes on maintained schools. We are proposing a million pounds on solar panels for council homes.\nNot only does this address climate change and energy security, but makes a real difference to council tenants’ fuel bills.\nWe are looking forward to future homes that are good to live in.\nThat’s why we also propose funding to bring more empty homes back into use and for stronger enforcement of disrepair in the private rented sector.\nWe are also looking forward to the future of transport in the city. We simply cannot expect to keep bringing more cars into the city centre with short-term plans to widen the inner ring road.\nOur reforms of parking prices and our proposals for a workplace parking levy would encourage people to switch towards public transport to get to work but would protect residents through lower prices for parking permits in residential zones.\nWe would even extend this to councillors – no more car parking claims please!\nWe are proposing a million pounds for proper, segregated cycle lanes. We really need to make cycling work in this city – and it doesn’t at the moment.\nWe would also bring back the FreeBee bus.\nMy colleague, Cllr Teal, has innovative ideas to address the growing issue of mental wellbeing of school children – but it is better if you hear from her directly on that. Cllr Rivers knows a lot about knife crime and young people but we need more people to act on this vital issue. We are proposing more PCSOs but also new posts of Safer Neighbourhood Officers.\nOur budget amendment creates 33 new jobs, a net gain of 26. We would have a new member of paid staff in each branch library; we would have new officers working on heritage, cycling and planning enforcement; we would reverse Labour’s cut to advice centres in the voluntary sector – now is not the time to be cutting these services, as they help people in desperate situations cope with universal credit and PIP.\nWe would have a new officer working on sustainability, helping everyone improve their lives and, by acting together, making a big contribution towards the reduction of plastics and better food-growing. We would have more trees. And these are ones you can eat, with a programme of tree-planting in parks and open spaces across the city. These would be distributed through the wards, according to need. Equally, we would boost the funding available to neighbourhoods through the ward pots.\nIt is of course traditional for the Greens to call for a cut to the Chief Executive’s pay. But we make a serious point about fairness and inequality with our aim to bring pay within the council inside a range of ten to one.\nOur budget is a proposal for the future. The improvements in people’s lives don’t just stop in this forthcoming financial year. In each future year after that, our proposals today would generate almost a million additional pounds for essential social care.\nAnd moreover, the Green budget proposes webcasting of all these meetings. We look forward to this beginning in April but our proposal goes further and would extend this to the full range of committees with public meetings, so that when the Greens are running the Administration, you will be able to see what we are doing.\nI therefore recommend that all councillors vote for these proposals.\nSheffield Green Party’s budget press release\nDownload Sheffield Green Party’s full budget amendment (pdf)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

But it makes clear sense to keep both at their current locations which have good transport links from across the city. Not move them to the Northern General, which Sheffield Save Our NHS (SSONHS) rightly says is not “an accessible or acceptable alternative for people in other parts of Sheffield.”\nThe online consultation forces to you to choose one of a number of unacceptable options throughout – keeping the current locations is not offered.\nWhat is the point of a consultation that doesn’t let you comment on the main proposals?\nThe suggestion that the proposed changes will mean simpler and less confusing service options for users has no obvious basis.\nSSONHS sums up the situation well for the Minor Injuries Unit. It is “an effective and much valued service with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Many of us have used it ourselves.” My family have used it along with 18,000 people annually at the Hallamshire.\nSheffield Green Party has been helping SSONHS to collect signatures for their petition opposing the MIU’s closure.

Cuts to VAT would help homeowners, landlords and social housing providers make improvements which reduce energy bills and make houses more environmentally friendly.\nCouncillor Johnson said,\n“This is just one of those simple tax changes that just makes sense. The current system encourages developers to build new homes rather than renovate existing homes.\n“It’s just wrong that property developers are given a big incentive to destroy fine old buildings like the Old Coroner’s Court and replace them with bog-standard blocks of flats instead of a decent refurbishment.\n“That’s one reason why I support the new heritage strategy for the city of Sheffield, developed by the Joined Up Heritage Sheffield community. To quote the architect Carl Elefante, ‘The greenest building is… the one that is already built.\n“We know there is a climate crisis and the challenges of the last twelve months mean we are now facing an employment and skills crisis.\n“The investment we are talking about will make tens of thousands of homes cheaper to live in and less damaging to the environment. It would also create thousands of worthwhile, stable jobs at a time when we need to help people get back into work.\n“Our Councils in South Yorkshire can do more to ensure our existing social housing is cheaper to heat and healthier to live in. This isn’t just good for the environment, it is good for the economy with less money being spent on energy bills and more being spent in local shops.”\nMolly Scott Cato, a former MEP, said:\n“Retrofitting is the most carbon-efficient way to provide Green homes for everybody, rather than focusing on building more new houses, which are far more energy intensive, and many people can’t afford anyway.\n“The construction industry currently produces 40% of our total emissions, yet current VAT regimes benefit new builds over refurbishments, and this has got to change.\n“During a climate crisis, we need to incentivise the most effective ways to reduce emissions and provide everybody with a warm secure home. The government has the ability to decide now if it wants to benefit all of society, or if it wants to continue prioritising big business at the expense of everybody else.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Candidate Alison Teal is a councillor in Nether Edge & Sharrow ward and was in the front line of the street trees campaign. Alison’s commitment to stand up with residents led to arrest and an injunction, with the Council’s Labour Administration applying to the High Court to have her jailed before campaigners won a moratorium on tree felling.\nAlso standing in Sheffield constituencies are Christine Gilligan Kubo (Brightside and Hillsborough), Natalie Thomas (Hallam) and Paul Turpin (Heeley).\nAlison Teal was second on the Green Party list of candidates in the European elections when Magid Magid was elected as an MEP for Yorkshire & the Humber in May. Magid comments: “Sheffield Central deserves an MP who is not only grounded in the community but also has a wealth of experience in grassroots campaigning and activism. Alison has shown time and time again that she puts people before anything else. She has a heart of gold and I can’t think of anyone more suitable to represent the wonderful people of Sheffield Central than her.”\nAlison Teal comments: “A lot has changed here since the last general election in 2017. Labour face losing control of the council next May after Greens comfortably beat them in council elections last May in Sheffield Central and across the city in the European elections this May. I can win this seat and join the amazing Green MP Caroline Lucas.\n“I live in this constituency with its diverse, vibrant mix of residents and students who are tolerant and inclusive. An overwhelming majority voted Remain and Greens trust the public to have a final say on Brexit in a People’s Vote.\n“From Abbeydale Rd to Hunter’s Bar, across to Hillsborough Corner, we all suffer in traffic jams and air pollution. The Labour-run council “declared” a climate emergency in February but nothing’s happened. Greens will put climate crisis action at the heart of all decision-making.\n“Greens have always opposed the privatisation of our NHS, schools and council services – like the Streets Ahead Highways PFI deal that Labour and the Lib Dems negotiated. I will work hard to protect a publicly-funded NHS that promotes health and well-being for everyone in the city, wherever they live.”\nChristine Gilligan Kubo has stood in the last 3 elections in Brightside & Hillsborough. Christine comments: “I’m a lecturer in Responsible and Ethical Business practice and non-executive director of Sheffield Renewables. I will support the rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, creating new green jobs that make the most of the manufacturing skills in this constituency. It is vitally important that, whatever the outcome of Brexit, workers’ rights and environmental protections are maintained.”\nNatalie Thomas has a long-standing commitment to environmental causes. Natalie comments: “In the 1990s, I stood on the front line to save our country’s landscape against open-cast mines and the road-building programme. I want to replace Jared O’Mara and will work hard to restore strong, responsive representation to Hallam constituents, inspired by the work of the brilliant Green MP, Caroline Lucas.”\nPaul Turpin was elected as the first Green councillor in Gleadless Valley ward with a 919 vote majority. Paul has a reputation as hard-working community leader who holds the Labour-run administration to account. Paul comments: “I’m deeply involved in the Heeley community and will stand up for decisions made as locally as possible, genuinely protecting our environment and fighting for our future.”\nNotes\n- Alison Teal feature in the Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/27/sheffield-councillor-cleared-of-breaching-tree-felling-order\n- Candidate profiles and pictures can be viewed at https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/elections/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

but will promote energy efficiency schemes in maintained schools by use of £500,000 unallocated New Homes Bonus funding;\n(21) will create further jobs by setting aside a further £500,000 unallocated New Homes Bonus funding to identify and survey brownfield sites for re-use for new housing and business, so as to minimise the impact of new building on the green belt or those brownfield sites that provide particular benefits to wildlife or the local community;\n(22) will take steps to increase affordable housing in the city by funding a pilot project of a small number of energy-efficient “container homes”, such as those already being pioneered at Heeley City Farm;\n(23) will create an additional officer post to bring empty homes back into use in order to tackle the blight and waste of empty houses, increase housing supply with far less energy consumption than new building and generate revenue through council tax and New Homes Bonus;\n(24) will fund an additional post to help tenants and improve standards in the private rented housing sector;\n(25) will earmark at least £250,000 of Local Transport Plan funding for cycle lane schemes to provide protection for cyclists, thereby improving the numbers of Sheffield citizens cycling to work and contributing towards improved physical and mental health;\n(26) further, will ensure that all future Local Transport Plan spending is used only on sustainable modes of transport that do not have any adverse impact on air quality;\n(27) welcomes the new investment in replacing obsolete air quality monitoring stations and will further invest in public-facing visual displays to ensure the public can see and monitor the measure of air pollution affecting them in real time;\n(28) will invest in a small discretionary grant fund to encourage zero or low- emission taxi vehicles through the licensing system;\n(29) will develop proposals to introduce a workplace parking scheme, to improve air quality and generate additional long-term revenue to invest in the city’s public transport;\n(30) will reduce the price of residents’ parking permits to 2010 levels, by shifting the cost of parking in residential parking permit zones to non-residents, meaning that people living in some of the most congested and polluted areas of the city are not subsidising other transport services;\n(31) will promote health, activity and fun by funding outdoor gym equipment in the city’s parks;\n(32) will commemorate the very origins of a municipal authority for public health by providing the public with clean, fresh water through the provision of drinking fountains in the city centre and major parks, thereby reducing waste and litter from single-use disposable plastics;\n(33) will further tackle the scourge of disposable plastics by employing an officer (6 months) to develop schemes that minimise the Council’s use of single-use plastics across all its services;\n(34) will support the work of officers and businesses in the night-time economy by developing proposals around a night-time levy scheme to offer more policing and street-cleaning, in order to ensure high-value businesses make an appropriate contribution to social costs;\n(35) will, in addition, fund an extra eight Police Community Safety Officers to make people feel safer;\n(36) will recognise the importance, both culturally and economically, of the city’s heritage and will provide funding for a dedicated heritage officer;\n(37) will regenerate a flagship city centre shopping parade by offering empty shopfronts on Pinstone Street and Charles Street to independent Sheffield businesses, rent-free on a temporary basis;\n(38) recognises the hard work of Sheffield citizens who have highlighted the economic risks attached to fossil fuels and the need for Sheffield City Council to do business ethically; and welcomes the inclusion in its Treasury Management Strategy, of commitments not to hold any direct investments in fossil fuels or companies involved in tax evasion or grave misconduct;\n(39) therefore requests the Executive Director, Resources to implement the City Council’s Revenue Budget and Capital Programme 2018/2019 in accordance with the details set out in the reports on the Revenue Budget and Capital Programme now submitted, but with the following amendments:-\nRevenue Budget\n| Spending Reductions | £’000 | Spending proposals | £’000 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Remove Group Policy Officers (half year saving) | 73 | Exempt Young Care Leavers from Council Tax | 30 |\n| remove 4 further posts in HR | 189 | Reverse cut and increase ward pot funding | 41 |\n| Additional 20p on street parking charge | 369 | Reverse cuts to voluntary sector & advice work | 50 |\n| use of NHB for one-off costs | 115 | Webcasting Council Meetings | 21 |\n| Reverse cut to Museums & Theatres | 53 | ||\n| Additional Empty Homes Officer to bring empty properties back into use | 38 | ||\n| Additional post in Private Sector Housing | 27 | ||\n| Establish discretionary fund for grants to encourage zero or low-emission taxi vehicles | 5 | ||\n| Workplace Parking Levy Study | 25 | ||\n| Reduce Parking Permit Fees to 2010 levels | 298 | ||\n| Reduce Parking Permit Fees to 2010 levels | 298 | ||\n| Revenue costs for outdoor gym | 4 | ||\n| Drinking Fountains for City Centre – Maintenance | 8 | ||\n| Single Use Plastic Avoidance Study | 25 | ||\n| Late Night Levy Study | 25 | ||\n| Heritage officer | 44 | ||\n| Regenerate city centre shopping parade | 40 | ||\n| Savings – subtotal | 746 | Spending – subtotal | 734 |\nThe following savings schemes require the agreement of new contracts, or actions to be agreed with other bodies.

Politics must change and if there’s anything we’ve learnt in this current political climate is that, we must have the courage to do politics differently – people don’t want more of the same and the Green Party can deliver that change for Yorkshire and Humber, having so narrowly missed out on a European seat last time.\n“Remaining in Europe is crucial to us all, but particularly young people. They should have the right to freely move across 27 other European countries, to study, to work, to fall in love, to experience life and have their lives enriched by people from other EU countries working in their schools, colleges and universities and living in our communities.\n“As a loud and proud working-class black Muslim refugee millennial, I know I may not be the usual politician, I get that. But our region deserves a representative who will boldly act on the issues that matter to us such as climate emergency and tackle the poverty, inequality and discrimination sadly rife in our communities.\n“This is an exciting opportunity. We have a real chance to change the status quo and improve our lives. As Lord Mayor, I’ve been able to engage people and spaces other politicians haven’t been able to reach, while being an authentic ambassador for our region around the UK and the rest of Europe. I will shake things up, stand up to hate and champion a vision of hope”.\nAlison said:\n“In Yorkshire and Humberside we are known for speaking our mind, and the same values of truth, transparency and openness attracted me to join the Greens. We also share the values of social justice and equality. We must put communities and the environment ahead of private profit. “By investing in renewable energy, local food production, local businesses and manufacturing, we can create new jobs and strengthen our communities to adapt to Climate Change.\n“It is “Austerity”-supporting politicians in Westminster who have increased poverty in our region. The EU has invested heavily in areas of social and economic deprivation, and we need this vital funding to continue.\n“I’ve confronted state and corporate power head-on to stand up for my local community in the Sheffield trees campaign. I will do the same for the residents of Yorkshire and Humberside, who have rightly lost faith in stale old party politics. I am asking people to be bold, choose change, and let us show you what a difference Greens can make.”\nOther members of the list are: Louise Houghton, a prominent campaigner from South West Yorkshire; Cllr Lars Kramm from York, a lawyer specialising in environmental and European law and a former Green councillor in his native Germany, and Ann Forsaith from Leeds, a former co-chair of the Yorkshire and Humber Green Party.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

I am pleased he answered my question about how we can create a city that values public transport more than private transport. We are broadly in agreement concerning the measures necessary to do this. We need cheap, reliable, high-quality services that go where people want to go. To do this we need public control and decent funding for our bus, rail and Supertram systems and this urgently needs action from both Mayor Coppard and the Government. For a vision of what our transport system could look like please see GETSHEFFIELDMOVING.ORG.\nMike opposes 20mph zones in residential areas because he thinks they cause more pollution. This is not the primary reason campaigners want 20’s plenty zones. The main reason is to reduce death on our roads. Compared to other similar cities Sheffield has particularly shocking statistics. With 10-12 under 16 casualties a year, Sheffield has a worse record than nearly all the other metropolitan areas. At 20 mph a child hit by a vehicle has a 90 per cent chance of survival, at 30 mph a child hit by a vehicle has only a 50 per cent chance of survival.\nJust like we changed the culture of wearing seat belts and smoking in public, we need to make it socially unacceptable to drive faster than 20mph in residential areas. In Sheffield, we have been very slowly rolling out more 20mph zones, but it would be preferable to tackle this on a city-wide basis. Mike is right that boy racers (and they are usually males) are a particular problem and these need to be tackled by the police. Some of our Councillors have been out with the police to see how they go about this. Those who are caught should be made to make reparations to the community they have endangered.\nThe science on whether driving at 20mph or 30 mph leads to more pollution depends on how people drive. Studies that find that 30mph is less polluting are due to the aggressive driving of some people in 20mph zones who brake heavily at speed bumps rather than just maintaining a steady but safe speed. What is very clear is that if you drive carefully, anticipating hazards well in advance so you avoid sudden braking and aggressive gear changing you can save fuel, money and emissions. This is a triple win, better for safety, better for the environment and better for your pocket! Even greater savings can be made if you walk or cycle!\nResearch in Germany has shown that the greater the speed of vehicles in built-up areas, the higher the incidence of acceleration, deceleration, and braking, all of which increase air pollution. Traffic calming reduces idle times by 15%, gear changing by 12%, brake use by 14%, and petrol use by 12%.\nTo me, the Green transport vision makes so much sense. Fewer deaths and casualties from road accidents and asthma, less obesity as more people walk and cycle, cleaner cities, fresher air, public transport so good you don’t need to bother owning a car, streets where kids can play rather than being clogged with parked cars. What is not to like?\nGraham Wroe\nSheffield Green Party",

Employers offering more than 10 parking spaces pay a fee of £1.17 per day per parking space. There are exemptions for local emergency services, NHS frontline staff and blue badge holders”.\nIn Nottingham, the Workplace Parking Levy on employers has raised more than £9 million each year, with the revenue used to fund tram infrastructure, a smart card scheme, electric buses and cycling facilities.\n“Nottingham has had great success with their scheme. Leicester is looking to follow suit. Legislation in Scotland could see similar schemes across the whole country. So let’s start to transform our city into a quieter, safer, less polluted, less congested one”\nGreen Councillor Martin Phipps, who also represents the City Ward, said:\n“How often do we hear requests for the tram to be extended? Thanks to the workplace parking levy attracting matched funding, Nottingham was able to double its tram network! Adopting a workplace parking levy is a real way to help achieve this in Sheffield.”",

Sheffield City Council policy on funding for nurseries meant that there was uncertainty over whether Middlewood Nature Nursery would be financially viable going forward.\nConcerned parents, who disputed OFSTED’s judgement, approached Hillsborough Ward Councillors who backed them, and intervened with the Council on their behalf to support their campaign.\nThe Funded Early Learning, provided for 2, 3 and 4 year olds, will now continue and Middlewood will be supported by Council Officers, through an action plan to address the points made by OFSTED. This should mean that when the Nursery is reinspected in July by OFSTED, their concerns will have been addressed.\nHillsborough Ward Councillor Toby Mallinson said,\n“I am overjoyed at the decision by the Council to maintain funding and to offer the needed support to Middlewood Nature Nursery. It is a very valuable asset to educational provision in Sheffield as demonstrated by the overwhelming parental support and the effective campaign they have run.\n“The nursery is one of the few Sheffield settings that follow a Forest School ethos which fosters a love for nature, enhances children’s confidence and independence, and promotes healthy development. We need more of these and need to grow those we have.\n“The whole Ofsted process has been a great shock to the nursery community, many of whom do not recognise much of the criticism in the disputed report. It is not the first time that concerns have been raised about consistency and fairness of Ofsted, particularly when inspecting settings that are not the norm. Let us hope that the nursery will now be able to move forward positively. I have been working hard to support the parents by liaising with council education officers for this outcome, and they have the full support of all three Hillsborough Ward Councillors.”",

I am currently a student here, but I also work locally as a chess tutor.\nEven in the two years living in Sheffield as a student, I have noticed significant safety and congestion problems on our roads. We need to build on schemes such as the Crookes Active Neighbourhood, but with more clarity and public engagement. It is unlikely to be successful without significant consultation. It is vital that we protect the lives and safety of children and other pedestrians and cyclists. With Sheffield being notoriously dangerous for children and cyclists, 20mph speed limits and safe, separated cycle lanes must be introduced alongside any active travel schemes. Such schemes cannot work alone and we need to find ways to support local buses in order to ensure that convenient transport options exist for everyone.\nAs a young person, I feel that I have a lot at stake in the planet’s future. This is part of the reason why I will do everything I can to protect nature and biodiversity and help everyone along through a rapid green transition involving more cycling and public transport, energy-efficient homes, and the creation of green jobs.

We listen to local communities and actively engage with them, working hard to improve people’s lives and offering support through the cost of living crisis.\nWe’re working to protect vital bus services and posted timetables on the new 31 route in October when Travel South Yorkshire failed to. We’ve offered doorstep help and advice during extended power cuts and flood risk emergencies. I gritted pavements during December’s big freeze.\nSupporting local communities: Christine supports S6 Foodbank at Winn Gardens and we hold monthly street collections for them at The Green Shop, Wadsley Lane. We founded the monthly S6 Community Litter Pick. We’re working to minimise impacts on local residents of matchdays and big events at Hillsborough Park.\nWe work with the excellent Hillsborough Together group supporting local businesses in tough times. We’re supporting vital Friends and Tenants groups, including Friends of Wisewood & District whose persistence helped deliver the Wisewood Park playground.\nActing on the Climate Emergency: Green councillors are pushing for urgent action as other parties drag their feet. Creating green jobs to properly insulate homes and reduce heating bills benefits us all. Clean air and safe streets create a better environment for our children.\nI promise to be a hard-working councillor who always puts the interests of local people and communities first.

The National Funding Formula (NFF) seeks to address long standing inequalities between different parts of the country but does not tackle the historic under-funding of Sheffield in comparison with similar places. Sheffield loses out massively compared to Liverpool, Birmingham, Nottingham and Manchester.\nNo fair funding formula can be fair if there is insufficient money in the system to fund it. The funding crisis could be eased if the government and local authority stopped outsourcing services and schools. We need to move back to an efficient model of running schools and colleges where local services are administered and provided citywide. Currently, every school has a Business Manager and administrative staff who manage individual contracts ranging from cleaning to Human Resources. This is very inefficient and expensive way to do things.\nAcademies are schools that have been outsourced away from the Local Authority. This adds needless, expensive, bureaucracy to the system with no, or questionable, educational benefits. A number have been closed down due to corruption. They often pay their top staff over-inflated salaries and perks. Unlike some other political parties, the Greens would abolish Academies and bring all state schools under Local Authority control.\nAnother way to redirect money to actually educating children would be by cutting or scrapping the constant testing and all the bureaucracy and expense linked to it. Instead of education for exams, we could be preparing our children for life, abolishing the baseline tests, SATS, and restoring more accurate and less stressful continuous assessment for sixth formers. That would also stop many de-motivated teachers from leaving the profession and help improve the mental health and education of our children.\nPeter Garbutt\nSheffield Green Party\nSign the petition at https://www.change.org/p/fair-fund-for-sheffield-schools\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Green Party councillors are now limited to submitting just 4 motions a year. By contrast, the Labour group has given themselves two motions every month, in addition to their control over all the other outlets of the council.”\n“This is a twisted approach to democracy.

It is absurd to build on greenfield sites like Owlthorpe just because it was set aside for car-driven urban sprawl in the 1960s.\n“Once again, this situation need not have come about if the council had an up-to-date local plan where Owlthorpe could have been respected for the greenfield site it is.”\nBrian Holmshaw, who addressed the meeting,\n“A powerful and far-reaching decision.

But until we have parity between physical & mental health resourcing we cannot say that there’s parity of esteem.\n“The latest statistic I have had says that 92% of resources are for physical health, only 8% for mental health. (1) I would be very interested to see how colleagues in the Labour group intend to challenge the new Government on this issue or if they just go along with whatever narrative the Government will spin to excuse their lack of political will to do the right thing”\nCity Ward Cllr Martin Phipps said\n“ For many people work takes up a large portion of their lives, which is why it’s so important that mental health and wellbeing is valued properly in work.\n“As we know, local government level finances are unsustainable, and this comes with its own stresses and pressures on local government employees. This is why in our amendment we called for sustainable funding for local government.\n“One of the biggest issues with mental health support is the lack of accessibility to NHS services. I looked at the CAMHS (Child, Adolescent Mental Health Services) waiting times and here in Sheffield Community CAMHS has an expected wait time of 130 weeks to get a first appointment. While that’s particularly bad, long waiting times for mental health support is a nationwide story.\n“One of the areas the Labour motion falls short is that it misses that the Parliamentary Labour Party now have the ability to make mental health financially equally valued to physical health – which is why we’ve added calls to government to make parity of funding a reality.\n“ This is really critical and underlies many of the conversations we’ve had around mental health and waiting times in health committees over years.”\nLabour voted against the sections of the Green amendment to write to the government to request parity of funding\nReferences",

As a party that places community at the heart of our policy it is no surprise that we agree with these demands.\nBan Bad Landlords:\nWe have long supported the tenants movement of which ACORN is a part and have called for city-wide licensing of rented properties in order to better protect tenants from bad landlords. We support the building of new social housing in order to tackle the housing crisis. This housing has to be built to a high standard with well insulated council homes, fitted with solar panels to keep resident’s energy bills low and help eradicate fuel poverty.\nBack Public Control of our Buses:\nGreens have been at the forefront of the campaign to bring buses into public hands and we fully support this campaign. Green councillors in Sheffield brought forward a motion in 2018 to put pressure on the City Region Mayor to use their powers to do this. We also support buses transitioning to producing zero carbon by 2030. This year Sheffield Green Councillors put forward proposals for a publicly owned, free, daily, electric city centre circular bus service (like the FreeBee buses in Manchester) This was rejected by the Labour led council. We support introducing a work-place parking levy that could subsidise public transport to keep it affordable and invest in active travel, such as free e-bike rental.\nDefend the right to protest and oppose the Policing Bill:\nWe are a party of non-violent direct action and we oppose any attempt to restrict peaceful protest. Our MP Caroline Lucas has been arrested for non violent direct action and we supported the successful non-violent protests against the unnecessary felling of Sheffield street trees. We unequivocally support the right to protest and oppose the Tory government’s Policing Bill that would restrict the democratic right to protest. The bill will also undermine action to tackle social issues such as systemic racism, misogyny and the climate crisis. Sheffield Green Party has felt the impact of attempts to curb peaceful protest locally, through the Labour led council’s use of draconian anti-trade union laws to wrongfully arrest its own citizens. We need to oppose any attempt to suppress our right to protest.\nEducate to end sexual and domestic violence:\nWe agree that there needs to be a cultural shift in order to protect women and girls from misogyny and male violence. Our deputy leader Amelia Womack has been leading the campaign to make misogyny a hate crime for many years and has stated that “The #metoo movement has underlined our need for a major culture shift, to change the way women are treated in our society.”\nWe are proud of the work that our local Green Party Peer Natalie Bennett is undertaking on the Domestic Abuse Bill, although we cannot end violence against women and children through legislation alone, the quality of our existing legislation is not sufficient. For example, we must end ‘no recourse to public funds’ for domestic abuse victims and properly fund and support services for people who experience domestic abuse or sexual violence.\nHouse All Rough Sleepers in Sheffield:\nWe would push for Sheffield City Council to pursue the ‘Housing First’ approach being implemented at pace by the Green-led administration in Brighton & Hove. By buying up empty housing across Sheffield and renovating it to house rough sleepers or people living in insecure, temporary housing (such as hostels) we could move to eradicate homelessness in the city. The action during the pandemic has shown that it is possible to house everyone and this is what we should aspire to achieve. Our national policy is that “nobody should be left homeless, and nobody should sleep rough on the streets, in the 21st century” and we would pursue this aim.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This is a real risk to Sheffield’s crumbling heritage.\n“I am therefore very pleased the new owner of the Old Town Hall has submitted plans to develop it and I’d like to offer a cautious welcome. To me, the idea of a souk – or indoor market in the basement of the Old Town Hall – is a really exciting prospect. It’s an excellent nod to the historic markets tradition of the Castlegate area.\n“The development also fits in well with the Green Party’s preferred approach to the development of Castlegate. We would like to see a thriving centre that is open to small and independent businesses, acting as a counterpoint to the big chain stores the council has attracted to the Heart of the City retail scheme.\n“The heritage aspects needs to be scrutinised closely but the prospects look good.\n“There is a deadline of 12 September to do this, unless the comment time is extended. You can see the plans and comment at: https://planningapps.sheffield.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=PWC4JINYK4S00”\nBrian Holmshaw said, “The Old Town Hall, under the previous owner, sat languishing unused and was a real downward drain on the feel of Castlegate.\n“The new owner does have a new and refreshing approach, but I have noticed that a lot of internal demolition is mentioned. It’s important to find out if this is later (1950s) dividing walls or Victorian ones moulded in plaster. There are five court rooms, some finer than others and I’m concerned that the attractive bespoke interior fittings to the court rooms and the benches in Courtroom 1 are being removed. The removal of fittings is central to the listing and the Friends of the Old Town Hall are encouraging online comments on these.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This city’s strong Yemeni community has been profoundly affected by a war that has resulted in the death of 85000 children under the age of 5 years.\nThe Green Councillors are proposing the council should go further and call for an immediate suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\nKaltum Rivers, Green Councillor for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale Ward, said,\n“The UK Government is contributing to a humanitarian crisis in Yemen through its support for the Saudi regime.”\n“It’s everyone’s business to safeguard children and it’s certainly our responsibility to question our government in their role of the deaths of Yemeni children.\n“This is not a scenario that is new to us; we have seen it in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. In illegal wars like this, children are the most vulnerable and affected. We must stand against this and question why our government is allowing Saudi Arabia to violate the rights of humans and in particular children in Yemen.”\nAlexi Dimond, of Sheffield Green Party, added,\n“The UK must end its support for the bombing and starvation of Yemen, stop supplying and repairing war planes, stop supplying bombs and ammunition, stop training Saudi pilots.\n“As well as the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi regime has executed over 100 people this year”.\nUpdate (28/01/2019)\nNotes\n1. The UK was responsible for selling Saudi Arabia $436 million worth of armaments in 2017, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. [Figures at 1990 values]\n2. Save the Children states that this has resulted in the death of 85000 children under the age of 5: https://www.savethechildren.org/us/about-us/media-and-news/2018-press-releases/yemen-85000-children-may-have-died-from-starvation\n3. Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT) states that June-September 2018 saw an estimated 164% increase in civilian deaths, with 500 people killed in just one nine-day period in August.\n4. The UK Government’s Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria states that the Government will not grant an export licence if there is a clear risk that the items might be used in the commission of a serious violation of international humanitarian law\n5. In October 2018 the foreign affairs representatives of the Green Party, SNP, Labour party, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, wrote to Jeremy Hunt, foreign secretary, calling for a full condemnation of Saudi Arabia’s “reckless and barbaric” behaviour, a suspension of arms sales for use in Yemen pending an investigation of alleged war crimes, a halt to UK military operations in Saudi, details of diplomatic representations made to Riyadh, and support for an independent inquiry into the fate of journalist Jamal Khashoggi: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/21/mps-press-hunt-to-take-action-against-saudis-over-khashoggi-affair\n6. Sheffield Green Party’s amendment adds the following to the council motion:\n(k) Notes that research shows the UK was responsible for selling Saudi Arabia $436 million worth of armaments in 2017, in a war which Save the Children estimates has resulted in the death of 85000 children under the age of 5.\n(l) believes that the Government should not grant an export licence if there is a clear risk that the items might be used in the commission of a serious violation of international humanitarian law.\n(m) Therefore resolves that this Council will write to the International Trade Secretary requesting an immediate suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Crookes and Crosspool Green Party’s Roy Morris, who submitted the objection, comments:\n“The applicants, Whitemoor Design Build have behaved deplorably and deserve to be named and shamed. Their actions included demolition of the community garden tended by volunteers, tree cutting in spring impacting nesting birds and the unsightly 8ft fence blotting the landscape. Responding to these actions has required the significant involvement of key workers, including police, during a national crisis.\nSave Cobden View Community Garden have done good work in compiling evidence to establish a Public Right of Way in use over past decades. This should now be fully verified by the council before any consideration of this application.\nOfficers need to seriously examine the need to scale this down to a 2 floor building to fit in with adjacent housing and limit overlooking. They also need to look at the Travel Plan which claims that “being in such a sustainable location, the development does not require off-street parking of vehicular access”. We know from experience this will not be the case. On-street parking is already over-stretched across this area of tightly packed terrace houses on a road that is a busy cut through from Crookes to the University and Hospitals. “\nNotes:\n- The planning application is 20/01651/FUL | Erection of mixed use development comprising three commercial units (use classes A1-A3) and 18 residential units (use class C3) in a 3/4 storey block and associated works | Land At The Corner Of Cobden View Road & Northfield Road Sheffield S10 1HP\n- The Save Cobden View Community Garden group submitted a 682 signature petition to Sheffield City Council Cabinet on July 15th.\n- The full Sheffield Green Party objection is:\nSheffield Green Party objects to this application. We are told “the site makes no positive contribution to the vitality and vibrancy of the area”. This ignores the bench, grassed area, flower bed and trees where the community planted, cultivated, played, rested, picnicked and crossed in their daily routine. The destruction of the green space has had a totally negative effect on the lives of people living near the site and the Crookes community as a whole.The applicants, Whitemoor Design Build have behaved deplorably and deserve to be named and shamed. Their actions included demolition of a community garden nurtured and cared for by volunteers, tree cutting in spring impacting nesting birds and then the unsightly 8ft fence blotting the landscape. These actions have required the significant involvement of key workers, including police during a national crisis.\nWe request that the Public Right of Way is fully verified before any consideration of this application noting the evidence of use over decades provided by the local community.\nWe note the concerns raised by neighbouring households about scale and overlooking. We request that officers examine in detail the need to scale this down to a 2 floor building for their amenity and to fit in with the scale of adjacent housing.\nWe note that the applicants are “happy to discuss any options for renewable energy generation that may be appropriate”. We suggest that council officers maximise this option via suitable conditions for the benefit of the city and the climate emergency we are in. We expect council officers to also mandate a suitable BREEAM rating to ensure the applicants can meet their claim that “the scheme in itself contributes to energy efficiency and carbon reduction by being a wholly sustainable form of development”.\nWe note “Being in such a sustainable location, the development does not require off-street parking of vehicular access”. We know from experience this will not be the case. On-street parking is already over-stretched across this area of tightly packed terrace houses on a road that is a busy cut through from Crookes to the University and Hospitals.\nIn a post-virus scenario, more people are likely to shun public transport. While Crookes has some good bus service access on Northfield Rd, routes and services changes are driven by the bus operators. Few people will have jobs in locations where they feel certain public transport and other active travel will meet their employment and personal needs. Assertions that “staff required for the commercial units will be sourced and recruited from the immediate vicinity with no requirement of a vehicle for commuting” clearly depend on what the commercial units are used for and the skills required.\nWe note that the applicants think car sharing is a good idea but no action is proposed as “It is perceived that private car use will be at a minimum.” We request that the travel plan proposals, including appointing a Travel Plan Coordinator, paying for travel passes and helping pay for bikes, are suitably conditioned with the Sheffield Council Travel Plan Officer ensuring they are fully discharged on behalf of the local community.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This is 15% of the money developers have to pay towards community facilities in local neighbourhoods. The majority of the funds are already centrally controlled by the Council.\nThe Greens’ response says:\n- The consultation is so flawed it should be abandoned\n- Neighbourhood funds should be spent at ward level, not centralised\n- The councillors from each ward should be responsible for making decisions on developments in their neighbourhoods.\n- The Council should do more to improve its efforts to tackle deprivation, poverty and inequality.\nGreen Councillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“This money is meant to benefit residents affected by big building developments. They have to put up with construction vehicles, noise and mud; parking obstructions and an increase in traffic; the loss of green space and open space; the loss of natural habitats, birds, plants and wildlife; restricted pavements and roads; increased anti-social behaviour; loss of views and light; and increases in litter and fly-tipping.”\n“These funds could mean improving small open spaces in the city centre, addressing traffic and parking arising from new developments or upgrading children’s play facilities in Sharrow and Highfield.”\n“Unfortunately, the Labour Administration wants to take this money away and reallocate it with a top-down directive.”\nGreen Councillor Martin Phipps added,\n“If the Council is really serious about using its funds to tackle poverty, then it could start by making sure that the centrally-controlled CIL is spent fairly.”\n“We challenge the Council to look again at its spending across the city and see how it relates to levels of deprivation.”\nDeclan Walsh, Green Party campaigner, said,\n“Greens want to see greater community involvement in decision-making while the Labour Administration seems keen to centralise.”\nRead the full Sheffield Green Party CIL consultation response (pdf)\nNotes\n- The Council’s consultation is at https://sheffield.citizenspace.com/communities-business-strategy/use-of-the-community-infrastructure-levy/\n- Sheffield Green Party’s response is available at CIL consultation – Sheffield Green Party Response (pdf)\n- The Council has collected £7.4 million in the CIL since 2015. Of this sum, £6.3m is spent by the Council’s Administration. The consultation only relates to the remaining £1.1m Neighbourhood Portion.\n- Of the £1.1m Neighbourhood Portion, over £330,000 has been generated from building work in City Ward, which has three Green councillors. City Ward includes the city centre, Kelham Island, Wicker and Highfield. The next highest sums have been collected from (in descending order) Nether Edge and Sharrow, Dore & Totley, Manor Castle and Walkley wards.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Well organised communities in Eckington, Woodsetts and Hartwell have resisted drilling in the past and are likely to resume the fight once the moratorium is lifted.\nThe experience of people in the Netherlands since fracking began there in 1963 shows there is good cause to fear fracking. Extraction of gas in the northern region of Groningen has caused thousands of earthquakes which have damaged homes and reduced entire neighbourhoods to disaster zones.\nAnd yet independent research published this month shows that neither fracking nor plans to increase North Sea oil and gas extraction will solve the current cost of living crisis or lower energy prices in the long term.\nNor will fossil fuel revenues guarantee the UK’s energy is secure by cutting the global price of energy. New chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng admitted this himself when he was Business and Energy Secretary but has now changed his tune.\nIn the meantime, the Government’s proposed £100bn-plus fund to cap energy bills may need to be repeated up until 2025. And who will pay for this? That would be us: UK tax payers.\nWorst of all, extracting fossil fuels will put at risk the UK’s shift to a low-carbon and sustainable economy and imperil the Government’s own legally binding climate targets.\nInstead of deepening our dependence on fossil fuel, we should cut carbon emissions and bring down energy costs by investing in insulating houses and ramping up renewable energy production. Experts believe this could have an impact within a year.\nIn a motion to Sheffield Council, Green councillors have proposed a Renewable Energy Strategy for Sheffield to increase the amount of energy produced from renewable technologies such as solar, wind and heat pumps.\nThis will not only help people and businesses reduce their fuel bills by using renewable energy in their own homes and buildings, but also create secure skilled jobs for local people.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that the transition to renewables is likely to have a “net economic benefit”. So the Government cannot claim the cost is too high while it allows the profits of fossil fuel giants to mount to obscene levels.\nCouncillor Christine Gilligan Kubo, Sheffield Green Party",

Air pollution contributes to the early deaths of 500 people every year in Sheffield It particularly affects young children and people with underlying respiratory conditions.\n“The Clean Air Zone means we support small businesses and taxi owners to upgrade their vehicles, to get older, dirty vehicles off the road and to clean up the city. There are exemptions for those who fall between the gaps. It forms part of the broader city centre strategy, including better public transport, better walking and cycling routes and better spaces for people to work, live and play.”\n“We believe this will end months of uncertainty for the taxi trade and give them a clear steer for the standards that will be expected for today’s taxi fleet.”\nSheffield Green councillors have continually stressed the need to support small businesses and taxi drivers to reduce their emissions, by offering grants and loans to upgrade their vehicles.\nOther cities have seen drops of up to 40% in some air-pollutants after introducing Clean Air Zones, along with drops in greenhouse gas emissions. Further steps towards introducing the CAZ include: the announcement of a grants scheme; a public consultation in November; the submission of revised plans to the council in the new year; and a charging scheme for polluting vehicles coming into force in 2022.\nNotes:\nA Category C Clean Air Zone (CAZ) will be introduced next year, using £24 million of central government funding to help local drivers convert to cleaner vehicles. Buses, taxis, vans, lorries and coaches which do not meet the Euro 6 diesel or the Euro 4 petrol emissions standard will be charged. Private cars and motorbikes will not be. The zone covers the inner ring road and city centre, including Park Square and the A61 / Parkway junction, and will be enforced using automatic cameras. Proposed charges are £10 a day for LGVs and taxis, and £50 a day for buses, coaches and HGVs.\nFunding will also be available to help local taxi drivers and businesses upgrade to electric or ultra-low-emissions (ULEV) vehicles. These include up to £10,000 grants for electric/ULEV wheelchair-accessible hackney carriages, up to £3,000 grants for local private hire taxi drivers up upgrade to electric or ultra-low emissions vehicles, and up to £3,500 grants for local businesses to upgrade to electric or ultra-low emissions vans.",

They provide a low-risk, low-return financial product, but they also encourage community engagement and contribute to projects to tackle climate change.\nA number of Councils from around the country have raised funding using Local Climate Bonds including West Berkshire District Council who used them to fund the installation of solar panels on Schools and also the London Borough of Hackney who intend to fund solar installations on schools and council housing. To date 12 Councils have issued Local Climate Bonds raising up to £1 million on each Bond issue.\nGreen Cllr Alexi Dimond, Deputy Chair of the Council’s Transport, Regeneration and Climate Committee said\n“I’m really looking forward to seeing Sheffield City Council issue its first Local Climate Bond. It will help fund projects to reduce carbon emissions and will help save the Council money in lower energy bills. This is money that can be used on other front-line services.\n“One of the advantages of Local Climate Bonds is that they are often cheaper than borrowing from other sources . This initiative is good for the planet but also the Council’s finances,\n“Funding is raised via a Crowdfunding Platform and people can invest as little as £5. This makes having a stake in positive projects to address climate change accessible to most local people .\n“Local Climate Bonds give people an opportunity to invest in action on climate change in their own community and providing them with a return on their investment,”",

After the successful referendum to abolish the anti-democratic “strong leader” or cabinet system where only 10 Councillors made all the decisions, in May 2022 Sheffield moved to a committee system, where all Councillors have a say.\nThere were then negotiations between the three largest parties resulting in a joint administration of Labour, the Lib Dems and the Green Party, with power shared proportionately by each, based on their respective number of councillors (39 Labour, 29 Lib Dem, 14 Green).\nThe Conservative and the one independent Councillor were not part of this agreement and not part of the administration.\nA politically proportionate committee system – with no Party currently having a majority on any committee – has meant for better policy to be made on a more transparent and consensual basis. Yes, there are things to be improved upon: there needs to be more engagement with local communities, experts and groups impacted by policies. However, the committee system is something to be strengthened and developed. It allows politicians to concentrate on common goals rather than argue about what they disagree on, especially at a time of tough financial challenges.\nThe biggest threat to the committee system and to a Council which makes good decisions would be a Labour majority in the current local elections. The recent deselection of their candidate for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale for comments they made “about the need for reform, greater accountability and transparency at the council off the back of the Sheffield tree inquiry“* is a warning that the current Sheffield Labour leadership has no intention of learning the lessons of the Tree Dispute.\nGreen Party Councillor for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale\n*Sheffield Star 6th April. https://www.thestar.co.uk/news/politics/sheffield-labour-local-election-candidate-deselected-over-tree-felling-comments-4095662\nFind out about your election candidates here.",

It is appalling that they have been forced to vote for strike action.\nThe Tory Government failed to properly fund the NHS for a decade, flip-flopped on funding training for new nurses, and have no long-term plan for health and social care. Short staffing and poor working conditions are piling pressure on the nurses who are left, leading many to leave the service. The NHS is filling the gaps with agency workers who cost up to £2500 a day. Patients who should be discharged are taking up hospital beds because there isn’t funding for enough carers to look after them at home. This is a crisis made in Westminster.\nThe British people, and particularly the wealthiest amongst us, can fund the 5% real-term pay rise that nurses are asking for. We can fund a minimum wage of £15 per hour to give social care staff a decent standard of living. Nurses and social care staff give so much and make a huge difference to the lives of so many; we have a responsibility to provide the pay and conditions they deserve.\nToby Mallinson\nHillsborough Green Party",

The Star has also published pictures of Roma men sent in by a former councillor.\nIt is dangerous to use the pandemic – like Donald Trump does – to stir up racism. I have to say the pictures from Fir Vale are little different to what I have seen in many parts of the city.\nThe link between Roma people and coronavirus deaths is entirely false.\nSocial distancing is important – but is so much easier when you don’t live in already overcrowded housing.\nThe Page Hall area includes Westbourne Nursing Home. Westbourne is part of the Palms Row group that has seen a shocking 18 coronavirus deaths already in their three homes. The group was criticised for moving residents between homes without telling families they were moving their elderly relatives into homes with confirmed cases of coronavirus. They have now admitted positive coronavirus tests for at least 60 residents and 36 staff.\nPutting the three homes together, this seems to be more deaths than any other care home in the UK.\nThis is deeply disturbing. Many care homes in Sheffield have had coronavirus cases but they have not had widespread outbreaks.\nWe all support our NHS and are in awe of how well individual staff have pulled together. But care homes are not “an extension of the NHS” as Palms Row has claimed, in order to demand more public money.\nPalms Row is a commercial enterprise seeking to make profit from its capital invested in its care homes business. It is a complicated web of business names, holdings companies, trading subsidiaries, debentures and shares.\nThis is not to criticise any of the staff at Palms Row, nor indeed the company itself. But there are questions which need to be asked – and which need to be answered – about how fit a private sector social care system is to look after us in old age.\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nSheffield Green Party\nSee also: Care Homes Are The Poor Relation\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

He was first elected as a councillor in May 2021 and was re-elected again for a second term in May 2024.\nMaroof is a proud immigrant and a dedicated public servant with a passion for education and skills. He can speak a number of languages, has a background in education, has worked with many different cultures around the world, and brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the Council Chambers; experience which has been crucial in ensuring progressive policies have been put forward during his time in post.\nMaroof is deeply committed to serving the needs and wants of the community of NE&S and works tirelessly to improve the lives of its residents. He has shown he is dedicated to listening to the concerns of the community and taking action to address them. He has assisted residents with concerns around litter, bins, parking, public transport, parks, and many other issues.\nMaroof champions holding people in power to account and has regularly challenged the Council Leader on his inaction in ensuring the city is listening and acting upon the concerns of its amazing residents. He strongly supports the rights of the Palestinian people to exist and their right to return to their homelands, he has been active in speaking up about the genocide being committed on Gazans by speaking at many protests and bringing their causes to wider attention. He has said “that by actively showing my support for Gaza, I am standing up for human rights, justice, and dignity for all oppressed people around the world”. By supporting Gaza, Maroof is sending a powerful message that he will not turn a blind eye to injustice. Maroof says he “understands that I may not be able to change the world, but I can help to change minds”.\nMaroof sees a future where education is “not seen as an assembly-driven provision, stifling creativity and the huge potential children have”. He believes that “school league tables need to be scrapped as they give an over-inflated impression of schools that have a higher ability intake. Our children’s achievements should be celebrated without turning it into a game between schools”. Instead of league tables, he suggests a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to evaluating school performances, “one that takes into account a broad range of factors and acknowledges the complexity of education”, he is committed to making this vision a reality by continuing the good work he has contributed to during his time as Vice Chair of Education, Children, and Families.\nPlease contact me if you have any enquiries about my candidacy or if you would like to display a poster in support of my campaign maroof.raouf@councillor.sheffield.gov.uk or 07367123276",

The comments were considered by Sheffield City Council’s Licencing Committee on Monday, together with evidence from the police, public health, Sheffield Cathedral and others. Cllr Douglas Johnson spoke at the meeting about the risks to vulnerable people and other residents in the city centre.\nFollowing the Committee decision to turn down the application Councillor Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group and a Councillor for City Ward said,\n“I’m very pleased the ward councillors’ objection to a new gambling shop on Fargate was upheld today.\n“The Licensing Committee heard our objections, which I presented at the meeting, together with evidence from public health professionals, police, the Cathedral, Victoria Hall, ChangingSheff and residents and refused the application for a premises licence.\n“We really didn’t want to see gambling place in the heart of the city. Millions of pounds are being spent to upgrade Fargate. Opening a slot machine arcade would only have damaged this ambition. It would also undermine the intense work done day in and day out by public services and local charities working with the large number of people in the city centre who are vulnerable to such addictions.\n“Gambling causes harm anywhere: we have heard of suicides related to gambling. In addition to that, the police confirmed that Fargate is a hotspot for violent crime. We all know it’s a hotspot for anti-social behaviour. Even the applicant told us that closing betting shops on Haymarket “improved” the area.\n“The business claimed Fargate isn’t a residential area but thousands of people live in the city centre now, many of them students who would be at risk. I am pleased the council has used its muscle to refuse a harmful application.”\nFellow Green City ward councillor Martin Phipps added,\n“It is great news that the licensing sub committee has listened and taken note of the overwhelming evidence against granting the licence for a gambling shop on Fargate. Residents, public health officers and the police clearly raised their concerns, and I’m pleased they were listened to.\nAs ward councillors we believe the council should look at Cumulative Impact Policy on premises such as gambling shops in the city centre to make it clear that the council believes the centre has enough gambling shops, and to support residents, public health, the police and other partners and agencies in making their case against future applications that would be detrimental if granted.”\nThe National Gambling Support Network provide free, confidential and personalised support for anyone who’s experiencing problems with gambling, as well as those affected by someone else’s gambling.\nIf you feel that you, or someone else is at risk of gambling-related harms, please call the National Gambling Helpline on 0808 802 0133, available 24/7.

At a local level, our budget proposals focus on what is achievable here and now.”\n“These proposals will make people’s lives better, especially for the poorest households and small businesses who have been worst affected by Covid. As well as a major investment in climate jobs, we offer real help for low-income families with substantial extra funding for advice work, a big boost to the council tax hardship scheme and lower heating bills in warmer homes.”\n“I don’t expect the Chancellor to recognise the reality of low-paid work or applying for universal credit but our budget shows these go hand-in-hand with tackling the climate crisis.”\nCllr Alison Teal (Nether Edge and Sharrow Ward) said,\n“Since 2008 the Green Party has been proposing a Green New Deal to address the climate emergency we face and create green jobs. The Covid-19 pandemic has only increased the urgency for action.”\n“We must address the massive changes needed and we must stop waiting for the government to rescue us. There are many things we can do as a city which we have outlined in our budget amendment. It is not exhaustive by any means, but we must make a start.”\n“From properly insulating homes to building new infrastructure to generate energy. Creating low traffic neighbourhoods and investing in biodiversity and urban horticulture. I’ve no doubt the people of Sheffield will see the benefits of so many positive changes, and work with the council to make them happen.”\nCllr Angela Argenzio (Broomhill and Sharrow Vale Ward) added,\n“The pandemic has shown us how important the local environment is: during the lockdown, Sheffield residents have learned to enjoy the green spaces on their door steps, they have taken up cycling and walking because there were less cars around but the COVID crisis has also brought inequalities into sharp focus, highlighting how people who live in smaller housing with no green spaces have suffered more deeply. Our budget offers solutions that address the environmental crisis at local level by supporting the most vulnerable and enabling the economic recovery of our local communities.”\nENDS\nFor more information please contact Douglas Johnson on 07981 860 662 or at douglas.johnson@sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nThe Council budget will be set at its meeting on Wednesday 3rd March at 2pm.

In every case, the council relies on non-payment of the water rates, as well as rent arrears. It is not enough for the council to say it will not evict where rent arears are solely due to delays in universal credit.\n“The Council has a chance to make a real difference to the lives of council tenants at a time of crisis, simply by bringing their cases into line with everyone else.\nAfter Labour councillors voted against the proposal, Cllr Alison Teal said,\n“It was disappointing to see Labour councillors speak out so strongly against the idea and even deny that water charges were ever used to evict tenants.”\nNotes\n- The proposal from Sheffield Green Party was:\n“That this Council notes that, in Sheffield, only Council tenants can be evicted from their homes if they cannot pay water bills on time and therefore calls on the Administration to end this practice by accounting for water bills separately from rent accounts and ceasing to pursue eviction in the courts because of water rates;” - The amendments are available with the Council agenda at: http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=6694\n- The Labour group of councillors voted against the proposal.\n- Housing benefit is not payable for water rates, even where they are payable under the tenancy agreement.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Burning near the Wyming Brook Nature Reserve resulted in smoke going to nearby urban areas and complaints by residents. There were further burning incidents on the 15th and 17th October too.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“The Council has legal powers to serve an “abatement notice” to stop pollution. I have therefore asked council officers to use these powers because of the smoke nuisance caused to many residents of Sheffield. Repeated air pollution undeniably causes harm to health.”\n“I raised the issue again with a number of formal questions at the full council meeting on Wednesday 1st November.”\n“The practice of moorland burning may support the grouse-shooting industry but those who cause pollution should not be exempt from the law just because they own large areas of land.”\nMoorland burning is opposed by a number of organisations including Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust, which manages Wyming Brook Nature Reserve.\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n- The council’s statutory enforcement powers for smoke control under section 80 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 allow serving an abatement notice on those responsible for causing pollution.\n- Other Green Party actions include moss-planting on the moors – see https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2023/10/19/residents-fight-moorland-fires-with-moss/\n- Green call to ban burning – https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2023/10/13/letter-to-the-press-greens-say-ban-the-burn/",

Events ranged across a variety of themes tackling some of the biggest issues we face, but also looking to real practical change in Sheffield.\nFestival of Debate achieves public engagement with politics and encourages active citizenship. Most events were in and around the city centre but included meetings in Darnall, Page Hall and Tinsley seeking to bring people together to build and improve neighbourhoods.\nNumerous events focused on the 70th anniversary of the NHS and the threats to publicly funded healthcare.\nEvents took place to a backdrop of despair on the state of local democracy and the actions of the Labour-run council, including their unwillingness to listen to local people and community groups. At “Democracy Across Seven Hills, Giving Communities a Say” we heard about Barnsley Council’s 2013 response to austerity impacts on communities, “Love Where you Live”. By choosing to invest rather than cut, Barnsley have empowered local people and communities and increased community participation and volunteering. This event was just one of many that showed there are solutions, if our city’s leaders embrace democratic change, rather than clinging to disastrous top-down models of decision making.\nWe look forward to Festival of Debate 2019.

It has a similarly friendly, welcoming feel, and an appetite for politicians not afraid to shake things up. I am excited for the people of Sheffield because they have an opportunity to elect more Green councillors this May, to build a better future through transformative programmes of retrofitting housing, improving transport and scaling up the jobs and skills agenda.”\nLeader of the Green Group, Cllr Douglas Johnson, added,\n“I am delighted to have welcomed Carla to Sheffield. Her work as a councillor in Bristol has been an inspiration to us, as she pioneered Europe’s first Climate Emergency declaration, which has since been followed by over 400 councils in the UK including Sheffield.”",

The scheme wasn’t on the meeting’s Agenda and no papers had been provided giving details of the scheme or recommendations. This lead to confusion during the meeting about what exactly Councillors were being asked to vote on.\nGreen Councillor Ruth Mersereau, a member of the Committee said\n“There was no need to pause the scheme. It’s really important to give the schemes sufficient time to bed in, and to properly trial the interventions. Also, as officers advised that they would be continuing to accept comments and feedback, pausing for further consultation was unnecessary. Sheffield City Council is aiming for zero carbon by 2030, but there is very little recognition by the committee of the urgency to make decisions that address transport’s contribution to emissions. Making streets safer, cleaner and quieter, and easier for people to walk and cycle in should be the priority of a committee which includes climate change in its remit.”\nCouncillor Mersereau said that the decision wasn’t based on evidence:\n“Details of the impact of the road safety measures were due to be provided next month, but Cllr Iqbal wasn’t prepared to wait a few weeks to see the data, and instead insisted on pausing the scheme. With these type of schemes, people who initially opposed Low traffic neighbourhoods often come to appreciate quieter, safer roads. We were also told by a Council Transport Officer that measures which were initially opposed by residents often become accepted after a few months.”",

The Council should have included a proposal to charge private cars in this consultation.\n- The need for this Clean Air Zone is an admission of failure at national and local government level.\n- At the same time, the proposals adversely and disproportionately affect public transport and smaller businesses. More detail on the proposals is needed.\nGeneral comments\nAir pollution is at high, often illegal, levels in the city centre and other parts of the city like Darnall and Tinsley. It is invisible but the effects are real.\nSheffield Green Party has always campaigned on the dangers of vehicle emissions. These contain nitrogen oxides and particulates which have been proven to worsen the risk of asthma, lung and heart diseases, strokes and Alzheimer’s disease and which cause 500 early deaths a year in Sheffield alone. Research evidence has shown air pollution can lead to premature birth and low birth weight, and impact on children’s lung development. Air pollution is associated with a range of physical and mental illnesses and is known to exacerbate serious conditions like heart disease.\nBusinesses lose hundreds of thousands of pounds every year due to staff absence caused by conditions related to air pollution.\nThe Council has permitted a number of developments in the east of the City, such as IKEA and the Meadowhall expansion. Whilst planning conditions have been specified to address air quality, these have been inadequate in practice and, in some cases, bypassed.\nHowever, we note that the Council is only taking steps to consider a Clean Air Zone because it has been ordered to do so by central Government. Even so, the required details were only submitted to government on the very last day that was legally possible.\nThe fact that the council has only done the minimum required by law is indicative of the lacklustre approach to tackling air quality. Much more could have been done earlier, such as by investing in a workplace parking levy, promoting public transport over private cars and by more effective use of planning conditions.\nCars\nPrivate cars cause half of all the pollution in the city centre and make up 80% of all journeys, many of which are unnecessary.\nThe Cabinet report acknowledges that the Class C CAZ “will also need additional measures … in order to achieve legal compliance by 2021.” This is an admission that the proposal to charge these categories alone will be insufficient.\nThe public is encouraged to drive cars into the city because of the convenience and cost of travel by car, relative to public transport. The low cost of parking a private vehicle in the city centre, in comparison to other cities, is a further encouragement to continue the habit of using a private vehicle rather than choosing public transport.\nThe convenience for some people who drive is offset against the disadvantage and harm to others, especially those who live and work in the city centre.\nContinuing to prioritise private cars also perpetuates wealth inequalities.\nWe agree with the Science and Technology Select Committee that widespread personal vehicle ownership is unsustainable in the long run, albeit for reasons of carbon reduction rather than NOx emissions (1). A switch to electric vehicles still leaves large amounts of particulate matter (from brake pads), which is detrimental to health. Sheffield Green Party would like to see far fewer cars brought into the city centre, leaving more space to live and breathe.\nMany journeys by car could be switched to bus, tram, cycle and foot travel. Engaging the public is critical to tackling the public health scourge of air pollution. This consultation was therefore an ideal opportunity to engage the public on the key issue of air quality. The council should have consulted on a proposal to charge all types of vehicle.\nThe decision to rule out any prospect of charging polluting cars was a missed opportunity to gauge public opinion and effect positive behavioural change. There is a pressing need to engage car drivers about how they might modify their behaviour for the common good of everyone.\nA proposal to charge private cars even a nominal amount of £1 a day for entering the Clean Air Zone would have the capacity to modify driver behaviour.\nBuses\nSheffield Green Party believes in encouraging and promoting public transport so that people in Sheffield can choose to leave their cars at home.\nBuses need to be given greater priority, both in bus lanes and at traffic lights. There is also a need to make improvements across the board so that buses become an easy, affordable and viable means of travel for most people.\nWe support the proposal to channel government grants to pay for new, cleaner bus vehicles.\nHowever, we have concerns that the council has only passed these grants on to the two biggest bus companies, First and Stagecoach, and has not given any grant to the smaller operators in the city, such as TM Travel, Sheffield Community Transport, Hulleys or Powells. As well as the appearance of bias towards big businesses over small, local ones, these operators often provide vital links for communities and their loss will worsen the position of people who do not or cannot own a car. It may also harm the innovation of new, more customer focused routes, which some small operators are developing.\nTaxis and goods vehicles\nWe note there is no firm proposal to address the issues faced by taxis and LGVs. These vehicles generally have a legitimate need to come into the city centre, which is not necessarily the case for private cars.\nTaxi drivers and businesses with vans need to know whether retro-fitting technology will be acceptable or whether the only way to comply with the CAZ requirement is to purchase new vehicles. In Sheffield Green Party’s view, retro-fitting would be preferable because of the very significant energy cost consumed in the production of new vehicles.\nBecause the focus of the CAZ specification is based on “Euro” standards, which relate to the condition of the vehicle when it was new, the benefits of retro-fitting technology have not been addressed by this proposal under consultation.\nSheffield Green Party has been contacted by engineering businesses which have researched and developed retro-fitting products and have sought the assistance of the council to trial them. It was disappointing to note that this was not followed up by the authority.\nThere needs to be consideration of how retro-fitted vehicles are charged if they do not quite meet the stringent conditions of low emission vehicles. It is important to avoid an all-or-nothing approach to charging. Either there could be a further period of time when retro-fitted vehicles are exempt or they could be charged at a much lower rate.\nWalking and Cycling\nSheffield Green Party supports measures to improve walking and cycling rates. These modes of travel are better for individual health than driving and they also contribute to the improvement of other people’s health, through reduced pollution.\nThere needs to be a far more developed network of segregated cycle routes. Cyclists should not be forced to share a lane with buses, as this is dangerous. It can also slow buses and thus negate the benefit to public transport of installing bus lanes in the first place. The lack of safe cycling space is an equality issue as more women than men feel unsafe when cycling with traffic on congested streets.\nSheffield Green Party would like to see the CAZ as an opportunity to enlarge and develop pedestrianised areas in the city centre.\nWorkplace Parking Levy and other progressive policies\nWe believe that the need for this CAZ in Sheffield demonstrates the failure of effective planning in previous years.\nSheffield Green Party councillors have repeatedly called for the introduction of a Workplace Parking Levy, which would address behavioural change in the decisions employers make about giving perks to staff in the form of free parking.\nWhere employers choose to charge staff for parking, it would encourage those staff to make realistic decisions about their choice of travel. It would also raise revenue for significant transport improvements.\nThe success of the workplace parking levy in Nottingham has paid for an extension to the tram system and has also meant that the city does not need to have a Clean Air Zone at all (2).\nFar too often, employers incentivise car travel by offering staff with their own cars subsidised or free parking when they do not offer any incentives to those who travel by bus. Employers could be encouraged to offer equal incentives, such as arranging for monthly or yearly travel passes, with costs recouped from wages. This would increase bus and tram travel in place of cars.\nThe way that people travel to work, to shop and for leisure can change. Sheffield Green Party wants to see a vision of a cleaner, safer city centre to live, work and play in. This means minimising vehicles to the essential only, such as those needed to ensure equal access for disabled people.\nElectric vehicle charging infrastructure\nAs noted above, Sheffield Green Party believes in the need to get people out of cars and onto public transport or other forms of travel. However, electric vehicles have a role to play in that they produce no NOx and less particulate matter and CO2.\nThe provision of electric vehicle charging points is therefore important. However, Sheffield City Council has failed to put in electric charging infrastructure to date (Nottingham has over 200 charging points), and has often failed to require developers to provide electric charging points as planning conditions. For instance, SCC required IKEA to provide five EV charging points but agreed to IKEA’s later request to install just one.\nDisplacement\nWe accept the principle that setting the charging zone on the Inner Ring Road captures a very large proportion of the city’s traffic. It has the potential to effect change because of the number of journeys that pass through the city centre or via the ring road. However, the purpose of the ring road is to divert traffic onto it, so as to keep it away from smaller residential roads.\nWe have not seen any assessment that addresses the anticipated impact on streets immediately outside the zone. This needs to be addressed.\nWe believe that some traffic, that would otherwise travel a short distance along the ring road, will be tempted to travel through small, residential streets to avoid the charge. For instance, a van travelling from Bramall Lane to Ecclesall Road would usually travel over a short section of the ring road. To save a £10 charge, this would be likely to increase journeys through the back streets of Sharrow.\nThe proposal only considers charging for driving on the ring road as a whole. It would be possible to consider charging only for certain segments of the ring road.\nPotential rat-runs should be identified and a package of suitable measures should be addressed. These could include closing off local streets to through traffic, whilst maintaining full access for residents.\nUse of revenue\nFunds created by the Clean Air Zone must be ring-fenced and publicly accounted for to show they are being put to good use to improve public transport. This is to ensure public confidence in this important health measure.\nNotes\n(1) Reported at https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49425402, 22 Aug 19\n(2) https://www.transportnottingham.com/no-clean-air-zone-for-nottingham/\nDownload\nDownload the Sheffield Green Party response to the Clean Air Zone consultation (pdf)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Recently, I was a support worker at a further education college.\nI am currently volunteering with the Wildlife Trust, and campaigning for safer roads and better public transport in Fulwood and across Sheffield. I am working with others to ensure that local housing plans are truly sustainable, with opportunities for the wider community, without damaging the vital green spaces in the neighbourhood.\nIf elected, I would be motivated to work alongside Green Party colleagues, listening to every resident, promoting fairness and the protection of our natural resources to make Sheffield a forward-thinking, egalitarian city – a good place to be for all communities.“Greens are also consistent supporters of public transport with routes to serve communities and key users, like older people, who need bus stops close to where they live. Constant battles are being fought in Fulwood as First and Stagecoach make profit-motivated decisions to change routes and services. People here should have access to bus services to take them to the two big hospitals – the council should be in control of the buses. I support the retention of threatened healthy street trees that help us breathe clean air and make our communities more than just concrete and cars.”",

In Heeley, we have seen a huge rise in the use of food banks and ever-increasing poverty as the cost of living crisis has made it even harder to manage household bills.\nSome policies seem designed to harm the poorest and most vulnerable in our community. An example is the two-child cap on benefits which punishes children for having been born and has plunged 420,000 families into poverty.\nIt was disappointing therefore to hear Louise Haigh (MP for Sheffield Heeley since 2015) on the BBC committing to keep the two-child cap which leaves families £3200 per child worse off every year.\nTo make matters worse, Labour have committed to even harsher austerity in the next Parliament than the Conservatives, according to BBC analysis. It is clear that the Tories are unelectable, but Labour are not offering the hope and real change our country needs.\nA Resolution Society report found that scrapping the two-child cap policy would cost about £6.3 billion in today’s prices by 2035 and would lift about 490,000 children out of poverty.\nThe Green Party would end austerity – including the two-child cap – by introducing a small tax increase for the wealthiest in society.

The council stopped its pension funds investing in companies linked to apartheid and barred South African sports teams from using its playing fields. Boycotts, divestment and sanctions were one of the most effective ways to apply pressure, and Sheffield led the way.\nThere have been 75 years of policies implemented by the Israeli state designed to discriminate against Palestinian people and force them from their homes. For the last 16 years, Gaza has been under illegal blockade, which preceded the Hamas atrocity of October 7th and the current genocidal campaign by the Israeli state. In the past few months over 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza – 11,000 of them children.\nPeople may feel powerless in the face of this, but we are not. Now is the time for Sheffield City Council to show leadership once more. In November, Sheffield Council resolved to note that “Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, B’tselem and the South African government recognise that the Israeli Government is enacting a system of apartheid”. We now need to declare our city an Israeli Apartheid-free zone.\nOur city must cut ties with all companies that contribute to the genocide of the Palestinian people and apartheid system. This action will show solidarity with the ordinary Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to find a political solution. It will add to the pressure on extremists in the Israeli government and grow the chances of hope and peace.\nTo support the call for Sheffield Council to boycott and divest from Israeli apartheid, please sign the petition\nAlexi Dimond\nSheffield City Councillor for Gleadless Valley",

The reason was subtle. I did not mention climate change, but actually I would be rather discussing that than discussing this attempted coup. I stated that I was in the SGP, and that our party is the the one that will get the votes.\nI went on to explain that Brexit has been hijacked by a bunch of opportunistic far-right gangsters. Their names being; Johnson, Cummings, Rees-Mogg, Farage, Trump as he inspires them all and the fanatical Nazi Tommy Robinson, currently in prison (since then released). I stated that they all should be in prison too.\nI made it clear that we are the people, that I am the people, so don’t mess with us or me.\nFrom my involvement with SUTR, and the many demo’s I went on, I know that you have to incite the crowd, so I said:\nWhose streets? Response from the crowd – our streets, repeated\nI said yes to remaining in the EU. Importantly I stated with reforms.\nA core part of my speech went onto list things that are fundamental to the GP and myself. You see for me, being a trans-female, I suffer constantly from verbal abuse, just as someone identified in one or more of the categories listed below. My activism within SUTR gained me much respect. I now bring this to the GP.\nI stated; no to sexism, no to racism, no to homophobia, no to transphobia, no to Islamophobia, an end to austerity, an end to benefits sanctions, welcome to asylum seekers and refugees and an end to forced deportations. I could have gone on, but perhaps for next time?\nI stated that I wanted this message to be heard not just in Sheffield, but across the UK and around the world. I said that we say no to the far-right. Dump and Trump them all.\nAgain I incited the crowd, so I said:\nNo pasaran – they shall not pass\nResponse from the crowd – No pasaran\nThis was repeated.\nI meant it totally when I stated that we will, I will never give up until we stop this coup. For me personally, were the coup to succeed, we would revert to the days where, for example people such as Oscar Wilde and Alan Turing were criminalised, and of course myself. So that is what drives me with such passion and force.\nI finished off by mentioning that I take great inspiration from Greta Thunberg, who is my hero. Again, alluding to climate change, but not by name. On this theme, I stated that our country is on fire. It is. That we will put it out by non violent direct action. Think about how the citizens of Hong Kong, who also fear for their democratic rights.\nI mentioned that if we are united, that we will be strong and sweep this tyranny away. These gangsters will try and divide us. I know that in that crowd that there were people with very different political views. Somehow, we have to work together, because if we do not, that coup could well succeed. Now that is a totally unacceptable and terrifying prospect.\nI finished by asking people to come and join me in the Green Party now.\nAgain I incited the crowd, so I said:\nWhose streets? Response from the crowd – our streets, repeated\nI was congratulated by many, not just in the GP. In the future, I intend to deliver more speeches, in a similar vein. I am open to suggestions as to how I might improve upon these speeches\nJuliette de Tosni-Tauvignon\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This is despite the Council actually being a part of the Partnership.\nThe other partners are Amey, the Woodland Trust, Sheffield & Rotherham Wildlife Trust, Sheffield Tree Action Groups and the volunteer Street Tree Wardens.\nThe Planning Application was for a new University of Sheffield building on land adjacent to Hounsfield Road, Leavygreave Road and Upper Hanover Street. As part of the planning application there was a proposal to remove a number of good quality London Plane Trees along busy Hanover Way. This was objected to by both the Sheffield Street Tree Partnership and the Sheffield Tree Action Group (STAG), amongst others.\nThe Street Tree Partnership were concerned at the loss of mature trees that had at least another 40 years of life. Jon Johnson, representing STAG, described the existing trees as “a valuable asset to the city”\nCouncillor Marieanne Elliot said,\n“The Sheffield Street Tree Partnership was formed to address many of the concerns that came out of the Sheffield street tree scandal – we need any plan to be endorsed by the Partnership.\n“The Planning Committee was asked to agree to the development without a clear understanding of exactly which mature trees are going to be removed on Favell Street. We were also lacking any detailed plans about the proposed new trees. Putting the right trees in the right place is absolutely crucial – this is something that requires professional ecologist input – before proposals are brought to the Committee for a decision.\n“It was for this reason that I proposed a deferral of the decision so Councillors could be given all the information we needed to properly determine the application. This would also mean that the Street Tree Partnership would be able to give their valuable input.\n“I am naturally disappointed that the majority of the Committee did not share my view and that they approved the application without all the facts in front of them. When the Street Tree Partnership is dismissed in this way, it makes me concerned that the lessons from the Sheffield Street Tree scandal have not been properly understood.”",

This follows comments from Green Party member, Graham Santer.\nThe application is to be determined at a Planning Committee on Tuesday 2nd June, which can be watched online. The agenda and report can be found at http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=7295.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson’s comment:\nI am writing to support the residents and others who have objected to the planning application at Owlthorpe Fields (19/03143/FUL – Erection of 74no. dwellings, formation of access road, associated landscaping works, open space works and flood storage works | Land Off Moorthorpe Way Sheffield S20 6PD).\nUrban sprawl is the great failed planning policy of the twentieth century. In what other field would the council consider itself bound by a provisional decision from the 1960s?\nThis is significant: the application would fall to be rejected under the council’s policy of building on brownfield sites [CS24] were it not for the fact that “Owlthorpe Township” is treated as an exception. Otherwise, the policy states that expansion of new housing in this area “will be strongly resisted.” [Core Strategy para 4.26]\nThe exception in policy CS24 is out of line with NPPF’s drive towards focussing on brownfield sites first. It is hardly an up-to-date policy, given that the site was former farmland that was earmarked for housing “in the 1960’s.”\nPerversely, the officer’s report claims that building on this Greenfield site is “supported” by the policy on building on brownfield sites. The claim that the “development of this Greenfield site is compatible with the NPPF as it is part of a wider strategy for prioritising previously developed land for housing” is nonsense: granting this application will do nothing to promote the use of brownfield land. By contrast, the NPPF requires recognition that undeveloped land can perform many functions, such as for “wildlife, recreation, flood risk mitigation, cooling/shading, or carbon storage.” [para 118(b)]\nOverall, as many residents have pointed out, this is a low-grade scheme of largely executive homes, at a low density that does not comply with policy CS26. No social rented affordable housing is proposed: shared ownership accommodation is a particularly bad deal and it is notable the developer has refused to mix “affordable” housing in with the other executive homes.\nAny sustainability benefits are limited and do not outweigh the “high ecological, landscape or recreational value” [CS24]. The proposal does not comply with ecological policies GE11, GE13 and GE15. Proof of this is that, even now, the developer has been unable to produce an acceptable ecological management plan and intend to reserve that decision to officers. That should really be a matter for the committee.\nThe transport proposals are inadequate: despite being within close proximity to a tram stop, this is a car-based development, with over 200 car parking spaces. The developer has rejected requests for access for buses and even for enough electric vehicle charging points, citing a failure to supply “adequate electrical capacity.”\nFinally, there is a difficulty with the officers’ recommendation where the council has a financial stake in the outcome of the planning decision: receipt of the sale proceeds of the land is conditional on planning permission being granted. Given the level of interest in this application and the need to avoid bias in this unusual situation, permission should not be granted without an independent planning assessment. This specialist should be instructed jointly by both the council and representatives of the residents group who will be affected.\nI trust these comments will be considered by the Planning Committee on June 2nd.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, (Green Party)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Everyone agrees that buses should be “better”, but there is a lack of willingness to tackle one of the major problems: private cars. Traffic made by cars holds up buses and contributes to climate emergency and air pollution.\nWe back the calls for re-regulating the buses, but also the need for greater priority for public and active travel: that means shifting priority & space away from cars so buses can get around quickly and people can walk and cycle quickly and, importantly, safely. Revolutionising our transport patterns is a crucial recommendation from Pathways to Zero Carbon in Sheffield report by Arup, and is needed to be zero carbon by 2030, as well as to improve our health.\nTo meet this implementing the ConnectingSheffield schemes is a necessity. They are major funded schemes to add segregated bike lanes, bus lanes and bus gates, designed & consulted on to improve walking, cycling, accessibility and bus journeys. (connectingsheffield.commonplace.is) The future of Pinstone St lies at the heart of delivering these schemes. It has been suggested that we should allow “low emission buses” on Pinstone St where it’s currently closed to motor traffic, Sheffield currently has none & this isn’t compatible with plans 👇 @CycleSheffield\nAt the overview and scrutiny committee it was raised by a transport officer that the proposed electric freebee bus could stop as close as the jewelers at the corner of Barkers Pool without negatively affecting the plans, we do not need it to run on Pinstone St to service the area\nThis is a win win allowing people to easily get around the city centre for free in a clean and accessible manner, as well as allowing greater space for walking, cycling and mobility needs and greening the city centre\nThere are significant bus time advantages in not having motor traffic run on Pinstone St, with improvements already seen and more expected with the planned bus gate to restrict private car traffic heading towards Castle Square from Furnival Gate on Arundel Gate by Novohotel\nAnd significant health benefits in improving active travel infrastructure in Sheffield. We need to be listening to our Director of Public Health, Greg Fell, in his blog on the need for active & public travel improvements and need to reprioritise.\nAnd listening to the health professionals and many people who started and have signed the petition to keep Pinstone St motor traffic free. Please read the petition text, it is full of important points from a health perspective, at Change.org\nIt was disappointing that in The Star article none of the Labour MPs stepped up to plate to address the need to change traffic priorities. Yes re-regulation is sorely needed for cheap, green public transport based on need not market, but also the priority currently given to cars\nImproving our bus services is a political choice. Let’s make it #Sheffield",

In June 1984, miners at Orgreave were viciously attacked by the police – and still await justice More recently the Labour administration of Sheffield used draconian anti-trade union laws, when peaceful protesters defending Sheffield’s street trees were wrongfully arrested.\nIf peaceful protest is prohibited or curtailed, this seems to make violence inevitable. This is not because protestors will resort to violence – but because the police will be legally mandated to use violence to stop otherwise peaceful protests. This was aptly demonstrated by the use of violence against women at the Sarah Everard vigil in Clapham recently.\nI have been attending protests all my life: from Anti-Apartheid and miners’ rights demonstrations as a child in the 1980’s to Palestinian rights, Black Lives Matter and climate marches in recent years. Protest is a fundamental part of our democracy, and if the right to protest is eroded – or if permission is required – the UK ceases to be a full democracy.\nWithout protest, none of the rights we enjoy today, from the right to vote, to join a trade union, to roam across our countryside, to equality legislation protecting marginalised communities, would exist. For these reasons, Sheffield Green Party party opposes the Police, Crime and Courts Bill and is proud to be part of a growing coalition of political, campaigning and rights groups organising against the bill.\nAlexi Dimond\nGreen Party Candidate for Gleadless Valley Ward.\nplease sign the petition here: https://sheffagainstpb.wixsite.com/sign\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Anyone can come and hear what is being said and done by our elected representatives.\nBut how many people ever do this?\nLots turn out for the big issues but sometimes it’s only five or ten in the public gallery for the monthly full council. Other meetings like Cabinet, scrutiny committees and planning and licensing meetings sometimes have very few or no members of the public to observe proceedings.\nI can’t blame the public for this. It is difficult to give up a whole morning or afternoon to wait for five minutes of something you want to hear. It is more difficult if you have a regular job, a disability or young children. And the conduct of meetings can make them pretty awful to sit through.\nThe Green Party councillors have campaigned for greater openness. In 2012, Cllr Rob Murphy proposed broadcasting of council meetings, and to allow people to make their own recordings. Both ideas were rejected by the ruling Administration. All other South Yorkshire authorities now have a proper, official online record. The advantages are many.\nYou can watch at home or work whilst waiting for the bit you are interested in to come up. You can check it online later, as there is a permanent record. It ends complaints that minutes don’t reflect what was said or leave out difficult questions altogether.\nIt also improves councillors’ behaviour. Green Party councillors always encourage respect for debate instead of the bickering and rudeness between the two big parties. From the council’s point of view, it shows a commitment to openness. It can also reduce the work of answering Freedom of Information requests one by one.\nThe cost is now fairly low and is something the Green Party has repeatedly included in budget amendment proposals.\nRight now, a new working group is looking at making council meetings more accessible.

He believes that “school league tables need to be scrapped as they give an over-inflated impression of schools that have a higher ability intake. Our children’s achievements should be celebrated without turning it into a game between schools”. Instead of league tables, he suggests a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to evaluating school performances, “one that takes into account a broad range of factors and acknowledges the complexity of education”, he is committed to making this vision a reality by continuing the good work he has contributed to during his time as Vice Chair of Education, Children, and Families.\nPlease contact me if you have any enquiries about my candidacy or if you would like to display a poster in support of my campaign maroof.raouf@councillor.sheffield.gov.uk or 07367123276",

Most civilians caught up in the conflict have an overriding desire to live in peace.\n“The Green Party calls for an immediate end to the violence in Israel and Palestine. The targeting of civilians is an outrageous breach of international law and is unacceptable under all circumstances.\n“We urge the international community to take immediate steps to protect civilian life and infrastructure from attack, and to launch immediate humanitarian relief efforts.\n“The long absence of a meaningful political dialogue and peace process has created a vacuum, which has been filled by those who offer violence as a solution. The pathway to ending these waves of violence and bringing about a long-term political settlement must begin with an end to illegal occupation.\n“The UN Security Council, of which the UK is a permanent member, must act to prevent the spread of the conflict to neighbouring states such as Lebanon and Iran. They have so far failed to agree any new political initiative to address the fundamental causes of these latest acts of violence. For the sake of thousands of people on both sides in this conflict, they urgently need to do so.”\nResponding to Sheffield City Council’s decision to raise the Israeli flag on the Town Hall Councillor Alexi Dimond said,\n“Sheffield Green Party opposed raising the Israeli flag on the Town Hall.\n“Hamas’ attack on civilians is a horrendous war crime, and so is the Israeli occupation, with its system of apartheid and current & frequent indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians & the infrastructure they rely on.\n“Gaza comprises a captive civilian population of 2.3 million people with nowhere to go.

The total impact of the transport & building works needs to be comprehensively assessed at this current stage.\nThe development stretches over a mile in length, & the huge amount of traffic generated would have major impacts on many planning matters in this location. It isn’t acceptable to say these would be considered in later planning applications, because the purpose of enabling works is only valid in the context of a major distribution centre being approved.\nSGP endorses the objections made by the Love Wincobank Campaign, the Sheffield & Rotherham Wildlife Trust, the Transpennine Trail Partnership (TPT), Sustrans, & Cyclesheffield.\nSGP also objects because of the negative impacts on:\n- health of local residents: communities in the Wincobank area are being put at risk in the name of development. This will lead to conflict between jobs & human health in an area of existing health disadvantage. There has been neither an Environmental nor a Health Impact Assessment, nor any information about how the traffic generated by the proposal would affect local air quality.\n- levels of noise: breaking up & removing the concrete pads (which are several metres thick), bringing new materials on site & building the new development will be noisy & will take many, many months. This will cause unacceptable noise, disruption & nuisance for residents living adjacent to the site. There have been no details of the proposed traffic movements, operation hours, etc. in this application.\n- ability to withstand flooding: The proposal will affect a floodplain, increasing the likelihood of local flooding, especially downstream of the development site, where Meadowhall has already been very seriously affected by flood damage. The flood risks that hindered the previous application don’t appear to have been addressed. At the Full Council meeting in Oct. 2019, the relevant cabinet member, Cllr Bob Johnson, stated in answer to Public Question 3.3.17 concerning Climate Change & Planning that “the Council was most aware of the impacts of climate change & was taking account of that in reaching decisions in individual planning applications. This was particularly the case in respect to drainage & flooding”. Allowing this proposal to go ahead would contradict this statement.\nThe application urgently needs a Flood Risk Assessment, to ‘manage flood risk from all sources’. By applying the Sequential & Exception Tests, this would avoid inappropriate development in areas of high flood risk. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) now requires that strategic policies consider the ‘cumulative impacts in, or affecting local areas susceptible to flooding’ (para 156, NPPF).\n- ecology: several concerns are noted in the ecology report – the need for a groundwater assessment; protected/notable animal & plant species recorded within 2 kms of the land; any poorly designed lighting affecting animal populations; dangers from pollutants in the construction phase; removal of trees. Plus an additional danger that the concrete dust generated by the development work could end up in the Blackburn brook, then the Don, undoing all the good work that has been done installing fish passes at the weirs.\n- air quality: Enabling more motor traffic in this area will hinder SCC’s ability to meet the EU directive for clean air, so any development which will increase traffic should be subject to greater scrutiny. The concrete dust generated by the building works will also negatively impact air quality.\n- traffic: as the enabling works cannot be seen in isolation from the operation of a very large distribution centre, there needs to be a traffic management plan, because of the significant impact both on local roads & the M1.\n- carbon targets: Enabling more motor traffic, including HGVs, does not fit with SCC’s commitment to be carbon neutral by 2030.\n- walking & cycling: The proposed access road cuts directly across the TPT, & will endanger & inconvenience walkers & cyclists. The design of the proposed cycle/foot crossing is unsafe, & the predicted increase in traffic will cause significant delays at this point. The applicant’s own Transport notes that the “proposed pedestrian/cycle crossing is acceptable, albeit in the context that the current proposal does not generate traffic once complete.” As it’s improbable that the current proposal will not generate traffic, the conclusion would be that the crossing itself won’t be acceptable.\nThe proposed access road is contrary to the NPPF’s presumption in favour of sustainable development – “development proposals should prioritise pedestrian & cycle movements”.\nThere is no need for the access road, as the site can be accessed elsewhere, & has a railway adjacent.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Only 3 of the 6 Sheffield MPs have so far supported the bill, which was tabled by Caroline Lucas of the Green Party.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Green Councillor for City ward, said,\n“I am delighted we can say that Sheffield City Council now supports this important bill going through Parliament. I am pleased the Labour councillors did not oppose our demand and that the council is now asking those MPs who have not publicly supported the bill to do so.\nAt the same time, it is disappointing that Labour councillors did block our declaration of a Biodiversity and Ecological Emergency in Sheffield itself. There needs to be leadership and action at all levels of government.”\nCommenting on the Labour vote to block an Ecological and Biodiversity Emergency being declared in Sheffield, Cllr Peter Garbutt said\n“There is plenty of good work being done by various organisations in Sheffield (such as Sheffield & Rotherham Wildlife Trust, Wildscapes and others) but what is needed is leadership, co-ordination and a will to tackle this absolutely vital issue. The cabinet member for the Environment has been promising this for well over a year now, but all we have is prevarication.”\nThe Green councillors also succeeded in committing the council to negotiate with private landowners on the Sheffield moors about restoring peat land and using natural flood management techniques.

I’m passionate about local politics and while Westminster is very distant, Sheffield Town Hall is very close. We can make a big difference to people’s lives right here in Gleadless Valley, and across the city.\nI see change coming from the ground up rather than the top down. By changing the way we do things here, we can change things in the city, in the country, in the world. That’s real Green politics.\nI will represent an alternative voice to the singular party line that comes out of the Labour controlled council. I don’t have to obey the party leader like the Labour councillors do. I am free to represent the people of Gleadless Valley and I’m honoured to have that opportunity.\nI’ve lived in this ward for almost 20 years. It’s my home. I live here, work here and have fun here. I use the parks, shops, cafes and pubs. I’ve grown my life here with my family. We had our children here at home in Meersbrook. My daughter goes to school here at our local primary school. My life is this area and this area is part of us.\nI grew up in a single parent family on a Northern council estate in a safe Labour seat. I understand what it feels like to be ignored by politicians who take people and their votes for granted. I understand the plight of those who need the help of organised communities and trustworthy politicians the most.\nI feel compelled to stand for election, not because I want a career in politics (I wouldn’t be in the Green Party if I wanted that) but because I can’t resist standing up to the current administration. Like many people in Sheffield I am angered by the way the local council operates: entitlement to rule, sham consultations, a relentless desire to accommodate big business at the expense of Sheffielders, the lip service to democracy and the environment. Their hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me.\nI want to stand for what matters; to be the voice of the people, not the voice of the leader of the council. I will stand up for Green politics; having decisions made as locally as possible, genuinely protecting our environment and fighting for our future.\nThere is so much to do in this ward and there are many good people trying to make the place even better than it is. I feel my ability to bring people together to achieve a common goal will give these local voices a chance to be at the forefront of local politics.\nI hope the people of Gleadless Valley Ward will see the value in having a truly independent voice to represent them on the Sheffield Council.

One of my most pleasing moments was to see the council finally make a firm decision on introducing the CAZ in October 2021.\nWhy take action\nTackling air pollution is important: it contributes to an estimated 500 people dying early every year in Sheffield. In the long term, children are most affected by air pollution whilst their lungs are developing.\nAir pollution remains at illegal, not just unsafe, levels in many parts of Sheffield, especially in the city centre where car ownership is at its lowest. Motor traffic is a principal source of nitrogen dioxide, the pollutant that is the target of clean air zones. Therefore, the national approach is to target old and polluting vehicles.\nThe UK government was dragged through the courts kicking and screaming over many years before it accepted it had to act in the face of illegal measures of pollution. It did so by ordering a number of cities with the worst pollution to implement clean air zones. They are now up and running in Birmingham, Portsmouth, Bristol, Bath, Bradford, Newcastle and Gateshead. Leeds decided to introduce a CAZ in principle but achieved legal levels of pollution without needing to charge vehicles. Manchester was on track to deliver a CAZ but has failed to do so under political pressure.\nDesign of the clean air zone\nAs one bus service manager said to me recently, it’s a crazy scheme that charges public transport but not the increasing number of massive SUVs we see on the city’s roads.\nUnfortunately, the framework is tightly controlled by central government. All the same, it was disappointing that Sheffield Council’s previous administration announced it would not charge private cars under any circumstances. Green councillors said we should at least have consulted on the possibility of charging private cars which make unnecessary journeys.\nHowever, one small intervention is designed to reduce the number of cars in the city centre. Councillors voted for a new bus gate on Arundel Gate, to reduce the amount of through traffic in an area of the highest concentrations of pollution. This will also offer advantages to smooth running of buses.\nGrants for local business\nWith the government mandate comes millions of pounds for businesses to upgrade vehicles. This is a very welcome chance to put more support towards small businesses and self-employed taxi drivers. All vehicles need replacing sooner or later. Taxi and van drivers can now apply for grants so they avoid the clean air charge.\nGrants have also paid for buses to be retrofitted to make them cleaner. Some 292 Sheffield buses have been treated so far and there is enough money to treat a further 16 vehicles. This means that none of the Sheffield bus fleet, barring exceptions, will be liable for the clean air charge. Fares will not go up because of the CAZ.\nElectric vehicles\nElectric vehicles will not be charged. However, the council has dropped the very demanding requirement that taxis would have to be electric to avoid the charge, in favour of a much more achievable Euro 6 Diesel standard, which includes any vehicle manufactured since 2016. Petrol vehicles manufactured since 2006 will meet the Euro 4 standard and will be exempt. This dealt with many of the genuine anxieties held by taxi drivers.\nThe clean air charge applies to vehicles inside or on the inner ring road. Some people have said the ring road itself should be exempt, but this is to miss the point about reducing pollution across the whole city.\nThe geography of Sheffield means that the inner ring road gathers in almost all traffic trying to cross the city. The ring road is effective as a defined location to identify and enforce the charge with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR). By covering a larger number of vehicles, the CAZ will have more effect on vehicles – and therefore pollution levels – across the city. It also widens access to grants for a greater range of businesses.\nDisplacement\nSome opponents of the scheme have argued that pollution will be pushed into residential areas around the city. Whilst there will be a small degree of displacement, it will be limited because it doesn’t apply to buses (on fixed routes), taxis (bound to have to travel through the city centre at some point of the day), private cars (not charged at all), any goods vehicles delivering to the city centre, any distribution vehicle where time is of the essence, exempt vehicles or any vehicle newer than seven years old.\nAs more polluting vehicles come off the roads, the charges paid will dwindle. In the meantime, the receipts will fund the system and any surplus will go to further air quality improvements. The CAZ is a step change in the ongoing process of cleaning up the air.\nThe future\nOf course, this is not the end. The CAZ aims to tackle illegal levels of air pollution, measured as an annual average of 40µg/m3 of nitrogen dioxide. However, the World Health Organization’s new guidelines now recognise levels of 10µg/m3 as harmful. We need to keep on improving our air quality and our health.\nMore information on the clean air zone, exemptions, charges and grants is available here.",

Spokesperson Bob Berzins, author of Report From the Front Line (2018) and Snared (2020, comments:\nSubsidised mismangement and killing\n“It’s outrageous that the four grouse moors within Sheffield’s boundaries receive a total of £663,000 a year taxpayers’ money in agricultural subsidies. The Park Authority spends £107,000 of taxpayers’ money on predator control programmes and the National Trust recruits grouse shooting tenants. There isn’t a single public body that condemns grouse shooting for a catalogue of crime and the mismanagement of our uplands.\nWe’ve seen a surge in wildlife crime during lockdown. There was a likely poisoning of a buzzard and two peregrines, a short eared owl and buzzard were shot and 4 raven chicks died after both parents mysteriously disappeared. The damage caused by grouse shooting goes way beyond raptors. Predator control results in local extinction of foxes, crows, stoats and weasels often using inhumane traps such as snares. It’s clear this is just a small sample of many wildlife crimes and that there is virtually no chance of successful prosecutions.”\nFlood protection in a climate emergency\nBob continues: “Grouse moorland is managed by burning which increases flood risk and increases air pollution while sending C02 into the atmosphere. Destruction of wildlife and environment for shooting is completely at odds with providing a natural, balanced, healthy space for the benefit of the wider population seeking urgent action to address the climate emergency. Yet our Government drags its feet on banning burning.\nMy “Report From The Front Line” in 2018 described the ravages of grouse moor management in the Peak District. There has been virtually no progress or significant change since and Sheffield was close to flooding in winter 2019/2020.

It’s a non-means-tested payment made to all, whether or not they are currently employed. This may sound alien compared to our current work and benefits system, with its zero hours contracts and oppressive universal credit regime. But previous trials have shown it can have a big effect in improving health outcomes, reducing poverty and supporting unpaid care responsibilities.\nUBI Lab Sheffield’s proposed scheme involves a payment of £600 a month to every adult. From care workers to entrepreneurs to stay-at-home parents to those on temporary contracts, it would provide a real safety net. The current cost of processing a single Universal Credit claim is £700 – money that would be far better spent actually helping people. UBI ditches endless forms and sanctions in favour of a simpler, fairer system.\nSheffield City Council should be listening to UBI Lab Sheffield and other amazing not-for-profit organisations, charities, community groups and small businesses with ideas to support our city. These groups help drive change from the bottom up, in contrast to the top-down decisions currently made by just 9 Labour Cabinet members.\nI pledge to support this if I am elected on May 2nd.

The decisions by the then Labour Cabinet leading to the felling of thousands of street trees and trying to jail protestors played a large part in the positive vote for a committee system in the referendum held last May.\nGreen Councillor for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale Brian Holmshaw paid tribute to the independent ‘It’s our City’ campaign who successfully campaigned for a referendum on reintroducing the Committee system, They spoke to well over 26,000 local people.\n“The “It’s our City” campaign which I was proud to be an active supporter of, has resulted in new modern looking committees for the 21st century. The people of Sheffield saw that the council democratic structures were lacking, over centralised, top down, ill-considered, and as a result, wrong for the people of Sheffield. They dragged the then council kicking and screaming to long overdue change.”Green Councillors Christine Gilligan-Kubo, Kaltum Rivers and Peter Garbutt were involved in the detailed work that steered the necessary changes to the City Council’s Constitution to today’s meeting,\nCouncillor Gilligan-Kubo said,\n“There are of course the necessary changes needed to ensure we have a Committee System but we must see the changes to the culture of the Council that should come with those technical changes. All Councillors will be involved in making policy. It means that simply opposing policies because they come from another party, or they weren’t your idea should no longer be an option. If we have a more cooperative, collaborative way of working then that will be good for the Council and is more likely to respect the wishes of the people of Sheffield.”Councillor Peter Garbutt said,\n“As well as working in a more positive cross party way the committee system must engage local people much more effectively in decision making. We can ensure we take evidence from local people to inform decisions, have informed local people as co optees on committees and ensure all sections of the community are involved in the things that affect them.”Councillor Douglas Johnson who is the Green Party Executive Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport on the Cooperative Executive that the Green Party share with Labour said,\n“The introduction of a Committee system is a really positive step in the right direction; however it is easy to amend constitutions but you cannot amend attitudes. We still have a long way to go in Sheffield and one thing that has been clear over the last year is that whatever the political system, we get better decisions when politicians from different parties have to work together.

Councils, campaigners and residents have to be able to make a judgement on claims about whether or not developers can afford to meet their targets of affordable housing in new developments that the council has set as a condition of granting planning permission.\n“But of course the definition of ‘affordable’ is far from genuinely that. The Green Party wants to work towards ensuring everyone has a genuinely affordable home and to establish a ‘living rent’ the same way there is ‘living wage.’ This means no-one is using more than 30% of their take-home income for housing costs.”\nCllr Rivers added, “The desperate need for housing in Sheffield is for genuinely affordable housing, in a range of sizes. Ultimately, we need to go back to the council or social landlords building far more homes, and promoting cooperatives, co-housing and community land trusts as alternative housing models, but we need to maximise that supplied by developers now.”\nDouglas Johnson, Green Councillor for City Ward, commented,\n“Property developers make far more profit on luxury flats or executive homes than affordable housing. The crisis is growing as rents and mortgages escalate.\n“Far too often, we see developers doing nothing to make housing affordable.\n“Even worse is where developers apply to lift planning conditions that require a contribution to the problem. This is why I welcome Michael Miller’s petition to highlight the issue of developers playing the system.\n“Local authorities need more power, not less, to force developers to contribute to this growing problem. But we also need to examine what is truly “affordable.” Many so-called “affordable homes are still out of the reach of many.\n“A decent, secure home at a reasonable cost is vital. Failing to provide such homes will cost the country more in poor health, education and productivity.”\nNotes\n- 2,569 people signed a petition asking Sheffield Council to require developers to make their “viability assessments” public. Michael Miller, of Nether Edge, will present this to the council’s cabinet on 19 th September 2018. It is then expected to be referred to the Scrutiny Committee for debate.\n- A petition of over 2,500 signatures can require a senior officer to give evidence about the issue at a Scrutiny committee meeting. This is a cross-party panel of councillors and Cllr Kaltum Rivers is a member of it.\n- The text of Michael Miller’s petition is:\nMake housing developers be transparent about costs in SheffieldTo: Sheffield CouncilRequire developers to make their viability assessments public if they claim they cannot meet council\ntargets of affordable housing in new developments.Why is this important?\nCurrent planning law states that if a developer will make less than 20% profit on a new development, they can ignore a council's regulations about building affordable and social housing.Leaked documents from several developers have shown that the maths they use to work out their profit margins are purposefully misleading, allowing them to claim they will make less than 20% profit on a development by undervaluing the prices of the houses they will sell and over-costing the labour.\nTo combat this, Islington, Greenwich, Lambeth and Bristol councils have introduced a policy that forces developers “viability assessments” to be made public.\nBy bringing these dodgy maths into the public domain, Councils, campaigning groups and individuals will be able to hold developers to account and force them to use more honest maths.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

With Greens in the Executive, the Council has introduced a 10-point plan for Climate Action, covering all organisations in the city and looking at jobs, housing, waste, energy, food and more.\n- Green action has meant property developers and businesses applying for additional recovery grants will have to say how they will address the climate crisis. This will mean businesses across the city taking practical measures, from reduction in plastics to sustainable urban drainage to increased renewable energy use.\n- Green Councillors succeeded in getting the council to declare a Nature Emergency; this includes reducing the use of the harmful weed-killer glyphosate, with the Council now running trials to go Glyphosate-free.\nMaking Sheffield a Fair city\n- Greens have made the Council take action on the cost of living crisis, with our councillors fighting to protect services to the most vulnerable. We also initiated a green Jobs and Skills strategy focussed on retrofitting home insulation, and got the council to investigate the “energiesprong” approach, aiming to make large numbers of homes warm, healthy and affordable.\n- Greens are pushing for new ideas to address the Council’s social care crisis, such as social care co-operatives.\n- Green Councillors have supported residents affected by unsafe cladding on tower blocks; supported refugees; spoke up for stronger migrant rights; worked to make public spaces safe for everyone; improved security for council tenants; stood alongside striking Just Eat couriers, University lecturers, and NHS staff for better pay and conditions.\nKeeping Sheffield Moving\n- Our Green councillors have got the go-ahead for a Clean Air Zone and unlocked millions of pounds in government grants for taxi-drivers and small businesses. This will make the city cleaner and healthier.\n- Green councillors kept the city centre around Pinstone St safe for people to walk and cycle. The street remains pedestrianised and will be transformed in the future. Green councillors also won agreements for a FreeBee city centre shuttle bus and a pavement parking ban for the city centre, making getting about easier for everyone.\n- Greens have worked hard to get Active Travel cycling and walking improvements in place across Sheffield, linking up the city. We’re also actively supporting the Upper Don Trail which will offer a safe route to the city centre from Walkley, Hillsborough and beyond.\nListening to every resident\n- Greens backed the independent “It’s Our City!” campaign that called for the end to the ‘Strong Leader’ way of running the council. Green councillors have been pushing for more openness in the new ‘modern committee’ system to involve ordinary people more.\n- Green Councillors secured an independent inquiry into the Sheffield street trees felling scandal. Many Green councillors played a role in the protests. This inquiry will help achieve “truth and reconciliation”.\n- Our Green councillors have close links with voluntary groups and charities and have been pushing to make sure these groups are involved more in Council decisions and services. Our Green councillors also work hard for residents on everyday issues, actively making the Council work better.\nJoin us in working for justice, equality and protection of the natural resources that sustain us, to transform Sheffield into a fairer, greener place to live and work.",

After our recent election successes, it is good to see Sheffield Council taking on our proposals for cleaner, faster and more efficient travel. If followed through, these should improve journeys for all residents.”\n“The Greens have long supported a 20 mph limit for the city centre; support for low emission taxis; investment in cycling and pedestrian infrastructure; public ownership of the rail network and re-regulation of bus services.

Details can be found here but, please, also follow us on Twitter @chile50yrsUK and Facebook . The campaign aims to commemorate the victims of the September 11th 1973 coup and celebrate the solidarity that the Chilean exiled community received from the labour and freedom movements in the UK. We must, however, not forget that, at the same time, Pinochet was protected and supported by successive British governments, most prominently the one led by Margaret Thatcher.\nThe military coup in Chile was supported by the American government and unseated the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende. It was a crime against the Chilean people and instigated 17 years of oppression led by the dictator General Pinochet. It dragged the nation towards an economic path that increased inequality and social division.\nThe economic system imposed with extreme brutality by Pinochet and his allies was led by fanatic neoliberal economists, who religiously believed that an economy based on competition, greed and infinite growth would have brought freedom and welfare. This ideology was eventually adopted across the world, with disastrous consequences. The social and climatic catastrophe that we are currently experiencing is the result of such dogmatic thinking.\nIt is vital that we remember the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Chilean military regime as well as its dark legacy for the future of the world as sadly seen nowadays in several countries across the world, including Britain. Please come along to our day of commemoration on the 9th of September (details in the poster).",

This would be funny had the Conservatives not managed to wreck the economy, leaving many people struggling with much higher food, fuel and housing costs.\n“The only way anyone can have the mandate to govern the country now is with a general election and let the people decide, not a small number of Conservative Party MPs.\n“Meanwhile, Green councillors in Sheffield and across the country will continue to do what we can to stand up for our communities, tackle the climate emergency and work hard for a better future for us all.”\nUmberto Albarella, Chair of Sheffield Green Party said “I completely agree with Caroline Lucas, who said anything other than a General Election is undemocratic. The Tory Party has spent its time in government to wreck the country for the interest of the few. They have substantially eroded our liberty, compromised environment and economy, and brought our country into disrepute. While people starve and struggle we cannot possibly afford to have another incompetent Tory Prime Minister in charge. Enough is enough” ”\nSheffield Central Green Party Candidate, Alison Teal said “The Tories have no electoral mandate to impose Austerity 2. Our Council and the people of Sheffield can not afford more cuts to vital services. We must have a General Election now.”",

Marieanne asked when traffic cameras are coming, as in other parts of the country.\nCllr Elliot said,\n“Establishing School Streets around a number of Sheffield schools has been a good initiative with many positive benefits. In some areas, its success has relied heavily on parents and local residents who have volunteered their time. The volunteers help to make sure that people are aware of the traffic restrictions at drop-off and pick-up times. They are doing a fantastic job in sometimes challenging situations. Despite being clearly signed and legally backed by a traffic regulation order, in some cases, the restrictions are being ignored, which puts the volunteers in a very difficult position.”\n“New traffic management legislation now makes it possible for councils to enforce ‘moving traffic’ offences using cameras. I think that this approach could be used on the School Streets to support our amazing volunteers and help keep children safe on their journeys to and from school.”\n“I raised this at a recent full council meeting, calling for the use of traffic cameras, where needed. This would make the initiative more effective. Other Councils, such as Oldham and the London Borough of Ealing are already using Automatic Number Plate recognition on their School Streets. Leicester have recently decided to get cameras too. I hope that Sheffield will follow and make our School Streets even safer.”",

(1)\nA similar levy in Nottingham raised £64 million in its first seven years and the city has benefited from increased inward investment, as businesses have recognised the value of good quality public transport and an active travel network.(2)\nOnly larger employers would be affected. For example, a levy planned to be introduced in Leicester this year will only apply to employers who have 10 or more parking spaces and does not apply to spaces for blue badge holders or to parking spaces for emergency services employees.\nCllr Christine Gilligan, says:\n“We can, and will, put pressure on the Conservative Government to properly fund public transport but the Workplace Parking Levy is something Sheffield City Council can do themselves to draw in funds to support buses, trams, trains and cycling and walking.

The Labour Council asked a High Court judge to imprison an opposition Green councillor on the strength of wishful evidence which the judge described as “mistaken”. They are your elected representatives, supposed to be making decisions in the best interests of the community. You may want to question why they used public money to try to rid themselves of an opposition councillor.\nThe court also heard how the Council had changed the words of the formal injunction from what the judge actually ordered, to what one officer described as ‘the spirit of the judgment.’ This attempt to intimidate and mislead the public is dishonest and quite frankly disgraceful.\nThis case comes after Labour Councillors voted me out of a full Council meeting for daring to suggest that Cllr Bryan Lodge had ‘misled’ the public. All 28 opposition councillors walked out in protest.\nInternal complaints are still being pursued against me by the council’s Legal Director who accuses me of “bringing the Council into disrepute” and breaching the councillors’ Code of Conduct. I was arrested in February under anti-trade union legislation (the 1992 Trade Union and Labour Relations Act) which the Crown Prosecution Service dropped due to lack of evidence.\nIn my opinion, the Labour Executive are doing a remarkable and unfortunate job of bringing Sheffield Council into disrepute locally, nationally and internationally.\nThe Council prefer to intimidate and bully opposition councillors and residents opposed to their horrendously short-sighted tree felling programme, rather than listen to residents and make informed decisions to retain thousands of healthy street trees.\nI have no choice but to call publicly for the Council to be held accountable for their expensive, politically motivated, and punitive legal action against me and other Sheffield residents opposed to their tree felling programme.\nCllr Alison Teal\nGreen Party\nLetter to Sheffield Star.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The LibDems proposed a vote to limit the amendments we could put in. Labour supported them whilst we objected. It may seem petty but it is yet another restriction on elected councillors having their say, instead having to channel everything through the party leadership.\nPetitions and public questions\nOn to petitions – with one on bridleways. It’s a less common mode of transport but has implications for improving off-road routes. Public questions followed. Ruth Hubbard, of the It’s Our City petition, asked the Council to embrace change but was given a hostile response by the Leader, Cllr Julie Dore. Calvin Payne asked about the Council’s role in actions, which the Independent Office of Police Conduct had recently found to be wrong. As usual, all questions on “trees” and people connected with tree protests were lumped together at the end instead of being treated like other members of the public.\nMembers’ Questions\nWe then moved on to Members’ Questions, which became a bit more lively. Just before the meeting, the Cabinet provided 29 pages of written answers to councillors’ questions, to which we had the chance to ask a few supplementary ones.\nI received a number of vague reassurances that “good progress” was being made so I asked what “good progress” on the Workplace Parking Levy (a Green idea) and the Inner Ring Road expansion (definitely not a Green idea) looked like. Cllr Jack Scott made it clear he was not going to give us any genuine or informative answers. However, he did confirm no further consultation was planned. The theme of Labour councillors in the Executive abusing their power to keep things secret was going to develop.\nCIL – the Community Infrastructure Levy – and central control\nThe first motion on the agenda (by the LibDems) was about spending the “Community Infrastructure Levy” (or CIL, the replacement for “section 106” or “planning gain” money). This levy is paid by property developers to compensate for the loss of open space or increase in traffic. Most of it (85%) is controlled centrally by the council and is spent on big schemes in the “Regulation 123 list” and administration. The remaining 15% is meant for parish councils or other ward-level areas. However, none has been spent since 2015. The real reason is this: by far the largest amount of CIL comes from city centre development. This is in City Ward, where Green councillors have a majority. So Labour’s proposal is to redistribute it to other wards.\nLies and more lies?\nNormally, officers provide quarterly reports on the amount of CIL money collected by ward. However, they were then instructed by Cabinet Members not to release any further information to us. When I put the question to Cabinet, Cllr Jack Scott denied this, saying that “no such instruction was given,” so I called him out on this apparent untruth. There was commotion amongst councillors and another complaint from the Labour Whip.\nWhat was even more blatant was that Cllr Scott, in his oral answers, told us that some information from officers was only provided for Labour members and that if we wanted this data we should “join the Labour Party.”\nThis led on to the debate on CIL. Our amendment pointed out that the consultation was a stitch-up made of leading questions. Instead, we said it should be spent in the communities most blighted by big building developments.\nWorkers’ rights\nWe supported the Labour motion promoting the TUC’s “Great jobs agenda.” Strangely, that didn’t stop Labour councillors attacking us for it. Many Labour councillors are of course sponsored (i.e. paid) by unions.\nCllr Martin Phipps seconded Alison Teal’s amendment, welcoming the steps towards making SCC a living wage employer (something originally proposed by Green Councillor Bernard Little in 2009) and noting that insecure work is a product of a system that puts profit over people.\nMartin noted the huge importance of unions for a healthy society and sadness that we have reached a point where a job paying enough to live on is considered a ‘great’ one. He described the impact insecure and lowly paid work has on people’s mental and physical health.\nHowever, Labour councillors voted against our proposal that would actually help workers in Sheffield and counter the effect of Government cuts to legal aid. We had asked officers to look for funding for three advice workers to advise on employment rights.\nReduce, reuse, recycle… or privatise instead\nOn waste and recycling, we criticised the Administration’s triumphant motion on the new brown bins. We pointed out that Sheffield came 314th out of 350 local authorities in the recycling league table, which is not something to be proud of. Cllr Martin Phipps pointed out that “over two thirds of our waste is incinerated, with the incinerator’s CO2 levels rising year on year. We are left behind as an authority, with waste food recycling seen as standard elsewhere, no plastics apart from bottles collected and not even aluminium foil or trays being recycling.”\nCllr Rob Murphy added that these problems all stem from being tied into a long-term contract with Veolia – signed by the LibDems and extended by Labour.\nTransport\nFinally, we came to our transport motion. In Members’ Questions, Cllr Rob Murphy had asked the Leader of the Council if she had been consulted on the Regional Mayor’s plans to spend public money at Doncaster/Sheffield airport. She hadn’t, so Rob followed up with asking if she thought she should have been.\nRob explained that people in Sheffield want to see local transport improvements instead of using public money for the benefit of big business. Cllr Alison Teal asked the chamber if it was serious about climate change and referred to the case of Phoenix, Arizona where the effects of climate change had grounded planes. I commented that, with even the Leader of the Council not being consulted of Mayor Dan Jarvis’s plans, this was yet another failure of openness in the way Sheffield City Region hands out millions of pounds of grants to profit-making businesses.\nMore questions, not so many answers\nIn answer to other questions, we also learnt the council had failed to comply with the legal requirement to publish the official verification number [relevant to the It’s Our City petition] because of an “oversight.” We heard the council is carrying out an assessment of the impact of Brexit. All parks are assessed against something called the “Sheffield Quality Standard” which includes accessibility for disabled people. We were promised that agendas and minutes of the Health & Wellbeing Board would be published from now on.\nAnd the new home for the Central Library?\nWe also received some more evasive answers – Alison Teal asked how the council manages conflicts of interest around academies. Kaltum Rivers asked about funding and re-staffing public libraries.\nI asked about Council plans to move the Central Library to the new HSBC building on the Moor – the official address is Grosvenor House, 1 Wellington St. Cllr Mary Lea neither confirmed nor denied. This may well come up again in the future.\nWith all that done, and Magid’s effective chairing – many councillors were stopped from speaking for too long – the meeting ended at a record early time of 5.30pm.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments. We do reserve the right not to publish comments that may cause offence.\n3 thoughts on “Report from September’s council meeting”",

There is no doubt that prices are going up and up, but we should remember that many people were struggling to buy basic food items before the invasion of Ukraine.\nIn January, poverty campaigner Jack Monroe, called for an alternative Retail Price Index to reflect the prices of essential items, and how much more money people are spending on basics. The shocks of the pandemic and Brexit have increased food prices and made trade harder. But, as a country with the 5th largest economy in the world, why are so many people in food poverty?\nIt is because of political choices.\nAt a national level, Universal Basic Income and rent control measures could be implemented. Locally, the council should be supporting the many community organisations in the city, like Food Works, Food Hall, St Mary’s and the network of food banks, to mention a few. Supporting advice services would help people get out of food poverty.\nLast year, the council’s cross-party Food Poverty Working Group found that a lot of people were already struggling to put food on the table. This is now much worse, with the extreme rise in energy prices and people being forced to choose whether to heat or eat. The council have now agreed a Green motion to re-start the cross-party group, which will look at the whole cost-of-living crisis.\nThere are many solutions if we choose to take them. If we were in a warzone like Ukraine or Yemen, it would be understandable that people were going hungry. But we aren’t.",

Water companies were banned from disconnecting water supplies for non-payment in 1999 but council tenants can still be evicted if they get into debt.\nThe Green proposal came in an amendment to the council meeting on 6th December 2017, asking the council to account for water bills separately from rent accounts and ceasing to pursue eviction in the courts because of water rates;\nSpeaking on the proposal, Cllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“I spent many years helping council tenants stop evictions when they got into debt. In every case, the council relies on non-payment of the water rates, as well as rent arrears. It is not enough for the council to say it will not evict where rent arears are solely due to delays in universal credit.\n“The Council has a chance to make a real difference to the lives of council tenants at a time of crisis, simply by bringing their cases into line with everyone else.\nAfter Labour councillors voted against the proposal, Cllr Alison Teal said,\n“It was disappointing to see Labour councillors speak out so strongly against the idea and even deny that water charges were ever used to evict tenants.”\nNotes\n- The proposal from Sheffield Green Party was:\n“That this Council notes that, in Sheffield, only Council tenants can be evicted from their homes if they cannot pay water bills on time and therefore calls on the Administration to end this practice by accounting for water bills separately from rent accounts and ceasing to pursue eviction in the courts because of water rates;” - The amendments are available with the Council agenda at: http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=6694\n- The Labour group of councillors voted against the proposal.\n- Housing benefit is not payable for water rates, even where they are payable under the tenancy agreement.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It is something that we have been campaigning on and working hard to achieve for many years.\n“The Greens were the first to push for 20mph zones in Sheffield, and have been doing so since 2008. We have included funding for this measure annually in our fully costed Council budgets since 2014.\n“A city centre 20mph speed limit zone will greatly improve the safety of city centre residents, who currently face the worst road traffic accident rates in Sheffield. We of course understand it is necessary for some people to use cars in the city centre but this limit is needed to protect pedestrians and cyclists.\n“We are glad that the Council has now decided it agrees with us, but regret that this couldn’t have happened earlier when we were first proposing the policy.”\n[1] http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=1892\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Bus services are controlled by the South Yorkshire Mayoral Authority not Sheffield City Council.\nFollowing the service cuts last October, Hillsborough Green councillors suggested a shuttle bus solution directly to the elected Labour Mayor Oliver Coppard. Only the mayor can create and fund new bus services.\nThe loss of the 52A from Hillsborough Interchange through to Wadsley, Wisewood and Loxley has had devastating impacts:\nWorking people and parents lost a frequent, direct service to central Sheffield and to key employers such as the hospitals and universities plus secondary schools. It forces people to drive where they have access to a car.\nOlder and vulnerable people lost a frequent, 7 days a week, option for daily shopping, medical appointments or just going out and about. The replacement 31 often fails to turn up or is full. It only runs hourly in the daytime and not on Sundays.\nHillsborough Greens regret this misrepresentation of the hard work that all local councillors are doing to restore adequate bus services following the changes last October.

Tramlines did not want to manage the extra safety issues at tram stops with not enough trams to get everyone home. In these circumstances they made a collective decision to pull ALL tram services from around 9pm on Friday and Saturday, and 8pm on Sunday between Shalesmoor and Middlewood/Malin Bridge.\nTramlines is an inner city festival with public transport provision minimising car use to reduce the many impacts on local roads and residents and keep the event safe. 28% arrived and 20% went home by tram at the previous event in 2019. A short notice decision to leave thousands without their planned transport home and local residents with no tram service is irresponsible. It will have forced many more people into cars and created new unplanned safety issues as thousands had no choice but to walk home.\nIn being part of this collective decision, Tramlines failed in their responsibilities to festival goers. As for Stagecoach Supertram, it wouldn’t be down to a private commercial decision if public transport was back under public control and everyone had a vested interest in running successful and safe major events.

Many questions remain inadequately answered. The outcome is that the new PSPO:\n- criminalises homeless people without providing new resources to help them\n- was made without a disability impact assessment when most people sleeping rough have mental or physical health issues, including brain injuries\n- was made without a race impact assessment and ignores Sheffield’s Race Equality Commission recommendations\n- undermines the expert local knowledge of the Archer Project, Ben’s Centre and other front-line organisations\n- will drive nuisance behaviours into residential areas\n- doesn’t provide any more resources, either to enforce the PSPO or support services\nCllr Marieanne Elliot, the sole Green Party representative on the committee, said;\n“The Committee only had around one hour to discuss this proposal of huge significance. This clearly wasn’t long enough and the Chair stopped me asking all my questions. There are still so many uncomfortable truths that haven’t properly been considered.\n“Although the proposal has been amended since it first came to Committee in January and now includes an ‘enforcement and support’ approach, the much-needed support route lacks detail and clarity. This was raised by organisations helping to deal with the behaviours arising from the social issues that the PSPO powers can enforce against. There is no extra resource for these amazing voluntary sector organisations, which is a real shame. It was also disappointing to see that their feedback was not given due weight in the consultation process – I was expecting to see a section with the professional opinions highlighted and also expected they should be involved in ongoing, genuine consultation as promised in a Council FAQs document produced in December 2023. I was disappointed to learn that the Sheffield Hallam University academics, who offered a wealth of expertise and research, were also not properly involved, as promised.\n“I’m very concerned by the decision not to undertake a full equality impact assessment. Given the nature of the proposal it should have been clear that people with the protected characteristics of race and disability will be disproportionately impacted, yet there is no explicit reference to these groups. The PSPO report and recommendations therefore cannot be relied on and, according to Liberty, could be unlawful. I proposed deferring the decision but this was not supported by any of the Labour or Lib Dem councillors.\n“Sheffield should have taken the opportunity to show we do things in a more compassionate way instead of feeding intolerance and discrimination. I couldn’t support a proposal that hasn’t considered the legal duties on disability and race. Sheffield’s Race Equality Commission recommendations include Action 2 d) ‘make transparent the use of robust Equality Impact Assessments that are less tick-box and more holistic in order to drive improved understanding of potential change impacts on ethnic groups.’ This clearly hasn’t happened.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson, who represents City Ward where the PSPO will be in force, added;\n“The ward councillors do not support this measure. Nor do the experts in the voluntary sector services that we are proud to support. As a result of their efforts, the council already admits that Sheffield is one of the safest cities in the UK. We have so much expertise amongst the people who actually do the work that it is disappointing to see their views sidelined.\n“The hundreds of people who wrote out comments did not support the PSPO either. Although a majority of consultation respondents said they supported the proposals, most of the people who gave reasoned comments were “negative,” “mixed” or, at best, “neutral” towards having a PSPO. Whilst we have all seen anti-social behaviour, I pointed out that a PSPO will not make it disappear and the council has admitted it will not stop anti-social behaviour.\n“What’s more, having a PSPO in place damages the really good work that has been done to keep Sheffield’s streets safe and to look after the many people with brain injuries and other social care needs.\n“The PSPO will shift nuisance behaviours to areas such as Netherthorpe, Lansdowne, Leverton, St Mary’s, Highfield, Park Hill flats and Kelham Island. This is acknowledged by the council but there is no plan and no resource to tackle the displacement.\n“We were informed by officers, learning from other towns and cities, PSPOs can work if they are given sufficient resources. However, no extra resources are being provided in Sheffield.”\nOverall, the comments in the consultation were not favourable to the introduction of a PSPO. Of the 1205 individual respondents, 872 gave further comments. Of these, only 8% of those were classed as “positive” compared to 52% “negative.” Of the 77 organisations that responded, 57 gave further comments. None of these were classed as “positive”.",

We’ve had a lot of issues locally. Supermarkets have opened in the area and put the squeeze on local shops. Demand for school places has increased with a lot of families moving to the area, but the route towards solutions has been a bit haphazard. I’ve helped out with campaigns, including the protest against the felling of the Rustlings Road trees and scrutiny of the new Bannerdale school. Lately we’ve been promoting the new Greystones and Whirlow 20mph area, making sure local people are aware of the scheme and the reasons behind it.”\n“As Government cuts put ever more pressure on Council services, especially for those struggling to get by, we need to push for changes in Sheffield. In Ecclesall we’re also working to make our area more sustainable. We have promoted what people can do differently – from making gardens greener to throwing a street party! A low-carbon lifestyle is about putting caring and happiness above buying stuff that we don’t need. It’s good for us and our planet.”\n“I work as a researcher, a parent, and as a PhD student.

It also means that the UK is less at the mercy of dubious and undemocratic regimes with poor human rights records that are often the suppliers of fossil fuels.”\nThe Green motion proposes that the Council carries out an audit of all its land and buildings to assess their potential for renewable energy and calls for a wider plan across the whole of Sheffield to see what can be done to boost renewable technologies in partnership with landowners and interested parties such as the National Grid and renewable energy installers.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, who Chairs Sheffield City Council’s Housing Committee, said,\n“ One of the most exciting proposals in our motion was calling on the Council to develop a compelling offer for householders, to install solar photovoltaic panels and energy saving measures in their own homes. This could make a real difference to people wanting to reduce the amount of energy they use and the bills they have to pay.”\nOther proposals in the motion called for changes to the Sheffield Local Plan to encourage renewable energy installations, encouragement for community investment and a strong emphasis on skills and training.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“We need to grow a skilled local workforce to deliver renewable energy projects in our area. These will be the sort of jobs we are going to need for decades to come, and will provide the security people will need to build their lives upon. The Council needs to be looking to the future and our successful proposal on renewable energy will provide real hope that it is a brighter one and a greener one.”\nReferences\n(1) Renewable Energy Strategy motion to Sheffield City Council",

There were Christmas chocolates, a collection for charity and a non-qualified teacher struggling to control a class of unruly children, even with the Chief Executive and Monitoring Officer acting as teaching assistants. Even those in the public gallery came very close to being ordered to sit out in the corridor for noisy behaviour.\nPublic questions this time covered the lack of democracy, the attempt to send Cllr Alison Teal to prison, air pollution, flaws in the planning process, wheelchair spaces on buses, closure of the Minor Injuries Unit and repairs to the Old Town Hall.\nMartin Phipps asked about the air pollution impact of council plans to widen the Inner Ring Road from two lanes to three. Cllr Scott denied this was a road-widening scheme. Jenny Carpenter asked about progress on an ethical procurement policy that had been promised in 2014 (now promised ‘soon’). Peter Garbutt asked why the council was spending time debating national topics it had no control over. Richard Davis asked about the accuracy of information about Amey’s health and safety infringements. Annie Taverner asked whether we had got beyond the days of the miners’ strike when masked officers would attack protesting miners.\nWhen asked about the reputation of the city in the ongoing trees debacle and selling off the Central Library, the answer of Cllr Julie Dore was – inexplicably – that “most cities are envious of being in our position.”\nThere was a dignified and thoughtful petition from Graham Jones talking about real work a group of residents had done in Pitsmoor to inform people about the dangers of air pollution and what they could do. They had collected signatures by talking to people at school gates and in doctors’ surgeries. The vast majority were concerned and respectful. Graham stressed the importance of being informed, constructive and polite. This lesson was evidently lost on members of the council.\nMembers Questions is an opportunity for councillors to ask questions and for Cabinet Members to avoid answering them. I asked when we would hear more about commercial interest in the Central Library. The answer was “shortly.” What councillors did not know at the time was that selected media had already been informed even if councillors hadn’t.\nWe put amendments to motions opposing the closure of the Minor Injuries Unit and Walk-in centre, on the Council’s moral duty to protect the city’s children, and calling for an end to evictions of council tenants for debts of water rates. Other householders can’t even be disconnected for non-payment and we think there should be an end to this discrepancy.\nOur main motion called for an independent enquiry into the conduct of members of the Administration and Council officers around the council’s application to the High Court to send Cllr Alison Teal to prison.\nUnfortunately, senior council officers objected to use of the words “to prison,” claiming they were “inaccurate.” It is indeed an astonishing discovery to find the official, if absurd, position of the council is that it never applied to send Alison to prison at all.\nUnfortunately, instead of the usual process of giving us advice about formal wording, the officers deleted them and added some extra words of their own. This is certainly not permitted by the council’s constitution, raising serious questions about the relationship between elected members and paid officers on political matters.\nThere was more success with our Play Streets motion, inspired by Alison’s successful event on Wake Road in the summer. Whilst Labour couldn’t resist deleting the bulk of our motion, it did result in a positive statement that the Council was now designing a “transparent policy on street play.”\nThe meeting ended in a sea of increasing chaos with a report on significant changes to the constitution being voted on without proper debate. The changes will allow the Monitoring Officer to pursue her own complaints against councillors even where no external complaint has been made. The reason this is constitutionally unsound is because the Monitoring Officer has the role of overseeing the complaints process. I warned the council this makes her both judge and prosecution in her own case.\nBoth Alison and I (but no other councillors) had to make formal “declarations of interest” for this item, seeing that the Monitoring Officer has now accused both of us of breaching the Councillors protocols.\nFinally, the Lord Mayor wished us all a merry Christmas, told us to get home safely and probably hoped some councillors wouldn’t come back next term.\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nCity Ward Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Many people are away for extended school, university and Easter holidays and will miss collections, creating a 4 or 8 week collection gap. University of Sheffield student houses will miss one or both of their April blue and brown bin collections. The occupants may have gone home by the time some of the June collections are made. It all creates overflowing bins and street mess before we then have to deal with the annual house clearance issues as student housing contracts end on June 30th.\nIn early 2017 the Labour Cabinet said they would look at terminating the 35-year Veolia contract but then renegotiated it later that year. The brown bin changeover costs are £6.6 million so it will be 9 years before annual savings of £750,000 actually kick in. This gives a clear indication that this is the bins system we will be stuck with until the contract ends in 2036.\nDavid Attenborough has inspired people to act on plastic recycling. He has just told us we have a decade to take urgent action to address the climate emergency. The Labour-run council voted against being carbon neutral by 2030, which many other councils have committed to. We have no recycling for plastics other than bottles and rely on the polluting incinerator for most other waste disposal. The Veolia contract is a clear hindrance to urgent climate emergency action in Sheffield.\nRuth Mersereau\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The council is now planning a pilot to encourage refillable water bottles.\nDouglas Johnson, Green Party Councillor for City Ward, said,\n“This is a simple, low-key, low-cost idea but is a great opportunity to promote health, money-saving and the environment.”\n“Drinking fresh water instead of sugary drinks is a great way for children to avoid tooth decay and diabetes in later life. It’s much cheaper if parents can get free refills in town and buying fewer drinks reduces the amount of discarded plastic bottles.\nIt’s win-win-win, so we look forward to the scheme being rolled out as soon as possible. We hope to see it extended citywide and invite businesses and other organisations to play their part.”\nNotes\n- The Green Party motion to the council meeting on 6th June 2018 refers to the problems of plastic waste, growing obesity crisis and childhood dental problems.\n- The Green Party budget amendment in 2018 included the proposal to :\n“commemorate the very origins of a municipal authority for public health by providing the public with clean, fresh water through the provision of drinking fountains in the city centre and major parks, thereby reducing waste and litter from single-use disposable plastics.” - Sugary drinks contribute to poor dental health, which affects children in poorer areas particularly. Green Party councillors brought the topic of oral and dental health to a council scrutiny committee in 2017 – see https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2017/07/15/green-party-councillor-welcomes-chance-to-debate-dental-health/\n- Sugary drinks also affect rising child obesity – see http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44261065\n- Sheffield Green Party’s motion for the full council on 6th June 2018 states:\nNotice of Motion Regarding “Promoting Health and Reducing Consumption” – Given By Councillor Douglas Johnson and To Be Seconded By Councillor Kaltum Rivers\nThat this Council:\n(a) notes the world-wide scourge of modern society consuming and disposing of large amounts of single-use plastic;\n(b) notes the recent analysis of public health data by the Local Government Association showing that one in 25 school children aged 10 or 11 are severely obese;\n(c) notes that tooth decay in children is a strong indicator of inequality and has a serious adverse effect on childhood health and life chances, leading to school absence and unnecessary surgery;\n(d) notes that Green Group councillors asked for the Healthier Communities and Adult Social Care Scrutiny and Policy Development Committee to look at the issue of dental health in 2017;\n(e) notes that the Green Group budget amendment in 2018 included a proposal to introduce drinking water fountains in the city centre and major parks, helping to improve health and reduce consumption of disposable plastics; and\n(f) therefore welcomes the introduction of new publicly accessible drinking fountains in Sheffield City Centre.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Increasing incidences of extremely heavy rain caused by climate change are also creating more problems for water companies as our current system of sewers can be overwhelmed.\nThe plans by Severn Trent Water Company to double the size of reservoirs such as Ladybower however are premature when so much of our water is wasted through leaking pipes.\nBefore considering such drastic action which will have a terrible impact on Derbyshire’s environment and biodiversity we should bring the water companies back into public ownership, to stop the money flowing out of the company to rich shareholders when it should be invested in improving the system.\nThe staggering figure of 151,329,000,000 litres of water lost by Severn Trent due to leaks in 2020/21 shows the complete lack of accountability the company has.\nNot only are the companies losing phenomenal amounts of clean water, but they also continue to discharge raw sewage into our waterways. Despite sewage being pumped into our rivers and seas 825 times a day last year, water company CEOs received nearly £15 million in bonuses. Water company shareholder dividends should be stopped until sewage and infrastructure repairs have been resolved.\nGreen Party Candidate for Ecclesall.\nSign the petition by Greenspaces\nFind out about your election candidates here.",

We acknowledge the need to build more housing – but it must be the right housing, of the right size, in the right place.\n2. The focus on the “number of dwellings” does nothing to address the complexity of housing need. There is a world of difference between 300,000 executive homes in the Green Belt and 300,000 student bedsits in the city centre but the Government’s proposed approach does not differentiate between these two extremes. Whether set locally or nationally, any targets must be broken down by size of dwelling.\n3. Developers aim to maximise profits by squeezing in as many separate “units” of accommodation as possible. However, this does harm to city centres like Sheffield, where there is a shortage of accommodation for families or for longer-term use. Conversely, there is an excess of student accommodation, which is not being filled. Having an overall target for new homes puts pressure on the local authority to meet the target with large numbers of very small flats instead of the range and mix of housing types that are needed.\nDelivering First Homes\n4. We understand this policy proposal to mean a reduction in the amount of affordable housing to rent, in order to increase sales of discounted housing.\n5. This is the wrong approach: there needs to be more affordable housing to rent and more social housing.\n6. The Government’s response to the earlier “First Homes” consultation demonstrates that most local authorities shared these concerns, whilst those organisations set to profit from this change (principally developers) supported the proposal.\nSupporting small and medium-sized developers\n7. We note this proposal will reduce the amount of affordable housing to be provided.\n8. Despite the headline, it appears that large property developers will be the main beneficiaries, as the proposal relates to threshold changes for “small sites” not “small businesses.”\n9. At present, property developers can be exempted from providing any affordable housing at all if the development is less than 10 properties. These building firms will not benefit from the proposed change.\n10. We do not support the lifting of this threshold. If a property developer is big enough to build at least 40 or 50 homes in one go, as is proposed, we do not believe most people would regard them as being a small business that should be exempt from any contribution to affordable housing whatsoever.\nExtension of the Permission in Principle consent regime\n11. We do not agree with this furthering weakening of planning control by local authorities. We oppose this move towards greater centralisation, taking power away from local communities.\n12. Whilst the permitted development scheme is different, it also has the effect of taking power away from local communities. Our experience is that the existing permitted development regime has led to poor quality residential conversions that cause problems for residents of both the conversions and neighbouring properties. As councillors, we have to respond to issues that could have been designed out had adequate planning controls been in place. We have been made aware by disabled people that permitted development conversions can result in inadequate access for disabled people because of the lack of local authority scrutiny. We therefore do not agree with increased deregulation. It conflicts with the aim of the “Planning for the Future” white paper to focus on good design.\n13. It also seems to offer little advantage for developers and we note the Government’s own evidence that developers have limited understanding of the current system “permission in principle” regime.\nEquality\n14. We are concerned that no equality impact assessment has been carried out on these proposals as a whole, other than for the First Homes proposal. Disabled people face many more barriers to adequate housing compared to the general population. BAME populations may face additional barriers due to lower average incomes and to family size.\n15. The public sector equality duty, which is the legal duty set out in section 149 of the Equality Act 2010, includes the particular duty to have due regard to the need to take steps to meet the needs of people with disabilities where they differ from the needs of those without disabilities. It also includes the duty to have due regard to the need to tackle prejudice and promote understanding. This may be particularly relevant, for instance, to the arrangements for affordable housing.\n16. The proposal should therefore not be taken forward without a full equality impact assessment.\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nSheffield Green Party\n1 October 2020\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We often hear it, but how many people in Sheffield feel it? There are many leafy streets and beautiful parks. There are also streets that feel grey. There are apartment blocks where it’s an expedition to get out into the sunshine.\nOn Saturday 27th April it will be 39 years since the official opening of Mount Pleasant Park in Sharrow. Mount Pleasant was one of six inner city parks built by the Council in the 1980s. People knew then that green spaces have huge benefits for our health and wellbeing. This matters for everyone, but especially for those who don’t have a garden.\nThere is research paper after research paper, including studies done in Sheffield, showing the benefits of green spaces. They improve child development, help mental and physical health, and reduce isolation for the elderly and refugees. Our public parks are free, so they benefit everyone in our city without barriers.\nThe council has got some money to invest in green spaces. I’ve worked to get more CCTV in Mount Pleasant Park, pushed for new playground equipment and signage, and a fantastic new park building with a cafe. But there is more that could be done. More urban gardens and allotments, more play spaces, more welcoming and safe parks, more accessible activities.\nInvesting in parks and green spaces has all kinds of long-term benefits; from educational, to economic, to environmental. We all want more parks. We all need more parks. We know the council could do with a lot more funding. But the council also needs the vision to involve local communities and commit to making a difference.\nWhen Mount Pleasant park turns 40 next year, maybe all councillors could work together and commit to making another six more parks in our wonderfully green city.",

Olivia’s tag stopped transmitting just four days after she left the immediate area of her home nest, and the last known location was over an area of land managed for driven grouse shooting at Broomhead. It is a similar story with the other two missing harriers.\n“There should be 300 breeding pairs of hen harriers in England, yet this year there were just nine, and already we are seeing loss of the young birds from those nests.\n“Sheffielders are being deprived of the opportunity to see these magnificent ‘sky dancers’ and our uplands depleted – removing opportunities too for small businesses and communities to benefit from the tourism they would attract.”\nNatalie Bennett, former Green Party leader who lives in Sheffield, said: “I’ve joined campaigners including Chris Packham and Mark Avery for several years now in calling for a ban on driven grouse shooting. This is an industry that’s linked to the illegal slaughter of raptors, but also the vast legal but highly disturbing slaughter of mountain hares and corvids, stouts, weasels and foxes, all to produce maximum numbers of grouse for shooting on and after the Inglorious Twelfth of August.\n“Driven grouse shooting is also associated with land management practices that increase the risk of flooding and reduce carbon storage. We are all paying a high price for this so-called ‘sport’ that a few engage in.”\nNotes\n(1) The RSPB report http://ww2.rspb.org.uk/community/ourwork/skydancer/b/skydancer/archive/2018/09/13/three-more-hen-harriers-disappear-suddenly.aspx\n(2) Sheffield Green Party’s report https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2018/08/09/sheffield-greens-release-report-about-destruction-and-slaughter-on-the-moors/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

They soon back-tracked after plastic cladding on Hanover Tower in Broomhall failed fire safety tests.\nAn investigation was promised. The Director of Housing said, “we will not rest in getting to the bottom of this matter.” The Cabinet Member at the time stated, “they took a piece of cladding to the tenants at a consultation and they didn’t put that up. That was the cladding that we asked for. That was the cladding that we were told was on the building.”\nHanover residents were told, “we need to look at every stage of the sign-off process for the works. Once we have the information we will take action against the contractor or SCC staff.”\nOver three years later, we now know the contractors merely did what they were told: it was the council’s own staff who specified the use of plastic cladding, despite residents and elected councillors being told otherwise.\nAn alternative report on what we now know is on the Sheffield Greens’ website at: www.sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/hanover.\nIt is unclear why this took over three years to come to light when the information must have been held by council staff all along. It is hard to believe the council now says it acted with “integrity” and that it hopes the report will “strengthen confidence in the council.” Residents and councillors were misled by their own staff.\nThe street trees fiasco exposed a culture of lies and cover-up.

The land was recently sold and the new owner says they want no trespassers as they are preparing a planning application to develop the site. The land was previously in private ownership, however the previous landowner did not make use of the land. For years, local residents and volunteers have been tending to the garden, maintaining the grass and creating a beautiful floral display. The week before last, a council ornithologist confirmed that birds are actively nesting on the site, and an investigation is currently being carried out by the ecology team at Sheffield City Council. Despite this, contractors have since removed a lot of the garden and felled two trees, which is a criminal offence while birds are nesting (The Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981).\nThe land has been enjoyed continuously by the public for over 60 years, including a footpath which has been in daily use for decades. Right of Way status is urgently needed to protect the path but it is necessary to demonstrate continuous public use.

The Precinct has suffered from numerous “drive to” supermarket approvals in surrounding areas and the loss of the Co-Op as a key footfall generator for other shops. This Lidl could lead to more shop closures in a vital but vulnerable District Shopping Centre.\nWe will end up living in communities without local shops, forcing us to use cars for shopping and creating even more traffic jams and harmful pollution. The climate emergency dictates a completely opposite approach. There is an urgent need for better public transport and safer cycling and walking options so people can choose to leave their cars at home, reducing congestion for all road users while improving dangerous air pollution and road safety.\nParents are now supporting the youth climate strikers who will have to live with the impact of today’s planning decisions. Hundreds of them are already concerned about their children walking from Hillsborough to Forge Valley and other schools in hazardous, polluted conditions.

It has to realise it can’t keep jamming more cars into the city and look at other alternatives, including bringing the nearby railway line back into use to offer a quick, easy route into town from the north of the city.\nThis ring road was only built 10 years ago, and is already supposed to be the most congested road in the city.

Their report outlined that the company had “systematically failed to deliver” the universal service obligation to deliver letters, prioritising more lucrative parcels instead.\nYou may be experiencing this in your household. We’ve been talking to posties who tell us that previous full staffing has been replaced by a new system with inadequate staffing that now requires 15% overtime to cover all rounds. It’s impacting Hillsborough, Stannington and Walkey in my sorting office area and deliveries on your road could now be entirely reliant on staff doing enough overtime.\nThese roads are sometimes seeing no post for a week and then it all arrives in one bundle. One customer told us they had posted a letter to themselves first class in desperation to test the system and were still waiting for it a week later.\nWe’ve been told that Royal Mail got behind in Sheffield during the snow and ice in December and has yet to get back on top of deliveries under this new system which management know does not work.\nCurrent strikes in public services are not just about pay. They are about long hours and poor working conditions leading to demotivated staff delivering poor service to customers. Strike votes are reaching the required threshold backed by massive public support as union membership soars. Even headteachers have indicated a willingness to strike.\nPlease thank your local postie for keeping things going despite the incompetence of Royal Mail’s management. They want the failings of the new systems to reach management at the highest levels so please submit a complaint via their website if you need to.\nWe also need the government to recognise the need to properly fund public services and pay staff adequately for the valuable jobs they perform on our behalf.\nCouncil election candidate, Hillsborough Green Party\nFind out about your election candidates here.",

IKEA were also due to pay more than £400,000 for sustainable travel improvements.\nDexter Johnstone got tired of waiting for the IKEA cycle improvements.\nJack Scott, Cabinet Member for Transport, eventually replied to the enquiries Dexter made on behalf of Cycle Sheffield. “The wording of condition 2 is less than ideal and leaves room for manoeuvre on the improvements that the developer had to provide. The general consensus is that it would be difficult to enforce it due to its lack of clarity and also as the construction works finished some time ago.”\nCycle Sheffield consistently presents detailed information to the council to ensure transport plans are cycle friendly, based on feedback from their many members riding in Sheffield every day. But we continue to see road scheme planning focused on cars with other forms of transport an afterthought. This is why the key deterrent for cycling in Sheffield in 2019 is that people simply don’t feel safe on our roads.\nThe council states that changes to the planning process will ensure this won’t happen again.\nDexter Johnstone now advises: “There won’t be any cycle infrastructure delivered as part of the Ikea development and the development itself has obstructed planned cycle routes in the area.” This is appalling for a massive development creating serious air pollution and public health issues.\nSheffielders urgently need better public transport and safer cycling and walking options so they can choose to leave their cars at home. This would reduce congestion for all road users while improving dangerous air pollution and road safety.

The event has boosted the profile of Hillsborough in a positive way.\nWhen considering the economic benefits, the focus generally falls on the 3 day event period. Tramlines arrived in Hillsborough Park in 2018 promising a boost for local businesses. Unfortunately, scheduling early headliners and removing the right to leave and re-enter now keeps people inside the venue, forced to buy expensive food and drink. Some local businesses get some benefit during the event whilst others lose out.\nBut businesses in Hillsborough are affected for much longer periods. Visitors stay away from Hillsborough Park when the fences are up. This year the big fences around most of the park were planned to be up for 12 days for the Arctic Monkeys in early June and 18 days for Tramlines in July. Now, due to the damage, most of the grassed area has been fenced off since July 23rd for repairs and reseeding. Many events have had to be cancelled including parkrun for a number of weekends.\nThere’s a clear relationship between park visitors and Hillsborough businesses. People who visit the park will often also go to high-quality cafes and shops within close walking distance. Many of these lose out whenever fences are up.\nThe council cannot just evaluate the benefits to Sheffield as a whole. The recent 14-page Tramlines Festival report for the Economic Development and Skills Policy Committee has no mention at all of the impact on Hillsborough businesses.\nWhat is the impact on visitor numbers to Hillsborough Park and the local area since the fences went up in early June? If significant, what actions are the council going to take to offset the ongoing damage to local businesses? Tramlines may be paying for the damage to Hillsborough Park but who is compensating local businesses for the ongoing loss of trade?\nMany people have a great experience for 3 days but many more local residents have had the quality of their lives degraded for the whole of this summer. No price can be placed upon that.\nCouncillor Toby Mallinson, Hillsborough Ward Green Party",

The right to protest is a vital part of our democracy, as the Council noted when supporting calls for an inquiry into the Orgreave picketing clashes in 1984.\nThe court heard the council’s claim for injunctions against 8 individuals – several defendants are Green Party members, including an elected councillor. The outcome is particularly important because the injunction was also sought against “persons unknown” – ie the general public. Like the felling of trees, the Council says legal proceedings are “a last resort.” This increasingly hollow statement brings the authority into disrepute.\nThe council barrister told the court the right to protest does not extend to direct action but had to concede there is no legal definition of “direct action.” He was also absolutely clear that the case only applied to roads, saying, “you can protest on the pavements as much as you like.” I wrote that down.\nThe Council also claimed that protests cost it many millions of pounds. This assertion was quickly withdrawn when challenged to back it up with evidence, such as in the Amey contract. It’s nonsense: published contract extracts state Amey “shall bear any loss suffered by any person which is caused by any Protester or Trespasser.”\nWhat next? The council didn’t get its interim injunctions but there will now be a trial from July 26th to 28th.

Local Green Rob Unwin said “It was great to be on a traffic-free road, with children playing and parents chatting. Air pollution was much lower when the road was closed to traffic.”\nWe’re also discussing with local residents how we can encourage drivers to turn off their engines when they’re parked. Rob added “Engine-idling can harm the vehicle; and is usually more expensive than turning the engine off. The pollution from an engine is dangerous to the health of people inside and outside the vehicle. If we all act, our area can have healthier streets.”\nMinor Injuries Unit save for now\nThanks to everyone who helped to save this Hallamshire Hospital service for now. Local Green Peter Garbutt commented “We worked with Sheffield Save Our NHS to collect signatures on their petition. And Green councillors pressed the Council to support the campaign to save the MIU.”\nDrains and gutters\nIn our last newsletter, we described our efforts to get action on bad-smelling drains in the Abbeydale Road area. Green Councillor Alison Teal said “Thanks very much to local people who have contacted us with information. I was shocked by the scale of the problem, with homes and businesses affected by odours and health problems.” We’ve also been discussing other drain problems, eg blocked gutters and gratings, with local residents.\nAlison added “If you have been affected by drain problems, please contact me with the details, so that we can press the Council, Amey and Yorkshire Water to take action.”\nRoad surfaces and pavement parking\nAlison Teal has spoken to many local residents concerned about the quality of the resurfacing of their roads and pavements by Amey. Alison said “In some places, the initial work was lower quality than expected; and in others the new surfaces have shown problems soon after completion. Green councillors argued years ago that the Labour and former Lib Dem- led Councils shouldn’t have given the work to a private contractor rather than have it done by Council workers.”\nWe’re also trying to tackle the widespread problem of parking on pavements in our area.\nLord Mayor at school\nNether Edge Primary School pupils impressed Green Councillor and Sheffield Lord Mayor Magid Magid during his recent visit. Magid said “I loved visiting this outstanding school. I was very pleased by how the children described their passion for the school and community, and by what makes them ambitious and confident learners. And I was delighted when pupils invited me to be an honorary pupil!” The children were just as struck by Magid, excitedly awaiting his arrival and with many keen to meet him.\nOther Green action\nAlison Teal and Peter Garbutt are working with community group Mums United and parents, police, schools and others to tackle the growing knife crime crisis. Peter said “For the sake of our young people, everyone needs to address this problem.” Alison added “We will be supporting some useful initiatives to support young people in our community.”\nWe’re encouraging the Council to listen to residents’ needs on estates like Lansdowne, and improve standards. And we welcomed a petition pressing the Council to require openness from housing developers about affordable housing because we need such housing locally.\nWe’ve persuaded a local business to deal with a destructive buddleia shrub which was causing problems for a neighbouring house on Wolseley Rd.\nYour Green candidate\nPeter Garbutt (see photo above) will be the Green Party candidate in our area in the May 201 9 Council elections.

Like Grenfell Tower, it is home to ethnically diverse and often low-income families. An estimated 78% of residents don’t have ready access to the internet.\nKey points:\n- After the Grenfell fire in 2017, the cladding on Hanover Tower was tested and found to be a material that failed fire safety tests.\n- Prior to installation in 2012, residents were consulted and told the cladding would be aluminium. Elected councillors on the planning committee were also told the panels would be aluminium.\n- Residents also raised the question of fire safety at the planning committee, which recommended a new fire risk assessment.\n- After the public consultations ended, council housing officers began referring to “Alucobond”, the composite material that was eventually fitted instead of solid aluminium.\n- An investigation was promised in July 2017 but the report has only now been released – over three years later.\n- In December 2018, the Council accepted there were no plans to claim costs against the contractors. However, in February 2019, it appointed external solicitors to advise it.\n- Green Councillors are now calling for further action to be taken.\nThe report is available at www.sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/hanover\nCouncillor Angela Argenzio, of Broomhill & Sharrow Vale Ward, where the tower is situated, said,\n“The residents of the Hanover Tower have waited a long time for this report that in fact provides no answers. They have endured three years of stress and the inconvenience of living on a building site.\n“Although the re-cladding work is itself complete, things are not back to normal as the green space surrounding the tower is still fenced off to allow the grass ruined by the heavy machinery to re-grow. Residents have endured all of lockdown without the opportunity to use the green space immediately outside their homes and they won’t be able to use it until next year, as the new grass needs to be established. People want to get on with their lives and put the whole episode behind them and yet they are reminded of it daily as their children cannot play outside.”\nHer ward colleague, Councillor Kaltum Rivers added,\n“Despite the length of time involved in the production of this report, residents are still left with the distinct impression that the same mistakes could be made again. The lack of accountability for the errors, oversights and apparent omissions from the various partners and council officers throughout the course of the project is astounding and utterly unacceptable.\n“If nothing else, what should follow on from this debacle is a significant change in the way contracts are awarded by the council so that those individuals and groups entrusted and paid to ensure the safety and quality of works accept the responsibility of failures that their positions are intended to prevent.”\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, leader of Sheffield’s Green group of councillors, said,\n“It’s been three years; three Cabinet members – and still no answers.\n“It’s totally unacceptable that residents and councillors were told one thing but officers decided they knew best. Even worse is that it has taken over three years to expose these failures. It is almost two years since the council admitted no claims would be brought against the contractor. If residents and councillors can’t trust paid officers to do what they say, it is no wonder the council suffers from resentment and distrust amongst its tenants and the wider public.”\n“We are therefore calling for a number of steps to learn from these revelations.”\nSian Berry, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales and a member of the London Assembly, added her comments on the Hanover Tower revelations, stating,\n“Time and again we have seen dangerous changes made to homes and the details of contracts and errors swept under the carpet.\n“All this was supposed to change after the Grenfell disaster but everywhere tenants and leaseholders are still being kept in the dark. A better future is only possible if residents have more real control over the decision affecting their homes.”\nThe Green councillors are now asking that the report is discussed at a Scrutiny Committee in line with a resolution of full council in July 2017.\nNotes\n- The Green councillors’ report, together with the council’s own report is available at www.sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/hanover\n- Cllrs Argenzio and Rivers have requested the Cabinet Member for:\na) proper compensation for tenants and leaseholders for the incredible stress and inconvenience unnecessarily caused by nearly three years of work on the tower block and waiting for a report that was delayed several times.\nb) disciplinary action against relevant officers.\nproposals for learning from the apparent failure of officers to perform their roles competently that put residents’ lives at risk and which have been exposed in c) this report. - Full council adopted the motion of Cllr Rob Murphy on 5th July 2017 to request a report to the Scrutiny Committee setting out:-\n(i) the reasons why the Hanover Tower Block came to fail fire safety tests;\n(ii) the cause of the failures; and\n(iii) the implications for other work carried out under the Decent Homes improvement scheme and for any other buildings in Sheffield.\nCllr Rivers has requested the report be on the agenda of the next meeting of the Safer and Stronger Communities Scrutiny and Policy Development Committee\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The people have spoken.\n“We are in a state of political crisis in the UK. But to understand that we need to look at the causes of the anger and frustration in Leave majority areas, Westminster austerity, our archaic Victorian voting system, and the concentration of power in London.\n“We have to be tough on Brexit and the causes of Brexit.\n“And we have to turn our focus to addressing the climate emergency, our social crisis that sees millions insecure and uncertain they’ll be able to feed and house themselves, the damage done to the NHS by privatisation and underfunding and the many problems in our education system.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It was state-of-the-art at that time, integrating coroner’s court, mortuary, post-mortem rooms, viewing chapel, witnesses’ waiting rooms and police accommodation together with a yard and stabling. Bomb damage in the Second World War led to internal remodelling in the 1950s before it was used as the Youth Court but it remains an important structure, close to two listed buildings and contributing significantly to the environment of the area.\nAbove all, it is an attractive and balanced building that lends a sense of calm to the area – no doubt something that was intended when family of the deceased had to attend the official courtroom of the coroner. However, it is not a listed building.\nThe court recently came under threat as a property developer gave notice of his intention to demolish it in August and clear the land to build flats on.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson explained, “I became aware of the plan to demolish the building and raised the concerns with council officers in the planning department and with heritage campaigners. I found out that the formal powers available to the council to protect our heritage are very limited.\n“I then talked directly to the developer about our concerns and we discussed the opportunities for a sensitive development of the area. He agreed to withdraw his application to demolish the building and to have a fresh look at what could be done with the site.”\nThe work with heritage campaigners has led to Green councillors asking the council to give further protection to the heritage of the Castlegate area, so that the forthcoming development there will preserve the remainder of the historic heart of the city.\nNo doubt, further plans for redevelopment will appear soon.

Hadfield & Son. The distinctive concrete frieze panels on the front of the building were added in 1967.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group on Sheffield City Council submitted a formal objection,\n“Regardless of its formal listed status, it is clearly a significant heritage asset in the area, where the character of the area is under threat because of piecemeal development.\nIf it is necessary to seek an Article 4 Direction to safeguard the building, I would support that course of action.\nIt seems to me that there is significant public opposition that should be properly taken into account. I would therefore ask that this demolition notice is deferred along with the related application.”\nOn hearing the announcement of the deferral Green Councillor Peter Garbutt, Green Councillor for Nether Edge and Sharrow ward said,\n“Local people value this building as part of their local heritage and would be dismayed to see it go. The news that the demolition notice has been withdrawn following local pressure is very welcome. The important thing now is to secure the future of the building and ensure that it is brought back into use.”\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson highlighted ongoing threats to Sheffield’s heritage.\n“This is far from the only historic building under threat of demolition. The Old Coroner’s Court on Nursery Street is still standing but in a dilapidated state after a Planning Inspector over-rode the views of the elected Planning Committee (1). The developer has now gone bust. At the time, heritage campaigners had to work hard to promote the value of such buildings when the council controversially cancelled the public consultation on a Conservation Area for Castlegate.\n“This fresh approach from the council is welcome. Local people should not have to continuously campaign to protect our past.”\nReferences\n1 – Old Coroner’s Court Sheffield: Developer due to demolish historic building goes bust | The Star",

One of those was to address the issue of homelessness. With funding provided to give every homeless person a place to stay, lockdown managed what hasn’t been done before, with many people getting the security of a home. But homelessness due to domestic abuse has increased in Sheffield through lockdown and the ban on evictions, which reduced homelessness in our city, is being eased away along with other support. A rise in people sleeping rough on Sheffield streets after the pandemic seems inevitable.\nLord John Bird, founder of the Big Issue, said this week on homelessness, “short-term ‘quick fixes’ are applied, which are far more expensive than if we could prevent people from sliding into homelessness in the first place.” We need to plan a way out of this. Not just homelessness, but all the long-term problems we face. That means facing up to some hard choices.\nThe ‘Future Generations Bill’ is currently in the House of Lords, backed by Lord Bird and led by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas in the House of Commons. It will require any Government or local authority in England to think about the impact of decisions made now on future generations. On our children and grandchildren. A similar act has already had an impact in Wales, pausing road building as the government there thinks seriously about clean air and child health. The pandemic has proven that we can protect people from hardship and poverty if the will is there. Please go to todayfortomorrow.org.uk to find out more and see how you can protect future generations.\nJason Leman\nEcclesall Green Party",

The circular service linked Gleadless Valley and Heeley, Nether Edge, Broomhill and Netherthorpe through to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and was withdrawn last August.\nIn September last year, Greens supported a petition initiated by Gleadless Valley Tenants and Residents Association to save the bus service. Green Councillors, Alexi Dimond, Marieanne Elliot and Paul Turpin together with Sally Pedley of Gleadless Valley Tenants and Residents Association wrote an open letter (1) to South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard asking him to intervene and seek another operator to run the service.\nGleadless Valley Green Councillor Alexi Dimond said,\n“This is great news and I’d like to thank the TARA and everyone who was involved in the campaign to restore the service. As soon as the service was cut, Green Councillors worked with the TARA to create a petition. We have played our part in keeping the petition going because we never gave up hope that a service that is so valued, particularly by many elderly residents, would return.\n“I would like to thank the Mayor Oliver Coppard for his intervention and for listening to those of us in the community who have been fighting these cuts for many months.\n“Unfortunately many bus services across Sheffield remain in a tenuous position due to rising costs and we need to be ever vigilant to ensure services are maintained. Many people on the lowest incomes cannot afford cars or taxis and so cuts like these affect people on the lowest incomes the most. That is why government support is so necessary, particularly at a time when so many households are under extreme cost of living pressures.”\nGleadless Valley Green Councillor Marieanne Elliot said,\n“As soon as we knew that the number 10 was going to stop running we started campaigning. I’m very pleased that the campaign has been successful. Over 1000 signatures were collected by the Gleadless Valley TARA and Green councillors because of the real impacts the loss of this service has had. Thank you to everyone who signed – it really made a positive difference.”\nCllr Paul Turpin says,\n“This service is vital for people across Sheffield who need to get to the hospital, whether it be for healthcare or to work. Clearly, this bus route means a lot to those who need it and I’m glad it is finally being reinstated.\n“It hasn’t escaped me that the loss of the service when Powells folded could have been avoided if the service wasn’t simply granted to the company with the lowest tender in the first place. Reliability and quality of service should always be a priority in these circumstances.”\nCllr Brian Holmshaw, Green Party Councillor for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale said:\n“The 10/10a is a vital service for getting to and from the Hallamshire Hospital from Endcliffe, Sharrow Vale, Hunters Bar and Brocco Bank and for young people attending King Edwards VII School and the primary schools in the area. Local councillors in the city campaigned hard for it’s return on behalf of our constituents, and I’m pleased to see that the Mayor’s office have responded positively.”\nCllr Bernard Little, Green Party Councillor for Walkley said,\n“I am delighted for residents who depend on the number 10 in getting to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and shop in Upperthorpe.”\nPhoto – Green Campaigner Rachel Hope with Green Councillor Marieanne Elliot collecting signatures for their petition to save the 10/10a bus service.\nNotes\n(1) The TARA and councillors’ letter can be found at: Open Letter calling for number 10/10a bus service to be restored from Gleadless Valley Green Councillors and Gleadless Valley TARA | Sheffield Green Party\n(2) The 10/10a route will operate from 24th July and will be run by Stagecoach.",

Led by Simon Ogden, who piloted the creation of the Five Weirs Walk, the project needs developments along the route to allow a 5 metre wide fully segregated walking and cycle path through sites.\nOn September 7th the council planning committee approved plans for a retail centre, including an Aldi store, on the vacant site opposite Hillsborough football ground. Most committee members appeared to be unaware or uninterested in the vital importance of accommodating the Upper Don Trail. Or the importance of upgrading a section of the notoriously substandard Penistone Road cycleway at the same time.\nSimon Ogden raised a number of significant issues in a 5 minute speech, outlining how the project would be critically undermined unless the plans were changed. In response, only Green Cllr Brian Holmshaw asked questions and sought clarifications from planning officers on this aspect of the application.\nWhile responding, the planning officer stated Penistone Road is not considered a Strategic Cycle Route, even though it’s on the Council’s official cycle map and is part of the National Cycle Network. But, with no right of comment or reply in planning committee meetings, Simon Ogden could not challenge the officer’s incorrect assertion.\nThe decision to approve the plans unchanged means there’s no guarantee of a proper cycle route through the site. The opportunity to deliver a high quality active travel route is gradually being eroded due to disinterest from those involved in the planning system in Sheffield.\nWe’re in a climate emergency and it requires new thinking to respond to new challenges coming thick and fast. Not a planning department and planning committee members stuck in the past with a business as usual mindset.",

The many billions the Government spends on nuclear power would be more cost effectively spent insulating peoples homes and expanding renewable energy with energy storage.\n“The problem of how to safely contain toxic nuclear waste for thousands of years has still not been resolved (1) and the history of nuclear power is one of accidents and some catastrophic ones.”\nCouncillor Nottage also criticised Labour prioritising investment in aviation.\n“Minor improvements to the efficiency of aircraft will not negate the unregulated, uncontrolled carbon emissions of the aviation sector.\n“The aviation industry’s non-binding goal of being net zero by 2050 is meaningless and, even if it were possible, would be too late to address the climate impacts of air travel. The Council should not be pandering to the fantasy that the aviation sector will be able to significantly reduce emissions through any other means than reducing the number of flights.\n“When local Labour leaders decided to bid for failed former Prime Minister Liz Truss’s Investment Zone proposal, it had a choice of what it could bid for. (2) Instead of seeking funding for ‘green industries’ it chose instead to go for ‘advanced manufacturing’. Instead of technologies that could super insulate thousands of homes or have more of our energy generated locally by renewables, they chose to help an arms manufacturer build aircraft a little bit better for those who can afford foreign holidays. They chose to back the few who can afford flights, not the many who can’t afford their energy bills . They made the wrong choice”.\nReferences\n1 – Boeing, the world’s second largest arms manufacturer.

Domestic heating is one of the big issues for CO2 emissions and another is the huge amount of carbon released in traditional construction.\nIt’s absolutely critical for the service-wide plan to have climate change as a priority as it takes time to face up to the serious challenge ahead of us.\nOur range of other proposals will offer protection to older and disabled tenants from new charges for gardening. We want to support local businesses that face constant problems with business rates. We want to see real action on preserving and maintaining open spaces that are so much under threat at present.”\nThe amendments come after Green councillors submitted a motion calling for a cross-party Climate Emergency Committee and more green jobs.\nCllr Alison Teal added,\n“Our Green Group motion urges the Council to act on the Climate Emergency, which we declared a year ago, yet no changes have been made.

But it was burning near Wyming Brook Nature Reserve at Redmires which was very obviously spreading smoke into adjacent urban areas from around 10am.\nVery quickly local residents complained of smoke and through the day complaints increased from almost all of west Sheffield. The Fire Service said the smoke was due to moorland burning.\nEcclesall resident and Green activist, Peter Gilbert commented,\n“Air quality sensors across the city showed elevated levels of pollutants well beyond safe limits (Air quality sensor network).\nThis level of smoke pollution is not just an inconvenience but causes immediate respiratory difficulty for anyone with existing health problems and Public Health experts in Sheffield tell us there is no safe level of air pollution. Of great concern is the level of PM2.5 particulates which are tiny particles that can become lodged in our lungs and bloodstream with a proven link to increased respiratory health problems.”\nSo why are people in Sheffield being subjected to this?\nEvery year from 1st October to 15th April Grouse Moor owners burn heather with virtually no oversight of the resulting air pollution.\nHeather is burnt to create artificially high numbers of grouse. It benefits a handful of wealthy landowners and their pay-to-kill clients, with total disregard for the pollution and resulting health problems endured by thousands of local residents.\nBob Berzins, Moorlands campaigner, inspected the burn sites near Wyming Brook which revealed around 30 separate burns, so intense they incinerated all the vegetation. It was the intensity of these burns which created so much smoke.\nPrior to burning a mower was used to create a fire break to stop the flames spreading and the same mower could have been used to cut all the heather instead of burning. Mowing vegetation is an accepted and well used management tool and produces no smoke. So the burning which took place was a matter of choice not necessity.\nNatalie Bennett, Green Peer in the House of Lords, is very active in highlighting the need to end this outdated practice.\nNatalie said “The overwhelming scientific evidence points to burning on peatlands causing damage to key peatland species, peatland ecosystem health, and the sustainability of peatland soils. There is a clear alternative – restoration of our uplands for the benefit of all.\nThe events of 9th October demonstrate the culture of grouse shooting is incompatible with the health and wellbeing of the people of Sheffield. Driven grouse shooting has no place in our society and we call for a complete ban.”\nYours sincerely\nMarieanne Elliot\nGreen councillor for Gleadless Valley\nGroup Spokesperson for Communities, Parks and Leisure Committee",

Julie Dore was there to answer the committee’s questions about bringing Youth Services back into the Council and as usual it hardly seemed to matter what she said, Labour would win the vote with their majority regardless, except this time, they didn’t.\nThe Leader commenced proceedings with a salvo of insults aimed at the LibDem committee members, they were to blame, apparently, for austerity. Ironically, the fact she’s been implementing the cuts and not fighting them for years seems to have escaped her attention.\nAfter 20 years of the charity ‘Sheffield Futures’ running the city’s Youth Services, EU legislation has forced the end of the contract which has to either be put out to tender, or, the option chosen by the Cabinet, to bring it back in-house.\nJulie Dore is promising to provide an additional £2 million to boost the Youth Service provision in the city. Great plan, you might say. However, where is the plan? What evidence is presented in the Cabinet report to show how the transition will be managed? How will an in-house service differ from the current contract provision? What is the business case – the difference in the cost of an in-house service vs the current contract? What facts are offered to reassure us that public money is being properly managed and what evidence is there to show the new in-house service will have the requisite staff and resources to at least deliver equivalent services to the existing provision? Nothing. No plan.\nWhen challenged, Julie Dore claimed it was entirely possible to have an in-house service up and running by the end of September. This is a dubious claim. How far will the ‘extra’ £2 million go by the time the TUPE and staff pension costs are factored in, and the rebranding of the service, for starters? What will happen to the front line voluntary organisations currently funded by Sheffield Futures? Where will future funding come from? Currently Sheffield Futures charitable status gives them access to grants that a council service will not be eligible for. Where will the shortfall come from?\nThis is why scrutiny is so vital. On this rare occasion (due to a Labour Cllr Abstaining and another needing to leave before the vote) opposition councillors were able to force the Cabinet to go back and gather evidence and formulate a plan worthy of scrutiny. Ordinarily Cabinet get away with making unsubstantiated decisions. Perhaps this explains why so much of what happens in our city leaves many citizens aghast?\nThe people of Sheffield deserve better than another year of this entitled sloppy approach to decision making and governance.\nAlison Teal\nCllr Nether Edge & Sharrow\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It’s a really difficult situation, closing that popular cafe right at the beginning of the school holidays. Not a good look for the Council to be fair. And of course, this all stems from a mistake in 2009 under a previous administration when they outsourced the Council service to a private company and they set up the building with no provision for repairs. Literally, the Council should have done the repairs but there was no plan for it, so we have now got a building defect which means the building can’t be used. There’s a big question as to what happens to the cafe building next. And in response to the campaigners it’s really difficult because we would just love to say, yes, that’s a priority, we’ll put the money in there. But the reality is the Council is really, really stuck for money at the moment and putting money into one park means that we have to take it away from other parks, like Abbeyfield Park in Pitsmoor which really needs the investment as well. So for me as a Green, the really important thing is to work with campaigners and think about how they can work alongside our staff in the Parks Department and try and make a better park for everyone given all the restraints on resources and time available to us. There’s a great community there. They could do fundraising, they could get the word out, support designs for how they want to see the cafe work and run well into the future and make it fit for another hundred years to add to the hundred years it has already been going.”",

For its social, economic and environmental impact, for retrofitting and re-use of historic buildings. It is good for the city and it makes people feel good about themselves. And our council’s heritage policy and practice should be cross-party and established by consensus.\nIts grassroots campaigning from ‘Joined Up Heritage’ and the dozens of heritage organisations they represent that’s made the difference! Not the council, who frankly should have been working with heritage already. ‘Joined up Heritage’ must be immensely proud of what they have done – and finally, finally persuaded the council to listen.\nThe city has been missing out on funding for years due to a backward view of heritage. A few examples. Statistics show that the southeast Sheffield area is chronically underfunded by the Heritage Lottery Fund – we could be supporting Birley Spa and others there. In the city the Old Town Hall, the Salvation Army Citadel and others.\nWe have no Heritage Action Zones in the city. Other cities do. Why – because the council messed it up. We underfunded officers to be able to deliver heritage funding applications.\nAnother example. We have one conservation officer for more than 600,000 residents and over 2000 listed buildings and precious few enforcement resources. It’s not enough,\nCllr Angela Argenzio, Chair of the Adult Health and Social Care Committee said,\n“Heritage is not solely in tangible assets; heritage is culture and, how we promote and champion our rich and diverse cultures in Sheffield, is paramount to how we flourish as a city and how we evolve, preserving the past by looking at the future.\nMusic has always been a huge part of my life and Sheffield has such a wonderful musical history. I want to highlight two musical heritage assets in the city that are so important and whose future is in the balance:\nFirst up is the Organ at City Hall which belongs to the Council. It was built by Henry Willis & Sons at a cost of £12,650 and is now the only remaining example in the world still unaltered from the original construction. Its original 1935 hairline wiring & relays (state of the art at the time) are still intact. It is now valued at around £1m. The reason why the organ is untouched is that the Council has never done anything to it unlike what has happened to other organs in the country…\nSecond up is Red Tape Studios where so many amazing artists went through their musical journey and the rumours circulating about its long-term future.\nWe cannot lose either of these heritage assets: we must do all in our power to preserve and champion them to ensure they are still here for future generations to use and enjoy. We need to do this cross-party, working together because heritage is about all of us.”",

Eamonn Ward (Broomhill & Sharrow Vale Green Party ward organiser) comments:\n“The Licensing process is not remotely user friendly for the general public. I see a lot of applications for licensed premises in and around Ecclesall Rd and Broomhill Shopping Centre. Residents have to find applications via a fascination for looking at lampposts in their area or the classifieds in the Sheffield Telegraph. There is an expectation that people engaging are professionals, with little help offered to the general public who might just want to protest about the terrible noise from all the events on the park opposite their house.\nWe rarely engage and don’t encourage others to engage as they will find the process confusing and meetings and decisions frustrating. Too often it feels like you are an inconvenience and It leaves people wondering why they got involved in the first place. It means this council Licensing objective is simply not met: “ensure the relevant views of those affected by licensed premises are taken into consideration”.\nNotes\n- The consultation ended July 13th and was https://sheffield.citizenspace.com/place-business-strategy/the-licensing-act-2003-statement-of-principles-pol/\n- Sheffield City Council’s Stated Licensing Objectives are:\nLicensing objectives shouldprovide applicants with a clear, consistent basis for submitting applications and noticesprovide a clear, consistent basis for determining applications\nensure the relevant views of those affected by licensed premises are taken into consideration\nsupport wider strategies of the City Council and the approach to licensing in the city\n- Eamonn Ward’s full submission to the consultation for Broomhill & Sharrow Vale Green Party was:\n“Residents have to find applications via a fascination for looking at lampposts in their area or the classifieds in the Telegraph.People on the mailing lists don’t receive them every Monday like planning apps. They come as and when with differing gaps of up to 3 weeks. For a time critical process this is not frequent enough. All too often it’s a struggle to get the information you need before the deadline for comments. Contrast this with Planning where comprehensive information is on the database.There is not enough relevant information on the e-mail list. Requests for more information are responded to inconsistently despite often pointing out looming deadlines. I expect this relates to staffing but I have no awareness of that other than in lockdown where home working situations have been outlined in responses.\nAnyone engaging with the process will find it difficult to understand from start to finish. There is an expectation that people engaging are professionals in this area, with little help offered to the general public who want to protest about the terrible noise from all the events on the park opposite their house.\nPeople who do go to meetings to speak are entirely reliant on councillors and others they may have liaised with on what will happen. No one tells you in advance that the applicants could grill you in the meeting. You get little information from those running the meeting to help your understanding and could easily get slapped down for talking out of turn while the applicants solicitor trots out the familiar script about student bar landlords being happy to give their number to local people for noise issues etc.\nOverall, it often feels like you are an inconvenience when you engage with the process. It is not remotely user friendly for the general public who will not be made aware of applications on their doorstep. So this objective is simply not met: “ensure the relevant views of those affected by licensed premises are taken into consideration”.\nGenerally, I rarely engage and don’t encourage others to engage as they will find the process confusing and meetings and decisions frustrating leaving them wondering why they got involved in the first place.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

I asked him what he was spraying on the pavement and he replied: “It’s only Round-Up”. When I told him this was not just dangerous to his health but to the whole ecology of our planet, he said he knew, but he was only “spot spraying”. I asked him why he was not wearing protective clothing (he had no face mask or gloves) and he told me that he had these but had been advised not to wear them as this scared the general public. I told him the public was quite right to be scared as we don’t want poison sprayed on our pavements! In the States, a court case against Monsanto was won by a man who developed cancer after using Roundup. He was awarded $289 million in damages.\nPesticides and herbicides are contributing to what is now being called the 6th mass extinction of species. When was the last time you had to scrape insects from your windscreen? When I first started driving back in the 1970s every summer journey resulted in the windscreen being covered in insects. Now we rarely need to do this. Scientists have found In the last 25 years, three-quarters of all flying insects have disappeared in Germany. This has a knock-on effect on birds, amphibians and other species.\nWe have known about the dangers of herbicides and pesticides since 1962 when Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring. Glyphosate has been banned in Holland, Denmark, Sweden and France and some Councils around the UK such as Trafford, Brighton, Bristol and Croydon. But last year Sheffield City Council sprayed 1750 litres of Glyphosate on our pavements, verges and parks. Please sign the petition to stop this at https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/sheffield-city-council-to-stop-using-glyphosate. More than 3200 people have already signed. 5000 signatures will force a debate in the Town Hall.\nYours faithfully\nGraham Wroe\nLetter to the Sheffield Star\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.
