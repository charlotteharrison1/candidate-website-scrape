In fact, I had spent some time in the country on a number of visits in the mid-nineteen- seventies when it was a very different country. I recall hiring a horse for a couple of days and riding out on my own to the stunning lake at Band-e-Amir and to the standing Buddhas at Bamiyan (- subsequently destroyed by the Taliban).\nGiven the blood and treasure that we have sacrificed over the last twenty years, I believe that NATO’s withdrawal is a profoundly mistaken policy. It is some years since NATO troops were actually involved in the fighting: with the exception of US air attack missions, NATO’s contribution has been largely confined to training and mentoring the Afghan security forces, whom we are now abandoning.\nThe advance of the Taliban is a catastrophe for women, girls and religious minorities, as well as to the ordinary liberties of everyone in that country. The prospects for educated women, many of whom have taken leading roles in the Parliament, media and the professions, are particularly bleak.\nWe can expect another even greater wave of refugees seeking to arrive on our shores.\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Nick Carter has said that we shouldn’t write-off the Republic yet: that there are signs that the population is showing the sort of defiance needed to win this battle; that they are rallying in support of the security forces which are pursuing a sensible and realistic strategy of consolidation to fight the Taliban to a stalemate. He says we must help them stay firm and force the Taliban to the negotiating table. He concludes that much depends on who wins the “battle of the narratives”\nHe’s right: winning the ‘battle of the narrative’ is vital for morale, the maintenance of which, is a most important principle of war and essential to success.\nOur policy however, appears designed to do the exact opposite. We do seem to be ‘writing-off’ the Republic. Our proper concern for the safety of Afghan interpreters who served our armed forces is laudable and indeed, our sacred duty. Our haste however, in securing their evacuation, sends a clear signal to those who are still fighting, that we believe there is no hope. Now a similar commitment is being given to evacuate Afghan journalists.\nI pray that the Afghan warriors, so many of whom have been trained by UK forces at our ‘Sandhurst in the Sand’, will prove the defeatists wrong.\nLiberty and Safety?\nSeveral constituents have written to me, outraged at the prospect of ‘Covid passports’ and quoting Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the USA, who said\n“those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety”\nFranklin couldn’t have been writing in more different circumstances: his concern was the liberty of the Pennsylvania legislature, for the purpose of meeting military expenditure, to insist on its right to levy taxes on the State’s founding family, rather than to be bought off with a lump sum in return for an acceptance by the assembly that they had no right to tax them.\nHowever impressive the quote may sound (and I’ve used it myself) it is a bit of a tight fit when it comes to shoe-horning it into the debate on compulsory vaccination.\nMy retort to the constituents who quoted Franklin to me is that, on the contrary, I have secured both my safety and my liberty by freely choosing to be vaccinated: a course that I recommended to them, and which I recommend to everyone else.\nNevertheless, regular readers of this column will know that I am deeply concerned about the creeping encroachment on liberty. I’ve twice used this column to set out my opposition to Covid passports and to the decision to make Covid vaccination compulsory for anyone working in residential care homes.\nI do not want to live in a society where we would routinely have to produce our bona fides in order to secure access to venues and enjoy our full civil rights. I’m confident that were such a system introduced -and we are not there yet, with the parliamentary battle still ahead of us – it would be very difficult to subsequently dismantle it and it could be the fore-runner of a system of identity cards.\nI understand the Government’s preoccupation that, whilst we have had enormous success with the vaccination programme, progress with the youngest age cohorts has been less impressive. From the outset I believed that the vaccination roll-out for younger people should have been incentivised on the basis of ‘carrots and not sticks’.\nFrankly we have made a poor job of trumpeting the effectiveness of the vaccines: We have thoroughly undermined them by maintaining restrictions even after the vulnerable groups had been vaccinated and by insisting on isolation and quarantine conditions notwithstanding fully vaccinated status. This sends completely the wrong message to younger and less vulnerable people. Which is possibly why the Government is now having to raise the prospect of making their lives less convenient and agreeable should they choose not to bother.\nAs for those who write to me about the Government’s malign and hidden agenda to deprive us of liberty. I reject it utterly. Though I disagree with their policy, I know these ministers personally, they are among my friends, they have the best of motives, even if they are mistaken. But I do accept that the threat to our personal freedoms are growing in intensity and we have to decide whether we insist on holding on to them, or we are going to allow the growing power of the state to take them from us whenever it chooses.\nChannel Crossings\nAs the trickle of migrants crossing the Channel in overcrowded and unsafe inflatable boats has started to become a flood, so the correspondence in my email inbox has increased by the same proportions.\nThough some correspondence is informed and sensitive, for the most part that is not the case: correspondents simply demand that it be stopped and that arrivals be sent back.\nIt reminds me of King Canute ordering the incoming tide to turn.\nSending the arrivals back does require the agreement of the jurisdiction to which we are going to send them: what reason would France have for agreeing to that?\nWe are already paying France a small fortune for the policing their beaches to prevent boats from launching, which has had some modest success.\nOnce launched however, France interprets international maritime law as preventing them from interfering unless the boats ask to be rescued. France sees its role as safely shepherding the migrants into UK waters where we will intercept them. A senior member of the Commons Home Affairs Committee has announced that France’s interpretation of maritime law is perverse and they must change it -so, we are back to King Canute: we hold no power over France to make them change (unless, of course, we can think of a sanction to make the French miserable, whose effects won’t rebound equally upon us).\nNow that crossing the Channel in small boats has been established as a successful means of illegal entry to UK, the numbers attempting a crossing are bound to increase until migrants assess that it is not worth undertaking the expense or encountering the danger because the probability is that they will be expelled, or that they will be held in conditions less eligible than their current circumstances.\nWe’ve already encountered the difficulty of finding somewhere to expel them to, so we are left with the ‘ Australian’ approach of deterring them on the principle of less eligibility. The Australians send them to detention centres in Papua New Guinea. This is controversial even in Australia and I rather suspect that the British public would not have the stomach for it.\nNevertheless, the Borders Bill currently going through Parliament specifies a 4 year prison term for illegal entry and empowers ministers to implement detention centres for the processing of asylum claims overseas.\nI seriously doubt that we will fill our -already bursting- prisons with tens of thousands of migrants, including the prospect of separating families.\nEqually, it is not clear what sort of inducement would be required to persuade another country to house our ‘processing centres’ and whether they would turn out to be as grizzly and embarrassing as Australia’s.\nThat we need to identify a workable solution, I do not doubt. Clearly, our generous resettlement schemes are being overtaken by unlawful migrants who, no matter what they may have endured and from what horrors they have fled, have had sufficient sums to purchase the services of criminal gangs to deliver them to our shores.\nOf course, we could reduce the attraction of the crossings, just making them so much more dangerous by withdrawing our cutters and patrols altogether. I’m confident that this would not be the answer. I wonder how many constituents would be emailing me then, when the bodies of children start washing up on the beach.\nEliminating EVAL without a vote\nWhen I first entered the Commons, the Father of The House (its longest serving member) was Ted Heath, who was followed by Tam Dalyell, one of the most independent minded and effective members. I remember him once rising after a particularly long and vapid ministerial answer and simply saying “why?” leaving the minister floundering. Tam was one of the few Scottish members opposed to devolving powers to a Scottish parliament. It was he who framed what became known as the “West Lothian Question” (he was the Member for West Lothian when he framed it though he was subsequently the Member of Linlithgow).\nBasically, at issue in the question was, if having once devolved Scottish educational matters to a parliament in Edinburgh, the fairness of the Member for Linlithgow voting in Westminster on educational matters in England which would have no effect in his own constituency.\nThe matter came to a head in the election campaign of 2015 because of the collapse of Labour support in its former Scottish Heartlands: Labour’s only prospect of getting into Government was believed to be, on the basis of polling, by relying on the support the Scottish nationalist MPs. Under such a scenario, England representing 80 of UK would have been governed at the will of Scottish MPs voting on matters whose own laws were devolved to an exclusively Scottish Parliament.\nTo the surprise of many it didn’t happen: a majority Conservative government was elected. One of its manifesto pledges however, was to address the issue with ‘English Votes for English Laws’ (EVAL). So, we changed the Standing Orders of the House of Commons (the nearest thing to a written constitution that we have) to exclude Scottish MPs from detailed stages of legislation not affecting Scotland and for the House to sit as an English Grand Committee in which Scottish MPs would not vote. The procedure was clumsy but effective.\nOut of the blue last week the Government introduced a motion to remove the procedure and to return to the status quo ante. I am at a loss as to its motive. The Covid-secure Westminster was empty and utterly ineffective. There were a handful of us there to vote against the measure, but to divide the House you need to supply two tellers, one for the ‘Aye’ Lobby and one for the ‘No’ lobby. Alas, so many of us have been persuaded not to act as ‘supper-spreaders’ by crowding the lobbies and instead to accept the innovation of voting by proxy. But if you are voting by proxy you cannot be a teller. So, when it came to the vote we couldn’t find anyone amongst us to be our second teller: Accordingly, English Votes for English Laws was ditched without a single recorded dissenting vote.\nDemocracy?\nCompulsory Vaccination is Here\nI am an enthusiast for vaccinations but I never dreamt we’d make them compulsory. In my blog of 3/12/20 Vaccination Passports (desmondswaynemp.com) I said it was unthinkable. Nevertheless, compulsory vaccination for anyone working in a care home will be introduced later this year, that includes any tradesman entering the premises to do repairs, or whatever.\nWe haven’t had compulsory vaccination since 1853 – which was soon reversed because it swiftly led to a collapse in the number of people willing to be vaccinated for smallpox, such was their suspicion of the new law.\nOf course, many clinicians have to have hepatitis vaccinations in order to practice, but they go into the profession knowing that. It is very different thing to turn round to a care worker mid-career and say ‘take the jab or lose your job’. This is no way to treat dedicated staff, who could well go elsewhere and do less demanding work for higher pay.\nI have received desperate representations from a number of care homes who are already under-staffed and fear that they will have to reduce their number of beds or even close.\nThis extraordinary departure from accepted norms was dealt with in our Covid Potemkin Parliament in a mere 90 minutes on a motion that was designed to obscure its purpose. The Statutory Instrument was almost double-Dutch and referred merely to a ‘medical procedure’.\nThe Government’s Impact Assessment of the measure was withheld from us and the minister either wouldn’t or couldn’t tell us what was in it.\nDemocracy is under attack from within, ably assisted by Covid-19\nUBI – Daft Economics\nI recall watching the early evening TV news in Jonesboro, Arkansas back in the mid-nineteen eighties and seeing footage of myself descending aircraft steps to the commentary “economist and professor, Mr Desmond Swayne flew into town to-day”. Well, it must have been a very thin day for news and they do use the term ‘professor’ very much more loosely than we do in the UK. Nevertheless, I was on a lecture tour of US universities, corporations and business organisations and the following morning I addressed a business breakfast at 7 AM, where most of the attendees had come from work, having already started an hour earlier -that’s productivity.\nIt is some now time since I passed myself off as an economist, but the facts of economic life are blindingly obvious. I am a member of the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee and we recently produced a report, the Future of Work. Select Committees are encouraged to reach their conclusions by consensus from the evidence presented to them during an inquiry. I’ve never been persuaded that consensus is a virtue: It is often the lowest common denominator and gives rise to some rather bland conclusions. On this occasion however, we couldn’t reach a consensus and voted on party lines not to include a recommendation on UBI within the report.\nNo matter how slight your acquaintance with the science of economics, UBI -the provision of a universal basic income, has got to be amongst the daftest of ideas. That it has attractions, I have no doubt: I’ve spoken to lots of furloughed employees who, despite having only 80% of their income (compensated somewhat by no longer having commuting costs) have rather enjoyed being paid to stay at home without having to work at all.\nEven Lenin insisted that “He who does not work shall not eat”. Who on earth would work if they were provided with an income that enabled them not to have to?\nThe argument advanced in favour of UBI is that it would not stop us from working but would provide a level of security against the possibility of a reduction in our earned income. But that is exactly what Universal Credit is there for. The difference is that UBI is to be paid to absolutely everyone where Universal Credit is only paid to those in need. It shouldn’t take an economics professor to spot that paying an income to absolutely everyone irrespective of their need, will mean you will have very much less available to concentrate on those who really are in need. Either that, or you tax everyone into to penury. .\nThey’d have understood this at breakfast in Jonesboro, even if they don’t in some parts of the Houser of Commons.\nThe Tempter?\nIn this column last week, referring to Matt Hancock’s affair, I made a passing reference to ‘the Tempter’. A surprising number of email correspondents have asked me to have the courage name and shame the individual in question! I’m afraid that they have got quite the wrong end of the stick. Indeed, I’m shocked that anyone would not be certain as to what I was referring to . Have we become so forgetful of scripture?\n“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour. Whom resist, steadfast in the faith”\n1 Peter 5: 8\nThat’s who I meant.\nSex, Lies…and Emails\nSarah Vine wrote sensitively in a national newspaper about the difficulties faced by political marriages following the coverage of Matt Hancock’s affair, only for the announcement of the end of her own marriage to Michael Gove to follow shortly thereafter.\nAll the true circumstances that lead to divorce will only ever be known by the couples involved, and it is always dangerous to draw general conclusions. I am not sure that the marriages of politicians are more prone to end in divorce than they are in any other profession. Clearly however, physical separation doesn’t help. If you have to be in Westminster and order your affairs so that your spouse is at a distance in your constituency home, then an additional stress has been placed on the relationship, and additional opportunities for the Tempter.\nWhen I was selected to be the Conservative Candidate to fight New Forest West before the 1997 election, a member of the selection committee told me that they had chosen my wife too: We were considered to be a team (such processes are now considered beyond the pale and candidates cannot even say if they have spouses, let alone be accompanied by them to interviews and selection hustings).\nEqually, when I arrived at Westminster I was advised by professional staff at the Commons to employ my wife as a member of my staff as such an arrangement would ensure that she was involved in my work as part of the team, so acting as a powerful corrective to any sense of isolation, and even possibly temptation.\nAfter the expenses scandal of 2009 the newly created Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority announced that it was minded to end the practice of allowing MPs to employ their wives. Following a public consultation they changed course and accepted that the practice had significant advantages. Unfortunately, they changed their mind again a few years later, since when new Members have been unable employ their spouses.\nSome 15 years ago I recall the telephone ringing one Friday evening as I was rushing to get out in time to attend a voluntary organisation’s Summer barbeque in Ringwood. On the line was a well-known journalist from a Sunday newspaper telephoning to warn me that they were going to publish a story about an affair I’d been having and that– when I’d sought to end it- my lover, in an act of vengeance, had leaked embarrassing emails.\nIt was with some relief that I was able to say that whilst I had on a number of occasions met the woman that he had named, also that I was confident that I had always done so accompanied by a member of my staff (my wife!).\nThe story never appeared. Alas, the emails however, filled many column inches. Though embarrassing, mercifully they were of a political, rather than a sexual nature.\nAs to how the emails had leaked, it wasn’t a jilted lover: I had left myself logged into a computer in the library, then I had gone out to take a phone call without logging-off.\nI think they call it ‘user error’.\nNew Secretary of State…new initiative to fix social care?\nOne of the pressing issues that will face Sajid Javid as the new Secretary of State for Health is how to reform social care.\nBluntly, the problem is that there is insufficient provision because we don’t spend enough on it. That much is generally agreed. The key question on which a consensus has yet to be reached is how are we going to pay for the much greater sums that we will need to spend.\nI sat on the legislative standing committee which introduced the distinction between healthcare, provided free at the point of use by the NHS, and social care which is means-tested. This distinction is not always sustainable, especially where patients with dementia together with a number of complex medical conditions are concerned. The assessment procedures to deal with these cases and to provide ‘Continuing NHS Care’ -where all the cost are met by the NHS- leave much to be desired, they are applied differently giving rise to a postcode lottery and to a perception of unfairness.\nThat sense of unfairness however, is much wider: People who have been lucky, wise, hard-working and successful in building up their savings will find that have to pay the full cost of their care. Whilst, those who have been impecunious or just much less fortunate, will have their social care paid for at the expense of taxpayers.\nThat perception of unfairness is an inevitable consequence of any system reliant on means-testing. We just live with it across other aspects of our welfare state; Where, for example, access to Universal Credit is denied to those who have significant savings, even though they have lost their income.\nThe only way to avoid this perception of unfairness is to remove any individual responsibly entirely by making free provision universal.\nUniversal benefits, irrespective of income and assets, come at an enormous cost to taxpayers, with all the consequences that higher taxation has for reduced incentives, investment and productivity.\nIt comes down to this simple question in the end: do we want to nationalise another aspect of our collective life by simply expecting the state to provide it?\nPoliticians often refer to the ‘scandal’ of elderly patients having to sell their homes to meet the costs of residential care. Of course, we’d all much prefer to leave our assets to the next generation, but equally, I was always taught to save up for a ‘rainy day’. Well, when you need social care, isn’t that the rainy day?\nI do not believe that we need to commission another great review of the options. The last such review developed a workable solution (and which Parliament legislated to implement): Sir Andrew Dilnot proposed a cap on the amount that anyone would be required to spend on social care if they had the means to do so. Beyond that cap the taxpayer would meet the costs. He suggested a cap of £75,000. Clearly, the lower the cap the greater the burden that will be borne by taxpayers.\nThe advantage of a cap however, is that it gives the insurance industry the certainty of a maximum liability which will enable the development of affordable financial products to protect those customers who want to safeguard their assets and savings for the next generation.\nThe Dilnot proposal is a means of getting more funding into social care on the basis of a ‘mixed economy’, whilst going some way to addressing the unfairness of a means tested system. But we must not hide from the reality that it comes at a greater cost to the public purse which inevitably will require either higher taxes or less expenditure on other aspects of government provision, and we need to be open and honest about recognising that.\nVictory into Defeat\nMonths ago, in this column I pointed out that the successful virus variants become more transmissible by being less virulent. Clearly, by sending your hosts to bed, to hospital, or even to their deaths, there will be fewer opportunities to spread than if you keep them up and about mixing with others.\nDespite the alarming graphs and charts, presented -as ever- without proper context, the success of the delta or Indian variant has become our dominant variant based on exactly this strategy.\nAccording to the NHS’s own data hospital cases have risen significantly since 27 May, but comparatively very few of these patients are actually occupying hospital beds. So, the rest probably pitched up at A&E -presumably because they couldn’t get an appointment with their GP – before being sent home.\nFor days however, establishment voices have been demanding an extension of restrictions to prevent even the smallest increase in hospital admissions so that the NHS can get on, uninterrupted, dealing with all the backlogs of other illnesses and conditions that have built up over the last 18 months. So it has come to this: enterprises are to be restricted, to remain closed, basic freedoms and social interactions remain banned, all as a means of managing NHS waiting lists.\nIs England just an NHS served by a nation, rather than a nation served by an NHS?\nBy this logic there is no chance of the restrictions being lifted as we approach the flu season this autumn. Indeed, a number of the Government’s Scientific advisors have been sounding-off that we will have to abide by their dystopian distancing and masking regulations forever!\nBy rolling over and implementing their latest advice, the Government has transformed the victory of the vaccination campaign in to the defeat of their road map to the lifting of the restrictions.\nBut if you thought you were ok because your wedding can now go ahead with more than 30 guests… before you celebrate, read the small print; only where the venue can accommodate higher numbers including the full distancing requirements. How cruel to raise hopes, only to dash them.\nI never believed that the Government’s response to the epidemic was proportionate: it had no right to the freedoms it took from us; now it continues to withhold them despite the emergency having passed, accordingly it has set the most disastrous precedent for the future of liberty in England.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 31\n- 32\n- 33\n- 34\n- 35\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_saving-your-home/content_626.html": "In this column on 28th June I expressed my hope that the issue of the reform of system of social care would be expedited by the appointment of Sajid Javid as the new Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.\nI also questioned one of the principal motives for reform: what politicians often refer to as the ‘scandal’ whereby people have to sell their homes to pay for their residential care.\nI have always taken the view that the main way that people save in the UK is by acquiring a home, and that paying for your residential care was a proper demand on your savings, which in so many cases means your home.\nOf course, there are many other things we might have preferred to spend our savings on, including passing them on to our families, but if we need residential care, why should we expect the community to pick up the bill if we have a property that we could sell to meet the expense?\nAny sense of unfairness arises, not from the assumption that we ought to pay for our care, but from the fact that we might have to but that others won’t. This is the same perception of unfairness that arises from any means-tested welfare system: the belief that you are penalised for having been prudent, but that the impecunious, profligate, or just less fortunate, get a free ride.\nThe Government’s proposals, announced last week, with a cap on care costs of £86,000 -after which taxpayers will meet any further costs, are designed to address the sense of unfairness.\nGovernment’s critics however, appear to be attempting to ride two different horses at the same time: first they argue that it is immoral for taxpayers to be expected protect the inheritance of the relatively wealthy by preventing them from having to sell their homes to meet their care bills. Yet at the same time they argue that so many of them will have to sell their homes anyway, because relatively few will have the £86,000 readily to hand to pay for their bills before the taxpayer comes to the rescue.\nThe critics have fundamentally misunderstood one of the main purposes of the reform.\nConsider our main motive saving: whist it may be prudent to save up against the possibility of lean times ahead; most of us save up for something positive that we want to get or to do, including passing such savings on to our children. I certainly couldn’t be motivated to save up for care costs, because my hope and expectation would be to never to have to be cared for.\nOn the other hand, rather than save up to meet unwelcome possibilities, we insure against them: We insure our homes against burglary, fire and flood. Equally, it would be sensible to insure against care costs in order to avoid having to sell our homes. The difficulty is that such insurance is not readily available because of the potential unlimited liability that might arise from many years in residential care. The purpose of the £86,000 cap is to quantify and fix that liability so that the insurance market can bring forward affordable schemes -should you wish to purchase one- to protect you from the first £86,000, and prevent you from needing to sell your home if you don’t have £86,000 to hand.\nI hope it works.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_campaigns_pub-and-brewery-email-campaign/content_249.html": "The Autumn Budget 2021 confirmed that duty rates on beer, cider, wine and spirits will be frozen for another year, a move which will save consumers £3 billion over the next five years, and provide further support to the hospitality industry and its suppliers as they recover from the pandemic. Duty rates on draught beer and cider will be cut by 5 per cent, taking 3p off a pint and further supporting pubs.\nI was glad to see the announcement in the Autumn Budget 2021 that, following a review, the alcohol duty regime is to undergo a major simplification. The old system was outdated system that set rates based on historical anomalies, and a new regime will be fairer to both consumers and producers, and promote product innovation in response to evolving consumer tastes.\nThis radical simplification of the duty system will reduce the number of main rates from 15 to 6, and tax products in proportion to their alcohol content.\nAll tax categories, such as beer and wine, will be moved to a standardised set of bands, with rates for products between 1.2-3.4 per cent alcohol by volume (ABV), 3.5-8.4 per cent ABV, 8.5-22 per cent ABV, and above 22 per cent ABV. Above 8.5 per cent ABV, all products across all categories will pay the same rate of duty if they have the same proportion of alcohol content. Registration and payment will also be simplified, and the practice where individual products have different administrative rules will end.\nThe new progressive manner in which alcohol is taxed will ensure higher strength products incur proportionately more duty, and these rates will be the same across all product categories. This change will address the problem of harmful high-strength products being sold too cheaply, and the new rates for low strength drinks below 3.5 per cent ABV will encourage manufacturers to develop new products at lower ABVs, giving consumers greater choice and greater options to drink responsibly.\nI welcome the introduction of a new small producer relief which will build on the previous success of the Small Brewers Relief, which will benefit cidermakers and other producers of lower ABV drinks. This will allow small producers to diversify their product range to other products below 8.5 per cent ABV while still benefitting from reduced rates.\nDS.",

The evening before departure I had a scheduled appearance on Radio Four’s late night Westminster Hour programme. Where I was ambushed by a question about the Sunday Times scoop on David Cameron’s leaked resignation honours list.\nI hadn’t seen it but, as a ‘former regime loyalist’ and Cameron’s parliamentary private secretary for 7 years, I felt it proper to defend his right to make honours recommendations. It was almost as if I suddenly I became the world’s leading authority on honours, sought by every news outlet: even having to rendezvous with the BBC en route to my holiday destination.\nI stand by what I said: In this country we do not, for the most part, provide public funding for political parties. Those public spirited individuals who do step forward and provide such funding for parties and for important political campaigns, ought not to be excluded from the honours system because of that public service.\nI note that those organs that howl loudest about these honours are also the most vitriolic in their denunciation of any suggestion that political parties should instead be taxpayer-funded.\nI accept that this is a controversial matter about which adults disagree, but I worry about the nature of public discourse when such intemperate language is used. People whom I have never met or spoken to, feel free to send me emails denouncing me in the most inappropriate terms. This is a form of fascism that seeks to intimidate anyone from expressing opposing points of view.\nWe saw examples of this during Scotland’s independence referendum when ‘cybernats’ attacked business leaders and other public figures who put their heads above the parapet, arguing that Scotland should remain in the UK.\nAs a thick skinned politician I am not intimidated by email correspondence from people who cannot express themselves without resorting to profanity. I fear that others may be more easily overwhelmed.\nBack to the Westminster Hour however, the best line came from my fellow panellist the historian Peter Hennessy, who observed that one should always accept an honour because of the anger it will provoke among your enemies. By that measure Mr Cameron’s list has been very effective indeed.",

I certainly don’t mean to be rude or unhelpful.\nThe fact is however, that there are a large number of people who want to see me, and some of them who really need to see me.\nIt’s not because I disagree with them (although I do), on the contrary, as a politician I enjoy a good argument. The fact is that I simply regard the matter as settled and I don’t want to endlessly go over old ground.\nThey may have forgotten, or they may just not have liked the result, but we had a referendum in 2011 in which 70% of us voted to stick with our current voting system. In my view that should settle it for a generation.\nThe same is true for those endlessly seeking to re-run the arguments of the June 2016 EU referendum. It’s done. We made a decision, and we just need to get on and implement it. As John Major said at the time “there won’t be another referendum: this is it”",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_category_ds-blog_page_9/content_349.html": "Some of my parliamentary colleagues, particularly those who are lawyers, get frightfully upset when I criticise judicial decisions. They believe that the separation of powers -political from judicial- is so sacrosanct that no politician should intrude by criticising the judgements of the courts.\nI disagree. As an elected politician it is quite proper for me to give voice to the frustration that so many constituents express to me about judicial decisions, whether it is the leniency of sentences or ‘high politics’, where courts have frustrated the will of Government -which should properly be a matter for Parliament.\nThere is enormous anger about leniency in sentencing. More than half our most prolific offenders -with at least 45 previous convictions- are never sent to prison. This is the reason that Parliament has increasingly been intervening with new laws to set mandatory minimum sentences to bind the judges, as we will again on 28th November with the second reading of the Criminal Justice Bill.\nGreater still is the frustration with Judicial intervention in the most contentious political issues of the day. I expressed my robust rejection of the authority of the Supreme Court in this column in my blog about the prorogation of Parliament back in September 2019:\nYes, it is a coup (desmondswaynemp.com)\nNow we have had the judgement that the Government’s scheme to deport asylum claimants to Rwanda is unlawful, with which I profoundly disagree.\nNevertheless, I’d be the first to acknowledge that throughout history Judges have played a key role in preserving our liberty. And that an independent judiciary is an essential part of a functioning liberal democracy. In any event, we already have a solution where we believe judicial activism has gone too far.\nIn their decisions judges make law. If we don’t like the laws that they make, then we have the remedy in Parliament, just as we have with lenient sentencing: Statute law made in Parliament trumps law made by judges in the courts.\nThe problem is that it will take time, and time is running out. A bill to make the Rwanda scheme lawful would pass at speed in the Commons but would be held up by the delaying power of the Lords, where the Government has no majority. We could prorogue, and re-present the bill in the new parliamentary session, forcing it through under the Parliament Act. it would be controversial and messy, it might not be quick but it would work.\nThat leaves us only having to deal with the international judges whose power derives from the treaty obligations to which we voluntarily acceded. They will not be overawed by Parliament. If they intervened, we’d have to withdraw from those obligations. The PM has indicated that, if necessary, he will do so.\nThe Rwanda deal, as a deterrent to illegal migrants, is an essential element to successfully stopping the boats, but it is only one element. Of greater importance are bi-lateral agreements to return the migrants to their countries of origin. Our agreement with Albania, from which the greatest number were coming, has cut those numbers by 90%.\nThe argument is made that, were we to withdraw from the international conventions, then it would be so much more difficult to sustain and extend bi-lateral return arrangements, that we’d be a pariah and that nobody would deal with us.\nI think this is nonsense. Other European countries are experiencing very much greater numbers of illegal migrants and are already following where we have led. There is a common view now that the historic conventions on refugees are completely unfit for the current reality. I’m confident that where we continue to lead, other developed nations will continue to follow.\nCapitalism & Climate\nI debated against motion “The Climate Crisis Cannot Be Effectively Tackled Without Transforming Capitalism” at Durham University last night:\nThe Proof of any pudding is in the eating:\nThe boffins at Yale, mapping their Environmental Index on to the international indices that measure the ‘capitalism of economies’ -the World Bank’s Ease of Doing business index and the International Chamber of Commerce’s Open Market Index -reveal that the freer the economy the better environmental record.\nFurthermore that there is a critical point in the economic development of free economies when additional economic growth leads greater environmental benefit\nThis is the reverse of what groups like Extinction Rebellion tell us\nWhy?\nWell., there are several reasons, but I’ll fix on just one\nCapitalist driven economic growth affords citizens the opportunity to care more about the environment. We aren’t consumed with worry about disease, slums, and malnutrition, so instead have resources to care about the environment and to demand political action from our democratic systems to address it.\nFor Example: Notwithstanding that our coasts and rivers are cleaner than they have been for years, every time a storm overflow discharges into the river Avon I get scores of emails demanding action, and that sort of political pressure drives the eye-watering £60 Billion investment now planned.\nEqually London was often ground to a halt by smog and fog so thick they were called ‘pea soupers’ it led to political action and the Clean Air Act.\nWhere is the campaign for clean air in Beijing?\nPeople who are worried about where their next meal is coming from, or about dying from malaria, are not in a position to be concerned about the extinction of endangered species or potentially rising water levels driven by climate change. And even if they were, they don’t enjoy the political freedoms and property rights that capitalism promotes, in order to demand a remedy\nSome comparisons: In the 198ies Total Green House Gas emissions in the USSR, with an economy a fraction of the USA generated, at the most conservative estimate, at least one and a half times as much pollution as the USA per unit of GNP.\nEast Germany provides an example as a socialist-capitalist contrast with West Germany. Before it folded, CO2 emissions in the German Democratic Republic were almost twice the West German level, in per capita terms – astonishing when compared to how much richer the German Federal Republic was.\nWhen the Soviet system collapsed, the enormity of environmental degradation became apparent including the disappearance of the Aral Sea, perhaps one of the worst environmental disasters, and directly attributable to socialist planning.\nI do not contend that Capitalism is an environmentalist’s paradise. Of course there are plenty of examples of capitalist excess that we need to address through regulation, as Adam Smith sets out in Book 5 of The wealth of Nations. This is why property rights, contract, rule of law, a free press, and democratic oversight are essential components of Capitalism.\nBut the present danger is this:\nA New puritanism is out to rob you of your liberty. To coerce you into giving up meat, to confine you to 15 minute cities, to take away the convenience and liberation of your own car, restrict you to public transport, stop you enjoying international travel.\nBut let’s be clear. We account for about 1% of Co2 emissions. Were we to stop at once, it would make no difference to climate change. The future of emissions will be determined in Latin America, India and China. Currently they have other priorities,\nRemember Alok Sharma in tears closing COP 26 when he thought he had unanimous agreement to abandon coal – but they pulled the plug on him at the last moment\nWhy?\nBecause their people are, per capita, much poorer, so they attach a much greater priority to increasing consumption. If you were poor your priorities would be exactly the same.\nAs Bill Gates points out in How to avoid a Climate Disaster, the solution lies in the technologies that enable us to enjoy increasing prosperity whilst repairing the damage to the planet’s climate.\nWhere socialist planning has sought to catch-up by investing in industrial espionage and the theft of intellectual property. It is the initiative and enterprise of capitalist economies that are the essential engines of innovation and technological advance,\nThis is Capitalism’s greatest strength, and frankly, without it we have no chance!\nOn the contrary, Capitalism -far from being the problem – it is the solution.\n[In the student debate Capitalism won – by a very comfortable margin]\nHumanitarian Pause -2\nAs we approach Remembrance Sunday, we are reminded daily of the horrors of war by the newscasts on our television screens, they are shocking and dreadful to watch.\nIn World war II the scenes that would have accompanied civilian distress throughout Europe would have been as equally horrible and shocking had instant close-up television coverage been available.\nPerhaps the absence of mass demonstrations demanding a ceasefire back then, can be put down to the unavailability of that television coverage.\nAlternatively, we might put it down to a clearer national consciousness that our Kingdom, for all its faults and short-comings, was in an existential struggle for survival against an ideology that would extinguish our liberties, our values and our way of life. Therefore, in those circumstances, whatever the misery and the innocent civilian casualties, there was no prospect for ceasefire, for compromise, we just had to prevail at whatever cost, or face oblivion.\nConstituents email me daily drawing my attention to the horrors on their TV screens, demanding my support for a ceasefire. There is no ceasefire to be had. Israel, whatever its faults and shortcomings, is locked into an existential conflict with Hamas, whose aim it to obliterate it and replace it with an Islamic republic of the most repressive sort. There is no compromise that can be had. A ceasefire merely provides the opportunity to rearm and resume\nWe must do all we can to provide humanitarian relief but the horror, unless a leopard can change its spots, will continue\nPull the Plug on the Covid Inquiry\nWhen the pressure is on to answer awkward questions at a time when there are many other pressing concerns to be dealt with, the temptation for a hard-pressed Prime Minister is to take the pressure off by putting the whole issue into a box which can be opened at leisure later -by announcing an official independent inquiry.\nBut it is, more often than not, a dreadful mistake. The short-term relief is bought at the expense of a prolonged nightmare. The government loses any control of the agenda as the inquiry meanders wherever it chooses, clocking-up ever greater expense.\nThe Covid Enquiry is doing exactly that. So far it has cost £100 million. The lawyers are laughing all the way to the bank. The rest of us can enjoy mild titillation, or despair, depending on our predisposition, as we are treated to what often appears as an episode of In The Thick of It, revealing who despised whom, and the fruity language they used to express it.\nNone of this addresses the they key issue that is of interest: why did the Government abandon the pandemic plan, previously war-gamed and rehearsed, and instead follow the herd of other nations by locking-down the entire country both socially and economically?\nThe Inquiry would, ideally, come up with a cost/benefit analysis and conclude that either the Government got it right or that it imposed a cure that was, in its unforeseen consequences, worse than the disease.\nThe Inquiry has already revealed a prejudice in favour of lock-downs and I doubt that anything of value is now going to emerge from its further deliberations. And it’s going to cost a bomb. Its time to pull the plug and close down this farrago nonsense with immediate effect.\n‘Humanitarian Pause’\nI’ve received a large number of representations demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. Or, to be more precise, demanding that the UK Government join international calls for a ceasefire.\nI do not see that there is any possibility of a ceasefire in the foreseeable future, so I can’t see the point in calling for one.\nWhat I do believe is a possibility, and for which we must work strenuously is a ‘pause’ for the purpose of delivering humanitarian aid to civilians. Even this will be difficult because Israel is acutely aware that Hamas has a history of appropriating humanitarian aid for its own purposes. Screening the aid and ensuring that it is not stolen will be a complex operation.\nEqually, using civilians as a ‘human shield’ is central to the standard operating procedure of Hamas.\nI do not believe that either side sees a ceasefire as being in their interests.\nThe ferocity and ‘in your face’ barbarity of the Hamas attack on Israeli settlements was clearly designed to provoke an overwhelming response from Israel. Hamas has been building its network of underground tunnels and arsenal for years. It has chosen its moment to draw Israel into a very costly urban warfare for which Hamas is well prepared. It is not in the interests of Hamas to hold a ceasefire now, when it is on the brink of achieving the very objective which its attack was designed to provoke.\nIsrael, on the other hand, has been attacked by an organisation whose only purpose is to completely obliterate it and replace it with an Islamic state. There is no settlement that can be negotiated with such an adversary. One side can only prevail by annihilating the other.\nTo survive this existential threat Israel must take this opportunity to destroy Hamas, or face prolonging the bloodshed of further attacks by Hamas in the future. I see no reason why Israel would accommodate a ceasefire now.\nWe have to confine ourselves to what is possible, namely pauses in which relief can be delivered and as many lives saved as possible.\nBut the nightly vision of Hell will continue to unfold on out TV screens.\n‘Jihad’\nI’m uneasy with the outcry over demonstrations and the chanting of ‘jihad’.\nI believe in the right to demonstrate -however strongly I might actually disagree with the cause about which the demonstrators are protesting.\nThe line that I draw is when a protest prevents everyone else going about their lawful business: I’d sooner someone was arrested for blocking a road than chanting ‘jihad’.\nOf Course, some chanting could contravene the laws that we have passed to prevent incitement to violence and hatred and, no doubt, that threshold has been reached on occasion in recent days.\nBut does chanting ‘jihad’ reach that threshold?\nThe difficulty in any court will be the question whether ‘jihad’, beyond any reasonable doubt, constitutes incitement or a ‘hate crime’. Surely the defence would simply plead that the proper and true meaning of ‘jihad’ is purity and spiritual renewal, rather than violent holy war.\nThe Law is Too Lenient\nThe statement the Lord Chancellor to Parliament last Monday clearly indicated that he believed that sentences were too lenient or inappropriate.\nHe indicated that space for the longer prison sentences for more serious offences will be made available by no longer imprisoning minor offenders for short sentences.\nI am not opposed to reform and I acknowledge the fact that short sentences have proved unsuccessful, and often make for a higher rate of reoffending. I hope however, that when more space is delivered by our largest prison building programme since Victorian times, he will consider that part of the answer to the problem of short sentences is to make them longer.\nBecause prison works – do not underestimate the relief to a whole neighbourhood had by removing persistent minor offenders can have.\nThey say fish Rots from the head down, so let’s start with the head – the capital crime: murder. The law shows its contempt for the sanctity of life by the leniency with which it treats those who take life.\nOn three occasions in Parliament I’ve taken the opportunity to vote for the restoration of the death penalty. My demand for justice would have been assuaged however, if the mandatory life sentence meant life -or at least some greater approximation to it- but of over 7000 murderers currently in prison, less than 1% have a whole life tariff. Typically, they only serve between only 11 and 16 years.\nMoving on to Rape, the requirement that rapists serve at least two thirds of their sentences was reduced to only a half in 2003 – needless to say, I voted against the measure. Of the tiny proportion of reported rapes that finally make it through to a conviction, in 2022 twenty rapists received sentences of less than 5 years, some less than 2 years.\nThe scandal is that nearly a fifth of all sex offenders reoffend within one year of their release.\nWe are living through an epidemic of Knife Crime, and despite bill after bill in Parliament giving the courts greater sentencing powers, repeat offenders for possession continue to avoid custodial sentences. Taking violent crime as a whole, in the year to 2021 sentences fell by a quarter – down by 19 months.\nMoving on to burglary, unbelievably the average Burglar will have been convicted for up to 27 offences before being jailed.\nAnd when any custodial sentence actually is handed down, however rare, we go through the charade of the judge specifying a term, and everyone else in court calculating on the back of a fag packet how long it will actually be, because they all know that most prisoners serve less than half their term.\nSo Let’s jump down to the tail, to those crimes that make the lives of neighbours and neighbourhoods a misery: the anti-social louts, the vandals, the shop-lifters, the benefits cheats, the fly-tippers, the fraudsters: none of whom will see the inside of a prison cell, for them it’s ‘community punishments’\nThe Lord Chancellor said that he was going to ensure public confidence with a robust regime for community punishments. Well he would need to, because last year I asked in Parliament\n“It is reported that community punishments can be discharged by working from home. Please tell me that isn’t true. “\nThe policing minister replied that although they would reduce the proportion of sentences that could be worked from home, they would retain them for ‘those unable to manage a brush and shovel’.\nLeniency is measured by the public frustration that justice is not being seen to be done.\nLet’s bring back penal servitude with hard labour!\nHamas, has it coming\nUntil July 2016 I was the minister with responsibility for UK’s assistance to the Palestinians, much of which was channelled through United Nations agencies, some in collaboration with the EU, and some directly by our Department for International Development’s operations based in Jerusalem .\nI regarded myself as a critical friend of Israel, but I kept that criticism between myself, our diplomats and the Israeli ministers and politicians with which I interacted.\nAt one meeting with the Israeli Deputy Prime Minister, who was also their chief negotiator with the Palestinian Authority, my criticism was sufficiently forceful to cause him to storm out in rage.\nI had made a number of complaints: illegal settlements on Palestinian land in the West Bank of the Jordan; the unfair treatment of Palestinians; and the bulldozing of schools by the Israeli occupying authorities -built with funding from UK taxpayers.\nMy concern was that the proposal for a ‘two state’ solution to the conflict, with a Palestinian State co-existing peacefully alongside Israel (which was -and which remains- UK Government’s policy), was becoming increasingly untenable given the rate at which Israeli settlements were expanding into the occupied Palestinian territory, making it very difficult to include in any viable and geographically contiguous future Palestinian state.\nWhen I no longer enjoyed that ministerial responsibility, I went public with my criticism for the first time: I led a debate in Parliament on the illegal Israeli settlements in February 2017\nOccupied Palestinian Territories: Israeli Settlements – Hansard – UK Parliament\nFollowing the debate I was invited to meetings with any number of Palestinian representatives. Basic ‘due diligence’ revealed that many of them were on the record with all sorts of blood-curdling statements about the destruction of Israel, and they had associations with terrorist organisations.\nIn this light it is important to see the conflict from the Israeli point of view: it is impossible to negotiate a settlement with opponents whose aim remains the obliteration of Israel. The horrific attack by Hamas from the Gaza strip which they control and govern is just the latest and worst in a long history of terrorism. The curtailment of civil rights in Israeli occupied Palestinian territories, of which I previously complained, is itself very largely a consequence of the security measures that have had to be taken to protect Israeli citizens from the terrorist threat.\nIsrael has endured, bombings and killings for so many years. This latest atrocity is the last straw. The Government of Israel must destroy the terrorist organisation that is Hamas, in order to prevent it from continuing its own quest to destroy Israel and all Israelis.\nThe action against Hamas now presents huge dangers to Israel itself, to the occupants of the Gaza strip , and to the stability of the whole region. Nevertheless, what other course is open to Israel?\nIt must protect itself from continued attacks\nEqually, no peace process can proceed whilst armed terrorists are determined that there should be no peace until Israel is wiped from the map.\nSmoking – what next?\nI won’t be voting to raise the age at which it is lawful to purchase tobacco.\nI don’t subscribe to the view that it is proper for the state to direct us to do things that are good for us, or to abstain from things that are bad for us. Providing warnings or encouragement is one thing, but giving us orders is quite another.\nA number of journalists have demanded to know how I can continue to support the Prime Minister as leader of my party when such a profound philosophical difference has emerged between us.\nWell, first, the PM made it clear that any vote on this question would not be whipped, so the pressure is off; it is purely a matter of conscience.\nSecond, democracy is messy: There will always be substantial disagreements on matters of principle within our political parties, and more so in the UK. Our voting system ensures that, to have any chance of success, a party must have a broad base of support. Proportional voting systems on the continent however, enable their parties to maintain much narrower ideological purity and still secure representation. The consequence is that multiple parties have to forge a coalition after an election and negotiate a programme for government that was never put to the voters. The virtue of the UK system is that we make our coalitions before any election, in that each political party is itself a coalition which puts its manifesto to the judgement of the voters. Inevitably, our ‘broad church’ polity means that, though united on most issues, our political parties will have significant disagreement on others.\nSo, back to tobacco.\nI don’t doubt that had we known the dangers of tobacco when Sir Walter Raleigh first introduced it to England in 1582 it might well have been banned, but it’s too late now.\nThe experience in USA of the Prohibition era from 1920 to 1933, where attempting to ban a widely consumed product, in that case alcohol, gave rise to a crime wave, violent gangsterism and widespread flouting of the law, is a warning of how this might play out.\nIt is one thing to demand that youngsters prove their age, but as the age threshold rises year by year, are we really going to ask the retailer to distinguish between one old man who is entitled to purchase a packet of cigarettes, and another old man, albeit one year younger, who isn’t?\nAre we really going to make sure that someone, now aged fourteen, is prohibited thought-out his life from enjoying the luxury of a cigar on New Year’s Eve?\nIs this really the business of government?\nAside from rescuing us from ourselves, the principal argument for prohibition is the scale of cost that falls upon the NHS through treatments for smoking-related disease.\nI accept that there is a logic to this. We have developed a system of socialised medicine where we share the cost of any individual ill-health among all tax-payers. It follows that anyone who recklessly endangers their health is a burden upon all the rest of us. Does it follow therefore, that we have the right to prevent them?\nIt may be logical, but it is the thin end of a very thick wedge. Its logic would soon extend to an absolute ban on smoking, and, so proceeding, to alcohol, and to any number of other products that food fascists have on their agendas\nHS2\nA constituent wrote to complain that he couldn’t find my blog on HS2. That’s because I’ve never written one…yet.\nThe reality is that most MPs are generalists. Of course, some bring particular, knowledge, expertise and experience from a profession or previous walk of life that they’ve been involved in. Others will master a brief and become expert in an aspect of policy in which they’re particularly interested, or if they’ve been appointed to a specific bill’s standing committee or elected to serve on a select committee.\nNot many of us are polymaths, so we are reliant on advice of experts and to temper that advice with our own prejudices and the weight of opinion of constituents, and most important of all, participating in the debate in Parliament -which is, after all, what we were elected to do.\nI’ve always had a healthy scepticism for large public sector infrastructure projects. The great age of the railway, though enabled by parliamentary legislation, was financed by private enterprise which carried both the risks and the rewards.\nNevertheless, HS2 with its huge implications for taxpayers, was given thorough parliamentary scrutiny. The Act that enabled it broke precedent by spanning two different parliaments (the members of the special standing committee, to ensure continuity, had to be from ‘safe’ seats which were unlikely to change hands in the election dividing the parliaments).\nThe Bill was subject to the hybrid procedure because it disproportionately affected so many different private interests. That procedure places a very significant additional burden on the MPs sitting on the committee, giving them a quasi-judicial role. Various interest groups, represented by parliamentary counsel (specialist barristers) present evidence from witnesses and cross examine the witnesses of other interest groups. The MPs sit as both judge and jury, they can intervene to cross-examine witnesses themselves, as a trial judge might.\nThe snag is that, like a juror, an MP nominated to such a committee has to present for every session of what, in the case of HS2, was a marathon.\nThough I had my doubts, I was never a partisan. I was prepared to accept the judgement of the standing committee that had examined all the evidence in such detail. Those MPs who were most vehement in their opposition clearly had a particular axe to grind: they were disproportionately those colleagues whose constituencies in the Chilterns, and elsewhere, were going to be dug up.\nI was to some extent reassured by the pedigree of the protagonists. Philip Hammond, formerly the MP for Runnymede and Weighbridge, was the Secretary of State for Transport who gave the green light to the project, he also became one of our most conservative and parsimonious of chancellors of the Exchequer.\nI always thought that halving journey times was a complete red herring. The case was always, in my estimate, built on the huge shortage of rail capacity on the routes north of London, where no new railway had been built for over 100 years. The question was one of ‘if we are going to build the new rail capacity that is needed, would we build an ‘old one’ or one using the latest cutting-edge technology?\nWe went for the latest technology, and that is largely responsible for the exponential rise in costs.\nWe have a duty to review the decisions we made in the light of the detrimental impact that these costs have on other important national priorities. It is always difficult to admit a mistake, particularly such a costly one, but it may be better than compounding the mistake by ploughing on.\nI will await the outcome of the PM’s review before deliberating further.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 7\n- 8\n- 9\n- 10\n- 11\n- …\n- 59\n- Next Page »",

I am not sure that the marriages of politicians are more prone to end in divorce than they are in any other profession. Clearly however, physical separation doesn’t help. If you have to be in Westminster and order your affairs so that your spouse is at a distance in your constituency home, then an additional stress has been placed on the relationship, and additional opportunities for the Tempter.\nWhen I was selected to be the Conservative Candidate to fight New Forest West before the 1997 election, a member of the selection committee told me that they had chosen my wife too: We were considered to be a team (such processes are now considered beyond the pale and candidates cannot even say if they have spouses, let alone be accompanied by them to interviews and selection hustings).\nEqually, when I arrived at Westminster I was advised by professional staff at the Commons to employ my wife as a member of my staff as such an arrangement would ensure that she was involved in my work as part of the team, so acting as a powerful corrective to any sense of isolation, and even possibly temptation.\nAfter the expenses scandal of 2009 the newly created Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority announced that it was minded to end the practice of allowing MPs to employ their wives. Following a public consultation they changed course and accepted that the practice had significant advantages. Unfortunately, they changed their mind again a few years later, since when new Members have been unable employ their spouses.\nSome 15 years ago I recall the telephone ringing one Friday evening as I was rushing to get out in time to attend a voluntary organisation’s Summer barbeque in Ringwood. On the line was a well-known journalist from a Sunday newspaper telephoning to warn me that they were going to publish a story about an affair I’d been having and that– when I’d sought to end it- my lover, in an act of vengeance, had leaked embarrassing emails.\nIt was with some relief that I was able to say that whilst I had on a number of occasions met the woman that he had named, also that I was confident that I had always done so accompanied by a member of my staff (my wife!).\nThe story never appeared. Alas, the emails however, filled many column inches. Though embarrassing, mercifully they were of a political, rather than a sexual nature.\nAs to how the emails had leaked, it wasn’t a jilted lover: I had left myself logged into a computer in the library, then I had gone out to take a phone call without logging-off.\nI think they call it ‘user error’.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_prison-works/content_770.html": "I was a prison visitor for over a decade, first at The Scrubs, then at HMP Wandsworth\nOn Tuesday last week the Commons approved the Release of Prisoners (Alteration of Relevant Proportion of Sentence) Order 2019, which is a very welcome measure: it ends the present early release regime for violent and sexual offences. Currently those offenders are released on licence once they have served only half their sentence. Furthermore, that halfway release is automatic, it is not dependent on good behaviour or on any other assessment.\nThe order that we passed last week changes this in two very important respects: first, it extends the release point until they have served two thirds of their sentence. Second, that release will no longer be automatic, on the contrary, it will require a full evaluation of risk and readiness by the parole Board.\nThis is a step in the right direction, but I do not believe it goes far enough. I believe we should be honest in our sentencing: the sentence that the judge gives in court should be the one that the prisoner should serve. What happens in court at present is a fiction: the judge might announce that the prisoner will go down for five years, but only the ‘man in the street’ is fooled. Those who understand the system will quickly work out on the back of their fag packet that he’s only going down for 2 years and six months. We should be grateful that now it means he’ll be inside for at least three years and four months, maybe longer. It would be more honest, I suggest, if the judge said at the outset “I’m sending you down for three years and four months, after which you may -dependent upon your behaviour in prison- be either released on licence, or remain in prison for a further year and eight months.\nThere is a whole lot more to do. Further legislation is on the way shortly to extend similarly the prison sentences of terrorists. I’ve always thought it absurd that an enormous amount of our counter-terrorism resources are taken up with monitoring terrorists who have been released from prison. Clearly, if they are still a danger requiring monitoring, then it was madness to have released them.\nWe also need to extend these provisions to less serious crimes, such as burglary. A Police officer recently told me that he had a graph indicating ‘spikes’ in local break-ins, which he could map directly to the release dates of a known repeat offender.\nWhen Michael Howard was Home Secretary he used to say “prison works”, what he meant was that communities are spared significant levels of crime so long as the habitual criminals are ‘inside’.\nIt follows that if we want lower levels of crime, then we need to keep criminals inside for longer. Frankly, we ought to keep them inside until they demonstrate that they are reformed.",

The Government backs small businesses, including responsible short-term holiday letting, which brings significant investment to local communities. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the impact that large numbers of holiday lets concentrated in an area can have on local communities.\nThe Government’s proposed planning changes would see the introduction of a new national use class and, simultaneously, the introduction of a new permitted development right. The new permitted development right would provide flexibility where short-term lets are not a local issue and allow for this flexibility to be removed where there is a local concern. Any Article 4 direction to remove the permitted development right must be evidence based and should apply to the smallest geographical area possible, and could therefore be focused on those areas or streets that see the highest numbers of short-term lets, or individual properties.\nAs set out in the consultation document, when the use class comes into effect existing properties would fall into the short-term let use class where they met the definition or remain as C3 dwellinghouse. Any re-classification is not considered development and so property owners should not need to apply for planning permission where they meet the definition of short-term let. They would be classified as such and would not require planning permission.\nAs you may know, the Government has also consulted on plans for a short-term lets registration scheme. A registration scheme is important. Crucially, it will provide information to help local authorities enforce health and safety regulations and apply and enforce the planning changes.\nDS",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_failed-lockdowns/content_738.html": "In my speech in Parliament in on 30th December in opposition to the previous tightening of restrictions (now overtaken by the all-England lock-down) I identified a need for competitive sources of expertise on which the Government could rely, even if only to frame the right questions to put to its current scientific advisors on SAGE -which suffers from all the disadvantages of decision-making by committee.\nThat speech has provoked a welcome email response from scientists from all disciplines, and in particular from some of our most eminent statisticians and mathematicians. They have sent me their analyses challenging the orthodoxy with which we are daily presented.\nIt is of some reassurance to know that you are not alone, and that that your stance is supported by credible experts. This is especially the case as the public debate has become more strident and toxic: The derision with which dissident professors have been treated in the media is itself a form of censorship.\nTwo things are clear. First, the last 12 months have been by no means exceptional in terms of total UK deaths. This is not, in any way, to fail to recognise the suffering of people mourning those who have died, but it does raise questions about the accuracy of recording any death within 28 days of a positive Covid test as being a Covid death.\nIf one accepts the accuracy and validity of the figures for Covid deaths, then it follows that 10 months of lockdowns have failed to reduce them. The Lancet published an evaluation of lockdown policy across governments and of varying severities, here is the conclusion:\n‘Increased mortality per million was significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence and per capita gross domestic product…. Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people’\nIn plain language, lockdowns didn’t impact on Covid deaths, neither did mass testing. Yet these are the two of the baskets into which we have placed most of our eggs.\nSetting aside the question of deaths, the main effort has always been to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed by the number of hospital admissions. As these have risen sharply over the last couple of weeks it is further testimony to the failure of lockdowns as a policy.\nFrom the outset a number of us have argued that a lockdown merely postpones the progress of the disease: the moment social isolation measures are eased, then the disease accelerates until a further lockdown is ordered. Yet this failing policy comes at an enormous social and economic cost which will scar our collective life for a decade.\nA sensible alternative would have been to identify the vulnerable groups most likely, if infected, to be hospitalised and incentivise their isolation (bluntly: assist them and pay them to isolate). This would have been neither easy nor inexpensive, but it might well have delivered a manageable level of hospital admissions with very much less damaging social and economic consequences.\nWe expect now to be rescued by vaccines, vindicating the Government’s strategy of suppressing the virus until vaccines became available.\nI would hope that the failure of lockdowns however, would be a lesson that we have learnt for the future, but the way that the critics of lockdowns have been silenced, derided and presented as mavericks, is hardly encouraging.",

Furthermore, the only reason that we are having a referendum at all, is because David Cameron campaigned on the basis of a manifesto commitment to do so at the last election.\nA number of my Eurosceptic colleagues have been very critical of the package that the PM has renegotiated. I believe that he has secured a significant change: the removal of the UK from the treaty obligation to ‘ever closer union’ is an important marker for the future when this legally binding change is incorporated into the next EU treaty. In its effect it will give us a new and different status within the EU. Were we to vote to remain in the EU we would do so under more favourable terms than we have at present.\nEU migrant access to UK benefits was one of the areas where the PM was not as successful in the renegotiation as he originally hoped. He has improved the situation, but the new agreement does not match his original ambition. My fundamental problem is that he had to ask at all. The rules that govern the receipt of benefits in the UK, funded by the UK exchequer, ought to be the exclusive prerogative of our own UK Parliament, and not a matter for horse trading at the EU Council.\nAll sorts of terrors will be threatened in an attempt to persuade us to stay. In the long term however, our prosperity will depend on our competitiveness, and I am confident that outside the EU we have the ability to deliver greater competitiveness than we can within it. Of course, there are risks about leaving, but I believe that the risks are greater if we stay.\nThis is not a new position that I have arrived at. Regular readers of this column will know that I voted to leave the Common Market in 1975. So many of my constituents complain that back then they were duped: that they thought that it was just about trade, and they only discovered later that it was a political project that, amongst other things, would rob us of the power to decide who can live in the UK and claim benefits here. Nobody can legitimately claim ignorance this time around.\nThe PM urged Members of Parliament to decide the issue on the basis of their conscience and not to be swayed by party activists, and I will certainly obey him in that respect. Fundamentally I want to live in an independent country that can reach its own decisions, and control its own borders. We cannot do so in important respects so long as we remain in the EU. I will be voting to leave. Hopefully, second time lucky.",

You have to know exactly what it is that you are seeking to achieve and design all your policy towards obtaining that aim.\nBack in March the aim was defined as ‘flattening the curve to protect the NHS’\nLast week I asked the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, if this had remained the same.\nHe replied “our aim is to flatten the curve, to protect the NHS and to save lives” and significantly he added “protect the economy”\nNeither the aim expressed in March, nor the restatement by Mr Gove last week gives us much by which we can judge the direction or effectiveness of policy. We do not know what the end state is supposed to be. We do not know for sure if the aim is to contain, delay the spread, suppress, or eradicate the disease. ‘Flattening the curve’ seems to suggest merely delaying the spread which was certainly understandable back in March: by delaying we would reach the warmer summer weather; The NHS would have less flu, norovirus, and other winter pressures to deal with; and the virulence of coronaviruses tend to abate in summer months.\n‘Flattening the curve’ is much less understandable as a statement of the aim in the autumn.\nI am often at a loss as to what the Government’s policies are supposed to achieve.\nA typical example is the nationwide 10pm curfew on the hospitality industry, particularly given Mr Gove’s additional stated aim to ‘protect the economy’.\nThe virus certainly can’t tell the time, and the impact on the industry is devastating: To comply with regulations premises have reduced their capacity and introduced expensive new staff-intensive procedures. Consequently, sufficient opening ours are vital to secure sufficient revenues, especially where restaurants need to secure a second dinner sitting.\nThis policy, applied across the country despite widely different infection rates, makes nonsense of the stated aim.\nIt would have been better to devolve powers to the local levels where any curfew could have been applied to individual establishments, giving proprietors a powerful incentive to influence the social-distancing behaviour of their patrons.",

In addition, the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Act introduced tougher sentences for animal cruelty, increasing maximum sentences. The Ivory Act came into force in 2022 and has recently been extended to cover five more endangered species.\nThe Kept Animals Bill, introduced in June 2021, was designed to implement several of the Government’s ambitions for animal welfare. This included banning the live exports of animals, seeking to prevent pet theft, and new measures to tackle livestock worrying. The Bill’s multi-issue nature means that there has been considerable scope-creep, and the Bill risks being extended far beyond the original commitments in the Conservative Manifesto, as well as and the Action Plan for Animal Welfare. Therefore, the Government will now be taking forward measures in the Kept Animals Bill individually during the remainder of the Parliament. The Government remains fully committed to delivering its manifesto commitments on animal welfare.\nSince 2010, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has had a strong track record in reforms. This includes: a ban on the use of conventional battery cages for laying hens; mandatory CCTV in slaughterhouses across England; a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses; the strongest ivory ban in the world; mandatory microchipping of dogs; and new regulations for minimum standards for meat chickens; and the modernisation of the licensing system for dog breeding and pet sales.\nFinally, the Government supports a series of Private Members’ Bills which will deliver important reforms on animal welfare. These include the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill, which will ban the import of hunting trophies for specific species; the Shark Fins Bill, which will ban the import and export of shark fines; as well as the Animals (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill, which will ban the sale and advertising of activities abroad which involve low standards of welfare for animals.",

So, as we will have to use oil and gas anyway, it much better that we use our own than have to import from sources that generate significantly higher emissions and come with all the supply hazards that have driven energy prices through the roof.

We even used to refer to him as ‘The Master’. Clearly, you cannot win 3 general elections in a row with majorities to dream of, without an immense ability to manage your political party and to reach out beyond your committed and faithful supporters. I always saw Tony Blair as a political ‘star’ of similar calibre to Bill Clinton in the USA. All this, without sharing his political outlook or his policies… that is until now:\nWhen Blair spoke out last week about the ‘imbecilic’ decision to leave Afghanistan in the way that the US Biden administration did, I do not think I could have come up with a better way of describing it. A monumental strategic error has been made.\nAfter a twenty-year commitment, expensive in both lives and money, I entirely understand the urge to withdraw. But to do so without first establishing the capabilities of Afghan forces, and to do so in a way that so undermined their morale, and to have done it during the Taliban’s fighting season instead of waiting till winter until they return to their tribal fastness, and to have done it with so little planning for the detailed logistics of withdrawal, all of this amounts to an enormous blunder with incalculable consequences.\nA Regime that assassinated female judges, female TV presenters, bombed girl schools, markets and weddings has been handed control. It remains intimately connected with Al Qaeda; it has released 500 of the world’s most dangerous terrorists which we left imprisoned at Bagram -when so much sacrifice went into their capture. And now we discover that we have left them with the pick of $85 billion’s worth of the most modern weapons. Frankly, it is just incredible that such an act of self-harm could have been allowed to happen.\nSo, were the billions of pounds that we spent and the British lives that we sacrificed, in vain?\nI certainly don’t believe so: Hundreds of terrorist outrages were prevented by the work of our troops in Afghanistan.\nIt was a righteous cause and the years of education and healthcare that improved so many lives were certainly of enormous benefit to millions.\nThe one bright spot of the last few days has been the magnificent performance of our Armed Forces in the most difficult and stressful of circumstances, evacuating 15,000 souls in the last fortnight, retaining their professionalism and efficiency in the face of such extremes of human misery.

What really hurts is when you know that there is truth in them.\nThe vitriolic response to the UN resolution on illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestine, and to John Kerry’s very measured speech explaining why the USA refused to exercise its veto, show that Israel is just a touch sensitive on the issue.\nThe reality is clear to anyone who looks at the pattern of settlement building on a map: it is removing the possibility of a viable Palestinian state that could co-exist peacefully with Israel.\nIsrael has persisted with settlement expansion on Palestinian land whilst the focus of world attention in the region has been understandably elsewhere, and it has, until now, enjoyed the assurance of support in the USA.\nMy own attitude was one of instinctive support for Israel. It is a democracy and an ally. My generation saw the Arab / Israeli wars through the lens of a David against Goliath. My attitudes were hardened by our experience of international terrorism by the PLO and our horror at what happened at the Munich Olympics. In more recent years we were disgusted by the senseless and indiscriminate suicide bombings of innocents in Israel.\nWe do no service to our friend and ally however, if we are silent and ignore its folly at scuppering the possibility of a two state solution, which we regard as the only prospect for its own long term peace and security.\nJohn Kerry said that, if the endeavour to create two state solution is abandoned, Israel cannot be both a democracy and Jewish: for if the Palestinians are not to have their own state, then they will have to have all their civil rights accommodated in the state of Israel.\nMy fear is that a significant part of the Israeli establishment reject this logic. Rather, they believe that they can continue to occupy Palestinian land and tell the Palestinians that they must seek their political expression and representation in Jordan, or in sub-state ‘bantustans’.\nThe Obama administration’s pressure on Israel has come far too late, and President Trump will renew robust, perhaps unquestioning, support for Israel. So, the prospects for a two state solution, which has been the focus of US and European endeavour for so long, looks bleak indeed.\nIf the opportunity is lost, Israel will not be alone in bearing the consequences: we will all feel the fallout from continuing violent instability in the region.",

The Chief of the Defence staff, Sir Nicholas Carter’s analysis that the Afghan security forces were pursuing a sensible strategy of consolidating in the cities, turns out to have been quite detached from actual events on the ground.\nEqually, my own suggestion that we might be being too hasty in our determination to expedite evacuations, turns out to have been ill-informed. Nevertheless, the concern about providing asylum for translators has been a long running saga over recent years and is likely to have had an impact on the morale of those who had no alternative but to continue taking the fight to the Taliban.\nIn 2016 I had a meeting with President Ghani where one item on my agenda was to get a more constructive approach from his government regarding facilitating the return to Afghanistan of failed Afghan asylum seekers from the Britain. His response was that he was a ‘war president’ and his first concern must be the men and women who were fighting the battle, rather than taking up any of his time with arrangements to accommodate those who had chosen to run away. It was a fair point.\nMy own view was that our proper contribution to Afghanistan was not in providing asylum, but rather in the hundreds of lives sacrificed by our armed forces and the billions of pounds that we spent on education, healthcare, humanitarian aid and economic development. The humiliating defeat of this enterprise inevitably means we will face what we sought to avoid, namely enormous new demands on our ability to provide sanctuary and asylum.\nThere is no hiding the magnitude of the disaster. An enormous unforced strategic error has been made by the decision to withdraw before the Afghan armed forces were capable of defeating the Taliban.\nOur enemies will be celebrating the humiliating defeat of western democracy and a huge morale boost will be given to Islamist terrorists the world over.\nIt is pure wishful thinking to believe that the Taliban will not return to their former policy of harbouring foreign terrorists and promoting the violent assault on our values. The disaster in Afghanistan is unlikely to be confined there.\nAlmost as an afterthought, Afghan students who had been successful in the highly competitive Chevening Scholarship scheme, which enables them to study for a master’s degree in the UK, have been told that there is now no time to arrange their visas.

Well, it seems to have survived pretty well.\nCivil Partnerships were introduced in 2004 to enable same-sex couples to enter a legally recognised and protected relationship because they were unable to get married. Now that they are able to marry it should logically follow that civil partnerships should be abolished.\nMy colleague however, wants to extend them to all couples.

Money is like any other commodity: the more there is of it, the less value it holds.\nWe’ve seen energy prices rise because the demand has exceeded supply as the world economy recovers from the Pandemic at the same time as the situation in Ukraine has led to the sanctioning of Russian oil production.\nWe can respond to the higher energy price by cutting our consumption of energy, or if that is too painful, by paying the higher price and instead, manage our limited finances by cutting our consumption of something else. Collectively, as millions of us make these decisions, there will be either a reduction in the demand for energy, or a reduction in the demand for other commodities. Prices will fluctuate accordingly: The price of energy will ease as demand for it at the higher price falls, or if we just can’t do without it, then the prices of other goods will fall as we cease to purchase them because we are now spending so much on energy instead.\nThis will be an uncomfortable process in an economy like ours which is so reliant on consumer expenditure. Our higher energy bills will inevitably squeeze other aspects of economic activity that we can no longer afford. There will not however, be any increase in the general level of prices. The higher price of energy will be offset by the falling prices of goods that we can no longer afford.\nA general rise in prices can only be sustained if we try and avoid the pain by inflating the economy to accommodate the higher level of prices by ‘printing’ and circulating more money. We have been doing this in a number of ways for years. Understandably, governments -fearing recession and unemployment due to the banking crisis in 2008 and the pandemic more recently- increased their own spending, borrowed more, and extended credit throughout the economy.\nInitially, this did not drive-up prices because demand remained suppressed. Now however, we are at full employment, there are huge world-wide supply chain problems and we have had the oil price shock. We are in a situation where too much money is chasing too few goods.\nThe only blunt tool the Bank of England currently has with which to remedy this, is to increase interest rates to try and squeeze some of the excess demand out of the economy. This will hurt, but it will pass.\nWhat we must not do is feed the monster by creating more demand in the economy through reduced taxes or increasing government expenditure to ease the short-term pain. Such policies will drive prices up further and -most damaging of all- create an expectation that inflation will continue. That would lead to excessive wage demands, which would reduce employment, and -so proceeding- give rise to further demands to inflate the economy with more spending and credit to mop up that unemployment…and so the cycle will continue.\nWe’ve been here before: welcome to the 1970ies.\nBest to grit out teeth and take the painful medicine now, than perpetuate if for decades.",

This duty is currently discharged in the commitment we make to spend 0.7% of our income on aid to the poorest countries, leaving us all of 99.7% of our income for ourselves.\nThe second pillar is our own national self-interest: The objective of our aid budget is the same as that of our Defence budget and our Foreign Office budget, namely to project our power and influence internationally, in order to deliver stability and security in which we will prosper.\nI am always keen to argue about how this budget could be spent more effectively to achieve this end, but I do not question that it continues to be in our interest to spend it. Indeed, at this point in our history, when we are leaving the EU and seeking to re-establish our place in the international order, I think it would be folly to reduce the ‘soft power’ that our UK Aid represents and the influence internationally that it affords us.\n‘Sex-gate’ has raced through Hollywood, Parliament, the media, and sport. Now it has reached international humanitarian and development aid. It raises questions about the way we go about doing things but it does not fundamentally undermine the purpose of doing them.\nNevertheless it does underline the importance of taking control of your supply chain if you are to avoid severe reputational damage. If our Department of International Development subcontracts a project to Oxfam to deliver, then it has to be exacting in the standards that it demands.\nThis is by no means straightforward. for example, let’s say we decide to fund a reputable international organisation like The World Bank, to build a hospital in a very poor country like Nepal.\nThe World Bank, then sub-contracts to civil engineering companies and builders to carry out the work. One of the builders orders locally made bricks –which is a good thing because it helps the local economy and creates jobs.\nThen investigative journalists discover that the brick-maker is employing child labour in frightful conditions. The reputational damage will go right back up the chain to the World Bank and our own Government for not investigating carefully enough exactly what they were paying for.\nThe same discipline applies to entirely commercial undertakings: when Rana Plaza collapsed in Bangladesh in 2013, killing over a thousand garment workers, the reputational damage rebounded on our own high street chains for not taking more care over the conditions in which their imported stock was being manufactured.\nWe all have a duty to ask searching questions about what we buy and about charities that we support.\nIf things turn look too good to be true, usually it’s because they just aren’t true",

I have to tell them to forget it. There will be no time for any other legislation.

These committees are composed of a subset of MPs determined by a formula to reflect the composition of the Commons as a whole. The Democratic Unionists, on whom the Government relies for a majority, are too few in number to qualify for representation on the standing committees. It follows that the Government will not have a majority on any such committee, and therefore cannot risk it. As a consequence, any legislation will have to be taken on the floor of the Commons in a ‘committee of the whole House’ creating a complete legislative log-jam.\nI see no light at the end of the tunnel, with the Government at constant risk of defeat.\nIt is at times like this that you have to concentrate on what you have already survived, in order to give you a proper sense of proportion.\nWe survived school, including liver like rubber that you had to hide in your pocket and hope to remain undetected; we survived those knee length bell-bottomed football shorts made of jaggy army battle dress fabric that chapped your inner thighs; and, hey, does anyone remember IZAL Medicated….\nThe Worst is always behind us: We will get through this.",

It flows from its headwaters adjacent to the B3078 near Bramshaw Telegraph down to the Avon.\nThe Forestry Commission has just submitted a planning application to fill-in and redirect the stream as part of the EU funded Higher Level Stewardship Scheme. I visited this much loved part of the Forest back in 2012 after concerns were raised about tree-felling along the stream. Since then proposals have expanded to cover the whole catchment. This now requires a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which provides an opportunity for everyone to take part in the consultation process over the next 16 weeks.\nI recommend that anyone with an interest in the Forest should “walk the stream” to see what a wonderful place it is already. Much of Islands Thorns inclosure is designated “ancient and ornamental woodland” with magnificent oaks and beech trees. It includes a remarkable section of stream, a highly protected “site of special geological conservation interest” with deposits set down over 40 million years ago. Extraordinarily, it appears that this is to be infilled too.\nAn intervention on such a scale along miles of stream will have major impacts on the whole catchment, and many questions will need to be addressed in the EIA before decisions are taken which will change the existing habitats for the foreseeable future. These must include the effect of importing thousands of tonnes of hoggin and clay into the ancient stream; the impact of heavy earth moving vehicles in an environment where previous interventions have been carried out with little more than men with spades (strangely, the numerous side drains that those spades fashioned, and which prevent the trees from becoming waterlogged, are to remain); how the ancient history, including the largest concentration of Roman features in the whole of the New Forest will be preserved; and how the existing habitats for species such as the rare Southern Damselfly and Smooth Snake (for which I am the ‘species champion’) will be conserved.\nIslands Thorns, Amberwood and Alderhill inclosures eventually open on to the grassland, heath and mires down to Ogdens which are already important habitats for a variety of species. Ponies and cattle graze by the stream and on “The Shade” – the large area of open grassland. It is an iconic scene which draws many visitors, with easy access from the nearby car parks.\nThis is a truly remarkable landscape that is typical of the New Forest and which needs protecting and conserving. Vandalism is the word that comes to my mind. I support any move to stop these proposals, there are plenty of better ways to spend the money.",

Indeed, I did so for longer that the mere minute that was officially encouraged. I confess however, that my mind wandered, and I found myself thinking about my own life rather than that of Queen Elizabeth II, an act of pure self-indulgence, please forgive me. My excuse is that she is part of the constant backdrop to my entire life, having been born four years into her reign. Everything that I can remember happened whilst she was our Queen: Her broadcast was part of every Christmas Day.\nI swore my allegiance to her on ten occasions. As my mind ranged over the years, I recalled my Grandparents. They were enthusiastic Royalists. One granny had collection of coronation mugs which now adorn my office at Westminster. My grandpa, a soldier of the first world war , who saw the angels of Mons, had a photograph of the young Queen displayed in the ‘back room’ , he would always refer to her as “my Queen” and would stand to attention when the national anthem was played at the end of the evening’s broadcasts – yes! the telly -a very substantial item of furniture- stopped every night and didn’t resume till late afternoon the following day. There were only a couple of channels, and they were just black and white. Do you remember the Test Card with 359 lines?\nAfter the national anthem the image on the screen would disappear into a white dot in the centre and a high-pitched whine would continue until it was switched off.\nThey never had a fridge: they didn’t need one; the cupboard in the front room was quite cool enough. The front room was only for entertaining, I only ever recall it being used once a year for ‘Hogmanay’ which was also my grandpa’s birthday. Life during the day was lived in the ‘scullery’ (a sort of annex to the kitchen) in which a coal fire was lit first thing in the morning. After tea in the evening, life would move into the ‘back room’ where another coal fire was lit.\nIn the mornings my brother and I would scratch designs into the frost that had formed on the inside of the windowpanes. We would be sent down the street to fetch Granny’s “messages” (her shopping). This could be quite confusing because she would always refer to shops by the names that they had been known by years previously, when they had been opened by former Italian Prisoners of war that had decided to settle in the town. There were no supermarkets, you queued at each shop and asked for what you wanted at the counter. On our way to and from the shops we would rush up the footbridge if a train was passing and stand enveloped in smoke.\nEven the money was different: We were given a threepenny bit to put in the collection on Sundays. We got two shillings pocket money (called a ‘florin’, now replaced by 10P) and if you got a ten bob note (50P) on your birthday you were a wealthy boy – or even a postal order, remember them?\nThere were no mobile phones, no constant noise of social media, no tyranny of email. If you wanted to telephone someone you had to ring the exchange and ask to be put through to their number. Remember button A and button B in the telephone box?\nOf course, the downside was that if you were travelling and were planning to meet someone, you had no way of letting them know that you would be late, or even not going to make it at all, potentially ending a relationship when you had arranged to meet up with your girlfriend in Rome.\nThey lived modestly, but my grandpa always took pride in his appearance. I’ve inherited his morning suit and top hat. I wore them to every audience I had with Her Majesty when I was her Vice-Chamberlin, and I wore it to her lying in state last week",

He didn’t give the slightest hint of the ‘plot’ which has subsequently emerged. Perhaps he realised that I would not be remotest of prospects (or perhaps he just thought me now of too little consequence). In any event, he has now been ‘outed’ in a Machiavellian master-stroke by the government whips. I know how dreadful it is being at the centre of a media feeding frenzy, so I do not envy him, but hey, he had it coming.\nUnderstandably. I have had a huge correspondence about splits and leadership challenges. I share my correspondents’ frustration, but not their evident surprise: I cannot recall when it was not so.\nI was David Cameron’s parliamentary secretary for 8 years, both as leader of the opposition and Prime Minister. I cannot remember when there wasn’t plotting. I did the same job for Michael Howard, and I was in the Whips office during Ian Duncan-Smiths turbulent leadership: The battle was continuous. John Major fought a long guerrilla war with elements of the Parliamentary party. No less so, did Maggie. Even Churchill had to endure continuous sniping from his own side. The Other parties are no different. Blair spoke of the scars on his back, and Jeremy Corbyn had the most turbulent contests up until the June election.\nOur electoral system ensures that our political parties have to be broad churches of generally like-minded people who, nevertheless will be bound to disagree on important issues affecting the future of our country. This should not surprise us but, add to that mix the large egos disproportionately possessed by politicians, and the short attention span of our journalism which has a tendency to see everything through the prism of ‘personalities’, and it is little wonder that the headlines scream.\nOf the inundation of emails, not one has urged me to use my influence dispose of the current PM. They have all supported her. I believe they are right to do so because the challenge that we face as a nation is one of policy not personality. There are two key issues to be addressed:\nFirst, to negotiate BREXIT on advantageous terms.\nSecond, to maintain financial stability whilst at the same time addressing the proper public demand to improve the housing situation, productivity and stagnant wages, care for the elderly, growing student debt, and… I could go on.\nNone of these priorities would be advanced by the distraction of a leadership election. If there were a candidate who so obviously were going to make a better fist of it than the current PM then one might understand the motive, but there isn’t.\nThis is a time to hold our nerve, to knuckle down, and get on with the job.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_still-plotting-remain/content_333.html": "Bizarrely, last Thursday evening, over 9 months after the decisive referendum result in favour of leaving the EU, I was at the Cannon Street offices of CMS, the city law firm, debating the question that ‘The UK is leaving the EU’ together with my Colleague Sir Henry Bellingham MP. Against us, and arguing that we won’t leave, were Lord Butler, a former cabinet secretary, and Lord Lester, our most eminent human rights lawyer.\nAfter 15 public debates across the south of England in the run up to the referendum last June, and two of them in the New Forest – head to head with Sir Vince Cable, am I surprised that here I am, still debating whether the decision of the voters will be implemented?\nNo, I am not. European elites have ‘form’ when it comes to overturning the decisions of voters. The Irish twice voted in referendums not to accede to European treaties, only to be told to repeat the process until they came up with the right answer – which they obligingly did. French and Dutch referendums both decisively rejected the EU Constitutional Treaty (the Dutch by the impressive margin of 68% to 32%). Yet, in all its essentials, that constitution became the Treaty of Lisbon without risking running it past French and Dutch voters again.\nIn very brief summary of our debate: Their Lordships thought it inevitable that the deal negotiated by the Government under Article 50 will be a poor one. They were equally certain that Parliament will have a ‘meaningful vote’ on the outcome (even if that vote is a vote of no confidence in the Government), and that Parliament will overturn it, and we’d give up on leaving.\nMy case is that the very suggestion of a ‘meaningful parliamentary vote’ (let alone a second referendum) is a standing invitation to the EU to overturn our decision by punishing us with such dreadful terms that we are bound to refuse.\nThe only way remove the temptation for them to adopt such a strategy is to maintain the certainty that we are already walking away, that the decision has been made, and that there is no going back.\nOnly then will it be absolutely clear to them, that their best strategy is to negotiate the optimum deal for themselves, which – given our shared identity of mutual interests, will also approximate to the best deal for ourselves.\nThe question isn’t ‘are we leaving the EU?’\nWe are.\nRather, the real question is ‘where are we going?’\nFew of us went into the polling booth on 23rd of June entirely of one mind. Whilst I was convinced that voting to leave was for the best, nevertheless I was thoroughly aware that there would be costs, disadvantages and risks. It is now the duty of the Government, individuals, and every enterprise in the Kingdom to seize the opportunities that are opening up to us, whilst working to minimise the costs and risks.\nThis should be the joint endeavour of the whole nation following the decision that voters have made. Unfortunately, a minority continue to put their effort into contriving circumstances in which the decision by voters can be thwarted.",

There is nothing new under the sun…(and change if usually for the worse).\nWhen I was first elected in 1997 the Commons sat from half past two o’clock in the afternoon until half past ten o’clock (and not infrequently until much later) from Monday to Thursday, and from half past nine o’ clock in the morning until half past two o’clock in the afternoon on a Friday.\nThat didn’t mean we took the mornings off Monday through Thursday. On the contrary, the morning was precious for meetings with councillors, constituents, and experts. They were vital for briefings, telephone calls and correspondence.\nTony Blair’s newly elected government set up its own modernisation committee and the hours were changed. Monday was left unaltered – to allow for MPs from far flung parts to get to Westminster.\nTuesday and Wednesday sittings were changed to start at half past eleven o’clock and finish at half past seven o’clock. Thursday to begin at nine thirty o’clock and finish at five o’clock.\nWe were told that this would allow us evenings with families, or enjoying the theatre, or whatever. We were sold a pup.\nMost MPs have their families in constituencies well beyond the reach of a finish at seven thirty in the evening. They would arrive home after their children had gone to bed, and they would be up the next morning to get to Westminster, before their children were awake.\nFurthermore, a seven thirty finish is not quite what says on the tin: it simply means that the main business must conclude by seven, with an adjournment debate for half an hour thereafter. The main business will more often divide the House. So there will usually be at least one vote and sometimes several more before the adjournment debate. The notion that you might get to the theatre in time is utterly fanciful.\nThat is before you consider that, as happens so often, you get a message from the whips informing you that “the business may go beyond the moment of interruption”, in other words, its going to be a late one.\nSo, we gave up our mornings in which so much could be squeezed, for the illusion of a family friendly leisure time at the end of the day. When, in reality, what had been done in the morning, now had to fill the evenings, but so much less efficiently, because the councillors, officials, experts or whomsoever that you wanted to interact with, are by then at home in front of the telly.\nWe found these changes so shocking that within eighteen months we had voted to restore the status quo ante on Tuesday, and we very nearly got a majority to get back our Wednesdays too.\nThen a new Parliament, with more newer, younger and more gullible members, voted to recapture Tuesday for modernisation.\nI fear it all going to start again, and the result will be even worse.\nThere is something a ‘bit off’ about getting into a new job and immediately agitating to reduce the working hours.",

It also creates a proportionate accountability mechanism to help reassure that central government policymaking takes this into account.\nI am encouraged that this Bill will create an Animal Sentience Committee with experts which will produce reports on how well policy decisions have paid all due regard to the welfare of animals. The relevant Minister must then respond to reports via statements to Parliament. From now on, Ministers will need to be ready to show that the needs of animals have been considered in relevant policy decisions.\nThere is clear evidence that animals with a backbone are sentient and I am pleased that this is reflected in the Government’s Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill. However, I am assured that the Bill also gives the Secretary of State a power to extend the recognition of sentience to particular invertebrates in future on the basis of evidence.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has commissioned an independent review of the available scientific evidence on sentience in decapod crustaceans, as well as sentience in the class cephalopoda. I understand that the review will report shortly and I look forward to reading its conclusions, which I know Ministers will respond to as part of their ongoing work to protect the welfare needs of animals.\nDS.",

This is a private member’s bill which is due to have its second reading early in September. The bill would make it lawful for medical professionals and others to assist someone in committing suicide. The correspondents in favour of the bill were well ahead earlier in the summer but, after a late surge, the antis have caught up. Currently it’s neck and neck.\nMany correspondents tell me it is my duty as their representative to vote in accordance with their wishes. I respond by telling them that my duty is to represent all my constituents, the vast majority of whom have expressed no opinion whatsoever.\nSuicide, and attempted suicide were once criminal offences. The church would even refuse Christian burial to suicides. Nowadays we have rather more understanding and greater compassion. You can now lawfully take your own life. Were anyone to assist you however, they would commit a criminal offence, and it is this that the bill seeks to change.\nThe key change however, is to make suicide easier by allowing medical professionals to provide the required service at the time of the patient’s choosing.\nI have every sympathy for those with terminal medical conditions with gruesome prognoses who, having decided to avoid a grizzly end by terminating their own lives, face the dilemma of going early or delaying too long and losing the physical ability to actually do the deed.\nFor me however, allowing assisted suicide is a step too far.

Since when, the UK negotiating stance, plagued by our own ‘lefty’ lawyers, appears to have weakened dramatically.\nTo recap, the archipelago is a legacy of the Empire, as the British Indian Ocean Territories.\nIn the early nineteen seventies the native population were resettled to Crawley in England and to Mauritius off the coast of East Africa, so that the main Island, Diego Garcia, could be leased to USA for a vital strategic air base.\nNotwithstanding previous agreements and payments, Mauritius has claimed sovereignty and was backed by a UN non-binding judgement.\nTo see if a new agreement could be established, our last government opened negotiations. We ‘walked away’ however, when it became clear that the demands by Mauritius were excessive.\nIn July our newly elected government reopened negotiations and has now reached agreement.\nParliament was told the bones of the agreement are that UK will cede sovereignty to Mauritius and then lease back the Islands for 100 years, with an option to extend for a further 40 years.\nWhat was withheld from Parliament was the price attached to the lease. Although, informed opinion suggested that it was £9 billion.\nThere was some urgency to complete the deal before the supportive Biden presidency ended. This was prevented by an election in Mauritius, which resulted in a new government there, which thought that the deal negotiated by its predecessor was a sell-out. Negotiations were reopened and a revised deal concluded.\nThe Prime Minister of Mauritius told his Parliament that the price of the lease would be an index- linked £18 billion and that Mauritius would have a veto on any lease extension.\nOur Foreign Office Minister told the Commons on Wednesday that the terms of the deal hadn’t changed. So, were they always that bad?\nIt is outrageous that we are contemplating paying billions to rent something that we already own, at a time when we are so strapped for cash that we have stripped pensioners of winter fuel payments the Treasury is even consulting on taxing death-in-service payments to the Armed Forces.\nThe Government’s defence is that our tenure of the Islands require certainty and that there is a danger that this would be thrown into doubt if a case was brought against us at the International Court of Justice. This is pure sophistry, the United Kingdom is not subject to the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ when it concerns disputes involving members or former members of the Commonwealth.\nThis dreadful deal is now on the desk of President Trump. We are at his mercy, hoping that he will save us from ourselves and the rotten deal that the Government has negotiated.\nNow, to cap it all, we discover that the Government is about to open negotiations with Caribbean nations on the issue of reparations for the Slavery. They are asking for trillions, notwithstanding that we were the first to abolish slavery and then expended enormous sums using our naval power to stamp out the trade internationally.\nSo much of the effort against us on the question of the Chagos and of slavery reparations is driven by our own left-wing lawyers who hate Britain and are ashamed of our history.",

Listening or watching the wall-to-wall coverage however, is just too intrusive, so much noise, I’ve never been able to understand how anyone can put up with it. Yet constituents often ask me if I watched so and so on Marr?\nWatch politics on TV and on a Sunday morning!\nFirst, I have better things to do. Second, I don’t want to go mad.\nNow, having read the commentaries and analyses, they might be right, but they might not. It is, after all merely the opinion of the commentators, and very little science lies behind it. I rather doubt that those who write so much about what voters want, or why they vote in the way that they do, have ever knocked on many doors and engaged with the voters about it.\nI have, and it isn’t easy. First of all, it’s quite difficult to find anyone at home irrespective of the time of day that you call -within reason. You can cover a whole street and have just one or two short conversations. I say short, because most people have busy lives with plenty of other things to be getting on with.\nThe notion that one might speak to a sufficient number of people to be able to come up with a statistically significant sample of opinion is just fanciful.\nOften, when you really do encounter a voter on their doorstep, the reason they give for their voting intention just doesn’t fit with any of the prevailing political ‘weather’ or events, frequently it’s just the random caprice of an individual decision. Imposing a credible political narrative on it is equally fanciful.\nSo instead, increasingly we rely on the science of polling -quantitative (surveys) and qualitative (focus groups). The problem is that sample is often self-selecting and the participants are led by the nose through a template of questions that impose an order on their opinions that, in reality, just isn’t there.\nSo, what are the lessons to be drawn from the articles by the pundits that I’ve been reading in the papers and online?\nBroadly, they conclude that, after this set of local results following on from the 2019 general election, Labour -as we know it- is finished.\nNow I’ve heard that before many times over the last 40 years. I’ve heard it said about Labour, Conservatives, and Liberal Democrats. At some stage such a prediction may turn out to be right, but not yet. They were wrong then and my hunch is that they’re wrong now.\nWhat has changed in the last 40 years, from my own experience, is the dramatic reduction in party allegiance. When I first started knocking on doors most people appeared to be committed to one of the two major parties and the election would be settled by the movement of relatively small numbers of ‘swing’ voters. This has changed: Overwhelmingly, when you do encounter someone on the doorstep, they don’t know who they will vote for and say they will decide later: more than half the voters now have no residual party allegiance and are open to persuasion. That’s why elections are more volatile with much bigger swings between the parties than we used to experience.\nI certainly wouldn’t write any political party off.",

To be fair, a couple of my oldest Remainer friends won’t any longer speak to me -holding me personally responsible for our leaving the EU, an honour I certainly can’t claim – but they are rare and the choice is theirs, not mine.\nI’m confident that political ideology has never been much of a barrier when it comes to convivial personal relationships.\nI am therefore, all the more bemused by the way that the PM’s coterie of former advisers- despite sharing exactly the same ideological outlook and policy goals, have fallen out with one another so spectacularly to the extent that they clearly now hate each other’s guts.\nAs to the substance of some of the fallout from this, I can’t get excited about it. I am neither surprised nor alarmed that Sir James Dyson texted the PM, and that the PM sought to accommodate his reasonable requests in what was clearly the national interest.\nObviously I do not have one iota of the influence that the PM wields, yet friends, acquaintances and people of whom I have never previously heard, who have got hold of my mobile number or my email address, lobby me to wield what little influence I do have in their own particular interest.\nThe key point is that, in responding, I act in the interest of all my constituents when deciding how to accommodate them. I consider the process is proper so long as I do not become prisoner to any particular lobby: The measure of what is appropriate, must be what is in the national interest.\nAs the furore about leaks escalates, I recall David Cameron (whose parliamentary private secretary I was for 7 years) expressing his frustration at yet another leak of sensitive inter-departmental correspondence -properly handled through civil servants- expressing his frustration and asking “why can’t ministers just talk to one another?”\nCertainly, that was the way that I always operated. I recall a difficult meeting in a foreign capital where my ministerial counterpart was refusing to co-operate with a UK policy objective because another UK department of state was making difficulties over a quite unrelated issue. I couldn’t understand the fussy objections of my civil servants when, after the meeting, I got back into our car and simply phoned the responsible minister back in London to get it sorted out.\nNow as a back-bencher and having acquired so many mobile phone numbers during my time at number 10 and as a minister, when a constituent raises a time-sensitive issue with me, if I consider it important enough I will, of course, properly send correspondence to a minister’s private office, but I’ll also text or phone that minister to lobby them, or I’ll even bend their ear at breakfast in the Commons Tea Room.\nThis is the stuff of ordinary life.

In addition, the Government’s consultation on this received more than 7,000 responses.\nFollowing this research, as well as engagement with trainers, behaviourists, e-collar manufacturers, the animal welfare sector, veterinary and dog keeping organisations, the Government will ban training collars in England that can deliver an electric shock to a cat or dog by a hand-held remote-controlled device.\nThis ban will not extend to collars which use alternative stimuli, such as noise, spray or vibration.

Thereafter, the concession is the responsibility of the BBC. This was agreed at the last negotiation of the TV licence fee – which generates £3.85 billion annually for the BBC. In addition to which, the BBC makes another £1 billion or so, from its commercial activities, including selling programmes to other broadcasters.\nWhen the agreement was reached with the Government that from 2020 the concession should be the BBC’s responsibility, the BBC’s Director General observed that the cost of the concession was more than matched by the funding settlement it had received.\nThe BBC has now decided to not to make the concession to all the over seventy-fives after 2020, but instead, to means-test it by confining the free licence only to pensioners receiving pension credit.\nFrankly, given the settlement that the BBC got, and the agreement it made, I think that tax-payers are being short-changed.\nI certainly don’t think that tax-payers should be expected to pick up the tab for this once again.\nThe BBC has ‘pulled a fast one’ and ought to reconsider.\nConstituents have however, pressed me on the principle that TV licences should be free for the over seventy-fives. Here I have some difficulty – I don’t see why they should.\nEvery autumn, I get a dozen or so letters from pensioners embarrassed by receiving their winter fuel allowance. They complain that they do not need it and that it would be better spent by giving rather more to those in greater need. I agree with them. If the allowance were mean-tested we could afford to make a more generous payment to those who really need it.\nI cannot see why the means-testing principle should not also apply to the TV licence too. Clearly there will be many who can well afford to pay for their own. A colour TV licence is £154.50 per year, that’s just over 40 pence per day.\nMy granny used to save-up for her TV licence. When I was a little boy, she would send me down the street to get her ‘messages’, by which she meant her shopping (and which, in those days, meant waiting to be served in a number of shops, rather than helping-yourself in a supermarket).\nOften, this would involve a trip to the post-office to purchase her TV stamp: By collecting the weekly stamp, she spread the cost of purchasing her licence annually.\nI am nervous about ‘moral hazard’ in the expectation that things should be free.\nPension Credit is currently under-claimed: Many pensioners who are entitled to it, are not claiming it. They will therefore, from 2020, also miss out on a free TV licence if they are over 75.\nThis should be a greater incentive to claim what they paid their national insurance contributions for, and live more comfortably as a consequence.\nAs for the rest of us, we should continue to pay for our own licences.",

Strangely there never has been any legal restrictions on Sunday trading in Scotland (except for pubs). In 1994 however, another less permissive regime did manage to pass into law. This enabled the current situation which we now enjoy: the larger shops (those over 3000 Square feet) are allowed to open for up to six hours between 10 o’clock in the morning and 6 o’clock in the evening on Sundays.\nFollowing the successful extended Sunday opening during the Olympics there has been some pressure to revisit the question of extending Sunday opening once again. Personally, I think that it is unfair to restrict high street opening when internet shopping proceeds unrestrained on a Sunday. Restrictions have never applied in Scotland but they appear to get along quite reasonably: Sundays there seem to remain ‘special’ and I understand that Church attendance is proportionately higher than in England.\nIn recent weeks. I have received quite a large number of emails asking me to vote against changes to Sunday trading hours which are now before Parliament. This is a false premise and I have replied pointing out that no such proposal is before Parliament. The proposal was not to change opening hours, but to change the responsibility for determining the trading hours. Currently Sunday trading in England and Wales is a matter for Parliament in Westminster. The proposal was to allow decisions for England and Wales to be devolved to local authorities, so that elected councils would be allowed to say how long on a Sunday larger shops could remain open for. So, there was no plan to change the hours, only to change who makes decisions about the hours.\nFrankly, it seems reasonable to let more important decisions be made locally, as indeed they are in Scotland. This whole issue has apparently now been shelved because, with a majority of only 12, a small number of Tory rebels threatened to vote against the measure as they believe it is important to defend the rights of Christians not to work on a Sunday. As a Christian myself, I think they are mistaken but I respect their decision and their principles.\nLabour is opposed to the measure because the Trades Unions oppose it. Though I rather suspect that many workers would welcome the extra overtime and the additional jobs it will create.\nThe Scottish Nationalists however, really do win the prize for unprincipled absurdity. They have no restrictions in Scotland, and they can control hours if they want to in their own Parliament at Holyrood. Yet they want to prevent English councils making decisions which do not affect Scotland at all. Having failed to get the Scots to vote for independence last year. I sometimes wonder if their new strategy is to annoy the English to such an extent that we vote for it instead.",

My estimate is that its likelihood is very small.\nSo,\nwe are probably looking at a long delay at best, and ultimately cancelling\nBREXIT altogether at worst.\nA long extension to Article 50 -whilst whatever Parliament now fixes upon is\nnegotiated- will, I believe, very probably lead to our remaining in the EU.\nWith every month that passes status of the decision of the 2016 referendum will\nerode.\nOur political establishment will deliberately seek to present us with\nalternatives that are so dreadful, that we may opt in the end, to stay.\n(Indeed, I suspect that this has been their plan all along).\nIf we opt instead for some variety of ‘soft’ BREXIT, we will face the prospect\nof becoming a vassal state, our laws and trade policy dictated by the EU,\nwithout our voice or vote.

We would have been free of the Common Agricultural Policy, free of the Fisheries Policy, and we would regain control of our borders. Anyone arguing for a return would have had to have persuade us to adopt the Euro, Schengen, and very much higher contributions without Mrs Thatcher’s rebate.\nIf we end up remaining however, the trauma of our failed escape attempt will make it very difficult indeed to persuade Parliament and people to give it another shot in our lifetime.\nThe only positive thing that I have to say, is that this isn’t over yet.\nAnd, hey, Latvia might veto the request to further extend Article 50.\nGod save Latvia!",

Frankly, such is the preponderance of a left-wing outlook among broadcast journalists in general, and the BBC in particular, that I have come to expect treatment of that sort as standard practice.\nRather, It is the format that is so biased in favour of the journalist and against the politicians participating -whatever their politics may be.\nA ‘bun-fight’ fight is deliberately set up so that none of the participants can come out of it smelling of roses. The compere however, with prepared one-line put-downs, and giving little time for her targets to respond, comes out as the master, looking reasonable, clever and in command of misbehaving school-boys.\nI am happy to be interviewed anytime, but for some-time now I have been refusing to do broadcast discussions, unless they are very strictly refereed -where one can only speak at the invitation of the referee. The moment participants are allowed to interrupt each other the whole thing goes the way that the broadcasters always intended: never content with reporting the news, rather they want to make it; by creating a spectacle.\nAs I have implied, all the participants lose out in this format by appearing pushy and unreasonable. Personally, I always come off worst in these arguments because I am just too polite: I was taught not to interrupt.\nOf course, as an ordinary civilian, rather than in my persona as a politician, I interact in conversation just like anyone else. It doesn’t matter if I’m interrupted because I can wait, then proceed as soon the person who has interrupted has finished. In a radio or TV studio, you just don’t have that chance: you are at the mercy of their pressured schedules. It is that pressure to get one’s point across while there is still time -and before the compere or the other participants interrupt again, that makes the whole thing so frightful.\nFormerly, as a member of the directing staff at the Army’s commissioning board I would put potential officers through any number of tests, one of which was to watch them engage with one another in conversations on controversial subjects. The objective, was to see that they could make an argument logically and communicate effectively, at the same time to see that they were not ‘hogging it’ and that they were properly mindful of the others. Indeed, extra merit might be earned by a candidate that turned to one more reticent candidates and afforded him or her an opportunity to participate.\nMany large employers have adopted a similar format when recruiting graduates.\nTo work effectively however, it needs plenty of time, the one thing you don’t get in a TV discussion.\nPutting five politicians on the spot and at the mercy of a compere with ‘reputation’ and only an hour to cover any number of subjects was bound to end the way it did: with none of the participants coming over well. As, I believe, was always the intention.\nIt was for that reason this I urged David Cameron not to challenge Gordon Brown to debates in the 2010 election. I failed.

The Horizon scandal and the Tainted Blood scandal being two obvious examples.\nI just don’t hold the same view when both victims and perpetrators have been dead for over a century.\nRecently I was at a lecture by a clergyman who told us that we all needed to apologise and atone for slavery. I disagreed vociferously on the ground that I had nothing for which to apologise, as I haven’t ever enslaved anyone.\nNow some Commonwealth nations are demanding mind-boggling sums from Britain as reparations for the slave trade. They badgered the Prime Minister into abandoning his original stance ‘this is not on the agenda’, to one of ‘opening a discussion’. Such discussions open the door to a slippery slope: The original flat refusal to engage was the correct response and he should have stuck to it .\nMany Britons were engaged in the ghastly slave trade and profited mightily from it from about 1650 to well into the 19th Century. Africans and Arabs profited from it too.\nMonstrous though slavery is, it had been a universal institution for millennia. Even the Maroons -the escaped slaves in Jamaica- kept their own slaves. Freed slaves in North Carolina owned slaves until the American Civil War in 1861.\nBritain abolished the Slave trade in 1807 and slavery throughout the Empire in 1833. We used our naval power to impose our own abolition of the trade on the rest of the World: 13% of the Royal Navy’s manpower was assigned to the West Africa Anti-Slavery Command. Historians have called that endeavour “the most expensive example of moral action”\nWhilst contemporary UK subjects can’t claim the credit for the action of our forbears in stamping out the trade. Neither should we be asked to pay compensation for being involved in it in the first place.\nSome of the Caribbean nations that suffered under the enslaved plantation system have prospered whilst others much less so. It is not the history of slavery that has blighted those that have not prospered, so much as other circumstances, not least weak and corrupt government.\nWe must not pay up",

I was disappointed when he had to resign in order to vote for an amendment to the Rwanda Bill, I voted for that amendment too.\nI regret his suspension for his tirade against the London Mayor Sadiq Khan, but his refusal to apologise left the PM with no alternative. There were plenty of perfectly proper things that Anderson could have taken khan to task over. He has been a dreadful mayor, squandering the legacy left by his predecessor Boris. His record on Housing, transport, police, and almost everything else has been lamentable.\nTo accuse him of being controlled by Islamists however, is absurd. I know Khan, he is a former parliamentary colleague, he is about as secular a politician as one can get.\nNevertheless, many constituents have registered with me their disgust at Anderson’s treatment.\nThey believe that he has so often articulated their own thoughts and they are concerned about the way that freedom of expression is being diminished. I understand those concerns, but politicians do need to be cautious about the language that they use. Imagine if a politician had criticised a high-profile holder of public office as being controlled by Zionists, the furore would have been deafening.\nMuslims must not be stereotyped. It is quite wrong to conflate ‘Muslims’ with Islamist extremists. We do well to remember current contribution of Muslims to our society as well as their historic contribution to the Empire and, in particular the imperial forces of the Crown.\nBut there are aspects of Islam which it is perfectly proper to subject to public scrutiny, such as the role of women, attitudes to homosexuality, Sharia councils, and teachings on apostacy. Just as there has been no shyness in subjecting Christianity to that same scrutiny ever since the Enlightenment.\nIn a liberal society an important aspect of public life, like Islam, must accommodate itself to the discomforts of public scrutiny and free discussion. Notions of blasphemy are an affront to liberal democracy.\nAfter a long consultation and subsequent deliberation, the Parliamentary Group on British Muslims defines ‘Islamophobia’ as “rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.”\nWhist I can understand what they are getting at, I think this is too broad a definition and has a chilling effect on criticism of aspects of Islam, or indeed of Islam itself. It is far too widely drawn. We must be very careful to ensure that criticism and freedom of expression in public discourse is not constrained by inappropriate accusations of ‘hate speech’. The reality is that Islam, like Christianity, is a religion adhered to by people of all races, and not itself a race.\nAs a Christian I am used to the criticism of my religion, both fair and unfair, and I’ve been critical of it myself too.\nIslam must be subject to the same rigour, and Muslims free to be equally critical of it.\nPoliticians, however, should endeavour to be accurate and justify their assertions with facts.",

Many commoners subsidise their commoning activities from other sources of income.\nA critical part of the equation to sustain commoning for a new generation is the provision of properties with affordable rents. A local home together with a back-up bit of land is an essential ingredient for managing ponies and cattle on the Forest.\nThe problem is that there is an ever grater premium on Forest properties, and you just can’t manage your livestock commuting from an address miles and miles away.\nThe problem isn’t new. It was spotted some time ago.\nThere are 65 Crown properties which were built to meet the needs of the Forestry Commission’s staff, most of whom were themselves commoners. In 1992 the recommendation of the Illingworth report was accepted by the Government, namely that these properties should be let to commoners at a rent equal to 15% of their income.\nThis policy was re-stated to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State in 2006 who said:\n“Two criteria underpin the retention of properties in the Forest. The First is to provide opportunities for affordable housing with associated back-up land for practising commoners and the second is to provide affordable accommodation for commission employees in key posts when there are operational reasons for staff to be based in the Forest.”\nForestry England now stands accused by the Commoners Defence Association of breaching the policy was clearly stated in Parliament. First, it is accused of advertising the properties to all staff within the region and not just those in key posts requiring them to be based in the Forest.\nSecond, that the rents charged are now well beyond the reach of genuine commoners, with rents representing from 70% to in excess of 100% of commoners’ income.\nThis is clearly a change from the policy adopted arising from the Illingworth report. In 2017 the Minister assured me that any review of the Illingworth policy would be preceded by a consultation with all interested parties, and that any change of policy would require ministerial approval.\nThere hasn’t been a consultation, and there has been no ministerial approval of any policy change.\nSo what’s going on?\nI await an answer from the Forestry Minister, David Rutley.\nOf course, I can understand Forestry England’s desire to maximise the income from its assets. It does however, receive a substantial subsidy from taxpayers to pay for its special obligations to conservation of the New Forest.

Now however, they can get onto Facebook, Twitter or whatever, and broadcast bile to ever wider audiences.\nIn addition, as I have observed before, many people will say things whilst typing away at their laptop or mobile telephone, that they would never have dreamed of putting on paper and sending in a letter. Rather in the same way that motorists will shout at other drivers in the privacy of their own car, using language that they would be most unlikely to use in public.\nI have definitely seen the temperature rising over the last year. There is at the root an anger and frustration at the apparent unwillingness of elected politicians to implement the result of the referendum. Parliament was explicit when it passed the legislation for a referendum in 2016: it clearly stated that the future of our membership of the EU, in or out, would be decided by the voters themselves, and that Parliament would implement their decision, whichever way it went.\nSince when we have seen political parties renege from that commitment, some openly and honestly, others by a pretence.\nThe anger and frustration that this has caused is as understandable as the stridency and volume of protests, and even the threats, have become worrying.\nI am not persuaded that, as is alleged, it is the language used by politicians themselves that has set the nation alight and corroded the public discourse. We have always enjoyed robust political language in our debates. Prime Minister’s question time has, for as long as I have been in Parliament, been a popular spectacle, in a way that proceedings in foreign assemblies rarely match.\nI note that those who complained loudest about the PM’s use of language last week, were themselves amongst the worst habitual offenders.\nArgument focussed on the term ‘surrender act’ as the PM’s chosen description of the European Union Number 2 Act 2019. The reason he calls it a surrender act is because it requires him to ask for a further extension of our EU membership and to accept whatever terms the EU demands in return for that extension. ‘Surrender’ is the best description, and the reason the opposition is so angry about the language is because they know how effective it is.\nThose who want to prevent BREXIT have spotted that Boris is the last obstacle standing in their way, so absolutely everything is to be thrown at him.

Given how critical I have hitherto been of the Withdrawal Agreement, it surprised colleagues and commentators,. My criticism has not abated, but my estimate of the alternatives courses has.\nTwo events in the Commons last week confirm my belief that we are in a REMAIN dominated Parliament.\nFirst, initiative was seized from the Government when -defying all precedent- an un-amendable motion was amended. I believe that changes to our procedures of this sort will now be driven forward granting the Commons legislative initiative -formerly exclusively in the hands of the Government- and that this is a clear danger to the Withdrawal Act which guarantees our departure from the EU on 30th March.\nSecond, the Government was soundly defeated in an amendment to the Finance Bill, which demonstrated that there is a clear and determined majority that will actively prevent a No-Deal exit from the EU.\nIt is clear therefore, that in the current Parliament a ‘No-Deal’ BREXIT as an alternative to the PM’s deal is no longer an option. The looming possibility of no BREXIT at all, has changed the facts on the ground. If the facts change, then I change. I have no doubt that the PM’s Withdrawal agreement, for all its faults, is preferable to NO BREXIT and to-night I voted accordingly.\nHansard Volume 652\nColumn 902\nEuropean Union (Withdrawal) Act\n14 January 2019\n9.00 PM\nSir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con)\nThe hundreds of constituents who have written to me demanding that I vote down this deal divide into two kinds: those who urge me to reject it so that we can leave the European Union without a deal—their preferred option—and those who urge me to reject it so that we can stay in the EU. They both cannot be right. There will have to be some management of expectations.\nI have made my own dislike of this deal plain, and it is based largely on the fact that we do not know what we will be getting. The political declaration might deliver anything from Canada-minus to Chequers-plus, and where in that spectrum we might land depends upon the negotiations that will follow. There will be no end to the uncertainty for some time.\nWe have delivered ourselves into the weakest possible position during those negotiations, first by making the financial settlement up front, and secondly by abandoning one of the most important principles to any negotiating position—the ability to walk away—because we have agreed that we will agree and that we will stay in a state of limbo until that agreement is reached. Such is the toxic nature of that limbo that I fear we would probably agree to anything in order to avoid getting there in the first place.\nI disagree passionately with my correspondents who say that this deal is worse than staying in the European Union. I have campaigned to leave since the referendum of 1975, and I am not prepared to see that opportunity lost. This deal is better than staying in the European Union. We will be out of the common fisheries policy, out of the common agricultural policy and out of the relentless momentum for political integration.

Furthermore, he was unable to comprehend my preference to switch to Andrea Leadsom were Gove to be eliminated in the next ballot (which he subsequently was), notwithstanding my acceptance of all of Theresa May’s merits and that she would be a formidable prime minister.\nI have read and listened to a great deal of ‘expert’ commentary and analysis explaining the ideological differences between the May and Leadsom camps, often going so far as to define them as two separate ‘tribes’. There may be a few tiny grains of truth in some of it, but – by and large – I believe that the commentators have added two and two, in order to try and make six.\nLike my friend and colleague in the library, they fail to take account of what I call the random caprice of human nature, and assume that choice is rational.

She has had a successful professional and political career. She has been our longest serving Home Secretary, in the department notorious for its difficulties. I have every confidence that, if elected, she will be a strong prime minister at a time when we certainly need one. I Know Theresa politically, but I do not know her personally, having never mixed in her circle and rarely met her socially.\nAndrea Leadsom, by contrast, has had a much shorter political career, and I have known as a politician for a correspondingly shorter period.

The Government backs small businesses, including responsible short-term holiday letting, which brings significant investment to local communities. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the impact that large numbers of holiday lets concentrated in an area can have on local communities.\nThe Government will abolish the Furnished Holiday Lettings tax regime. Importantly this will eliminate the tax advantage for landlords who let short-term furnished holiday properties over those who let residential properties to longer-term tenants. This does not stop people conducting short term lets, but rather ensures that the system is equal for those letting long term or short term. This will level the playing field between short-term and long-term lets and support people to live in their local area.\nDS",

The trial of Axel Ruhakana has prompted many more such demands.\nI have voted for the return of the death penalty on the three occasions that the opportunity has presented itself during my parliamentary career. Alas, I was always in the minority -and by a wide margin.\nWhen I first became a parliamentary candidate in the New Forest, I expressed my view robustly. I was challenged at a church hustings, as to how I could reconcile this support with my professed Christian faith. I answered by quoting article 37 of the 39 Articles (which form the doctrinal foundation of the Church of England): “The laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and grievous offences”.\nWhen my questioner responded with the sixth commandment “ Thou shalt not Kill” , I pointed out that the original biblical languages suggest “thou shalt do no murder” is a closer translation, and that is a clean different thing.\nThe latest polling by More in Common reports that overall, 55% support restoration with 37% opposed. This is a 5% increase in support and a 5% reduction in opposition, since their last poll in 2023. In the generational breakdown, there is majority support across the age ranges with millennials (28- to 43-year-olds) leading the way, 58% of them are in favour, to only 27% against. Generation X (18- to 26-year-olds) was closest with 45% in favour and 42% against, even here however, there has been a 16% increase in support since the last poll.\nWhatever the level of public support, the reality is that there is just no parliamentary majority for it.\nEven if we did restore it, a significant minority would remain viscerally opposed and every death sentence would be the focus of public protests. It might also be more difficult to secure convictions for capital offences -as jurors contemplate the finality of a guilty verdict. Whatever the argument, one way or another, it certainly won’t happen in this Parliament.\nThe public demand for justice might be assuaged however, were a life sentence to mean what is says. Which is why the inability to sentence Ruhakana to a whole-life term was so frustrating. It is an affront to justice to see criminals who have been imprisoned for the most horrible offences being released (even though this is very unlikely in Ruhakana’s case).\nWe devalue human life by our refusal to punish those who take it, with death.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_taxing-self-employed/content_433.html": "I have received half a dozen of emails from self-employed people complaining about the budget proposals to change the way that they are taxed.\nThe problem, as I see it, is not the policy itself, but David Cameron’s pledge when he said “as long as I am Prime Minister we will not put up national insurance contributions”. This became a manifesto pledge at the last election.\nTrying to get round this by saying this was only meant to apply to class 4 national insurance contributions looks distinctly shifty. It would have been much better, though still controversial, to have said that pledge was made by David Cameron and he is no longer in office, and that our dramatically changed situation demands that the policy be changed too.\nAs to the substance of the Chancellor’s policy, I believe it to be fair. Self-employment enjoys advantages over being an employee when it comes to tax, and because self-employment is growing fast we are losing £billions annually because of this more generous tax treatment.\nChanges in public policy, principally the fact that the self-employed will now have the same rights as employees to the state pension, have substantially removed the reasons for the more generous tax treatment of the self-employed. In fairness therefore, it follows that the tax treatment should be made more equal – which is what the Chancellor proposed.\nMy email correspondents complain that this is unfair because they don’t get entitlement to sick pay. True, but then their costs are lower because they are not paying employers’ national insurance contributions either.\nThey complain that they do not get maternity or paternity benefits, but I distinctly heard the Chancellor say that this would be changed to include them.\nThey complain that they do not get holiday pay. This is a complete red herring: tax and national insurance doesn’t cover holiday pay for any commercial enterprise. It is just part of the cost of labour that companies of any kind need to factor into their overall cost of doing business.\nWhilst I believe that the policy of more equal treatment is fair, the question arises as to whether it will discourage entrepreneurs and risk-takers from making a go of it in self-employment, which is vital for the prosperity and growth of our economy. I certainly believe that we need to develop a tax system that more generously rewards these entrepreneurs with a risk appetite. Our current difficulty however, is that there is no way of distinguishing them from any other service provider who has simply chosen to be self-employed for the tax advantage of doing so. Equally, and for the same reason, it suits many undertakings to avoid having employees and to pay them instead as contractors.\nI’m glad that the Prime Minister has delayed the legislation while we look at all these things in the round.\nAs for the present media storm, might its intensity have anything to do with the fact that so many of our broadcasters and journalists are being paid, not as employees, but as limited companies, or am I being just too cynical?",

He expressed his view that he did not believe that wider party membership should have a role in the choice of party leader. As chairman of the Conservative 1922 Committee – the principal ‘man in a grey suit’ , his voice carries weight.\nI agree with him. I was opposed to the reform from the moment when William Hague introduced it.\nInevitably MPs will be familiar with the candidates in a way that ordinary party members cannot possibly match. MPs will have seen them perform and they will know their strengths and weaknesses.\nA parliamentary ballot can be organised in hours, but involving the party membership adds weeks. Hustings and debates have to be organised in addition to the logistics of the postal ballot itself. This delay may paralyse effective government at a time when events demand swift and focussed leadership, which is exactly what happened in England in the Summer of 2022, and is now likely to follow in Scotland.\nPolitical parties in Parliament need to have confidence in their leadership if they are to function effectively in either government or opposition. The final choice of leader by a wider party membership however, raises the possibility of a leadership choice that a parliamentary party decidedly didn’t want.\nThis is precisely what befell the Parliamentary Labour Party after Ed Miliband’s resignation in 2015.\nLabour MPs voted very decisively against Jeremy Corbyn but their wider party membership chose him anyway, with all the unhappy consequences for them that followed.\nAnd for the Tories, Rishi led in every round of voting and ended with 137 votes in the fifth and final ballot, beating Liz Truss with 113 votes.

Patient satisfaction with the NHS is at a record high, with patients saying they have never been treated more safely and with more dignity and more respect. The number of complaints that I receive has diminished dramatically, and the number writing to commend the care that they have received has increased correspondingly. In the last couple of weeks two people close to me have received first class care: one walked into casualty with a broken foot, and the other was taken by ambulance in an emergency with a stroke.\nThere are now 11,000 more nurses and 11,000 more doctors working in the NHS. On cancer, we are starting treatment for 130 more people every single day, and have achieved record cancer survival rates; we have 1,400 more people getting mental health treatment every day and some of the highest dementia diagnosis rates in the world; we are doing 5,000 more operations every day and that, despite those 5,000 more operations every day, MRSA rates have halved.\nWe are spending more on the NHS than ever before, with plans to increase that expenditure year on year.\nThere are, of course, very significant problems for which we are going to have to find solutions.\nPeople who would ordinarily have died from a heart attack in their fifties or sixties, were saved by modern medicine over recent decades, and are now presenting in their eighties with multiple and complex nursing needs. Add to this mix the demands of a rapidly rising elderly population, and a deterioration in the health of many younger people consequent upon an obesity epidemic, and it is clear that pressure on the NHS will continue to build. Notwithstanding, that medical advances are continuing to deliver new, and expensive treatments.\nThe current furore has centred upon the 4 hour target within which to treat anyone who is admitted, or who walks into an hospital accident and emergency department. In recent weeks this measure has fallen from a percentage in the high nineties to the mid-eighties. The irony is however, that in terms of the raw numbers, more people are actually being treated within the target every day, because so many more are presenting – it’s winter again.",

It should have occurred to these doomsters that it is precisely because Britain is so much better than anywhere else, that migrants are making such herculean efforts to get here.\nThe truth is that the vote to leave the EU was a massive vote of confidence in this country, and that confidence has been justified:\nWhilst I accept that the EU has placed all sorts of bureaucratic costs in the way of our exporters, nevertheless, despite all the dire warnings, trade with EU is up almost 40%.\nAnd, free of the EU tariff regime, our trade with the rest of the world is up almost 60%.\nNo longer are we surrendering 75% of our customs revenue to the EU, Nor are we having to pay an annual membership net contribution of £13 billion, with the addition of all sorts of extra burdens like a contribution of 600 million euros to the EU Covid Recovery Fund.\nWe have become the world’s eighth largest manufacturer.

We have the third fastest growth in the G7 group of leading economies. We are more innovative than both our European neighbours France & Germany and our Asian allies Japan & South Korea.\nLondon has regained its pre-eminence as the global financial centre.\nThe UK now has more trade agreements than any other independent country on the planet. We have negotiated free trade agreements with 73 countries, from Mexico to Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand. We’re the first European nation to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership with the Indo-Pacific’s most dynamic economies, which will make up nearly a quarter of global GDP by 2050.\nWe are masters in our own house once again. We are now able to ban the cruel export of livestock for slaughter. We are have scrapped the dead hand of the Common Agricultural Policy, and instead incentivise biodiversity and stewardship.\nWe are able (if only we’d show more energy to get on with the job) to cut red tape and set the economy free.\nFar from losing our influence, as we were warned, we have taken a lead in the world with our response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to the situation in the Middle East.\nI make no pretence that there isn’t a heap of intractable problems that we need to fix, but just consider the public disquiet and political angst in Germany, or the blockade of Paris by French Farmers.\nLooking back isn’t the answer to any of our problems, neither is Labour’s ‘closer alignment with the EU’ -whatever sinister meaning that phrase may have.",

There are three possibilities.\nFirst, the Government wins its appeal in the Supreme Court and carries on to negotiate the terms of our exit.\nSecond, it loses, but it is judged that a resolution of both Houses is sufficient to authorise the Government to invoke article 50. I am confident that this could be delivered quickly – although it could be messy in the Lords. Voting against such a resolution would require an MP or peer to explicitly oppose the referendum result, which is a tall order and I estimate that few would be so foolhardy.\nThird, it is judged that such a resolution is insufficient, and that a full act of Parliament is required. This does really get us into dangerous territory. Opponents could cover themselves by supporting the bill at second reading, but then delay and derail the process by seeking to amend the bill during prolonged committee and report stages, by trying to tie the Government down to a specific negotiating strategy. Nick Clegg has already announced that the Liberal Democrat peers will do exactly that.\nIn such a scenario the obvious way out would be to dissolve Parliament and settle the contest in an election.

As I have pointed out in this column previously however, calling an election is no longer in the PM’s gift http://www.desmondswaynemp.com/ds-blog/begging-for-an-election/\nand would involve jumping through a complex set of hoops.\nClearly, the best way out is for the Government to win its appeal.

I said however, that we would have to await the election result to know which MPs were the turkeys. Well, with the Tories having lost seats, and Labour having gained them, we now know the answer.\nThe Prime Minister’s campaign lacked a strategic object: She set out her aim in Downing Street when she announced the election, saying that it was to secure a position that would enable her to negotiate our departure from the EU from strength. She then published a manifesto however, which failed to sustain that stated aim. It contained 85 pages, offering a range of inducements from free school breakfasts (for which the costs had not been accurately calculated), to a major change to the agreed government policy on funding social care, which was quickly dubbed the ‘dementia tax’. The PM then had to trash her own brand of ‘strong and stable government’ when she carried out a U turn from that manifesto policy.\nI was taught at Sandhurst that the first principle of war is the ‘selection of the aim’, and the second principle is the ‘maintenance of the aim’. Applying that to politics, the PM selected and set out her aim quite clearly in her Downing Street briefing at the outset. Her failure was in the maintenance of that aim: the disastrous manifesto distracted attention from her objective.\nThis was compounded when events intervened in the form of the terrorist outrages, and the PM was not particularly successful at articulating a defence of her policy and achievements on policing during her time as Home Secretary.\nIn addition to the failure to maintain the aim, the PM’s performances lacked charisma and authenticity. Altogether, it was a dreadful campaign. Yet, more people voted Conservative than have done so since 1992, and the PM secured the highest share of the vote since Mrs Thatcher in 1983.\nThe triumphalism of Labour needs to be tempered by the fact that, notwithstanding their gains, after 7 years of Conservative austerity and a shockingly bad Conservative election campaign, they are still some 60 seats behind the Conservatives: they didn’t even come close.",

I was against his forced resignation at a time when I considered him to be making a critical difference in international affairs. I did not think it wise to initiate a new leadership contest, with a completely unpredictable outcome at this time of international tension and domestic economic uncertainty.\nNevertheless, I was exasperated by what the tennis commentators call ‘unforced errors’, the last of which was the Pincher business. If only he had said at the very start how sorry he was that he given the fellow a second chance, but he had been let down when he got drunk and behaved so disgracefully at the Carlton Club. There would still have been a frightful row, but I don’t think it would have been terminal. (I should point out that it is my understanding that the historic incident that took place in the Foreign Office was not of the same order as the events in the Carleton Club. The Foreign Office complaint was subject to a formal Cabinet Office investigation which concluded that no disciplinary action should be taken. That certainly would not have been the outcome had the complaint been anything like what happened at the Carleton).\nBoris was a fantastic communicator and campaigner. We will certainly miss his charisma in what can often be a rather ‘grey’ political scene. His legacy will be the successful 2016 Brexit campaign that he led – LEAVE would not have won without him; He followed this with his decisive parliamentary and electoral intervention to break the deadlock in 2019 and finally ‘get Brexit done’.\nOver the last couple of years I’ve often been asked who I think should be the next Tory Prime Minister and I have responded by telling my questioners that they probably won’t recognise the names because I believe that our best talents are among the newer MPs who have not had sufficient public exposure. Anyway, the two names that I have given have been Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. Two highly effective ministers at the despatch box with a clear Conservative vision. Both, for some reason -probably fear, are singled out for particular attack from the opposition benches, but give as good as they get.\nI was somewhat surprised, but nevertheless delighted, when they both announced their candidatures.\nSuella was first off the block, so I immediately gave her my support.

Its whole ideology is based on the demand for Muslims to cut themselves off entirely from wicked infidels – with our democratic and ‘decadent’ liberal way of life. Those Muslims who fail to obey this demand are as deserving of death as any infidel.\nDaesh would be delighted if we rejected all Syrian refugees: the notion of generous western democracies giving sanctuary to Muslims, runs counter to their entire narrative.\nOverwhelmingly, Muslims are appalled by Daesh’s perversion of their religion into a fascist death cult. There is no escaping however, that the terrorists claim to be the only truly faithful Muslims. Destroying Daesh will require victory both in the use of force, and in the force of argument. It is vital therefore, that many more articulate Muslim scholars step up to the task of showing exactly how the terrorists have misinterpreted and perverted the true meaning of Islam.\nDaesh is an armed military occupation operating from the territory it controls, and from which it exports terrorism. Daesh’s territory straddles Syria and Iraq. It ignores the border between the two countries. Currently we are prepared to attack it in Iraq, but not in Syria where its principal strength is concentrated. This strikes me as absurd. If we are to crush the serpent, we have to crush it wherever it appears.\nAs to the question of admitting even more Syrian refugees than the 20,000 to which we have pledged, this takes too little account of our main effort, which has been to provide relief to the 4 million refugees in the countries surrounding Syria, where our money goes so much further. We are the second largest donor to this crisis, spending £1.2 billion – more than we have spent on any previous humanitarian relief effort. Those who – like the bishops and the judges – have plucked numbers from the air, in their demand that we accommodate more, have no idea of the complexity and difficulty of finding homes, livelihoods, and support for the 20,000 to whom we are already committed. I believe that we are maintaining the right balance between the needs of the millions of refugees in the region surrounding Syria, and accommodating the only most vulnerable cases here in Britain.",

First, because Scottish National Party MPs felt that the Parliament in Edinburg was being slighted by Whitehall. Second, because the debate about sex and gender has been particularly vicious from the outset. Individuals have been treated shamefully when they have expressed concern that the privacy, dignity and safety of women may be compromised when men present themselves as female and are given access to women-only facilities: The philosopher Professor Kathleen Stock was hounded out of the University of Sussex for saying so; The author J K Rowling has been denounced and ‘cancelled’ for agreeing with her; The Labour MP for Canterbury, Rosie Duffield, was heckled by her own side in the Commons last week when the supported the Government’s sensible course of action. These women have been brave. Many others have decided to keep their own counsel because of the vitriol poured out on the women who have broken cover.\nI predict that the temperature will rise further because the Government has now committed to bring forward its own legislation to outlaw conversion therapy. This has long been planned but was originally designed to restrict the measure to therapies that purported to convert gay people into heterosexuals. These therapies have a long and bizarre history, from testicle transplants, to lobotomies, exorcisms and hypnosis. My concern about any new law is first, that most of these egregious practices are now unlawful anyway and would constitute an assault. Second, because of the difficulty of defining a new law so it does not constrain freedom of speech.\nThe intention is now include transgender conversion therapy within the proposed ban. This adds a level of complexity to an already highly emotionally charged debate. When Boris Johnson was Prime Minister, he made it clear that his proposal would exclude transgender conversion therapies – he was right to do so, I wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole- but the current administration has reversed that decision.\nThe problem remains essentially the same: how to define the law so that it does not prevent freedom of speech. The difficulty is greater however, because there is much less of a consensus.\nYoung people, including children at school, who are confused about their gender may find themselves considering treatments which will interfere with puberty and have consequences that they may later bitterly regret. It is essential that they think this through and are sure about what they are contemplating. The problem will be to define a law which does not constrain the ability of parents, teachers, clinicians, friends, and why not clergy too, to have serious conversations with children about their decisions.\nStanding in the way of such discussions is deeply irresponsible.",

They are not Muslims, even if they claim that they are responding to wars waged against innocent people in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, or the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis, and the support given to tyrant rulers in the Middle East.\nAny Muslim who agrees with their Ideology or condones their evil practices, or sympathises with them in any form is regarded by God in the Quran and by the tradition of the prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, as an unbeliever. This means he is not a Muslim. A severe punishment awaits him in this life and in the Hereafter, as detailed in the Quran in verse 93 chapter 4 and verses 32-34, chapter 5.\nThose who carried out the heinous attack on innocent harmless victims in Paris on 13th November, are nothing but criminals who should be eliminated, and their organisation destroyed.

He is delivering the suspicion and the hatred that it craves: It is determined to present its grotesque violence as a war between the Muslim caliphate and Christendom. Trump has fallen right into the elephant trap that it dug for him. This tiny group of psychopaths believe themselves to be the only authentic expression of Islam. Trump has gone some way along the road to accepting their analysis and, in effect, presenting them with a badge of honour.\nThe same is true of all those constituents who have emailed me to demand an end to our programme of affording asylum to 20,000 vulnerable Syrians over the next five years. My correspondents believe that what happened in Paris makes it just too risky. Closing the programme -which we’ve only just started- would be another spectacular own-goal: Daesh would love it; the very idea of the ‘Christian’ west giving sanctuary to war-weary Muslims, runs utterly counter to their ideological narrative.\nIn any event, with 700 ‘home grown’ terrorists having left UK to fight for Daesh in Syria, the arrival of refugees, many of whom have fled Daesh’s terror, will itself be a powerful corrective to Daesh’s perverted version of events.\nDaesh massacres Muslims. So, just as I believe that Muslim fighters should take the lion’s share of the endeavour to defeat Daesh on the battlefield, equally I believe that Muslims must take the lead in exposing the falsehood of its perverted ideology. It is for this reason that I am delighted to have received a Christmas card from the Imam at the Woodford Muslim community centre, wishing me God’s peace, mercy and blessings. The card points out that over 1.5 billion Muslims believe in Jesus Christ and his second coming. On the reverse of the card is the following statement\n“Islam is a religion of peace, justice and tolerance. It rejects violence and condemns the killing of civilians anywhere in the world irrespective of their race or religion, even if Islam is insulted or ridiculed”\nNow, that is a much more effective antidote to Daesh and its poison.",

First, the Commons Health select Committee, after a thorough inquiry has produced a thoughtful and very balanced report on the question which can be found at\nAssisted Dying/Assisted Suicide (parliament.uk)\nSecond, because the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, has announced that he will let Parliament vote on the matter.\nBut Parliament does not need his consent or permission; Both Houses have mechanisms to secure a vote, when they want it.\nIn the Commons we last voted on it in September 2015, then we rejected the proposal to legalise it by 330 votes to 118.\nThat opportunity arose on a private member’s bill.

I’m certain that there is no Government enthusiasm for to giving up such time and effort to this complex problem, at an inevitable cost to its other legislative priorities.\nEqually, notwithstanding the apparent public support for changing the law, I suspect that most parliamentary colleagues, recognising the difficulties that such an enormous change would represent, and seeing the experience of those jurisdictions that have embraced it, themselves shrink from it.",

Overwhelmingly however, political differences arise from principled and\npractical differences between politicians, who –whilst they may share the same\nobjective, namely our national welfare, nevertheless disagree profoundly about\nhow it is to be achieved.\nConstituents demand that ‘heads be banged together’ so that parties work cooperatively in the national interest, but this is virtually impossible when there is little common ground about what course constitutes the national interest. It is of little use demanding unity among politicians when their disunity is mirrored among the voters that elected them.\nThat\ndemand however, does at least acknowledge that there could be a sensible way\nforward with a positive outcome.

Well, yes, it is all about political integration (and – I hate to rub it in – but you were warned), how anyone ever thought this was ever about free trade however, is just bizarre, because the reverse was always the case.\nThe EU, the EEC, the EC, the Common Market, or the ECSC – as it was originally called, is not, and never has been a free trade area. On the contrary, it is a club, a full customs union: imposing a common external tariff against its non-members. This means that when you join, you get free trade with the other members, but tariff and other barriers are erected to disadvantage your trade with non-members. This is exactly why, as a trading nation – and most of our trade being with the non-EU world – it never was in our economic interests to join it in the first place, and it remains in our economic interests to get out of it as fast as we can.\nWhen we leave however, we would not wish to see our trade with the EU disadvantaged. So, the main effort of our departure negotiations must be to secure it. I cannot predict how that will turn out, neither can ‘Vote Remain’, but their assumption that the terms will be a disaster is both implausible and wrong. The EU exports more to us than we do to it, clearly it will not want to ‘cut off its nose to spite its face’.\nWe are warned that Norway and Switzerland have had to pay handsomely for their access to the EU single marked, accept free movement of migrants, and abide by all the rules but have no influence over their making. This is all true. The UK is not however, a tiny economy with a very small population. We are the 5th largest economy in the world, and the ending of our EU membership on less than harmonious and mutually beneficial terms would present an existential threat to the survival of the EU itself. So, In am confident that we can drive a much better bargain.\nIn any event, I would not sacrifice the advantages of our escape, and free trade with the rest of the world, for access to the EU single market. In the worst case we could just trade according to the World Trade Organisation rules with an average 2.5 % tariff. The USA does so, and its trade with the EU is growing faster than ours.\nDon’t be bullied by Project Fear",

That this measure should have come as a surprise to anyone, is beyond my comprehension. It was a principal feature of the election campaign, from my own experience as a candidate, it was one of the most commonly discussed issues on the doorsteps – and the most popular.\nThe Government has been accused of putting the Union with Scotland at further risk by implementing the measure. On the contrary, the Scots already enjoy these powers, granting them to England will address one of the principal complaints that the English have about the Union.\nThe opposition of the Scottish Nationalists is all the more surprising given their stance in the last parliament: they took the principled view that English measures, on health and education for instance, where the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood determines these matters for Scotland, were none of their business, and they voluntarily abstained from voting on these questions. They have failed to explain why they have changed their minds in this Parliament.\nThis change of mind makes the measure necessary. Whilst Labour would never have agreed to a voluntary abstention when they dominated the Scottish parliamentary seats, now that they hold only one, their approach is of little consequence.\nI have used this column before to express my view that a voluntary arrangement would be preferable. This was, after all, the approach that the Ulster Unionists adopted, when the old Stormont parliament operated. I do not like the notion of different classes of MP, some of which may, or may not vote, on particular matters. I think it would have been preferable to voluntarily have adopted the convention that MPs representing Scottish seats simply abstain on purely English matters. The abandonment by the Nationalists of their previous stance however, makes a formal change in the Standing Orders of the Commons (the nearest thing we have to a written constitution) necessary.\nThe issue is not new. We have wrestled with it ever since it was first identified by Sir Tam Dalyell of the Binns during the original devolution debates of the mid nineteen seventies. It was characterised as the ‘West Lothian question’ because that was the parliamentary seat that he represented. In his principled opposition to the prospect of a Scottish assembly he pointed out the absurdity of allowing the member for West Lothian at Westminster to vote for measures that wouldn’t affect his own constituents, but only those of English constituencies.\nThis theoretical possibility became real during the years of the Blair Government when English Education and Health reforms – and also the Hunting Act – where the support of Labours MPs in Scotland turned out to be critical in securing majorities for the measures, which would not have passed had they had to rely only on the English seats which were to be affected.\nThis is an outrageous unfairness to English voters. It has been crying out to be addressed for years. The determination to do so now, after an election with a clear manifesto commitment, is a way of cementing the Union by removing a grievance felt by the English – which, after all, are the largest part of it.",

This is a matter that has been debated in Parliament several times over the last few years. By ‘assisted dying’ what is really meant is doctor assisted dying. In my estimate Government will be unwilling to invest legislative time in such a measure unless there is an overwhelming consensus within the medical profession in favour of it. Currently that is most certainly not the case. Though, I accept that it is the case amongst the public in general. Opinion polls typically report support for assisted dying as high as 75%. There is nothing new in this, the majorities have always been overwhelming ever since they first started asking the question. A response to an opinion poll however, does not constitute an argument. Equally, when pollsters ask a member of the public their opinion, they do not ask how often, or for how long the subject has occupied the respondent’s mind before reaching the declared opinion.\nI have debated the question several times in this column and in Parliament and earlier this year I debated it at the University of Durham. I was up against Baroness Meacher who had sponsored a Private Member’s bill in the Lords. She was assisted by a psychiatrist who was a member of the ‘My Life, My Death’ campaign. The Baroness was determined to focus on the narrow terms of her bill and the safeguards built into it (terminal diagnosis with only six months to live, sound mind consent verified by qualified physicians etc.), but she was thoroughly undermined by her assistant who wasn’t having any of it. As far as he was concerned, this was a service that should be available for anyone who wants it.\nOne of the most alarming aspects of assisted dying in those jurisdictions that have implemented it, is the way that the scope of the provision has so swiftly expanded from the original restricted circumstances that were originally specified. It does appear to be a very slippery slope indeed. One example will suffice. I was deeply troubled by the report in the Spectator of the recent euthanising of 23-year-old Shanti De Corte in the Netherlands. She was tired of having to take daily anti-depressants to deal with the PTSD she had suffered since when, at the age of sixteen, she was with a school trip caught up in a terrorist bomb that killed and maimed many, though she was not physically injured herself.\nIn Parliament the debate has always focussed on the dilemma facing people with degenerative conditions and their loved ones. I accept that these are hard cases (though there are many who, with the assistance of palliative care, die peacefully with dignity) but the greater danger in my estimate, is changing the law. My fear is that what would begin as a choice, would by degrees become an expectation. After all, with such reduced quality of life is it fair to go on consuming enormous clinical resources?\n“you wouldn’t want to become a burden, would you?”",

The scheme, which will eventually be open to every farmer in England, will support approaches to farming that deliver for the environment, such as actions to improve soil health, hedgerows and integrated pest management. I understand that the SFI will begin by offering two soils standards – an arable and horticultural soils standard and an improved grassland soils standard. Through signing up to these standards, farmers will be rewarded for management practices that improve soil health by improving soil structure, soil organic matter, and soil biology.\nFurther, I am encouraged that the Government’s landmark plans for a renewed agriculture sector will transform the way farmers are supported. The new system will be centred around incentivising sustainable farming practices alongside profitable food production. I welcome that at COP26, countries committed to transform agriculture and food systems. In addition, the UK led 45 governments in new pledges to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming. I am glad that the UK launched a £65m fund to help developing countries move towards more sustainable methods of agriculture and food production.\nFinally, I welcome that the Government’s new Environment Act includes measures to protect biodiversity, with a new, historic legally binding target to halt the decline in species abundance by 2030.\nDS.",

This has not been informed by experience: the benefit has not yet been implemented in the New Forest; rather, it is based on the hysterical ‘shroud waving’ of politicians and commentators.\nMany of my correspondents ask for implementation to be paused until problems are ironed out. This is unnecessary because we learnt from the experience of Working Tax Credit which was introduced as a ‘big bang’ in 2003 -with truly disastrous consequences. For this reason the roll-out of Universal Credit is deliberately very slow. It will not be complete until 2022 and currently only 10% of eligible claimants are on it. The process is designed to identify and remedy difficulties as the implementation proceeds.\nUniversal Credit replaces 6 benefits, each of which have their own problems and disadvantages. To compare Universal Credit with some previous ideal state is ridiculous. No benefit can be perfect and without anomaly. A benefit has to address the needs of the community as a whole, by encouraging claimants to seek work, and also be effective in the very diverse circumstances of individual claimants who have different attitudes and needs.\nUniversal Credit addresses many of the limitations of the ‘legacy’ benefits that it replaces.\nIt removes the discouragement to work more than 16 hours per week that is built into Jobseeker’s Allowance.\nIt removes the cruel choice between financial support and work which is a feature of Employment Support Allowance -when most claimants really need a bit of both.\nIt addresses the disadvantage of Working Tax Credit where, once claimants are in work, there is a disincentive to increase their working hours because they lose 70 pence of every additional £1 that they earn.\nThe results speak for themselves: Claimants on Universal Credit find work quicker and remain in work longer.\nThe principal complaint has been that there is six week wait and that people are left to go hungry and their rent arrears to build up. This is just not true: Claimants can get an advance that very same day if necessary.\nMost benefits have ‘waiting days’ before which the benefit does not start to accrue. This is to discourage very short term claims when people are between jobs. There were six waiting days for Universal Credit but the Chancellor has now abolished them in his budget last week.\nThere is a calendar month in which the evidence of the claimant’s circumstances is collected and the amount to which they are entitled is calculated. Then, there can be up to a further week for the payment to reach the claimant’s bank account.\nRemember, the purpose of the benefit is to prepare claimants for the world of work: and three quarters of workers are paid monthly in arrears. So, encouraging claimants to budget over a similar period is a good discipline.\nFor those claimants who need money right away, a same day interest free advance can be had. This was repayable over 6 months, but the Chancellor has now extended it to a full year.\nAs for the allegation that rent arrears are building up as a consequence of Universal Credit, actually the reverse is true: many claimants arrive with rent arrears and, after four months on Universal Credit, these have on average fallen by a third.\nNothing is ever as bad as reported.",

In other words, by 2035 the Government has an ambition that no new gas boilers will be sold.\nThere are several alternatives to gas boilers already in existence, including heat pumps. A heat pump is a very efficient electrically-driven device that extracts heat from the air or ground and concentrates it to a higher temperature and delivers it elsewhere, for example to a central heating system. Therefore it has the potential to replace fossil fuel heating, such as a gas or oil boilers. In the Prime Minister’s Ten Point Plan, the Government announced that it will increase the installation of electric heat pumps from 30,000 per year to 600,000 per year by 2028, supporting up to 20,000 jobs by 2030. A new £60 million Heat Pump Ready Scheme will help the Government meet this target by providing funding for pioneering heat pump technologies.\nAnother possible green alternative is a hydrogen boiler. The Government is working with industry to examine the potential role of hydrogen in heating homes and workplaces. It would work in a similar way to gas boilers today but without any carbon emissions. The UK is already a world leader in hydrogen and the Government is investing £500 million in new hydrogen technologies. Prior to consulting on the role of ‘hydrogen ready’ appliances, the Government will assess the case for encouraging, or requiring, new gas boilers to be readily convertible to hydrogen, so-called ‘hydrogen-ready’ boilers, in preparation for any future conversion of the gas network.\nThe Hy4Heat programme has also supported the development of prototype ‘hydrogen-ready’ boilers, cookers and fires. As a result, two ‘hydrogen homes’ have opened to the public in Gateshead to give people an opportunity to experience a zero-emission gas-fuelled home of the future. In addition, there is the opportunity to interact with green technologies inside the showrooms and demonstrate to customers that they can have a choice about how they heat their homes sustainably in the future.\nIn addition, the Hydrogen Strategy confirmed that, dependent on the success of the heating trials and the information gathered, the Government aims to make a strategic decision on the future of hydrogen for heat in 2026. Ahead of this, and to help inform the decision, the Government will launch a trial ‘Hydrogen Village’.\nDS",

Our voting system ensures that, to have any chance of success, a party must have a broad base of support. Proportional voting systems on the continent however, enable their parties to maintain much narrower ideological purity and still secure representation. The consequence is that multiple parties have to forge a coalition after an election and negotiate a programme for government that was never put to the voters. The virtue of the UK system is that we make our coalitions before any election, in that each political party is itself a coalition which puts its manifesto to the judgement of the voters. Inevitably, our ‘broad church’ polity means that, though united on most issues, our political parties will have significant disagreement on others.\nSo, back to tobacco.\nI don’t doubt that had we known the dangers of tobacco when Sir Walter Raleigh first introduced it to England in 1582 it might well have been banned, but it’s too late now.\nThe experience in USA of the Prohibition era from 1920 to 1933, where attempting to ban a widely consumed product, in that case alcohol, gave rise to a crime wave, violent gangsterism and widespread flouting of the law, is a warning of how this might play out.\nIt is one thing to demand that youngsters prove their age, but as the age threshold rises year by year, are we really going to ask the retailer to distinguish between one old man who is entitled to purchase a packet of cigarettes, and another old man, albeit one year younger, who isn’t?\nAre we really going to make sure that someone, now aged fourteen, is prohibited thought-out his life from enjoying the luxury of a cigar on New Year’s Eve?\nIs this really the business of government?\nAside from rescuing us from ourselves, the principal argument for prohibition is the scale of cost that falls upon the NHS through treatments for smoking-related disease.\nI accept that there is a logic to this. We have developed a system of socialised medicine where we share the cost of any individual ill-health among all tax-payers. It follows that anyone who recklessly endangers their health is a burden upon all the rest of us. Does it follow therefore, that we have the right to prevent them?\nIt may be logical, but it is the thin end of a very thick wedge.

My opponents -arguing that they would prevent our departure- were Lord Butler, a former cabinet secretary, and Lord Lester, one of our most senior lawyers.\nEven just a fortnight ago, when the Lords were debating an aspect of the Brexit negotiations, Lord Kerr (who actually drafted the Article 50 clause in the Lisbon Treaty, and was so keen to remind us recently that we can still change our minds) spoke of the UK having to ‘come to heel’.

The ‘project fear’ of the referendum campaign is undiminished.\nThird, by these first two means, and any parliamentary tactic, to seek to reverse our course and remain within the EU.\nThe battle will initially focus on undermining and reversing the Prime Minister’s policy of leaving the EU Customs Union and Internal Market. She saw these as essential in honouring the referendum decision.\nRemaining in the internal market would require retaining freedom of movement by all EU citizens to the UK; continued payments to the EU in perpetuity; and being subject to jurisdiction of the European Court.\nEqually, retaining membership of the EU Customs Union means that our trade policy remains in the hands of Brussels, where priorities and preoccupations differ very significantly from our own. We would not resume our independent leadership in the World Trade Organisation, and our consumers would forgo the lower prices and greater prosperity that leaving the EU properly might have delivered.\nWhilst the battle will rage about these two issues, the real objective is to just use them to bring about a prolonged delay, to bore and demoralise the British people, and ultimately to defeat them.\nIf you find all this profoundly depressing, then as an antidote I recommend going to the Cinema to see Darkest Hour.\nIt is magnificent.\nI still wake every morning and my first thought is “we are going to be free!”",

Ministers are committed to building on our strong track record on animal welfare.\nIn the King’s Speech, the Government announced the Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Bill, which will ban the export of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses for slaughter and fattening from Great Britain, stopping unnecessary stress, exhaustion and injury caused by exporting live animals. This Bill will ensure that animals are slaughtered domestically in high welfare slaughterhouses in the UK, reinforcing the UK’s position as a world leader on animal welfare.\nRegarding puppy smuggling, the UK has one of the most rigorous pet travel border checking regimes in the world and every dog travelling into Great Britain on approved routes has its microchip and paperwork checked to make sure they are all properly vaccinated and are old enough to travel. The Government has said that it will ban the imports of young, heavily pregnant or mutilated dogs and it would be supportive of legislating to ban this through a single-issue Bill when parliamentary time allows.\nFurther, mindful of the challenges the sectors are facing, Ministers do not consider the time is right to consult on cage reforms. However, the market is already driving the move away from using cages for laying hen production. In addition, the Government’s animal welfare priorities for its Animal Health and Welfare Pathway include supporting producers to transition away from confinement systems.\nOn food labelling for animal welfare, Ministers want to make it easier for consumers to purchase food that aligns with their values, by improving transparency and providing the industry with a level playing field to promote such products. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) intends to work with the industry to explore how to harness the market to improve food information for consumers and raise animal welfare standards.\nIn 2021, Defra carried out a call for evidence on the fur trade in Great Britain.

The Lords have already amended the Withdrawal Bill to require the UK to remain within the customs union.\nWill the Commons follow their lead?\nOf course, to do so would be extraordinary given that 80% of us voted less than a year ago for political parties committed explicitly to leave the customs union (whatever they have decided subsequently).\nDesire to stay is bizarre: it would require us to hand over the conduct of our trade policy to EU officials without any influence over their decision making, their priorities, or any ability to hold them to account for their conduct of it.\nAny trade deals negotiated between the EU and other third countries would require us to open our markets on the terms negotiated but without reciprocal concessions for us.\nIt is the daftest of policies. Why on earth would anyone contemplate it?\nThe answer is simple: it is at least one way of scuppering BREXIT.\nThe customs union is the essential core of the EU. It was there from the foundation and long predates the internal market. If you like, think of it as the walls of Mordor, it protects the fortress from trade from the rest of the world with a common external tariff. Or think of it as the “one ring to rule them all…and in the darkness bind them” as It holds the EU together in one mercantilist relationship against free trade with the world.\nRemaining within it would be a betrayal of ‘taking back control’ and all that we voted for in the referendum, but there is no arguing with its adherents. It is the nearest thing to a religious belief. To accept the will of the people would, for them, be like denying the existence of their god.\nDo not despair, the battle is not lost yet, but it will be very tight indeed.\nIf we were to lose it however, who would be to blame?\nDon’t blame the Lords, they have no power if overawed by the Commons.\nSo blame the Commons, but remember that it was the voters who determined its current composition less than a year ago.\nIf we did lose that vote, whatever advisers in in Number 10 may do, or however few ministers resign, I will certainly be one of those shedding tears into my beer.",

We rarely apply such a restriction to anyone else in society, so I’m not yet persuaded that it should apply to MPs. The argument for making such an exclusive arrangement for MPs would not necessarily be that they won’t give enough time an attention to their ‘proper job’ because that might apply to anyone with a second job. Rather, a more persuasive reason for excluding MPs from the possibility of ‘moonlighting’ would be that their other remunerated interests might unduly influence them when legislating. The way to deal with this possibility is to require full disclosure and to outlaw advocacy and lobbying. This is exactly what the current rules do. Of course, there will always be scope for some tightening up, but as we’ve seen recently, the penalty for breaking the existing rules can be devastating.\nA hundred or so MPs are on the Government payroll: In addition to their duties as MPs they have very demanding jobs as ministers -for which they are quite properly paid. In my opinion they are not paid nearly enough for the hours that they work and the responsibilities that they carry. It seems to me absurd that we pay the Prime Minister only £79,000 (in addition to the £82,000 we pay him for being an MP) which compares very unfavourably with senior roles in industry and the public services.\nGiven that we accept that MPs can have second jobs as ministers, it would be rather unfair to exclude the possibility of additional earning for extra responsibilities for MPs who are not ministers. That is why we don’t. On the contrary, MPs who are selected to chair legislative standing committees, select committees, or the Commons itself as Speaker and deputy speakers are paid for it.\nIf we accept that MPs, in addition to their responsibility to represent their constituents, have time to carry out these functions and be paid for them. Why should they not also do so by carrying on -in moderation- their former professions as nurses, doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, or whatever?\nIn Parliament we have all of the above, and we are better off for it. We are better informed by having professionals who are still up to date in their fields with their finger on the pulse with what is happening in industry, business and the NHS.\nI think it would be a great shame if we were to become a class of professional politicians increasingly detached from the experience and expertise of life outside Parliament.\nAs for independence of mind, as a whip, I always found it much more difficult to lean on MPs for whom their political career was not the ‘be-all and end-all’ and who had other professional interests to fall back on.\nIt seems to me that the greater danger is not that we are too open to undue influence, but rather that we would excluding from our deliberations people of great knowledge and ability, who might command significantly greater remuneration elsewhere. In short, the danger is mediocrity.\nOf course the solution to that one, would be to pay MPs so much more. My political antenna tell me that this would be deeply unpopular.

It was carried out two reigns previously, over 3000 years ago, when the Prophet Samuel anointed Saul as Israel’s first King, then subsequently, when Saul proved something of a dud, Samuel sought out the youngest son of Jesse, and anointed David, as King instead.\nThough instrumental, Samuel was a somewhat reluctant participant. He didn’t rate the prospects of monarchy and he warned the people of Israel that, by demanding a King like other nations, they were making a rod for their own back, with taxes and other oppressive impositions. His greatest fear was that kings would wander from proper devotion to the one true God. His fears were not misplaced. To put it mildly Israel’s experience of monarchy might be, at best, described as ‘mixed’.\nA fellow from the Plymouth Brethren used to come campaigning with me at elections. He was happy to deliver leaflets and canvass voters, but he wouldn’t vote himself. When I challenged him about this, he told me it was because he believed in the principle of Biblical Monarchy.\nWell, good luck with that! As we went through the reigns described in the Bible there was perhaps only one paragon, Josiah 640 -609 BC (to whom our own Edward VI was compared by contemporaries as ‘the new Josiah’ in 1547). Many of the others were pretty dreadful.\nOf course, our own experience of monarchy has also been mixed. We’ve had both saints and monsters. Nevertheless, we had a very unsuccessful, and not to be repeated experiment of doing without a monarch from 1649 to 1660.\nUndoubtedly, what has saved our monarchy was the wisdom of separating the institution from political power so that it could become what it is to-day: the focus of unity, majesty and awe.\nThe thought of replacing our Head of State with an elected politician is just grotesque. Think about it! Which one of us would you vote to have instead?",

Which rather re-enforces my prejudice that neither side is ready for the level of compromise required to reach a peaceful settlement.\nIt strikes me that there are four possible scenarios:\nFirst, a continuation of the status quo with occupied territories, the absence of a Palestinian state, together with the consequential economic disadvantages, intermittent terrorist outrages, intifadas and bouts of open warfare.\nSecond, The rather unlikely triumph of Israel’s sworn enemies, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, resulting in genocide and the complete replacement of Israel by ‘Palestine’.\nThird, the equally unlikely possibility of a single secular state embracing both Palestinians and Israelis, as well as the Arab Israelis.\nOr fourth, a two state solution, which is the objective of UK, European, and US policy, with Palestine and Israel both enjoying full statehood and living side by side.\nThese last two possibilities would require historic concessions of enormous magnitude on both sides.

It wasn’t until ten years later, when George Osborne became Chancellor in the coalition government, that a £1.5 billion compensation scheme was implemented. (It also took a decade for the company’s auditors to be fined for failing to warn the policyholders).\nOsborne’s scheme dealt differently with each of the categories of savers. For the vast bulk of policyholders however, their settlement amounted to less than a quarter of what they had lost.\nAs far as the Government was concerned that was the end of the matter. For the campaign on behalf of the policyholders and their 240 supporters in Parliament, that was never going to be the case.\nI came late to this group. My prejudice was that first, the policyholders were relatively sophisticated savers and should have had more ‘nouse’ to spot that their returns were too good to be true. Second, that compensation would be paid by all taxpayers, many of whom would never have been able to afford to put aside the premiums which they would now be paying to compensate.\nA number of constituents badgered me until I made sufficient effort to investigate and discover how wrong I had been: overwhelmingly Equitable Life’s clients were of very modest means with small savings. Second, an impression was given within the public sector in particular, that Equitable Life schemes were somehow government approved.\nI read the two reports by the Ombudsman into the scandal which are quite shocking and reveal the level of regulatory failure, and the fact that the Treasury was aware of it. Consequently, I came to the view that this fact alone makes the Government culpable and liable to pay full compensation.\nThe second report by the Ombudsman required that the settlement be fair to the policyholders, but also fair to the taxpayer in terms of what could be afforded.\nIt was against the background of the frightful state of the public finances inherited by George Osborne after the financial crash that he designed his compensation scheme.\nThe situation with respect to the public finances has since changed dramatically, and that is why MPs and campaigners are demanding that the settlement be reopened and a more generous provision be made. Ministers however, insist that the 2010 settlement was final.\nThe matter now falls within the brief of the new Treasury minister, John Glen MP for Salisbury, who came to our meeting to listen to the case we made last week.\nHe made no promises, but I hope he was impressed by the number of newly elected MPs who have joined the group: clearly, the issue is not going to go away anytime soon.\nLack of savings provision for pensions is a major problem that we face for the future. There is hardly an incentive for younger people to make that sensible provision when they see the shabby treatment meted out to pension savers of a previous generation, for what was a clear failure by government.\nThis campaign will run, and run.",

Without a significant majority, which is what she sought when she called the election, there was little chance of getting the clean BREXIT that she set out in her Lancaster House and Florence speeches and in her election manifesto.\nYet the PM continued to raise our expectations by using the same rhetoric about leaving on 29th March and ‘no deal’ being better than a ‘bad deal’, despite the reality of the parliamentary arithmetic.\nEncouraged by this perceived guarantee the majority of my correspondents continue to demand that we leave without a deal. Parliament demonstrated its unwillingness to allow a no-deal Brexit in three votes earlier this year and now it has changed the law to prevent it.\nAccordingly, the only chance of a no-deal BREXIT now, is if one of the 27 EU member states refuses the application for a further extension of our membership which the law now requires the Government to make.\nWeeks ago, when the Government still had freedom of action, I did urge the PM to consider proroguing this REMAIN Parliament to prevent it stopping her from leaving the EU. It is now too late to close that stable door.\nTo be honest I didn’t expect my advice to be taken. It is very difficult in a parliamentary democracy, to just prorogue parliament and govern without it, it is after all exactly what King Charles the First did, and it didn’t end well.\nUnable to get a majority for her ‘high risk’ agreement (I voted for it despite that risk, because I thought the risk of not leaving the EU at all was even greater), the PM has now reached out to find common ground with the Leader of The Opposition, to my dismay and that of my colleagues.\nLabour brings two demands to the table.\nFirst they want a ‘confirmatory referendum’ which is just a euphemism for overturning the result of the last one. Anyone who believes that another referendum is a way of healing the division within our nation, was clearly on another planet during the last one.\nThe second demand is that we agree a permanent customs union (which is the essential core of the EU) and means that our trade policy will be governed by the EU. Mr Corbyn believes that new inclusive arrangements can be negotiated to give us a say, this is nonsense: the EU treaties specifically exclude any such possibility.\nThe problem with a customs union is that it is all give and no take. We would literally be traded: The EU would be at liberty to make trade agreements with third countries where access to our market was part of the deal, but with no reciprocal access for us to that of the third country. We would subsequently need to try and negotiate that access bilaterally with the third country, but what could we offer, and why would they negotiate? -already having free access to the UK market.\n‘Vassal state’ hardly does justice to such a status. We would have forfeited the principal economic benefit of BREXIT.\nCould I vote for such a shadow of BREXIT?\nOnly, if it is a question of that, or no BREXIT at all.\nIf we remain in the EU the ratchet of ever greater political and economic integration will continue relentlessly as it always has done since we first joined.\nIf we leave however, the ratchet will work in the opposite direction: Political independence and a measure of economic freedom will be intoxicatingly liberating, and will inexorably lead to demands for more.\nEqually, without Mrs Thatcher’s rebate, with a requirement to join the Euro, to handover our waters once again, and re-join the Common Agricultural Policy, there would be no prospect of tempting us back.\nI am deeply distressed that we haven’t left already and that we face another prolonged extension with tortuous and deeply unsatisfactory negotiations.\nBREXIT will be a long haul, a process rather than an event, but the alternative is much, much worse.",

The reality is that tertiary education is one of our major export industries which is worth about £20 billion to the UK economy. It also allows own students to study at university at substantially lower fees, in effect subsidised by foreign students.\nThose foreign students return to their native countries with a British education and goodwill towards us, which will have a beneficial impact on developments, commercial and diplomatic, for years ahead.\nIt is right however, that we have clamped down on short and ‘low value’ courses which attract migrants who really aren’t interested in study but just want to find a way of getting into Britain.\nWe need however, to cut the 150,000 dependants that postgraduate students have been bringing with them. So, beginning with courses starting in January, students on taught postgraduate courses will no longer have the ability to bring dependants; only students on designated postgraduate research programmes will have that entitlement.\nAll this begs the question of why we include students, here temporarily, in our migration statistics at all, when most other jurisdictions don’t. The answer is simple: we always have; So, any government that chose to exclude them would be accused of ‘fiddling the figures’.\nWhich leaves us with the other half of the net migration figure: those on work visas.\nAs I’ve said before in this column, there isn’t an enterprise that I have visited that isn’t having difficulty recruiting staff. We have a million vacancies, yet 21% of our working age population, nearly 9 million people (including 3 million ‘on the sick’) are economically inactive.\nLittle wonder then, that businesses and public services sponsor so many visas for overseas workers, making a mockery of the ’points-based immigration system’ which was modelled on Australia’s.\nThe argument is made that -were we to abolish the list of critically short occupations allowable and to raise the salary threshold, the consequent fall in the number qualifying migrants would fuel inflation and cause some sectors to grind to a halt.\nI am sceptical. The counter argument is that, whilst migration is generating greater national income, the income per head of population is not growing in proportion. Genuine economic welfare may actually be falling as a result of the pressures on housing and public services arising from the growing migrant populations.\nFurthermore, despite the numbers arriving, the shortages persist: 70,000 people were recruited from abroad for care roles in the year to June, while the number of vacancies in the sector dropped by only 11,000.\nForeign workers cost employers 20% less than UK employees: this incentive to recruit from abroad should certainly be removed.\nBut the strain on our society, economic an social, of immigration well beyond what we can safely absorb, will not be assuaged until we can curb our appetite for foreign labour and address economic inactivity amongst our own working age population.",

I had the rare privilege of being her Vice Chamberlain from 2012 to 2014.\nThe VC has four duties: To give the Queen a daily written account of the highlights of proceedings in the Commons -taking care to make it interesting; To accompany the Queen at her Summer garden parties; To be held hostage at Buckingham Palace against the safe return of the Queen when she is in Parliament (a reminder of times when the relations between the Crown and Parliament were not so cordial), I found the terms of my confinement very agreeable, quickly acquiring Stockholm syndrome; Finally, to carry humble addresses from the Commons to the Queen and to return her responses to the Commons.\nThis is a formal process. Immediately after prayers Mr Speaker announces the VC, who -in morning dress and carrying the wand of office- advances from the Bar of the House to the Table bowing twice. Having read the Queen’s message, bows twice more whilst walking backwards to the Bar, which feat is accompanied by roars of approval from colleagues.\nWhen I presented my first humble address to the Queen at Buckingham Palace I was briefed beforehand by a courtier about the proper etiquette, he told me that on no account was I to observe the ‘former custom’ of walking backwards so as not to turn my back on the Sovereign. During these audiences you are entirely alone with the Queen without anyone else present to prompt. After I had formally delivered the address we had a more relaxed discussion, the Queen then asked me in a rather mischievous way if I was about to walk backwards. I replied that I had been ordered not to, would she like me to?\nShe chuckled, saying it that she didn’t mind at all either way and that it was entirely a matter of personal preference. So, I did walk backwards.\nThe VC’s wand is not the sort that a wizard might wield. It looks more like a billiard cue. In former times the Monarch would snap it in two to signify the end of the appointment. In deference to modern sensibilities, they’ve now put a hinge in the middle. One used to be able to hold onto the wand as a keepsake but these days the Government Whips Office charges £1000 for it, so I opted for a scroll instead.\nWhen the Queen presented the scroll she said that it had looked rather dull so she had made it more presentable by tying a red ribbon round it. She didn’t say that she had caused a ribbon to be tied, she said that she had tied a ribbon and I don’t doubt it.",

Parents are now badgered by their children to get them one at an ever-younger ages.

According to the regulator Ofcom ‘many children are spending six and even eight hours a day on social media – sometimes even more’, instead of playing and interacting in the real world with friends. Little wonder then, that teachers say that children find it increasingly difficult to concentrate, that they are often anxious, and that so many are lacking in self-esteem.\nCertainly, the Online safety Act is a good start with its very large fines for the media giants when they break the law.\nAlso, The Department for Education has published new guidance which backs head teachers in banning mobile phone use throughout the school day, including at break times, to tackle disruptive behaviour and online bullying.\nThe new guidance says that schools should prohibit the use of mobile phones, but they will have a free hand on how to do this. Schools will be supported to prohibit mobile phone use with examples of different approaches including banning phones from the school premises, handing in phones on arrival at school, and keeping phones securely locked away at school.\nFrankly, the smartphone has abolished normal childhood and polls say that 60% of parents want them banned for under-sixteens.

Casework is processed primarily under the lawful basis of public task, with exceptional cases processed under the lawful basis of consent.\nii. Personal data contained in the non-political Sir Desmond Swayne’s MP Mailing List is processed under the lawful basis of public task. It does not fall within the definition of direct marketing.\niii. We undertake to always act within the reasonable expectations of our constituents and any other individuals about whom we hold personal data.\n3. Data we hold\nWe operate a paperless office. Personal data is stored electronically and securely on our computer systems.

Plainly, there is, and we should evaluate it before we write it off as being less effective than the existing strategy which, after all, does not appear to be working well at all.\nThe Government restated its strategy this week with absolute clarity: to suppress the disease through local and national restrictions on liberty and the economy until such time as a vaccine is developed.\nHere is the difficulty: first, there are areas of the country that have now been in restrictive local lock-down for many weeks and infection rates, far from decreasing as a result of the measures have, on the contrary, increased sharply -in some areas as much as tenfold.\nSecond, vaccines may take a very long time to develop, there is no guarantee that one will prove effective, or it may prove only partially effective and take a further prolonged period to be sufficiently available to have an impact. After all, We possess anti-flu vaccines but it still kills 20,000 of us annually ( and incidentally it is currently killing a lot more of us than Covid-19).\nThe Government’s strategy requires that lock-down restrictions with increasing severity, with all their disastrous economic, social and health consequences be repeatedly imposed and re-imposed with every local outbreak indefinitely until an effective vaccine developed.\nThe unease with this prospect of indefinite misery is growing. Very significantly family doctors are now demanding to be represented on the body of scientists advising the Government. They point out that currently the scientists are too focussed on the disease and the measures to combat it, without weighing up the damage that those measures are doing to the health and mental health of the nation and which the family doctors are seeing daily.\nThe alternative strategy can be summarised thus: Concentrate resources on isolating the infected, and on protecting people who are particularly vulnerable. The rest of us should be allowed to get back to normal social and economic life, judging and managing for ourselves the risk we are prepared to take, and through social interaction over time, acquire a measure of ‘herd immunity’.\nThis must include the NHS getting back to normal too, where Covid-19 measures have vastly reduced its capacity to treat other conditions.\nThe basis of this strategy is that we may have to live with Covid-19 for a long time, even forever, so we need to adapt to living normally with it; best we get on with it without wasting more time, as we it appears now that we wasted the summer, and consequently have made the coming winter worse.",

My attitude to the European Union has not altered a great deal over the years – as regular readers of this column will be aware. I do believe however, that David Cameron has earned the right to be trusted in re-negotiating our EU membership. As Leader of the Opposition he withdrew his members of the European Parliament from the federalist European Peoples’ Party and instead created a new Eurosceptic block. When he got into government he became the first Prime Minister ever to repatriate powers from the EU: First by withdrawing UK from the Euro bail-out mechanism that the previous government had signed-up to; and second, by leaving scores of Justice and Home Affairs arrangements that we had previously opted into. He is the only UK prime minister ever to veto an EU treaty, and the only one ever to secure a cut in the EU budget. He enacted the Referendums Act which requires a referendum every time that powers are ceded to the EU, and now he is implementing his election promise to re-negotiate the terms of our EU membership and delivering the In / out referendum, that his opponents said would never happen.\nGiven this record, I believe that I owe it to the Prime Minister to wait and see what his negotiations achieve, before coming to a decision about how to campaign and vote in the referendum. Many constituents however, have already made up their minds and write to tell me as much. Overwhelmingly my correspondents are in favour of leaving, but this week I had my first letter from an outraged EU enthusiast. His beef was that the PM’s investment in trying to negotiate us out of the aspiration to ‘ever closer union’ was the height of gesture politics, and is of no substance whatsoever. I disagree profoundly. The objective of ever closer union, which is central to the Treaty of Rome – the initial founding treaty, informs the judgement of the European Court of Justice that determines the interpretation of EU law and all of our disputes with it. Dispensing with a UK commitment to ever closer union would be a very significant departure. It would mean that, whatever speed the rest may choose to go at, we would no longer have join them at their destination, or even go in their direction.",

First, the speculation may have been misinformed. Second, the anticipated candidate might not have secured the required ten signatures from colleagues necessary for a valid nomination. It is always preferable to get the nomination sewn up first, then to announce your candidature, rather than to announce first, only to have to subsequently and ignominiously withdraw, having failed to get sufficient endorsements. Third, the potential candidate may have thought better of it and changed their mind.\nI think this is my 9th Conservative Party leadership contest in 28 years a member of the parliamentary party. In only one of them have I backed the winner from the outset of the official contest.\nOn this occasion I have signed the nomination of Mel Stride. I accept that there are other candidates with great strengths under whom I would be pleased to give support from the backbenches. (I have no desire to return to the frontbench having spent 11 years there in opposition and 6 years there in government.) Nevertheless, I regard Mel as the most experienced candidate because he has been a Treasury minister, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and -In my estimate most important of all, and unlike any of the other candidates – he has been a whip. I regard experience of the whip’s office, the nuts and bolts of managing the ‘wolf pack’ that is the parliamentary party, as being extremely important, particularly in opposition where you have no ‘payroll’ on which to rely or other preferment that you can offer.\nHave some sympathy however, for whomsoever wins this contest.\nI served two Leaders of the Opposition as parliamentary private secretary over six years. Leading the Opposition is the worst job in politics imaginable, particularly when a new government has been elected with a large majority. That government has all the initiative and all the interest of the media and ‘commentariat’ is focussed upon it. Nobody takes much notice of what the Leader of the Opposition has to say, unless it turns out to be something stupid, in which case they will make a meal of it.\nThere is little money to afford heavyweight support. And it is always much harder to ask the questions at the weekly match with the Prime Minister than it is for the PM to answer them: The expectation is that you must address the big issues of the week, otherwise it will be thought that you are ducking them, and on those questions the PM will have been briefed to the eyeballs with the full resources of government.\nYou will have your own record in government traduced and thrown back at you, and you will be humiliated when some daft comment by one of your colleagues is quoted back to you.\nI wish Mel the best of British…but whichever candidate wins, I hope they know what they are letting themselves in for.",

This is not the visit of an individual and does not express any support for the individual’s policies. It is an expression of the importance of the relationship between our two states. This is why comparisons with other US presidents who made their state visits to the UK much later in their presidencies are so wide of the mark. The situation then was radically different.\nWe are about to begin negotiations to leave the EU and profoundly change our place in the world. We have a significant agenda to cement with the nation that is our largest individual trading partner and our most important strategic ally. At the same time, its new president had signalled radical departures in respect of policy towards free trade and enduring alliances.\nWhatever our reservations, it is both vital and urgent that we exercise the greatest influence that we can in our national interests. The state visit is an important part of that process.",

A mistake common to most of them is that they treat their contributions as if they were savings that had been paid into a retirement fund – on which they are entitled to draw when fully paid-up, and that any reform constitutes a change in the terms and conditions upon which they made their contributions in good faith.\nThe system just doesn’t work like this, and most people should be very glad that it doesn’t. For the overwhelming majority of us, had our national insurance contributions been paid into a savings fund, they would never have generated anything like the level of income in retirement that the state pension now affords. So, for most of us, it’s a bargain.\nOur contributions, are in fact just taxes. They qualify us to receive a pension but they don’t pay for it. They just go into the total available to pay for all government expenditure, including, of course, the current pensions bill. So, in a sense, our national insurance contributions are paying the pensions of those who are already retired, in the expectation that the national insurance contributions of younger earners will pay for our pensions when we retire.\nThis leads to the critical need for reform: as we live longer and are retired for so much longer, the proportion of those of working age is shrinking relative to that of those in retirement. If the bill for pensions is to remain affordable for the working age people who are having to pay it, then we need to reduce that bill by either cutting the pension or by delaying the retirement of those who receive. Delaying the pension is much the more sensible course.\nUnder the Pensions Act 2011 the pension age for men and women accelerates to reach 66 by 2020. One of the current campaigns argues that this disproportionately affects women in their mid-fifties (born after 5th April 1951) and that for them the change should be reversed. I recognise the complaint of those who now find that they have to retire later (my wife is one of them), but the line has to be drawn somewhere – to the frustration of those just the other side of it. The campaigners need to explain why these particular women should be protected from a rise in State Pension age, when women just days younger – and men of all ages- will wait longer for their state pension.",

I doubt however, that there would have been displays of public grief and affection in the way that we have seen in the last few days. Would crowds of well-wishers have flooded to the presidential palace and to the presidential country retreats?\nWould there have been such ceremony, even in the midst of the mourning, to mark the inauguration of a president’s replacement? I was out very late on Thursday night walking along the Mall and watching the crowds thronging towards Buckingham Palace, some with flowers, others just to stand, wait, and reflect. On Saturday morning I walked up the Mall again, this time on my way to take part the Accession Council at St James’s Palace as a member of the Privy Council. The crowds were out in even greater force to witness the Proclamation of our new King with a great shout of ‘God Save The King’ followed by a rousing three cheers. Unlike relatively short presidential terms, a monarch provides something of a backdrop for a lifetime, providing a constant presence and reassurance. We may imagine that we have been almost familiar with our monarchs simply because it seemed that they were always there, an ever constant presence.I was Vice Chamberlain to our late Queen from 2012 to 2014. I cannot claim to have known her better than any other of her subjects, but one of the rare privileges had by the Vice Chamberlain is private audiences with the Monarch when a humble address is sent by the Commons to the Sovereign. These take place following every State Opening of Parliament, they mark important events like royal marriages and births, but they are also used for more mundane business, for example, where the Commons wants a particular individual appointed to a job that is in the gift of the Crown.\nOn these occasions the Vice Chamberlain is entirely alone with the Monarch, nobody else is present. My experience was that once the formal business was concluded, the Queen would relax and we’d have a brief chat. She had quite a sense of humour. I’ve told a story in this column before, but I think it bears repetition: When I presented my first humble address to the Queen at Buckingham Palace, I was briefed beforehand by a courtier about the proper etiquette. In particular, he insisted that on no account was I to observe the ‘former custom’ of walking backwards so as not to turn my back on the Sovereign when I left the room. He said that this sort of ‘flummery’ had been abandoned for good. So, I presented the humble address, I enjoyed our chat and then, when I was about to take my leave, with a mischievous smile the Queen asked me “ now, are you going to walk backwards?”. I replied that I had been ordered not to, but if she’d like me to..? She chuckled, saying it that she didn’t mind at all either way, but she just had the impression that I might be a stickler for tradition. I said that, if it was really all the same to her, then yes, I would like to walk backwards. She smiled and said “just make sure you don’t trip up, or I’ll be in real trouble”",

After all, the virus will spread much more successfully if its host remains active rather than being laid low in bed.\nThe problem is that social distancing and lockdown may skew that process of natural selection in favour of variants that are more infectious: -infectious enough to get round aspects social distancing; and potent enough to gain hospital admission because that’s where some of best opportunities for greater spreading are to be had.\nThis artificial advantage for more infectious and potent variants afforded by our lockdown in response to Covid-19, applies not just to covid-19 itself, but to every virus that is out there.\nThis may have implications for future flu and other epidemics.\nIt’s another good reason to get back to normal life -urgently.",

She is a first-class lawyer and a fierce opponent of judicial activism.\nThere used to be an understanding that our constitution had a lock that required 3 keys to be operated simultaneously: only when the Crown, the House of Peers and the Commons all agreed on a measure would it become law.\nOver the last century or so the power of two of those keys has diminished dramatically: in effect the Crown has withdrawn entirely from decision-making in the legislative process and the Parliament acts of 1911 and 1949 have reduced the Peers to a revising chamber with limited delaying powers. The Commons is supreme.\nConstitutional theorists fret about this largely unchecked concentration of legislative power in one body. It does have the virtue however, of being elected, so that it is periodically held to account by voters for its stewardship.\nI have always been in receipt of letters demanding constitutional reform, to be fair it’s always been a minority taste amongst my correspondents, but it has been growing steadily albeit from a low base. Their principal demand is for the certainty of a written constitution.\nThis is the very opposite of what we currently enjoy, where there is no superior body of constitutional law that cannot be altered by statute (a new act of Parliament). Parliament can make new law and alter or repeal any previous laws unrestrained. Parliament is supreme and no court can strike out its statutes.\n(Under the Human Rights Act 1998 a court can declare any Act of Parliament as being incompatible with the Human Rights Act, but that will be just a declaration: the offending Act remains in force; the court cannot strike it out. In any event, Parliament itself can repeal the Human Rights Act should it choose to.)\nThe reason we should shrink from a written constitution is that it would establish a superior body of law as supreme, and which Parliament could not alter, and by which it would have to abide.\nThe will of the people, expressed through their elected representatives would be constrained by this new body of law.\nNow here’s the real rub: any decision with respect to whether a law infringed the constitution would be made by judges, who would indeed have gained the power to strike out laws democratically made by elected representatives.\nWe would have replaced the supremacy of an elected Parliament with the supremacy of unelected judges.\nGiven the rage with which so many constituents have written to me over the years to vent their frustration at judicial decisions that fly in the face of common sense (most recently, for example, the decision to halt the deportation of a foreign rapist and a murderer), such a constitutional settlement would be very much for the worse.\n(…but not all the judges are barking: Well done to Mr Justice Knowles for condemning the Orwellian actions by Humberside police who presumed to “check the thinking” of Harry Miller for expressing perfectly legitimate opinions about ‘transgender’ issues)",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_climate-lobby/content_800.html": "Earlier in the week I was lobbied by 30 or so constituents seeking more action on climate change.\nTheir principal request was for local empowerment so that communities could lead initiatives themselves. I agree. Of course, there is an agenda that Government must lead from the centre, but there is so much that can be done locally.\nOur New Forest Communities are active in tackling the scourge of pollution, from litter picks, to recycling initiatives across the area, to mass tree plantings on community land. This volunteering spirit reminds me of what we tried to foster a decade ago through the ‘Big Society’ which sought to give “communities and local government the power and information they need to come together, solve the problems they face and build the Britain they want.”\nIt is a force that we need to harness in order to drive forward change.\nA good example of initiatives that we should be pursuing is in the Local Electricity Bill which is currently in Parliament. This will allow electricity to be generated locally and sold direct to households in the community. It is not only positive environmentally to harness energy locally but in an increasingly uncertain world it is also prudent in terms of energy security.\nMaking those households much more energy efficient is the natural partner to renewable electricity supply. The statutory requirements for The Future Homes Standard to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 75-80% don’t kick-in until 2025. I’d prefer it to be much sooner, but there is a cost involved, and we have yet to address how that cost is to be divided between the developer, the purchaser, and the taxpayer.\nInevitably the group raised the issue of litter and plastic pollution. I am all too familiar with it and I’ve used this column on before to draw attention to it. I am frustrated that, having concluded a consultation last year on a bottle recycling scheme, the Government has decided to proceed with yet another one next year before we see it implemented. Nevertheless, there has been some success with a 90% reduction in single use plastic bags. Again, I’ve used this column to point to the example of Rwanda where plastic bags are banned entirely -and they are doing just fine.\nI also believe there is far more scope for regulation to reduce the obscene amount of packaging. I am glad that progress has been made on banning micro-plastics in cosmetics and the ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds takes effect in October.\nFrom 2022 products will be taxed that do not contain 30 per cent recycled materials.\nI was happy to report that the leading campaigner on this agenda, Rebecca Pow, the MP for Taunton Dene, has been promoted to be the minister with responsibility for this brief.\nThere was a clear preference expressed by the group for more cycle-friendly transport policy. As a cyclist myself, I am glad that this has been part of the Government’s strategy: we can expect more cycle lanes when the Prime Minister (himself a keen cyclist) announces a new cycling and walking strategy later this Summer.\nWe all agreed with each other that the move to electric vehicles required a transformation in the charging points available. Equally, we should congratulate local services like MoreBus: Their electric X3 from Salisbury to Bournemouth via Ringwood and Fordingbridge generates fewer emissions than my push lawnmower.\nIt was a useful and positive exchange, and it is essential that we keep it that way: I’ve come across far too much defeatism on climate change. It is not beyond our wit to reverse the damage that we’ve done to the planet, and to enjoy a better quality of life. The UK was the first developed country to impose legislative targets to reduce our emissions, since when we’ve met those targets and reduced emissions dramatically. There is plenty more for the Government to do, for local communities to do, and for each and every one of us to do.",

The expectation was that an elected House would replace it within a decade or so. Of course, it never happened.\nWhen, in 1998, the Blair Government culled the hereditary element, they allowed 100 hereditaries to remain temporarily -elected by the hereditary peers themselves. This arrangement was to only supposed to endure until a through reform would subsequently replace them with elected peers. They are still there, and every time one of them dies, a byelection is held amongst the hereditary peers to elect another to serve instead. The irony is that the remaining hereditaries are the only peers with any democratic legitimacy, because at least they were elected by someone.\nIn 2011 the Coalition Government, under pressure from the Liberal Democrats, invested precious parliamentary time in an attempt to legislate for elections to the House of Lords. It all came to nothing because the Commons could not agree on any particular scheme by which it would be achieved. My estimate is that exactly same outcome would be repeated were a government to attempt it again.\nThere are two fundamental reasons why the Commons will find reasons to prevent the Lords being elected. First, no MP wants a peer on their patch purporting to also represent their constituents too.\nSecond, we are savvy enough to realise that were the Lords to be elected and so legitimately claim to represent the people, they would no longer be content to be a mere revising chamber and without financial control: So, there would be enormous pressure on the Commons to share real political power.\nThere is reason why ordinary voters too should beware of democratic Lords reform: the huge bill that would come with it and which would be another claim on our taxes.\nWere the Lords to become elected tribunes of the people, they would no longer be content with expenses and a per diem allowance, they’d want salaries and pensions just like MPs. They would demand staff too. They’d need offices to operate from and to accommodate their staff. This extension to the secure parliamentary estate would present a huge new capital cost, in addition to all the extra running costs.\nAnd all for what?\nTo elect more politicians when we already have quite enough.",

Given what we’ve been through with the pandemic and the fact that WHO has proven to be a deeply flawed institution in obeisance to China, I quite understand the suspicions of my correspondents.\nNevertheless no WHO agreement can impose changes to UK law. Parliamentary sovereignty ensures that any changes must be approved by MPs. Currently none of the concrete proposals that are on the table would compromise UK sovereignty, nor is there yet any legal mechanism by which the WHO could compel its members to do anything. The Government has been clear: if any such proposals were on the table, we wouldn’t accept them.\nAll the suggested amendments to the International Health Regulations – the only proposals which have a realistic chance of being implemented in the immediate future – have been tabled by the United States and are sensible and uncontroversial. They address issues surrounding information sharing and surveillance that arose at the beginning of the pandemic and seek to remedy errors that were made.\nThe Prime Minister and other world leaders made a statement in March last year on a proposal for an international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response. All this is still further down the line but there is no plan for this new treaty to facilitate ‘global lockdowns.’ So, in my estimate there is no immediate cause for alarm. I see nothing sinister in “enhancing international co-operation to improve alert systems; data-sharing; research; local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment.”\nPreventing and mitigating future pandemics will require a transparent and co-ordinated approach together with other WHO member states on basic issues like information sharing and PPE procurement. What we must avoid however, is anything that limits our ability to respond to future pandemics independently.\nNone of this is to say that there have not been developments that give rise to proper concern. A WHO white paper titled ‘Strengthening the Global Architecture for Health Emergency Preparedness, Response and Resilience,’ proposes the establishment of a Global Health Emergency Council which would have a responsibility to “foster compliance with and adherence to global health norms and policies.” We must see- off this sort of interference and be vigilant in ensuring that any new treaty goes no further than proportionate and sensible measures.\nI hope this goes some way to allaying the concerns of scores of people who have emailed me.\nNevertheless, it is never wise to be ‘too reassured’. Nor can we take too much comfort from the protection of our parliamentary sovereignty when lawyers come demanding compliance with ‘binding international obligations’.

In times before food banks existed they would, in the first instance, rely on the wider family for help, and in desperation they might even have recourse to loan sharks. Food banks address a need, and we should thank those volunteers who give their time, money and substance.\nWe have a more generous welfare system than most comparable affluent economies. We also have a number of short term and emergency benefits including Discretionary Housing Payment. It is significant that government figures show that most food bank users have not applied for a Discretionary Housing Payment in the 6 months prior to their referral to a food bank.\nThe explanation may be that they were simply unaware of the benefit, or that the crisis that caused them to be referred to a food bank arose at such short notice.\nWhatever the particular crisis that an individual may face, there will inevitably be a delay in the response of the welfare system whilst the bona fides of any applicant for benefits are established and checked, into that ‘space’ the existence of a food bank is an important contribution.\nFor longer term reliance on food banks we need to ask more profound questions as to why people find themselves in such a situation. Of course, this will include assessments of the adequacy of the level of benefit payments -particularly where housing costs are concerned. The easy answer however, is always to address the problem with more money, but I do believe that we need to get at more a fundamental understanding of how recipients of benefits actually spend the welfare payments that they receive.\nThe shocking statistic is that one in five of our children is obese by the time they leave primary school, and that this disproportionately affects those children in the lowest household incomes.\nTo put it bluntly (and in the terms that elicited shouts of protest at the hustings): the poorest are amongst the fattest.\nThe conclusion that I draw is that their families need, in addition to welfare payments, help with how to shop more cost effectively and healthily.",

The danger is not that it will be voted down at second or third reading, rather that it will be amended during its committee and report stages.\nAs last Wednesday’s overwhelming Commons’ vote proved, relatively few MPs will explicitly vote against the express will of the voters. What they will do however, is put down amendments to try and constrain the Government’s negotiating position in order to emphasise or preserve particular aspects of EU membership that they wish to have retained, whether it be membership of the EU internal market, or its customs union, or whatever.\nIn the Commons the difficulty is reduced because the Government has a majority, if only a small one. In the Lords where there is no Government majority the danger is much greater.\nThe amendments will make success in the negotiations no more deliverable, but that is not their intent. The sole purpose of amending the bill will be to place obligations on the Government, requiring it to take account of the subject matter of the amendment when it negotiates.\nOnce the bill becomes an act of Parliament and the Government enters negotiations, questions will then arise as to whether it has complied, and taken proper account of the obligations placed upon it in those amendments. These questions can be subject to judicial review, and so you can bet that they will be. Be in no doubt, this is their strategy, this is the plan of the opponents of Brexit: they mean to tie the whole process up in legal knots.\nThe Government’s counter strategy must therefore, be to prevent its Article 50 bill being amended, particularly in the Lords. Experience from history teaches that their Lordships can be overawed by governments when those governments have demonstrated that they were determined to create sufficient new peers to secure the majority that they needed. Accordingly, I do hope that somebody in Number 10 is preparing a very long list of potential new peers, and is ready to leak it.",

This is primarily through funding from the UK Research and Innovation for the National Centre for the 3Rs (NC3Rs) who have committed £31.6 million for research and innovation into replacements technologies in the past five years, and to ensure that the UK has a robust and regulatory system for licensing animal studies.

In total, eligible families collectively received £380 million in meal vouchers while schools were partially closed, but I do not believe that this is an effective way of dealing with the problem.\nThe proper way to address poverty is not to provide free lunches to poor children, but to empower their parents, by tackling their poverty at source, by increasing their income.\nAccordingly, Universal Credit has, in response to Coronavirus, been increased by £1,040 this year.\nIn addition, between 2015-16 and 2019-20 1.7 people million were taken out of paying income tax altogether as a consequence of raising the personal tax-free allowance to £12,500 for all 32 million income tax payers.\nFurthermore, the adult national minimum wage was raised to £8.72 per hour.\nIn total £53 billion has been spent on income protection schemes and £9.3 billion on additional welfare payments.\nThese are the proper ways to treat those on low incomes with dignity. It allows them to budget according to their family circumstance rather than being issued with vouchers for lunches, almost as a badge of poverty, much in the way that claimants are demeaned in the USA by being issued with food stamps.\nPoor people still have their dignity, and it should not be compromised.\nEmployment is by far the best route to escape poverty, which is why it is so important that we stop generating further unemployment through our response to Covid-19.\nI do not belittle the suffering of families who have lost loved ones, nor the suffering of those who recover only to be blighted with a post-viral syndrome, but that suffering is no excuse for tipping our economy into recession.\nThe proven effect of lock-downs is that they make poor people poorer.",

Many of the disposable vapes thrown away each week are not recycled properly and are instead littered or discarded with residual waste.\nThe Government recently carried out a public consultation on the Prime Minister’s proposals to create the first smokefree generation and crack down on cheap and accessible disposable vapes. The consultation included proposals to restrict child-friendly flavours and bright coloured packaging. These proposals will be of major benefit to the environment by tackling a particularly problematic waste stream.\nRegarding the waste of vapes, retailers that sell over £100,000 of electrical equipment per year are obliged to provide in-store takeback of electrical items, including vapes, under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations. Smaller businesses can choose to contribute funds to the distributor takeback scheme instead to ensure vapes are recycled correctly.\nUnder these regulations, producers of electrical and electronic equipment, including vapes, are required to take financial responsibility for the collection, and proper treatment the products that they place on the market when those products become waste at household waste recycling centres or are returned to retailers. Consumers that wish to dispose of their old vapes can take them to their local authority household waste recycling centre. All vapes that are deposited at household waste and recycling centres will be collected and treated.\nFinally, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not currently hold information on the potential risks to animals from exposure to disposable vapes, it has commissioned research which will better understand both the market for, and impacts of, disposable vapes and associated cost inputs.\nDS",

It will neither address the problem of the Irish border nor deliver a continuation of frictionless trade at any border.\nUnless the UK remains within the EU Internal market (continuing with free movement, paying our annual subscription, and being subject to EU laws –but without any voice in the making of them), we will have to comply with checks to ensure that exports from the UK are compliant with EU standards.\nI do not doubt that the advocates of remaining in the customs union realise all this.

The question has been the extent to try and ‘hold the line’ through engineering works in the face of rising sea levels and climate change, or whether we try and manage the retreat as the coastline realigns.\nThere is a consultation underway: the detailed proposals can be found at https://www.hurstspit2lymington.co.uk/ and representations must be submitted by email HurstSpit2Lymington@environment-agency.gov.uk by 11th January\nI find the proposals for ‘managed retreat’ pretty alarming. They include discontinuing the maintenance of the Hurst Spit shingle bank and abandoning the existing sea wall between Keyhaven and Lymington Yacht Haven.\nWalking along the popular sea wall footpath from Lymington to Keyhaven will no longer be possible.\nOnce Hurst spit has been breached through discontinued maintenance, all of the salt marshes inside of Keyhaven river, all along the existing sea wall to Harpers post will ultimately be lost. This managed realignment will accelerate the loss of the intertidal habitat outside the sea wall and make the Lymington outer harbour area much more exposed.\nI understand that the Lymington River will almost certainly silt up, it will be subjected to huge wave action and become no longer navigable.\nHurst Castle will be cut off permanently from the shore and Lymington Harbour as a whole will be at risk. All of the features in that area will be given up to allow the tidal waters to penetrate inland and create new intertidal habitats for the birds further inland.\nThe cost of raising the existing sea wall to “Hold the Line” is in the order of £100 million, whilst the “Managed Retreat” option is closer to £280 million. The more expensive option of managed retreat is now the preferred option of the environment Agency because it unlocks central government funding for the proposed creation of the new intertidal bird habitat. However, I do not believe that enough weight has been given to local marine-related employment, or sufficient recognition given to the needs of businesses in the town of Lymington which depend of a thriving harbour, or the local amenity of sailing, motor boating, sea fishing, or simply walking your dog along the sea wall between Lymington and Keyhaven.\nThe annual budget for maintaining the shingle bank at Hurst of £40,000 is per annum, but there has been no maintenance this year. Given the new policy of “do nothing”, it remains to be seen if there will be any future maintenance of Hurst Spit between Milford and Hurst Castle, or whether this has already been abandoned to “Managed Retreat”. Given the relatively moderate cost of maintaining this structure in a normal year, this should not be allowed to lapse.\nThese proposals will change forever the shape of the coastline with profound impact on amenity and businesses.

I hope that readers will agree that, unlike tropical fish fancying, eradicating disease is a perfectly proper use of our overseas aid.\nThese diseases, such as the scourge of Leprosy, have been around since Biblical times. In 2010 former US President Jimmy Carter came to a conference in Britain to galvanise a renewed effort to eradicate them, which resulted in the ‘London declaration’ expressing our ambition to eradicate them by 2020. Last week was the 5th anniversary of the declaration and an opportunity to review how we are progressing.\nA medical research scientist once explained the difficulty of searching for cures by comparing the endeavour to a piece of Confucian wisdom: apparently the sage once said that the most difficult thing is to search for a black cat in a room without light, and particularly so…if there is no cat. I can understand the simile: the enormous effort searching with no guarantee that there will be a cure at the end of it. Of course there is scope for further research into these diseases, and we are paying some of it. Our problem however, is of a very different nature. The clue is in the name: neglected tropical diseases.\nThe irony is that we are awash with cures, what we have lacked is the will to distribute them.\nBetween 2010 and 2020 the pharmaceutical companies will have donated $17.8 billion’s worth of free cures. These numbers are so large that they scarcely mean anything to us – but reflect on it, only one billion minutes ago we would be back in Biblical times.\nThe cost of a pill to protect a child from bilharzia (a ghastly disease that eats away your organs from the inside) costs as little as 20 cents. The difficulty is not so much in finding cures for these diseases, as in providing the infrastructure and health systems to distribute them by the billion to remote and impoverished populations, and this is the proper role of international development aid, investing to increase the capacity and effectiveness of health services in the world’s poorest countries.\nAt this half way point between the declaration of our intent to eradicate these diseases, and the target date of 2020, I think we deserve a small pat on the back. We have certainly raised our game. The UK will spend £250 million over the decade on this endeavour. Poor countries themselves are spending their own meagre resources too. Ethiopia has launched a major initiative to clear a backlog of surgery to deal with trachoma (an excruciatingly painful cause of blindness). We have built up a fantastic international partnership with the UN, USAID, the Gates Foundation, Charities, and the Private sector – last year these companies donated 1.3 billion cures. The impact these partnerships are having can be dramatic: in 1987 there were 35 million cases of guinea worm disease (another really painful and debilitating condition), last year there were just 127, and so far this year only 4.\n‘But’, because there is still a big ‘but’. There are still 1.4 billion people suffering from one or more of these dreadful tropical diseases, and half a million people die from them every year.\nMedical science can be a grizzly business, as anyone who has thumbed through the pages of a medical text book to look at the photographs will know. These particular diseases are among the world’s most grizzly, the grizzliest of the grizzly, in terms of the grotesque disfigurement and disability that they cause. This leads to stigma, isolation and poverty.\nWe need to redouble our efforts to eradicate them if we are to realise our ambition to do so by 2020. My message to the conference last week was that, were we to fail, and still to be able to sleep at night, we had to make sure that no one could accuse any of us of not having done enough.",

I understand that, particularly for parents whose children are suffering or in pain, there is continued frustration that it is not easily accessible. Although the scheduling of cannabis-based products changed in 2018, this has not translated into significant clinical use.\nEach case is judged individually, and the decision should remain solely with the clinician. However, many doctors remain cautious in prescribing these treatments, and guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence demonstrate a need for more evidence to justify routine prescribing of unlicensed cannabis-based products. With that in mind, it is encouraging to hear of 13 ongoing trials in the UK, and six other trials already completed. Additionally, two new clinical trials into treating refractory epilepsy are being developed by the National Institute for Health Research and NHS England. I look forward to the results of these trials in due course.\nThe number of patients with NHS prescriptions for medicinal cannabis products is low. Often families have sought private treatment, which is clearly a serious financial burden. While the Government cannot stipulate what companies charge for the products, and these companies may face export or import fees for controlled drugs, I am aware of Ministers’ work within these constraints to reduce costs. Many believe medical cannabis, where clinically appropriate, is critical for patients and families in need, and I am assured that the Government is considering every possibility to ensure greater access.\nOf course, there is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis itself, can harm mental and physical health and damage communities.\nDS.",

As the wartime generation passes, it is important that we remind future generations of out glorious past.\nThis is particularly important, when so much of our public discourse is dominated by the security threat posed by a radical Islamist minority.

Yesterday (15th Oct) we debated the second reading of very short five clause Government bill to remove the ninety-two remaining hereditary peers from the House of Lords.\nThey had remained there on the basis of an agreement that was made by the previous Labour government to secure the passage of the 1999 Act which removed six hundred and sixty-six hereditary peers. The then Lord Chancellor, Lord Derry Irvine of Lairg , gave a solemn and binding undertaking that ninety-two would remain (having been elected to do so by the whole hereditary peerage) until a comprehensive measure to reform the whole of the House of Lords membership had been accomplished. The current bill, therefore, is in clear breach of that solemn and binding undertaking.\nThroughout the debate, the principal argument advanced by Labour was that there had been fourteen wasted years in which there had been no attempt at a comprehensive Lord’s reform, and consequently, the current government is somehow absolved of its obligation to abide by its Labour predecessor’s undertaking.\nThey seem to have forgotten that the previous Labour government had a further eleven years of power after the passing of 1999 Act, in which it could have itself enacted the awaited comprehensive reform.\nNevertheless, their charge about the last fourteen years of alleged inaction is entirely mistaken.\nThe problem that has bedevilled Lord’s Reform for over a century is that, notwithstanding an appetite for reform, there has been little agreement on what it should actually be.\nIn 2011 the Conservative-led coalition went to considerable trouble, involving series of iterative votes to try and identify a consensus for reform around which the Commons could unite. On that basis it then introduced a bill that passed at second reading, and which, had it proceeded, would have put democratically elected peers into the Lords.\nThat bill failed, not because it was opposed by a minority, which included me, and who thought that it was dreadful. Rather, it failed because, in an act of party-political cynicism, Labour – having voted for it- then subsequently withdrew support for its accompanying and very generous timetable motion. This would have scuppered the whole legislative programme, so there was no alternative but to drop the measure in entirety.\nLabour ministers were not lying when they insisted that they were absolved of the Lord Chancellor’s binding promise because of ‘fourteen wasted years’.

I have always rather suspected that one can secure the legal opinion that you want, if you are prepared to pay for it.

Without giving sufficient weight to the huge lasting economic and social damage that lock-downs cause.\nI was not surprised therefore, when accounts in the media trumpeted the findings of the joint report by the Commons Health and Science & Technology committees and their criticism of exactly that failure to lock down swiftly enough.\nWell, nothing is ever quite as bad as first reported. I have now read the report for myself and it is much more nuanced than was evident in the news broadcasts.\nIt is clear from the report that the policy of choice ought to have been not to lock-down at all, but instead, to follow the example of those jurisdictions that avoided lock-downs because, having earlier experience of the SARS infection, they had developed sophisticated and efficient systems to trace all the contacts of infected persons and isolate them.\nThe parliamentary committee’s criticism is more focussed on our failure over the longer term to have developed such systems because we really only ever planned for a severe flu epidemic.\nWhen it comes to the analysis of the position last autumn, when there were also demands for swifter and more extensive lock-downs, the report actually supports the Government having resisted those demands.\nThe usual suspects are now demanding, once again, that the life and livelihood of the nation be restricted to accommodate the needs of the NHS. I find this surprising because Covid-19 hospital occupancy is lower now than it was a month ago. We are told to be alarmed at the current 50,000 infections per day, -when following the removal of restrictions in July- we were told to expect 100,000 cases per day and still hold our nerve.\nIn any event, in most cohorts the figures are relatively flat, the growth is largely accounted for by five to twelve-year-olds, who are the most able to shake it off like a common cold.\nA principal cause of the pressure that the NHS is under is the rise in what used to be common respiratory and viral infections which are of now increased severity precisely because we have lost so much of our natural immunity by restricting social interaction. The more we see social and economic restrictions as the answer to reducing Covid-19 infections, the more we will generate problems from the loss of our ability to resist other common viruses that put elderly and vulnerable people into hospital, let alone the growing problems for mental health.\nLiving with the Covid-19 virus means treating it in the way that we treat other endemic diseases. We live with flu which, on a typical winter’s day will carry off 250 souls, but we don’t obsess about it and publish daily statistics.\nOver the last 18 months the Lock-down policy has enjoyed high levels of public support, indeed pollsters were telling us that the public would welcome even severer restrictions. Now however, the situation has changed significantly and the public are much more alive to the long-term damaging costs of restricting economic and social life. Hopefully this may act as a constraint on the willingness of ministers to submit to the noisy lobby demanding a return to restrictions.",

(David Cameron thought so too when he began his negotiations, before we even had the referendum.) When I heard Mr Blair being questioned in detail however, his answers were much more nuanced, it was clear that there was no such deal in prospect.\nDuring the referendum both sides agreed on only one thing: the importance of casting a vote in a once-in-a-generation opportunity to settle the EU question. We settled it and accordingly, Parliament voted to initiate the article 50 process: We are past the point of no return; We will automatically cease to me members of the EU on the second anniversary of our Article 50 letter. There currently is no means of stopping this process. To do so would require new treaty agreements with the EU.\nSuppose we did get cold feet however, change our minds, and ask to stay. I have no doubt that we would be welcomed, but at a price. Remember that annual rebate Maggie negotiated, well forget that! Remember all the opt-outs we had from policy areas where we didn’t want to participate, forget them too.\nWe are leaving the EU, the only questions to be settled are the terms upon which we leave, now the subject of negotiation.\nDo not underestimate however, the anger of our political establishment at what has happened and their desperation, even now, to stop it. They still believe that something might turn up. Whatever that ‘something’ might be, the vital ingredient of the strategy is the waiting for it: So, delay is essential.\nThe loss of the Government’s majority at the election is a gift to those who now seek to delay.\nThe Governments ‘repeal’ bill is an essentially straightforward measure to ease our exit from the EU. It repeals the 1972 European Communities Act which ensured that, wherever there was a conflict between our own law and EU law, then EU law would prevail. The bill now before Parliament seeks to incorporate exiting EU law into UK law so that on the day we leave the change will be seamless. But it’s a massive task, so the bill grants temporary powers to ministers to amend UK statutes by regulations which have a swifter passage through Parliament. There is nothing new here, it is a tried and tested way of making law.\nYou will by now have heard the great cry of anguish as politicians pronounce that, notwithstanding their respect for the referendum decision, these powers are too broad, the bill must be thoroughly scrutinised and amended, and so proceeding it will take a very long time to pass, if indeed it passes at all.\nIf it were not to do so, then our departure from the EU would be attended with confusion and uncertainty. That matters not to the bill’s opponents. They have only one object: endless delay; Delay for as long as it takes for something to turn up.",

As one of my colleagues put it “I just wish I had had the opportunity to play high stakes poker with them”. As I’ve said before in this column, if you really want a particular thing out of a negotiation, you don’t reveal it, on the contrary, you show that you are absolutely indifferent about it, otherwise your counterparty will raise his price accordingly.\nNow however, Tim Farron has revived an earlier demand for a second referendum: One at the outcome of the article 50 negotiations, so that people can decide to either remain, or to leave on the basis of the negotiated terms.\nThere is a small fly in the ointment: So far, we have been told that article 50, once invoked, is irreversible (indeed the High Court based its recent judgement on this very fact) and that the EU won’t negotiate with us at all until we do invoke article 50. There is therefore, no logic whatsoever to any post article 50 referendum, because the moment we invoke the article there is already no going back, even if a subsequent referendum result demanded it.\n(Of course, this could all change with the Government’s appeal to the Supreme Court).\nThere is another glaring problem, obvious to anyone who thinks about it for a moment: The EU does not want us to leave; holding another referendum at the end of the negotiations presents the EU with an opportunity to offer the most dreadful terms imaginable (including cutting off its own nose to spite its face), confident that these terms will be rejected in the referendum.\nOf course, that is the objective of those that propose the second referendum: they want to reverse the result of the first one, so perhaps Tim Farron isn’t daft at all, but he must think that we all are.\nThe notion that we did not know what we were voting for on 23rd June, and that we need a second chance to get the right answer, is not untypical of elites who disparage and distrust democracy.\nThe Remain campaign painted a picture of the ‘hardest’ Brexit imaginable. They told us that not only would the Leave campaign’s extra billions for the NHS never materialise, but that on the contrary, we would be too poor and too denuded of NHS staff to afford to have an NHS at all. The voters didn’t fall for it. They have made their decision and it is now the responsibility of all democrats to get on and implement it.",

The Government takes the issue of low-welfare and illegal supply of animals very seriously. Significant steps have been taken to improve and update the laws in England to crack down on unscrupulous breeders who breed purely for financial greed at the expense of animal welfare.\nUnder the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018, anyone in the business of breeding and selling dogs and/or who breeds three or more litters in a twelve-month period needs to have a valid licence from their local authority. Under these regulations, local authorities have powers to grant, refuse or revoke a licence. Licences must achieve and maintain statutory minimum animal welfare standards, linked to the welfare needs of the Animal Welfare Act 2006.\nFurther, under these regulations, licensed breeders are prohibited from breeding dogs if it can be reasonably expected that on the basis of their genotype, phenotype or health, this would lead to welfare problems for the mother or the puppies. This applies in the case of brachycephalic breeds. Both licensed and unlicensed animal breeders are required under the Animal Welfare Act to protect the animals involved in breeding from harm and to provide for their welfare in line with good practice. A breach of these provisions may lead to imprisonment, a fine, or both.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is in the process of reviewing the 2018 Regulations.\nFinally, Defra’s campaign Petfished raises awareness of issues associated with low-welfare and illegal supply of pets. The campaign provides a list of red flags for buyers to look out for when searching for a pet online. More information can be found here: https://getyourpetsafely.campaign.gov.uk/\nDS",

The volume of sewage and other pollution being discharged into our waters is completely unacceptable. The Government’s Plan for Water, published earlier this year, sets out more investment, stronger regulation and tougher enforcement to tackle every source of pollution.\nAs part of the plan, over £2.2 billion of investment has been accelerated. This will be directed into vital infrastructure to improve water quality and secure future supplies, with £1.7 billion of this to tackle storm overflows. Ministers have set stringent targets for water companies to reduce storm overflows, driving the largest infrastructure programme in water company history of £56 billion over 25 years. This is a credible plan which includes front-loading action in particularly important and sensitive sites, including bathing waters.\nRegarding regulation, Ministers are driving up monitoring and transparency. Monitoring of storm overflows has increased substantially, from only 7 per cent in 2010 to 91 per cent now, and companies are on track to reach 100 per cent by the end of the year. It is because of this monitoring that action can be taken to fix storm overflows and hold water companies to account. The Government is clear that water companies must not profit from environmental damage and Ofwat has been given increased powers under the Environment Act 2021 to hold them to account for poor performance. In March, Ofwat announced new powers that will enable it to take enforcement actions against water companies that do not link dividend payments to performance for both customers and the environment.\nIn July, Ministers introduced laws to remove the £250,000 cap on penalties that can be handed out by environmental regulators, as well as significantly broaden their scope to target a much wider range of offences. This will ensure that regulators have the right tools to drive compliance across a range of sectors, including water companies. Fines from water companies are being reinvested into the new Water Restoration Fund, which will deliver on-the-ground improvements to water quality and support local groups and community-led schemes which help to protect our waterways.\nFurther, the Environment Agency has launched the largest criminal investigation into unpermitted water company sewage discharges ever at over 2,200 treatment works. The Environment Agency funding is closely monitored to ensure that it can carry out its duties and functions effectively. Its funding for inspections comes directly from the permits issued to companies; enforcement is funded by government, and in the current Spending Review period, the Environment Agency’s environment RDEL (Resource) grant for 2022/23 increased to £96 million from £56 million in 2020/21.\nThese measures and others are making progress and Ministers will continue to make further improvements where necessary. Our bathing waters continue to improve, with 93 per cent classified as good or excellent in 2022 compared to 76 per cent in 2010. There is now 80 per cent less phosphorus and 85 per cent less ammonia in our rivers compared to 1990 when water was privatised.\nDS",

That’s because I’ve never written one…yet.\nThe reality is that most MPs are generalists. Of course, some bring particular, knowledge, expertise and experience from a profession or previous walk of life that they’ve been involved in. Others will master a brief and become expert in an aspect of policy in which they’re particularly interested, or if they’ve been appointed to a specific bill’s standing committee or elected to serve on a select committee.\nNot many of us are polymaths, so we are reliant on advice of experts and to temper that advice with our own prejudices and the weight of opinion of constituents, and most important of all, participating in the debate in Parliament -which is, after all, what we were elected to do.\nI’ve always had a healthy scepticism for large public sector infrastructure projects. The great age of the railway, though enabled by parliamentary legislation, was financed by private enterprise which carried both the risks and the rewards.\nNevertheless, HS2 with its huge implications for taxpayers, was given thorough parliamentary scrutiny. The Act that enabled it broke precedent by spanning two different parliaments (the members of the special standing committee, to ensure continuity, had to be from ‘safe’ seats which were unlikely to change hands in the election dividing the parliaments).\nThe Bill was subject to the hybrid procedure because it disproportionately affected so many different private interests. That procedure places a very significant additional burden on the MPs sitting on the committee, giving them a quasi-judicial role. Various interest groups, represented by parliamentary counsel (specialist barristers) present evidence from witnesses and cross examine the witnesses of other interest groups. The MPs sit as both judge and jury, they can intervene to cross-examine witnesses themselves, as a trial judge might.\nThe snag is that, like a juror, an MP nominated to such a committee has to present for every session of what, in the case of HS2, was a marathon.\nThough I had my doubts, I was never a partisan. I was prepared to accept the judgement of the standing committee that had examined all the evidence in such detail. Those MPs who were most vehement in their opposition clearly had a particular axe to grind: they were disproportionately those colleagues whose constituencies in the Chilterns, and elsewhere, were going to be dug up.\nI was to some extent reassured by the pedigree of the protagonists. Philip Hammond, formerly the MP for Runnymede and Weighbridge, was the Secretary of State for Transport who gave the green light to the project, he also became one of our most conservative and parsimonious of chancellors of the Exchequer.\nI always thought that halving journey times was a complete red herring. The case was always, in my estimate, built on the huge shortage of rail capacity on the routes north of London, where no new railway had been built for over 100 years. The question was one of ‘if we are going to build the new rail capacity that is needed, would we build an ‘old one’ or one using the latest cutting-edge technology?\nWe went for the latest technology, and that is largely responsible for the exponential rise in costs.\nWe have a duty to review the decisions we made in the light of the detrimental impact that these costs have on other important national priorities. It is always difficult to admit a mistake, particularly such a costly one, but it may be better than compounding the mistake by ploughing on.\nI will await the outcome of the PM’s review before deliberating further.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_disputing-deaths/content_798.html": "I Have been taken to task for ‘spreading misinformation’ because in this column on the 5th of September 2020 I stated that UK deaths in the preceding 12 months had been by no means exceptional.\nA critic however, has provided figures clearly showing a 15% increase in deaths in 2020 over the average of the preceding three years.\nFirst, the criticism is based on figures for the whole of 2020, where my column was written at the beginning of September before the surge in infections and deaths consequent upon the advent of the new variant. Only two weeks after publication of the column, the Secretary of State told me from the despatch box, on the record, that average deaths were consistent with the long-term average. I consider my column to be a fair analysis at the time it was written.\nFurthermore, when I wrote the column I was considering a much broader sweep of recent history than my critic.\nFrom early in the pandemic I have complained about how we are manipulated by the ways in which statistics are presented, especially without context.\nMost recently I have been appalled by the way that last year’s figures for deaths have been presented with attendant hyperbole.\nOn the morning of their release the BBC R4 Today Programme trumpeted that they were the worst since WW2. The statistician in attendance said that this was a quite illegitimate comparison given the number of profound changes since then, not least the vast increase in population. Nevertheless, the BBC persisted with the characterisation.\nLikewise, The Guardian ran with a headline on the 12 January 2021 that “2020 was deadliest year in a century in England and Wales.” Such a sensationalist headline looking at deaths recorded in a calendar year did not account for the size or composition of the population.\nA useful measure for understanding deaths is the Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMRs). ASMRs take into consideration both the population size and age-structure allowing comparisons over time. The ONS notes that the provisional ASMR in 2020 for England and Wales was 1043.5 deaths per 100,000 population which was around 8% higher than the five-year average. Since 2001 the ASMR has decreased annually but an increase was seen in 2019 and 2020. It is granted that the ASMR was higher in 2020 than recent years but it was surpassed in 2008 (1,084.2), 2007 (1,085.1), 2006 (1,099.1), 2005 (1,137.6), 2004 (1,155.4), 2003 (1,224.8), 2002 (1,225.5) and 2001 (1,229.8).\nAnother way of assessing the number of deaths in the UK is the Crude Death Rate (deaths per 1,000 population). Based on ONS’s monthly deaths spreadsheet and population projections for 2020 a provisional crude death rate for England and Wales can be calculated at 10.1 deaths per 1,000 population, compared with 8.9 in 2019. The ONS’ Annual data: Deaths (numbers and rates: total, infant, neonatal) shows that the crude death rate in England and Wales was higher than 2020 when records began in 1953 (11.4 deaths per 1000 population) until 2003 (10.2 deaths per 1,000 population) in every single year.\nThere is little doubt that the UK had a greater number of deaths in 2020 than in the preceding decade. However, it is far from exceptional. Under the Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR) measure the rate of mortality was higher in every year prior to 2008. Likewise, under the crude mortality rate every year preceding 2003 saw a higher mortality rate than 2020.\nIn any event, given that my principal complaint is that lockdown is a failed policy: It comes at an astronomic economic and social cost. So, the more dramatically one presents the death rate, the more its abject failure is manifest.\nScientists and politicians ought to be able to dispute the interpretation of data sensibly and without rancour or name-calling.",

Then there is always an address that you just can’t find. There are streets that appear to have no logic whatever to the way the house numbers work.\nSo letter boxes display prohibition against the delivery of ‘Junk Mail’. Would anyone trouble themselves to deliver a message all the way to your door, if they really thought that it was junk?\nWhen it comes to canvassing, I confess that it is not my favourite pastime. I know that some election volunteers love it, but I am not among them.\nNo matter what time you call, most people are out -or pretending to be.\nThere are some voters who are disappointed that the Tory didn’t call by, and I did get an email from one. I pointed out that with some 45,000 households in the constituency, even going full tilt with a dedicated team of volunteers you would barely make an impression. My own maximum during this election was 300 doors in one week.\nWhat makes canvassing so daunting however, is the fact so many voters do not want you on their doorstep discussing politics -or anything else, and they make this abundantly clear by the little stickers they place on the door telling you to go away. Those who follow me on Twitter will have seen that I have been sharing examples as I encountered them. Perhaps the most common, and the daftest, is “No unwelcome callers”. I ask you, how on earth can you tell if you are unwelcome or not, unless you call?\nOne of my favourites was “No purveyors of religious or political wisdom of any kind”\nAnother said “No Cold Callers. We are too broke to buy anything. We know who we are voting for. We have already found Jesus. Seriously, unless you are distributing free cookies PLEASE GO AWAY”\nSome signs just say “no cold callers”. Now does that really mean salesmen or does it apply to political canvassers too?\nWell, it depends on the random caprice of the occupant. When I’ve gone ahead and knocked sometimes they’ve seemed quite agreeable, but at others they are clearly angry that their instruction has been defied.\nWhen you knock, having first consulted the electoral register, you know the name of the person you are calling on. Often, for an address with only one registered voter, the door is opened by a person of the opposite sex to that specified on the register. My habit is to say “excuse me, I was hoping to speak to Mrs ‘x’, is she at home?”\nNow here’s a question for our new age where gender is now regarded merely as an outdated social construct rather than a biological fact: could I be insulting the occupant by assuming that he or she is not the person on the register, on the basis of my own bourgeois expectation of what a person of a particular sex looks like?\nI haven’t had a complaint yet, but I suppose it’s bound to happen sometime.",

I’ve set out the reasons for my own choice below.\nIt starts with honesty. We need to be clear about why we lost the election. We lost because we were seen as incompetent and divided, and no-one knew what we stood for. This wasn’t entirely fair but it was true enough to turn off millions of voters who left us for Reform, the Lib Dems, Labour, or to stay at home and not vote at all.\nTo restore our reputation for competence, to unite the Party, and to rediscover what we stand for – we need leadership.\nLeadership isn’t about grabbing media attention, though we certainly need a good media performer. It’s about doing the hard work to identify the real causes for our national malaise – on productivity and growth, on defence and security, on social breakdown and the state of the public services – and putting in place a plan to fix them.\nIt’s about setting a clear direction, with explicit policy commitments on the main issues the voters care about: immigration, the economy and the public services, especially the NHS. When the leader is clear on direction, the troops will unite and follow.\nAnd it’s about being professional, diligent, decent and respectful towards all strands of conservatism (and indeed non-conservatives). We need courage and radicalism, but with the spirit of emollience and courtesy. You don’t win by hectoring people. You win by putting across a clear and persuasive message.\nThis combination – clarity on policy direction, and an inclusive and generous spirit – is what Robert Jenrick represents. He has set out a detailed analysis of what is wrong with our country, a clear set of Conservative principles to address them, and policies to get there. His pledge to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a case in point.\nI like and greatly admire Kemi Badenoch. If Rob had been knocked out of the contest earlier, I would have backed her. Indeed, I backed her in the last leadership contest. I share her politics – pro-Brexit, pro-growth, anti-woke – and I recognise her strengths as a punchy debater and, of course, if Kemi wins this contest, I will gladly follow her. We have a great chance of winning back power from this plainly failing Labour government, and we will need unity to do that. But for the next week we have a choice and I see Robert Jenrick as the stronger of the two",

And several of them are now showing an interest in the arrangements we have been negotiating with Rwanda.\nI was wrong however, with respect to the most important partner in this business: Rwanda has now made it clear that, were we abrogate our commitments under the Convention, then the deal will be off, and they won’t receive any of the illegal entrants that we are hoping top send their way.\nThis effectively closes off the route that I and many of my colleagues favoured, namely leaving the Convention altogether. Unfortunate, but we have to live with political reality.\nInstead, we must now capitalise on the increasing frustration of our continental neighbours, in order to collaborate collectively to drive reform of the Convention itself -which we all signed up to three generations ago, and which was made for a different world and a completely different set of circumstances than now prevail.\nAlas, this will not be deliverable in the short to medium term.\nIn the meantime, the Government has framed new legislation that delivers all the objectives that I set out in my blog of 16th October.\nI entirely understand the frustration of Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick. They urged the Government to adopt this course much earlier and to prepare for a defeat in the Supreme Court when, instead, the Government was banking on winning.\nNevertheless, we need to deal with the situation as it is, not as we would wish it to be. Howling at the moon and insisting on what me might have done differently won’t get us anywhere.\nIt is no good complaining that the new bill does not go far enough, if it went any further, Rwanda would cancel the whole endeavour: End of story.\nThe Bill before the Commons next week uses parliamentary sovereignty to establish, beyond the jurisdiction of any UK court, that Rwanda is a safe destination.\nWhat it doesn’t do, is to stop is individual appeals against deportation. We can live with that for the time being. After all, we have already legislated to establish that such appeals can be conducted remotely, once they are already in Rwanda.\nLet’s get on with it.\nWe forget that we are not alone, all of Europe is experiencing the same problem -but worse than we are.\nWhilst our Channel crossings are down by a third, Europe’s crossings are increasing exponentially.

In its Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP), the Government restated the commitment to restore 75 per cent of protected sites to a favourable condition by 2042, while also setting an interim target to put us on the right path to achieving this goal by 31 January 2028.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) worked closely with Natural England in setting the interim targets in the EIP and consulted widely on the legally binding targets set out in 2022. Defra continues to work closely with Natural England to achieve both of these commitments.\nFurther, through the Sustainable Farming Incentive, farmers are paid for actions that support food production and improve farm productivity and resilience, while also protecting and improving the environment. This includes actions relating to soil health, hedgerow management, providing food and habitats for wildlife, and managing pests and nutrients.\nWhen adopted at scale by farmers, these actions will make a significant contribution to the Government’s environment and climate targets, and support objectives to maintain food production and improve farm productivity. This includes the aim published in the EIP of between 65 and 80 per cent of landowners and farmers adopting nature-friendly farming on at least 10 to 15 per cent of their land by 2030.\nRegarding green jobs, the UK has attracted around £120 billion investment in renewables since 2010 and is expected to attract a further £100 billion investment in net zero by 2030, supporting up to 480,000 jobs. The Government is providing investors with long-term certainty over policy and regulatory frameworks to unlock investment and create jobs in green industries such as hydrogen, carbon capture, offshore wind and nuclear.\nAdditionally, any decision to modify our tax regime is a matter for the Treasury and careful consideration will be given to any proposed amendments.\nFinally, access to open spaces and nature is important for the health and wellbeing of our communities, and Ministers have set a new ambition that everyone should live within 15 minutes’ walk of a green or blue space. Through the £14.5m ‘Access for All’ programme, the Government has targeted measures to improve access to our protected landscapes and countryside.

As the wartime generation passes, it is important that we remind future generations of out glorious past.\nThis is particularly important, when so much of our public discourse is dominated by the security threat posed by a radical Islamist minority. We should recall that our people struggled together in great and honourable endeavours against tyranny and injustice. People who are proud to be British, and who happen to be Muslims, must not be tarnished by a tiny minority.\nWe need to remember that 400,000 Muslim soldiers fought for us in WWI and 1.5 million in WWII.\nThey shared our defeats and our victories, they were injured, died, and won gallantry awards in our finest hours.

I revisit it again for two reasons. First, the Commons Health select Committee, after a thorough inquiry has produced a thoughtful and very balanced report on the question which can be found at\nAssisted Dying/Assisted Suicide (parliament.uk)\nSecond, because the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Keir Starmer, has announced that he will let Parliament vote on the matter.\nBut Parliament does not need his consent or permission; Both Houses have mechanisms to secure a vote, when they want it.\nIn the Commons we last voted on it in September 2015, then we rejected the proposal to legalise it by 330 votes to 118.\nThat opportunity arose on a private member’s bill. Had there been sufficient appetite for a re-match, another private member’s bill could have been presented; Or, alternatively, an amendment could have been tabled to a suitable Government bill. Another option would have been a division under the ‘ten-minute rule’ procedure -often a very useful test of the opinion within the House. Indeed, there is nothing to stop Sir Kier giving one of his Opposition days over to a motion on the subject. Or the back- bench Business Committee could schedule a motion for decision.\nThe point is that Parliament does not have to wait on the Government in order to debate and vote on questions that it considers important.\nOf course, were a vote supporting a change in the law to be successful, then Government time and co-operation would be required, in spades, in order to get the detailed legislation through. I’m certain that there is no Government enthusiasm for to giving up such time and effort to this complex problem, at an inevitable cost to its other legislative priorities.\nEqually, notwithstanding the apparent public support for changing the law, I suspect that most parliamentary colleagues, recognising the difficulties that such an enormous change would represent, and seeing the experience of those jurisdictions that have embraced it, themselves shrink from it.\nThe Budget\nBudgets, or as they are increasingly designated in Newspeak. ‘fiscal events’ need to be judged in their historical context. They are, after all, designed to have a lasting effect on our prosperity in the long term. This isn’t always the case, as we discovered with Kwasi Kwarteng’s autumn statement, all which was largely reversed within weeks.\nYesterday’s budget needs to be judged in the context of events dating back to 2010 when the Coalition Government inherited the most disastrous state of the public finances in peacetime, and a recession worse than any since the 1930ies. Incoming Treasury ministers were left a leaving note by their predecessors announcing that ‘there is no money left’.\nOf absolute necessity, there followed the most significant cuts in public expenditure in order to ‘fix the roof’ as the Chancellor, George Osborne put it, and which he accused Gordon Brown of not doing during the much more advantageous economic circumstances that he had inherited in 1997 – when “the sun was shining”.\nThe Coalition’s financial policy was dubbed ‘Austerity’ by the opposition and it was predicted that it would lead to mass unemployment. On the contrary, as Jeremy Hunt boasted yesterday, it generated 800 new jobs per day, for every day that Conservatives have been in government since 2010.\nAnd It put UK economic growth ahead of the other G7 wealthy economies.\nWithout the successful delivery of that financial policy, Britain would never have been able to access the billions that were needed to keep employment and the economy stable during the pandemic and to weather the economic impact on energy prices delivered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nWithout the ‘headroom’ created by the Coalition’s policy we would have faced the most disastrous of outcomes from either of those shocks to the economy.\nThat we were able to deal with them by hosing them with money, now provides the immediate context for this present budget. The phenomenal costs of business support and furlough, together with the eye-watering bill for subsidising energy bills are the explanation for the level of taxation being at a peacetime record: Record sums spent to get the economy through a pandemic and Russia’s war required record taxation.\nThe task of the Chancellor yesterday was to use what little room to manoeuvre that he had, to plot a path to lower taxes and reduced debt without spooking the markets.\nIn my estimate, he made a reasonable fist of it with a second recent reduction in direct taxation.\nNo doubt, my critics will complain that I have omitted two important factors from the context in which this budget fits: Brexit, and the short-lived Truss premiership.\nI addressed the economic outcome of Brexit previously in this column Brexit Freedom Day (desmondswaynemp.com) . In a nutshell, our relatively good performance in growth, inflation and interest rates compared to the EU suggests that Brexit is not part of the problem.\nI remember well, that was on a train to Oxford to defend the Government’s record at the University debating Union when I heard the news that Kwasi had been dismissed and that the measures that he had set out were to abandoned. Clearly it was a poor wicket on which to go out to bat.\nThe spike in interest rates, most unwelcome to those of us with mortgages, were on the way up in any case, and their trajectory has been similar to those experienced internationally.\nAs I said here at the time Two fingers to Socialist Dogma and Envy (desmondswaynemp.com)\nI approved of all the measures individually and I want to see them all implemented as soon as possible. Kwasi’s mistake was to spook the markets by attempting them all at once, and at the same time as announcing the most generous energy subsidy entertained by any jurisdiction.\nThe modest measures set out yesterday are designed to get us to the same desirable high growth\ndestination to which Kwasi aspired, but -this time- by a secure route.\nLee Anderson – Islamophobia?\nI was an early fan of the straight-talking Lee Anderson. On the 3rd of February last year I badgered the Prime Minister to make him Chairman of the Conservative Party. In the event he made him Deputy Chairman. I was disappointed when he had to resign in order to vote for an amendment to the Rwanda Bill, I voted for that amendment too.\nI regret his suspension for his tirade against the London Mayor Sadiq Khan, but his refusal to apologise left the PM with no alternative. There were plenty of perfectly proper things that Anderson could have taken khan to task over. He has been a dreadful mayor, squandering the legacy left by his predecessor Boris. His record on Housing, transport, police, and almost everything else has been lamentable.\nTo accuse him of being controlled by Islamists however, is absurd. I know Khan, he is a former parliamentary colleague, he is about as secular a politician as one can get.\nNevertheless, many constituents have registered with me their disgust at Anderson’s treatment.\nThey believe that he has so often articulated their own thoughts and they are concerned about the way that freedom of expression is being diminished. I understand those concerns, but politicians do need to be cautious about the language that they use. Imagine if a politician had criticised a high-profile holder of public office as being controlled by Zionists, the furore would have been deafening.\nMuslims must not be stereotyped. It is quite wrong to conflate ‘Muslims’ with Islamist extremists. We do well to remember current contribution of Muslims to our society as well as their historic contribution to the Empire and, in particular the imperial forces of the Crown.\nBut there are aspects of Islam which it is perfectly proper to subject to public scrutiny, such as the role of women, attitudes to homosexuality, Sharia councils, and teachings on apostacy. Just as there has been no shyness in subjecting Christianity to that same scrutiny ever since the Enlightenment.\nIn a liberal society an important aspect of public life, like Islam, must accommodate itself to the discomforts of public scrutiny and free discussion. Notions of blasphemy are an affront to liberal democracy.\nAfter a long consultation and subsequent deliberation, the Parliamentary Group on British Muslims defines ‘Islamophobia’ as “rooted in racism and is a type of racism that targets expressions of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness.”\nWhist I can understand what they are getting at, I think this is too broad a definition and has a chilling effect on criticism of aspects of Islam, or indeed of Islam itself. It is far too widely drawn. We must be very careful to ensure that criticism and freedom of expression in public discourse is not constrained by inappropriate accusations of ‘hate speech’. The reality is that Islam, like Christianity, is a religion adhered to by people of all races, and not itself a race.\nAs a Christian I am used to the criticism of my religion, both fair and unfair, and I’ve been critical of it myself too.\nIslam must be subject to the same rigour, and Muslims free to be equally critical of it.\nPoliticians, however, should endeavour to be accurate and justify their assertions with facts.\nReform\nI’ve had a few letters from constituents, genuinely solicitous for my own political survival, suggesting that I switch allegiance to the Reform Party -for such is their own preference.\nI am not tempted. Though, some of Reform’s programme certainly appeals:: smaller Government, lower taxes, control of immigration, much greater exploitation of our Brexit freedoms:; A programme that definitely chimes with the section of the political spectrum that I occupy. Nevertheless, political parties in the UK, unlike parties in so much of continental Europe, have to be much more than a manifesto of measures that appeal to a particular segment of the electorate. Most European jurisdictions use electoral systems that are largely designed to ensure that the outcome of an election delivers representation proportional to the votes cast for each party. This guarantee of representation enables political parties to be much more ‘picky’ about the narrowness of their ideological purity and agenda. The constitutional principle in the UK however, is that the candidate with the most votes wins, irrespective of the proportion of the vote achieved. We vote for candidates in whose judgement we place our trust for the duration of a parliamentary term. That is why we do not hold a by-election if an MP switches party: votes were for a named candidate, whose political party allegiance is only secondary. After all, it’s only in my lifetime that we have allowed the names of political parties to be included on the ballot paper at all.Consequences follow from these different voting systems. Proportional electoral systems deliver a modest measure of success to a relatively large selection of political parties, each having put their manifesto to the vote, but rarely do any of whom command a majority. Coalitions are formed after the election through ‘horse trading’ between the parties to cobble together a numerical majority delivering a programme put together and agreed by the parties after the election, but which was never put to the voters at the election.\nTo have electoral success in the UK system however, requires much broader support to secure any representation at all. Consequently, UK political parties are ‘broad churches’. We make our coalitions before elections: each of our parties is a coalition that agrees on a set of values and principles but will encompass members with a spectrum of views on different issues. Unlike the European proportional systems, ours makes it very difficult for a new and ideological party to break through and win any constituency seats at all, even if they secure a proportion of the votes that gets into double figures. Unsurprisingly, part of the Reform offer is to change our system to the continental model. Whilst, all voting systems have differing advantages and disadvantages, we voted to keep our existing voting system in a referendum in 2011 by a margin of 70% to 30%. I’m satisfied with that decision.No, I’m not remotely tempted.\nWars…continued\nlast week, in this column, I was somewhat sceptical about imminence of a war with Russia.\nNevertheless, it is a growing danger that we cannot ignore, together with the increasing threats to our vital national interests, including freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf and the South China Sea.\nBut defence is expensive: despite the 6th highest defence budget in the World we have seen very significant reductions in our armed forces.\nThe Defence Settlement announced by the Prime Minister during his tenure as Chancellor in 2020 provided an additional £24.1 billion in cash terms over four years, exceeding UK’s NATO pledge and represented the biggest increase to UK defence spending since the Cold War.\nMore recently, the Chancellor announced in last Spring’s Budget that the Government will invest an extra £5 billion in defence and national security over the next two years, and will be spending another £3 billion across the defence nuclear enterprise, allowing us to improve our nuclear skills programme and support the delivery of our AUKUS partnership for the Indo-Pacific region together with Australia USA.\nDefence spending is set to consume 2.25% of GDP by 2025, exceeding the NATO target of 2%.\nMost recently the PM has expressed his ambition to reach 2.5%\nBut is it enough?\nDuring the Cold War, and the ‘temperature’ is no warmer now, we were spending 4% of GDP.\nIf we take the current threat level seriously, should we be doubling our defence budget?\nThe war in Ukraine has changed everything. Once again, size really matters: Both Russia and Ukraine are struggling to recruit sufficient forces.\nWhilst, Ukraine has mobilized in a war of national survival in which reserve units -like the Azov at Mariupol, have played a critical role, we by contrast, have optimised our forces for expeditionary operations much further afield beyond the NATO area, fighting ‘wars of choice’ against adversaries over which we have significantly greater capabilities.\nWe now need to prepare for war in Europe against a ‘peer adversary’. With that in mind, what can we learn from Ukraine’s experience against that very peer adversary?\nI suggest the lessons are:\n-The importance of number of manoeuvre formations that can be put into battle\n-The quantity of infantry, thickened by anti-armour and anti-air capability, to protect long lines of communication\n-Engineers to keep those lines open\n-The manpower challenges of protecting civilian populations and infrastructure\n-The even greater manpower requirements of urban warfare and the need to rotate exhausted troops.\nWhen we were last able to deliver these sorts of capabilities we relied on Territorials to swiftly reinforce the British Army of The Rhine. The Territorial Army, with an establishment of 86,000 in formed units, providing potent blocking formations equipped with artillery, anti-tank missiles and mortars.\nWe make much less use of reserve forces that our the USA, Australia and Canada. Whilst our regular forces are among the best in the world, they are increasingly difficult to recruit and expensive to retain. If we are to pose a risk, sufficient to deter any aggressor, without impoverishing the taxpayer, then it has to be by recovering the ‘citizen’s army’ of reservists.\nWars and Rumours of Wars\n(Matthew 24:6-7) “ you will hear of wars and rumours of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.”\nWe’ve certainly been hearing those rumours in recent weeks. The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, appears to be one of ‘doves’ when he told us last month that Western armies and political leaders must anticipate conflict with Russia in the next 20 years. Other analysts and commentators have put the prospect of total war very much closer.\nGeneral Sir Patrick Sanders, Chief of the General Staff, has said that our forces would not be large enough to defend the country if there was a war, and it and that it is essential that we lay the foundations now for “national mobilisation”. Others have explicitly called for the return of conscription.\nI accept entirely, notwithstanding that we already have the 4th largest defence budget in the world, we do need to beef-up our defences in the face of Russia’s expansion of defence expenditure to a third of their entire national budget. We are one of the few NATO members to reach the current defence expenditure target of a mere 2% of national income. So, we have a lot of ground to catch-up.\nThe purpose of the increased the defence capability that we now need to acquire, is not so that we are able to fight the next war, but so that we can avoid having to do so.\nAs the Roman said ‘Si vis pacem, para bellum’, which loosely translates as ‘if you wish for peace, then prepare for war’. Only our readiness will deter the enemy from the risks of making war upon us. It is the possibility of defeating us that will tempt the enemy to try: Deterrence is cornerstone of our defence policy.\nDo we have time?\nI certainly don’t accept the hyperbole that the threat is imminent. Russia’s military performance against Ukraine does not indicate that they will be capable of successfully taking on NATO in the short term. Furthermore, NATO retains very impressive capabilities, far in excess of what Russia has encountered in Ukraine, which should make Putin think twice.\nAs we were surprised by Ukraine’s ability to resist, similarly in the nineteen-eighties we believed that the Soviet capability was so great, that our only chance of holding their advance was to resort to first use of battlefield nuclear weapons. Very swiftly, at the end of that decade, the myth of Soviet superiority was exposed by its complete collapse.\nThat Russia has had to empty its prisons to field troops in Ukraine, may indicate that we may, as in the eighties, be overestimating their capability.\nI shall return in this column, to the question of how we might improve our defence without breaking the bank, and certainly not by resorting to conscription.\nIn the meantime, whilst we do live in very dangerous times… “but the end is not yet”\nBrexit Freedom Day\nToday is the fourth anniversary of the UK leaving the EU: Brexit freedom day.\nNevertheless, it is the nature of email, by which most of my correspondence is received, that it is a medium chiefly of complaint, and rarely of celebration.\nDoom merchants continue to talk-down our country.\nYet, the other leading complaint they send to me is to deride our monumental struggle to reduce immigration, both legal and illegal. It should have occurred to these doomsters that it is precisely because Britain is so much better than anywhere else, that migrants are making such herculean efforts to get here.\nThe truth is that the vote to leave the EU was a massive vote of confidence in this country, and that confidence has been justified:\nWhilst I accept that the EU has placed all sorts of bureaucratic costs in the way of our exporters, nevertheless, despite all the dire warnings, trade with EU is up almost 40%.\nAnd, free of the EU tariff regime, our trade with the rest of the world is up almost 60%.\nNo longer are we surrendering 75% of our customs revenue to the EU, Nor are we having to pay an annual membership net contribution of £13 billion, with the addition of all sorts of extra burdens like a contribution of 600 million euros to the EU Covid Recovery Fund.\nWe have become the world’s eighth largest manufacturer. Out technology sector is now three times the size of France’s and twice that of Germany’s. ‘Project fear’ warned that if we left the EU we faced economic oblivion, but, on the contrary, since the referendum in 2016, the UK economy has grown faster than Germany, Italy, and Japan. We have the third fastest growth in the G7 group of leading economies. We are more innovative than both our European neighbours France & Germany and our Asian allies Japan & South Korea.\nLondon has regained its pre-eminence as the global financial centre.\nThe UK now has more trade agreements than any other independent country on the planet. We have negotiated free trade agreements with 73 countries, from Mexico to Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand. We’re the first European nation to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership with the Indo-Pacific’s most dynamic economies, which will make up nearly a quarter of global GDP by 2050.\nWe are masters in our own house once again. We are now able to ban the cruel export of livestock for slaughter. We are have scrapped the dead hand of the Common Agricultural Policy, and instead incentivise biodiversity and stewardship.\nWe are able (if only we’d show more energy to get on with the job) to cut red tape and set the economy free.\nFar from losing our influence, as we were warned, we have taken a lead in the world with our response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and to the situation in the Middle East.\nI make no pretence that there isn’t a heap of intractable problems that we need to fix, but just consider the public disquiet and political angst in Germany, or the blockade of Paris by French Farmers.\nLooking back isn’t the answer to any of our problems, neither is Labour’s ‘closer alignment with the EU’ -whatever sinister meaning that phrase may have.\nThe ‘Net’ in Net-Zero\nOn Monday the Commons debated the second reading of the Offshore Petroleum Licencing bill which is opposed by all the opposition parties, with the exception of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party.\nThe Bill enables the licensing of new North Sea oil fields on an annual basis going forward.\nIt is opposed because it is perceived to sacrifice UK’s World leadership role in the movement to reduce carbon emissions in the battle against climate change.\nI think this fear is quite misplaced. Our leadership is established by the fact that despite generating only about 1% of the world’s carbon emissions, notwithstanding being the 6th largest world economy. we have cut those emissions by more than any other developed economy – they are down by a whopping 30% from the level they were at in 1990.\nThis achievement has been partly secured by cutting out coal for power generation and increasing\nreliance on wind and solar for electricity. In 2010 these two forms of power generation accounted for only 7% of our electricity, now they are producing 40% of it.\nUK led has the world to give legislative imperative to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe important thing to remember about this net-zero target however, is that it is ‘net’.\nWe will continue to generate emissions after 2050 because we will need many more years to replace our need for hydrocarbons in any number of uses from powering vehicles, heating our homes, manufacturing products, and generating electricity until we are able to replace gas-fired power stations, increasing nuclear, and until we have improved our capability to store power generated earlier through better battery technology.\nDespite this time lag, we will reach a position of net zero by removing more carbon from the atmosphere through carbon capture and storage, so that overall we will balance continued emissions with the amount that we are removing.\nThis will be no mean endeavour: it will require new technology; transforming agriculture, and changes to the way we do things.\nNevertheless, it is much more manageable than the hair-shirt mentality that wishes to hobble our economy and prosperity by prematurely closing down one of our greatest assets: oil and gas in the North Sea.\nWe still need it; and we will still need it for decades after we achieve net-zero in 2050. So, if we do not get it by issuing new licences for North Sea exploration and extraction, then we are going to have to import it from overseas at much greater cost to ourselves and we will forgo what has been a lucrative source of tax revenue to fund public services, currently to the tune of £16 Billion annually.\nThe Opposition state however, that far from needing the oil and gas ourselves, we are exporting it.\nFirst, they are largely wrong: virtually all the gas goes into our own UK distribution network.\nBut a significant amount of the crude oil does indeed go to Europe to be refined. This generates export earnings and tax revenues. It also obviates the need of those European refineries to get their crude oil from Russia and the Middle East, removing a source of profound insecurity in our energy mix.\nThe reality is that the opponents of new licences for the north sea are not against oil extraction in principle, or the 200,000 well paid skilled jobs that enable it, they are just opposed to them being British jobs in British waters. They know we will simply have to get the oil and gas from other countries at higher cost.\nThe trump card however, and which renders the opponents case to the realm of ‘bonkers’, is that the carbon emissions created by extraction from our North Sea are vey much lower than the emissions generated by having to import it.\nMercifully, sanity prevailed and the Bill was carried by 293 votes to 211\nThe Loan Charge\nWith the Post Office Horizon scandal fresh in our minds, the Commons debated the Loan Charge yesterday.\nHorizon and the Post Office rumbled on for years with debates and inquiries but did not explode into public consciousness until the recent ITV Drama.\nThe Loan Charge is in that rumbling along stage, having had a limited inquiry and a few debates but, notwithstanding thousands affected and ten suicides, it has yet to make an impression on the public and so, demand political action.\nIt is in all our interests that HM Revenue & Customs pursue ‘disguised remuneration’ schemes which disguise income in order to evade tax.\nMany contractors however, faced with the complications of a particular tax regulation called IR35, were persuaded by employment agencies, employers and accountants to accept payment in the form of a loan. They were assured that this was proper and above board, typically they paid fees of 18% to the provider. They declared the arrangements in their tax returns, unchallenged by HMRC.\nThen years after the event, for tax years now closed, they started to receive huge tax bills, with eye watering additions for interest stretching back over the years.\nTypically, these are people of modest means including many nurses, computer programmers, some were even contractors working at HMRC.\nMuch of the debate last Thursday was taken up with the detail of HMRC’s shocking treatment of its victims and the terrifying experience it can generate.\nThe worst of it however, is that unlike the Horizon scandal, where the Post office and Fujitsu can be blamed, the powers that HMRC are now using were specifically granted for that purpose by the House of Commons itself in the Finance (Number 2) Act 2017. (Exclusive blame lies with the Commons because Finance bills don’t go to the House of Lords for scrutiny).\nA key question that we touched on was, how was it that, when we approved the measure, we didn’t realise the full implications and consequences of what we were about to inflict?\nThe 2017 Loan Charge measure defies the principles of good legislation because, first, it is retrospective in its effect, and second, it denies anyone affected the right to have their case resolved by a tribunal or court: It makes HMRC their sole judge, jury and executioner.\nI have constituents who came to me for help, insisting that they declared all their affairs properly at the time and believed they had paid the tax that was due. HMRC didn’t challenge them or raise any question about what they had clearly set out in their tax returns. Then, using the power to re-open closed tax years retrospectively, HMRC has presented them with demands that they just cannot comprehend, against which they have no right of appeal.\nTheir lives are in turmoil, and they stand to lose everything\nI wonder if it will take a TV drama to resolve\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 5\n- 6\n- 7\n- 8\n- 9\n- …\n- 59\n- Next Page »",

The Government is fully committed to ensuring that older people can live with the dignity and respect they deserve. In April, the State Pension was increased by 10.1 per cent, in line with inflation. As a result, the full yearly amount of the basic State Pension will be over £3,050 higher, in cash terms, than in 2010.\nRegarding your specific concerns, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is required by law to undertake an annual review of benefits and the State Pension. The outcome of this review will be announced in the year following the publication of the relevant indices by the Office for National Statistics, and the new rates will enter into force from April 2024.\nAdditionally, while your concerns about the eligibility requirements of the Cost of Living Payments are noted, the Government is providing substantial support for pensioners through the welfare system.\nAt the Autumn Statement 2022, the Government announced a substantial support package for the most vulnerable for 2023/24, including £300 Cost-of-Living Payments for pensioners; £150 for people on disability benefits; and £900 for people on means-tested benefits, including the 1.4 million pensioners currently in receipt of Pension Credit.\nAlongside this, all households, including pensioner households, will benefit from the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG). This guarantee limits the amount consumers can be charged per unit of gas or electricity. The current price guarantee, set at £3,000, will support households until April 2024. Although energy prices are currently below the level at which EPG payments would be made, it will remain in force until the end of March 2024 to protect households from price spikes, putting in place a safety net for the most vulnerable.\nMoreover, the Government is providing an additional £1 billion of funding to enable the extension of the Household Support Fund (HSF) this financial year, bringing total funding to £2.5 billion. Since its launch in October 2021, the HSF has issued early 26 million awards to those in need of support.\nDS",

Security and deterrence need to meet the severity of the situation.\nWhether we prefer to call it a tide or a swarm, or whatever, we fool ourselves if we think it will abate. On the contrary, there is every indication that it will intensify.\nLast week I visited Syrian refugees encamped in the Beqaa valley in Lebanon. I spoke to one Lebanese mayor whose town is now dwarfed by the refugees camped around it. For many of them this is their 4th year since fleeing home, their savings are exhausted.

So, there will be an even more powerful attraction for those who are able, to make the journey to Europe for a new life.

It announces to your negotiating counterparties that you will accept any deal no matter how bad, and they can adjust their demands accordingly.\nIt is a stupid negotiating strategy.\nSo why are clever politicians urging the Government to adopt it?\nThe same clever politicians have put their names to an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill which requires that Parliament be given the power to reject the deal that the Government has negotiated. This would give Parliament the power to ensure that there is no deal.\nSo, they demand that the Government rule out the possibility of no deal, but they demand that Parliament has the power to ensure that there is no deal.\nThis is truly bizarre.\nThere are three possibilities: perhaps they are not nearly so clever as was thought;\nmaybe they are just being awkward for the sake of it;\nor perhaps some of them really want as bad a deal as can possibly be had, in the desperate hope that the British people will lose their nerve and demand to stay in the EU.\nAfter all, senior EU politicians keep reminding us that we can still change our minds.\nThere are all sorts of campaigns running to try and persuade us to do so, including the ‘Grab Your Granny For Europe Campaign’ which seeks to get young voters to persuade their grandparents to change their minds about leaving the EU.\nAdd to this mix the way that broadcast media present every piece of economic news as part of a gathering Brexit catastrophe, and you realise that ‘project fear’ is still very much alive.\nDid I ever expect them just to accept the referendum result and get on with it?\nNo I didn’t.\nEuropean elites have a record of ignoring referendums.

(92665)\nTabled on: 21 September 2020\nAnswer:\nEdward Argar\nThe Nightingale hospitals are available to support the National Health Service when needed. Local clinical leaders are working to determine how this is done whilst considering the needs of all patients requiring NHS care.\nThe answer was submitted on 07 Oct 2020 at 13:41.\nNow the answer was due several days earlier, so the department clearly needed longer to think about it. Nevertheless, the discerning reader will observe that the answer is pretty opaque, It might mean nothing at all.\nMy purpose in asking the question was this: I want to see the NHS getting back to normal by treating all the other routine and life-threating conditions that are killing us off other than Covid-19 (which, after all, is only killing less than 2% of those of who are dying).\nOne way to achieve this would be to resume normal service in those wards, operating theatres, and hospitals that were converted for exclusive Covid-19 use and to put the Covid-19 patients, as far as possible, in separate units, with the Nightingale hospitals being obvious candidates.\nNow, one of the reasons why the Nightingales were so underused is that they could only accommodate ‘intubated patients’ i.e. patients who are sufficiently unwell to have to have had a tube inserted down their airway and sedated. They would also, as a consequence, be catheterised.\nThe hospitals couldn’t take patients that were not entirely bed-bound because they didn’t have enough lavatories.\nGiven that we’ve had all summer to address the issue I thought I’d ask if we’d taken the opportunity to remedy the matter.

I know too many of them well and they are not unpleasant and aggressive ladies and gentlemen.\nI was myself a whip both in opposition and in Government and over the course of the decades I witnessed the waning of their influence.\nMy whip asks me how I plan to vote rather than telling me. It’s not unreasonable for me to let him know, so that he can at least get the responsible minister to address my reservations and see if he can persuade me with reasonable argument.\nThat one might believe a threat to turn off government largesse in one’s constituency strikes me as highly improbable. Government expenditure just doesn’t work like that. You’d have to be quite gullible to believe any such threat.\nSlightly more plausible would be a threat to stymie your prospects of becoming a minister, or other parliamentary career opportunity, were you flout the whip. Nevertheless, even that threat has diminished over recent years. There was a time when the Party Leader would focus on Cabinet appointments and leave the junior ministerial ranks to the Chief Whip to decide, but those days have gone. Equally, the appointment of so many serial rebels to high office has made nonsense of the notion that promotion is dependent on obedience.\nThe appointment to sit on Commons Select Committees, or to be Chairman of any of them was, until recently, entirely in the gift of party whips, giving them significant patronage and leverage. That however, was reformed under the Cameron premiership and those positions are now elected, removing another potential weapon from the armoury of the whips.\nThere have been other factors at work too which have led to more independence of mind among MPs.\nFirst, the ease of electronic communication has given MPs much more exposure to the opinions and influence of their constituents. It also provides a useful network for like-minded MPs to encourage one another under the radar in any potential rebellion.\nFinally, the opening-up of candidate selection processes to more democratic procedures, such as open primaries, introduced number of MPs who considered that it was more their own personal ‘brand’ rather than their party brand that won the day and, in turn, they exhibited a greater measure of independence. Though they were few in number, their attitude was very infectious.\nThe notion that whipping can influence a leadership challenge is just complete nonsense and it is secrecy makes nonsense of it. Whatever you may tell your whip, or anyone else for that matter, only The Chairman of the 1922 Committee ever knows if you really sent in a letter, and only you yourself will know how you voted in any subsequent ballot.\nIt’s a bit like the constituent who stopped me the other day and told me he’d only vote for me at the next election if I voted for a particular candidate after a leadership challenge. No doubt he trusted me to tell him who I voted for in any such ballot, but how would I ever know that he’d fulfilled his part of the bargain at the next election?\nWith whipping, I think we almost got to the position where, if you want to win, then you’ve got to win the argument.

This has been especially the case over the last year of intermittent lockdown. Some of my correspondents complain to me as if visitors to the Forest are some sort of intrusion into ‘our Forest’, but I can’t blame anyone for wanting to get out of an inner-city or suburban sprawl and spend some time in this magical place – so long as they treat it with the proper care that it deserves and don’t spoil it for everyone else.\nLast summer I had quite a correspondence from constituents who felt that the Forest was being overwhelmed by the number of day trips, litter, BBQs, anti-social behaviour and wild camping as a nation that had been locked-down descended upon us. Whilst some of these problems were exacerbated by the fact that the main official Forest campsites, run by Camping In The Forest, remained closed throughout the year -which will not be the case this year, nevertheless given a release from our current lockdown and great uncertainty about foreign travel, we must expect similar pressures this summer too.\nA great deal was achieved jointly last year by a range of local organisations including the banning the sale of disposable BBQs by 50 local retailers and recruiting 400 voluntary New Forest Ambassadors.\nI am delighted that Forestry England together with The National Park Authority, New Forest District Council and Go New Forest have come together, supported by The Verderers, Hampshire Fire & Rescue and Hampshire Constabulary, to pool their resources and to use the lessons learnt last year in order to produce a plan to protect our unique landscape and encourage greater respect for the area, and to manage the pressures that we will inevitably face this summer.\nThere will be increased high visibility patrolling by Forestry England Rangers including their voluntary rangers, and the National Park rangers too.\nNew Forest Ambassadors will assist with litter removal, report parking violations and promote the New Forest Code – which sets out what people need to do in order to take proper care of the Forest (which you can find it at www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/news/new-forest-code/ )\nThere will be a complete BBQ and fire ban in the New Forest Crown lands and signs will make this clear.\nOften constituents express their frustration to me that they want to help protect the Forest but feel powerless to do so, beyond picking up litter -which many of us do whenever we can.\nWell, consider this: how about becoming a New Forest Ambassador; find out more at www.newforestnpa.gov.uk/communities/get-involved/what-you-can-do-the-new-forest-ambassador-scheme/",

It was early in the morning when I first heard the newscast: was I dreaming it?\nSurely it couldn’t be happening, because I remembered that we had fixed the problem: after years of effort didn’t we change the law to protect the likes of Mr Osborne-Brooks?\nThe Answer is yes.\nFor years in opposition we attempted to get two private members’ bills through and failed, but we managed get the law changed under the coalition government in 2013. That change that we secured enabled anyone finding a burglar in their home to defend themselves, and to be protected from prosecution if they killed or injured the intruder, unless it can be proved that wholly disproportionate force was used.\nSo how come Mr Osborne-Brooks was even arrested?\nClearly, he shouldn’t have been.\nImagine yourself, disturbing a burglar in the dead of night. You hear a noise downstairs, you go to investigate, in the kitchen someone leaps out at you, it’s dark, you can’t see if your attacker is armed, but instinctively you grab the bread knife and take a lunge at him. Unfortunately, your attacker is killed, and subsequently discovered to have been unarmed after all. Have you committed an offence?\nI do not believe that a public prosecutor would go to the expense of proceedings, because there would be no reasonable prospect of a jury being persuaded to convict.\nIf however, your burglar fled and you chased him down the garden path and you stabbed him in the back as he tried to get away. Well, then there might be more of an argument as to whether wholly disproportionate force had been used, a day in court therefore would not be an unreasonable expectation.\nUltimately, whatever the words in the law say, we have to rely on the good sense and judgement of 12 jurors.",

If your counterparty knows that you really won’t be able to walk away, then he can increase his price accordingly.\nThe estimate that I made of the parliamentary proceedings over the last week was that, given the make-up of the Commons, there is very little likelihood of the House accepting our leaving the EU without EU agreement on the terms.\nUnfortunately, the EU Commission will have been watching too and may have drawn the same conclusion",

(That is until Gordon Brown forgot to take his microphone off in his car before making unguarded comments following an encounter when a voter gave him a piece of her mind about immigration).\nIt was a mistake for David Cameron to have issued the debating challenge in the first place, and a measure of Gordon Brown’s desperation that he accepted it.\nIn the 2017 election the debate was a shambles. Notwithstanding Theresa May absenting herself, the same exposure was given to regional parties and those only contesting a few seats, as was given to the main parties contesting every parliamentary division, which was quite absurd.\nMore important, the debates are a constitutional monstrosity: We do not directly elect our prime ministers in the United Kingdom, on the contrary, we elect Parliament. The only voters that will have the Prime Minister’s name on their ballot paper will be those in the one parliamentary constituency out of 650 that he or she is seeking election to represent.\nThe Prime Minister is accountable to Parliament and not directly to the voters. To invest the aspiring PM with head to head debates against potential rivals is to give them the dangerous impression of power and authority that under our constitution they do not, and should not possess.\nIf we really want a presidential style of politics it is perfectly proper for us to entertain changing our constitution to directly elect the PM as Israel has done. There may be constitutional arguments and advantages for doing so, though I doubt it. I would be very reluctant to change because, in my experience, one of the problems parliamentarians have striven to redress over recent years is the relative weakness of Parliament as against the powers wielded by government. Directly electing the head of the government would enhance its power and authority vis a vis Parliament, which is the very opposite of what we have been trying to achieve.\nWe certainly ought not to consider changing our constitutional arrangements to suit media pundits whose primary concern is TV ratings and entertainment, however they might dress it up.",

I am not surprised that, thus far, it has failed to do so.\nAfter the drubbing that both the main parties have just taken\nin the local elections, It strikes me that there are three possibilities as to\nwhat happens next with Brexit:\nFirst, nothing changes, and the parties take no notice of the evident\nfrustration of the voters expressed in the results of last Thursdays polls, by\ncontinuing to reject every compromise, save only that they have voted to\nprevent departure from the EU without any agreement (which, perversely, appears\nto be the most popular option among voters -if my correspondence is any guide).\nSecond, that the EU loses patience and just throws us out at\ntheir next opportunity, Halloween.\nI know that to many this is highly desirable, because it achieves the no-agreement\noutcome above, which Parliament has refused to deliver. In my estimate however,\nit is the most unlikely outcome: We are the EU’s second largest financial\ncontributor, and all that money is surely worth the minor irritation of our\ncontinuing indecision.\nThird, the Government, together with sufficient numbers of opposition MPs,\nencouraged by the sobering effect of the local election results, decide to\nunite around a compromise BREXIT.\nThis will involve a measure of re-alignment: some will brand it as ‘BREXIT in\nname only’ (BRINO) and peel off to join Farage’s BREXIT Party, whilst others,\nopposed to any departure without a further referendum, will join the new Change Britain Party.\nThis third, and most likely of the possibilities, will\ninvolve leaving the EU politically whilst hanging on in there in some form\neconomically. It is bound to mean some close accommodation with the EU customs\nunion and internal market.\nThat isn’t what I want, or what I voted for, but in the hung parliament\ndelivered by the voters in May 2017 it’s probably the best I can get.\nThe opportunity to leave the EU only comers round once every 46 years, I cannot allow it to be fumbled, and lost.\nCould the British people live with it?\nSome, like me, I would be disappointed, but I suspect they would shrug and continue with their busy lives and other priorities. After all, for years they used to say to me “we were hoodwinked in 1975, we were sold a ‘common market’ but it turned out to be a super- state”\nDoes that mean that, shorn of involvement in the super-state and its political institutions, they could live with the EU’s economics?",

An example given was not to say “I went home to visit Mum and Dad” because some people may have two mothers or two fathers.\nI don’t have any statistics, but I suspect that families with two fathers or two mothers are still relatively rare. In all probability, many more families may be less fortunate in only having one parent, be it a father or a mother.\nI cannot imagine how someone with a widow for a mother would be offended by any mention that I visited my father over a weekend. No more so, can I imagine that a fellow with two mothers at home would be upset by such a reference to my father.\nIt is, of course, complete nonsense. Irrespective of our sex and sexual preferences, we are all quite capable and broad-minded enough to chat about what we did at the weekend without our colleagues being upset by references to our mothers and fathers, whether they possess such parents themselves or not.\nWhat this is really about is given away by the earlier part of the instruction namely, to avoid mentioning anyone’s gender. What they seek is the abolition of the concept of fatherhood and motherhood in entirety, replacing it instead with a gender-free concept of parenthood.\nNow, I’ve previously made clear in this column that I consider this concept of separating sex and gender as pretty nutty. Nevertheless, given my preference for freedom of expression, if people want to espouse this nonsense, that is entirely a matter for them. In my opinion they are entitled to believe that there are any number of genders. Just as I am entitled to recognise only two, male and female (whist keeping an open mind about hermaphrodites).\nWhat is increasingly sinister however, is the attempt to bully those of us who reject this new ideology which suggests that life is not unlike a supermarket where you can choose your gender much as you choose a breakfast cereal.\nTelling us we will upset others by using gender specific nouns like mother and father, is clearly an attempt to coerce us into abandoning them. Effectively it is telling us that polite and decent people don’t use those offensive words.\nI’m not normally a conspiracy theorist, but I’ve begun to wonder if there is one.\nWhy is it that this new gender ideology is trying to purge us of everything that we have considered familiar, even normal?\nI don’t know, but I’m working on it.",

Given their bravery and commitment to their native land, I would expect such sanctuary to last as long as the danger itself. Once the opportunity arises (if it does, but it may never) I anticipate that they would want to return to help rebuild their country.\nThere are very many more Afghan men and women who are not in grave danger, nevertheless they have lived difficult lives in a war-torn country, they are about to lose what rights they have and their life chances and opportunities are about to get very much worse. There have been demands in Parliament that we resettle permanently as many of them that wish to come to our shores and are able to escape.\nWith the best will in the world, though we regret their desperate situation, we are in no position to make that unlimited offer.\nAngela Merkel made such an offer in 2015 and the result was one million takers.\nWe ought to help as many as we can, but it does come down to a question of numbers. In the circumstances, our offer to accommodate 20,000 Afghans -especially the most vulnerable women and girls, is proportionate. Particularly so, when our support to other nations in the region which take refugees is taken into account.\nThere are countless places in the world where life is so much less eligible than here in Britain: Countries where there is ghastly oppression, injustice, poverty, warfare, famine and disease. The people of those countries would dearly wish to come to Britain for a better life -and many try to. It is to our credit that we wish we could be more generous in our welcome. I believe that our contribution is better made in development aid deployed to the places from which they seek to escape (that is why I was dismayed by our decision to cut our aid budget, though we remain the world’s second largest donor).\nSome go further and argue that not only should we have a much more generous resettlement scheme, but that -because of our involvement in Afghanistan over 20 years – we are obliged to do so. I do not agree and I revert to the distinction that I have drawn: We do have an obligation to provide sanctuary to those who, by assisting us or by the roles they have played, have put themselves in particular danger. For the wider population, beyond our offer of 20,000 places, our obligation has been met in blood and treasure over 20 years as we sought to bring a measure of security, education, healthcare and economic development to their country.\nI wish that we had completed the job and that we had avoided the huge strategic error of withdrawal.

Even the rest of us, healthy, with longevity increasing every year, might envy the patriarchs who, before the Flood, lived so much longer. Adam was 930 years old and Noah made it to 950.\nI don’t believe that pumping the body full of anti-freeze and storing it in liquid nitrogen is an answer. The science of re-animating a corpse is no more plausible to-day than it was when Mary Shelley published Frankenstein in 1818. The £37,000 cost of preserving the body is a gamble on the prospect of future technology discovering how to bring it back to life, and then to cure it of whatever was the cause of death in the first place. It is not clear when, if ever, sufficient medical priority would be attached to such an endeavour to justify deploying the necessary resources and expertise.\nAside from the question of how one would regulate and police the industry, the danger is that the Judge’s request for government regulation, would of itself confer credibility on the practice, almost as it were officially sanctioned.\nYet the desire to preserve the body is quite normal. The ancients mummified them. Daily, billions of Christians recite the creeds stating explicitly “I believe in the resurrection of the body”. This begs all sorts of questions, including, is it the body in its prime, or old and wrinkly?\nCertainly there was something different about the body of Jesus after the Resurrection: neither Mary Magdalene nor the disciples on the road to Emmaus initially recognised him (even though he bore the stigmata of the crucifixion).\nIn any event, faith in resurrection by divine intervention for an eternal and quite different existence, seems to me a much better prospect than an investment in an inevitably temporary re-animation, even if science can ever deliver it.\nAnyway, irrespective of the judge’s request, I’m sure won’t be regulating it.",

The initial phase in our strategy to deal with Covid-19 was ‘Confine’: to confine it by identifying it through testing, and then quarantining cases and contacts. It was understood however, that this would be temporary and that inevitably it would get out and start spreading in the community. So, the next phase was ‘Delay’: The purpose of delaying the spread was to ease the strain on the NHS by reducing the infection rate until we got to the summer when there would be fewer other winter pressures like flu for hospitals to deal with. We also hoped Covid-19, a coronavirus like flu, would be equally seasonal in its behaviour and abate in the summer.\nThere was no expectation that we would implement extreme measures, rather the advice was to wash your hands frequently and be sensible about social distancing. We anticipated acquiring a herd immunity through the manageable spread of the disease.\nWe witnessed hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed and other countries bringing in draconian lock-downs. Then, modelling by the team from Imperial College London suggested that, if we carried on as we were, 500,000 would die (they have form in vastly over-estimating deaths from other diseases), the Government was spooked, it changed course and ordered the lock-down with all its devastating consequences.\nFlu kills all year round – In the last weeks of July it killed 1000 of us (where Covid-19 killed only 200)- but it is seasonal: it certainly kills a lot more of us in the winter. Equally, we should stop talking about another wave of Covid-19 and instead, like flu, start expecting its annual season.\nHaving peaked in April Covid-19 abated over the summer. Inevitably it will get worse in winter. It may also be worse this winter than might otherwise have been the case. This is because we carried on with a number of restrictions on normal social life during the summer, reducing our ability to acquire and share herd immunity and wasting the opportunity provided by the weakest period for the virus.\nMy contention remains, as I have said many times over the last months, that our over-reaction to the disease has done much more lasting economic damage, and, counter-intuitively, even more damage to our health than the disease itself.\nThe current strategy merely kicks the can down the road. If the measures work and reduce the spread, the virus will simply reappear later.\nOf course, we could be lucky and get a vaccine or a cure, or even ‘moon-shot’ daily tests to enable us to return to normality, but none of these are certain.\nOne day there may be a virus that threatens our whole way of life – but this isn’t it, even if we are behaving as if it were.",

This is a debate between partisans who hold their opinions with a passion that moulds any facts to suit their argument, and I am not immune – but at least I am honest enough to recognise it. I told my audience that they had to wake-up, and invest a serious effort in thinking for themselves about the subject before reaching a decision.\nTo cap it all, facts change: the world is changing, and the EU is changing dramatically too. None of us can predict what it will be like to remain in a changing EU, any more than we can predict what it will be like as an independent nation in a changing world. There are risks with either course of action. The key difference is that as an independent nation we will be able to decide how to respond to risks and inevitable change in our own national interest, rather than have those responses determined for us in Brussels.",

Alongside providing £10 billion a year to support people through our overseas aid, the UK is a global leader in refugee resettlement. As a country, between 2016 and 2019 we resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any member state of the EU.\nLet me assure you that the new Nationality and Borders Bill will allow the UK continue to resettle genuine refugees directly from places of danger and offer refugee family reunions. It will improve support for refugees to help them build their life in the UK, integrate and become self-sufficient members of society. The Bill also seeks to introduce a new temporary protection status for those who do not come directly to the UK or claim asylum without delay once here but who have, in any event, been recognised as requiring protection.\nI have always believed that resettlement is vital as a safe and legal pathway to protection for vulnerable refugees fleeing persecution. It is right that the Government continues to offer safe pathways for those in need, and I will continue to ensure that this is the case. The launch of a new global UK Resettlement Scheme will now build on the success of previous schemes and continue our proud record of resettling refugees who need our help from around the world.\nIt is also the case that refugees in the UK need to have the freedom to succeed as they settle. This means ensuring refugees have access to the tools required to become fully independent and provide for themselves and their families. This will allow refugees to be in a position to contribute and integrate into the economic and cultural life of the UK.\nIt is therefore good news that the Home Secretary has announced £14 million of funding to help newly granted refugees to integrate in the UK. This fund will pilot new approaches across the country to support newly granted refugees to learn English, move into work, access housing and build links in their local communities. Lessons learned from these pilots will inform future support available to all refugees.\nDS.",

My solidarity however, is for the vast majority of our police who have a very difficult balance to strike and end up being seriously injured for taking the trouble.\nValues and standards change, and every generation has the right to reappraise the actions and attitudes of its predecessors, and that this might even extend to the removal of monuments if that is done by consent and lawful means.\nWhat is completely unacceptable is to have people taking things into their own hands.\nThere is a proper democratically controlled planning process for the removal of listed monuments and changing the name of a street requires the formal consent of two-thirds of local taxpayers who reside in it.\nIt is a measure of the mindlessness of the mob that they take out their anger on monuments rather than put their energy into addressing, through our democratic system, the injustice of which they complain. The truth is that these anarchists have no interest in consent and democratic politics, like the fascists from whom they differ so little, they want to impose mob rule without consent.\nThe attacks on the Cenotaph and on the statue of Sir Winston Churchill show that the mobs are determined to outrage public opinion.\nOur history over centuries is bound to have thrown up both great achievements and terrible horror stories. As Historic England puts It\n“We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations. They had different perspectives, different understandings of right and wrong. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come.”\nI’d put it a little stronger: seeking to erase the past in this way is no better than Daesh when it destroyed the standing Buddhas in Afghanistan, and ancient ruins of Palmyra in Syria.\nIf we followed the absurd mindset of the mobs we’d erase every remaining trace of Roman civilisation in the our Island and the Egyptians would tear down the pyramids.\nSome of the emails to me have been so despondent about mob behaviour that I have had to try and cheer them up.

Clearly, the very welcome measures that he announced in the House of Commons last week had been in the planning pipeline for some time.\nIn addition to the UK police presence that he has already established in France he announced – a new joint operational command in the Channel, bringing together our military, Border Force, and National Crime Agency -with doubled funding and 700 more staff for the job. -More staff too to free-up immigration officers for enforcement, including many more raids on illegal workplaces. -An end to the scandal of £5.5 million per day spent on hotels, with the acquisition of alternative accommodation for 10,000 in surplus military sites and similar facilities. -Doubling the number of asylum caseworkers and re-engineering the processes to triple productivity, so that claims can be processed in just days and weeks. -Embedding UK Border Force in Albania. Issuing new guidance and staffing a new 400 strong specialist Albania unit, so that we reject almost 100% of Albanian asylum claims (and to legislate if this is challenged in the courts) -Amending the Modern Slavery Act to significantly raise the evidence threshold for individuals to be considered a victim -Restarting the Rwanda project which the courts have now said it is lawful -Further law reform to prevent the courts being used to frustrate removals for months and to legislate to make it lawful to remove anyone here illegally.

It had no chance of success, but it was important for a substantial number of us to put down a marker. The Convention was largely the UK’s own creation and was designed as a bulwark to prevent Europe slipping back into dictatorship after the Second World War. Nevertheless, as I have said in this column previously, it has long outlived its usefulness and extended it reach beyond what was ever intended. Ministers are confident that they can achieve control of our borders without leaving the ECHR, but they were confident about that before. We need to keep withdrawal on the table.There is however, another side to this entire problem.\nScores of millions of people are displaced, they are fleeing conflict, poverty, climate and lack of economic opportunity. Who can blame people born into these circumstances from wanting to seek a better life elsewhere. If we are serious about reducing the temptations that draw them to our own shores, then we have to invest in economic opportunities in the places from which they are coming: In the end international development aid has to be all about creating jobs. In the early nineteen-seventies the wealthy nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their annual income on development aid. Very few have ever delivered their pledge. We were the largest economy to do so, but only from 2011-2019. Had all the pledging nations lived up to their commitments that they made so long ago, perhaps the World would not be facing the huge numbers of refugees that are now overwhelming the international treaties and conventions that were originally put in place to deal with far fewer of them.",

Naturally their focus has been Calais: Constituents have demanded that we send in the Army – oblivious to the fact that we ceased to rule Calais on 7th January 1558, when it fell to the French.\nSome estimates suggest that as many as 1% of the refugees who have entered Europe this year, have now reached Calais. I think we are right to demand tighter security and to protect our border. We do however, need to maintain a sense of proportion. Consider that this year Germany will have to accommodate as many as half a million refugees. The problem for Germany, and much of continental Europe is the Schengen Agreement to which most EU countries are signatories (but very wisely we didn’t sign-up to). The agreement removes internal borders between the signatories. This is convenient for travellers who need not be delayed by passport controls within the Schengen area. It does however, mean that once a migrant has secured entry to a Schengen state, they can then travel unchecked to any other. The very large numbers now arriving in Italy and Greece will make their way to Calais, where at least we have a chance of halting their onward progress, and to Germany where there is no such chance.\nShouldn’t we take our fair share?\nIsn’t there a case for all European nations dividing up the burden?\nI have every sympathy for desperate plight that has driven so many people to such dangerous measures in their flight to Europe. To accommodate them however, will encourage potentially millions more to follow in their footsteps.\nWe have put our money where our Mouth is: we have committed £900 million in relief for those affected by war in Syria. Our money goes much further in providing shelter and assistance in the region than it possibly could in Europe. Our contribution is addressing the problem at its source.\nIf other wealthy nations followed our lead the flow of refugees would be reduced accordingly.\nIt is both fair and essential that we hold the line at Calais.",

Given that consumer spending drives almost two thirds of our economic activity, denting that confidence can have a severe impact. It is most certainly responsible for the very thin time that our high streets have been experiencing recently, with retail sales actually falling. The same depressing trend is evident in figures for recent mortgage approvals. These figures will be seized upon as vindication by those who predicted the Brexit ‘economic shock’.\nConsumers are taking a hit because prices are rising; and prices are rising because of the devaluation of the pound which will, of course, be presented as a consequence of Brexit. It isn’t. Rather it is a consequence of the huge and growing trade deficit that we have been running over recent years – at almost 10% of our national product. What is more, we desperately needed this devaluation to correct the imbalance in our economy. It will move us back towards a trade equilibrium by making our exports more competitive whilst choking off some of our seemingly insatiable demand for imports.\nWhilst the higher prices hurt consumers in the short term, they are nevertheless a necessary correction for the long term health of our economy.\nThe world economy is in desperate need of the flexibility we have recently achieved, because currency exchange rates have become increasingly sticky – almost fixed. There are countries – not least in parts of Europe – desperate for a devaluation similar to one that we have seen, in order to rescue themselves from becoming more and more uncompetitive. If Brexit could be blamed for Sterling’s devaluation, it would be a boon to the world economy and not a threat.\nWe will become accustomed to every economic development being presented in the worst possible light – and blamed on Brexit.",

This cannot be achieved unless we have some control over EU migration, and we don’t have any at all. That is why the Prime Minister made such a big deal about seeking such control in his effort to re-negotiate our membership terms.\nHe came back virtually empty handed. What he got was not control of migrant numbers, but rather the possibility of some temporary reduction in their benefit entitlements described as an ‘emergency brake’. The PM believes that the prospect of reduced benefit entitlement will, in turn, reduce the desire of EU migrants to move to the UK. I just don’t believe it. They come here for jobs not for benefits. Europe is in a semi-permanent self-inflicted recession caused by its disastrous experiment with a single currency. Britain has been booming. The imperative to move to the UK to get a job is not going to diminish.\nWhat is particularly insulting about the so called emergency brake, is that it is not under UK control.

I leave aside its accompanying Political Declaration which is still incomplete, and in any event is just a wish list with no greater legal status than my letter to Santa.\nWe will leave on 29 March and nothing will change whatsoever, we will remain subject to all EU law and jurisdiction, save that we will no longer have any role in the framing of the law and regulation by which we must abide. This will be for a two-year ‘transition’.\nHaving waited over 40 years to leave the EU, I can live with a couple more, even at risk of temporary new burdensome laws over which we have no control.From the outset, the Agreement binds us into a financial payment over years costing some £40 Billion, the exact sum being determined by processes ultimately under EU control.\nSet against annual payments in perpetuity, were we to remain members, this is a bargain.So far, so good?\nWell, at least tolerable?It is during the 2-year ‘transition’ that our future trading relationship will be negotiated. The difficulty is that even before the negotiation opens we have played our strongest card by already binding ourselves into the financial settlement.\nHistorically, EU trade negotiations have taken a long time. These ones have a further complicating factor: they must deliver a solution that obviates the need for a ‘hard’ border between Eire and Northern Ireland.\nIf that solution has not been agreed before the end of the transition then one of two things must occur:\nEither the transition must be extended indefinitely with all its costs, restrictions and obligations.\nOr, the UK must remain in the EU customs union, and additionally Northern Ireland will effectively remain within the EU internal market. In this scenario, the only way we could preserve the integrity of the UK and avoid border checks on goods going from the mainland to Northern Ireland, would be for ourselves to abide by the EU internal market regulations.These arrangements might continue forever, because the withdrawal agreement hands a veto over ending them to the EU. It is extraordinary that we should place our future in the hands of the EU in such a binding way, with no other way out.\nWe are reliant entirely on their good faith, but they will have us exactly where they want us: unable to implement international trade agreements elsewhere; unable to develop competitive advantage; they will have free access to our markets; continuing to benefit from our financial contributions; and they will have us under their jurisdiction without any of our tiresome objections to new regulation, harmonisation and integration.\nWhat possible incentive will they have to release us from this trap into which we will have so willingly walked?\nThe terms of any future relationship would have to be so heavily one-sided in order to give them any inducement to do so.\nWe will have bound ourselves by international treaty law without escape.",

Overwhelmingly they remain private contractors who provide their services to the NHS. Strangely enough, when the wartime coalition government was making plans to set up the NHS, it envisaged nationalising the GPs (by making them paid NHS employees rather than private contractors) and leaving hospitals as the independent bodies that they then were. When the post war legislation was introduced however, they did it the other way round, by nationalising the hospitals and leaving GPs as private contractors.\nWhen people write to me demanding an end to all privitisation in the NHS and requiring all services to be exclusively provided by the state, I reply by asking if they really want their GP to be nationalised?\nThe GP is the gate-keeper to other NHS services. Before your GP even begins an examination of the ailment that has brought you to the surgery, she -or he- starts will all sorts of knowledge about you, your family, and your medical history. So, she is ideally placed to decide how serious your condition is and whether you need to be referred to a specialist.\nThe problem is that this strength has been eroded over the last few decades as more of the NHS resources have been invested in hospitals at the expense of general practice. Too many GPs are leaving the profession at a time when rising patient numbers, and the complex needs of an aging population, mean that the demands for their services are growing exponentially. There is however, a plan to address the problem:\n- More funding –an extra £2.4 billion annually for general practice to increase to over £12 billion a year by 2020/21 (a 14% increase in real terms). Last year the first £507 million of this growth was delivered.\n- Providing a new affordable professional indemnity system for GPs and their staff against clinical negligence risks\n- Increasing recruitment – record numbers of medical graduates are choosing general practice and the supply of medical students is being increased by a record 25% – 1,500 more medical school places every year, focussed on producing family doctors.\nLast month, the Care Quality Commission gave a positive verdict on the state of General Practice in England: Nearly 90% of practices received ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ ratings, whilst of the rest with lower ratings, the overwhelming majority of them are improving.\nThere is however, something more that needs to be done. Only a quarter of GPs have had any formal training in mental health, of those that have, it has been in psychiatry of an advanced sort that is well beyond the more commonplace conditions that are now presenting in terms of anxiety and depression. Addressing this omission, I believe, should be a matter of urgency.",

How was it that I opposed those measures only to become the champion of the Equal Marriage Act, the Lord Commissioner responsible for whipping it through all its stages in the Commons.\nLong term readers of this column would have witnessed that transformation as it took place in these blogs. I call it a transformation not an evolution, because it was sudden.\nI put my original prejudice down to intellectual laziness. I simply never challenged, or even thought about the views that I held. Furthermore, when I received a very large correspondence in support of my position and against the liberalising measures that we were debating, it was so much easier to simply reply by stating that I agreed with them, rather than investing any intellectual effort in the matter.\nMy mind changed when the Government presented Parliament with the Sexual Orientation Regulations. The purpose of this measure was to prevent the providers of any commercial service from discriminating against a potential client on the basis their sexuality.\nIt prompted a huge lobbying campaign by certain elements of organised religion. I received hundreds of letters, most of them containing the same example: a Christian couple running a B&B would be required by regulation to accept as guests a gay couple, notwithstanding the offence to their deeply held religious beliefs.\nIn a flash of enlightenment the question occurred to me ‘ what Gospel is it they could possibly have been reading?’\nHow on earth could they imagine that, were Our Lord the landlord, that he would have turned the quests away?\nHaving made that leap, I then put time and effort into studying the Scriptures. The result of which study I put to use when the controversy arose when the Equal Marriage Bill was before Parliament. I published a number of defences of the Bill from a biblical perspective. One of which, entitled Too Much Leviticus, was even written-up in The Guardian in a column by Chris Bryant MP (a former Vicar) and which prompted an attempt by a national evangelical association to reclaim me for the ‘truth’. It resulted in a very unpleasant meeting, the only one in which I’ve ever had to ask my guests to leave.\nIt is easy to forget the virulence and bitterness of the Campaign against the Bill. My stance led to a significant number of resignations from my political association. I was assured that I was destroying marriage, to which I responded that the marriages to which they were objecting would be occasions of joy and celebration to the participants, their friends and relatives, but wouldn’t make a blind bit of difference to anyone else.\nEvents have proved me right: marriage has survived and, I believe, it has been strengthened.\nThere are examples of politicians having radically revised their opinions.

For centuries we managed without one. I do not claim to be an objective observer: I believe that the enterprise was misconceived, particularly when it comes to political questions.\nThe USA needs a supreme court because it has a legal, written constitution. This includes a defined separation of powers between the executive branch (the President) and the legislature (the Congress).\nThe UK however, has a completely different settlement. Our constitution is predominantly political and the executive (government ministers) themselves are members of Parliament just like any other member of the legislature. The executive and legislature don’t enjoy separate electoral mandates, and their functions are all mixed-up together.\nThe Supreme court is guilty of grabbing power that has hitherto been reserved to Parliament: the power to deliberate over what happens in Parliament. In doing so, it breaches a much older piece of constitutional legislation, the Bill of Rights 1689, which denies any court the right to question proceedings in Parliament.\nThe new principle that the Court has established is that it has the power to determine whether a prorogation is lawful, on the basis of judging it on a test of reasonableness. That test will include the length of the prorogation, the ‘temperature’ of the political climate (how pressing the great issues of the day are), and the legislation that would be lost if Parliament is prorogued.\nAll of these are ‘proceedings in Parliament’.\nThe court has intruded into our elected Parliament’s business.\nParliament had notice that the Government intended to prorogue it. It was open to the Commons, assisted by Mr Speaker, to debate motions against prorogation, or to stop it dead by carrying a motion of no confidence.\nIt chose to do neither.\nThe Court’s intrusion is indeed a coup against the proper role of Parliament.\nThe President of the Court, Lady Hale, insists that the ruling has nothing to do with BREXIT, which is a measure of her naiveite. It is all about BREXIT. Their own judgement finds that, despite what the PM said about a new Queen’s Speech, he really sought to avoid scrutiny -over BREXIT.\nThe Court has stepped right into our greatest political row for decades: Parliament’s unwillingness to allow the Government to deliver BREXIT in accordance with the decision of the referendum.\nIn vain the 11 justices insist that theirs is a legal and not a political judgement, but they have intruded into the greatest political issue of our time.\nThey are guilty as charged.",

I recall the Milky Bar kid whose sales pitch was that the Milky Bars were on him, a statement that would be unlikely to get past modern advertising standards.\nThe real difference is that so many children do so much less exercise than we did in the past.\nOne in five children starts primary school already too fat, but we will have that child in full-time compulsory education for 13 years, for 35 weeks per year, for 7 hours per day: the lack of productivity is staggering if we cannot organise their day so as to ensure that they come out thinner than they arrived.\nIf we lack the political will to make schools the engine of a healthier lifestyle, I doubt that advertising bans will ever make up for it.",

The critics need to consider carefully what the Prime Minister actually said, because their critiques so often attack something that he didn’t say. Mr Cameron made no general criticism of Muslims or their communities. On the contrary, his remarks were directed specifically and forensically. So, if the cap fits….\nWhat I have found very encouraging over the last year or so, is the growing strength of the reaction within Islam in opposition to the extremists. A fortnight ago UK parliamentarians were privileged to hear the Grand Mufti of Alhazar, the most prestigious seat of Sunni Islamic scholarship, lecture on the how the Ideology of the violent extremists is incompatible with the proper interpretation of Islam. There is now a determined, even evangelical, effort underway within our Muslim communities to challenge and reverse the influence of extremism.\nMinhaj-ul-Quran has just launched the first Islamic curriculum on peace and counter-terrorism and young Muslim activists are being trained to take on the extremist ideologies in their communities.\nWhat the Prime Minister was rightly drawing attention to, are those within Islam who, whilst not preaching violence themselves, never the less foster an environment where it can develop. I believe that this falls largely into two categories. First, those who place the blame for radicalisation squarely on the perceived injustice of our own foreign policy and its effects in Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan. By blaming Western interventions in the Middle East – however, fair, or unfairly – they take their eye off the growing cancer that is preaching another bout of hatred and death as the solution to all the region’s problems.\nSecond, those elements within Islam, whilst not themselves advocating violence as a remedy, never the less regard western values, including democracy, as inherently un-Islamic and therefore seek to seal off their communities from all the cultural influences to which our life-style exposes them. This gives rise to confusion about identity especially amongst the young, and creates the environment in which distrust and suspicion develops into hatred and violent intent.\nThe Prime Minister was entirely correct in pointing out that this conflict is within Islam, and a very small minority at that, even if its consequences are disproportionate and disastrous.\nThere is a very different analysis: I continue to receive internet inspired hate email which paints the rise of violent extremism as a war of all Muslims against Christianity, the so called clash of civilisations. This really is such utter nonsense and contrary all our experience. Whilst it is true that the consequences of the war in Syria, and its spill-over into Iraq, has been catastrophic for Christian minorities, its principal victims are fellow Muslims. This is a war within Islam. It is precisely for this reason that voices within Islam must be at the forefront of the effort to vanquish the ideology that promotes war and death as the vehicle for propagating religion. The Prime Minister was right to point out that those Muslims who are refusing to engage in this vital effort, are themselves complicit in the consequences that arise from their failure to do so.",

The volume of sewage and other pollution being discharged into our waters is completely unacceptable. The Government’s Plan for Water, published earlier this year, sets out more investment, stronger regulation and tougher enforcement to tackle every source of pollution.\nAs part of the plan, over £2.2 billion of investment has been accelerated. This will be directed into vital infrastructure to improve water quality and secure future supplies, with £1.7 billion of this to tackle storm overflows. Ministers have set stringent targets for water companies to reduce storm overflows, driving the largest infrastructure programme in water company history of £60 billion over 25 years. This is a credible plan which includes front-loading action in particularly important and sensitive sites, including bathing waters.\nRegarding regulation, Ministers are driving up monitoring and transparency. Monitoring of storm overflows has increased substantially, from only 7 per cent in 2010 to 91 per cent now, and companies are on track to reach 100 per cent by the end of the year. It is precisely because of this monitoring that action can be taken to fix storm overflows and hold water companies to account. The Government is clear that water companies must not profit from environmental damage and Ofwat has been given increased powers under the Environment Act 2021 to hold them to account for poor performance. In March, Ofwat announced new powers that will enable it to take enforcement actions against water companies that do not link dividend payments to performance for both customers and the environment.\nIn July, Ministers introduced laws to remove the £250,000 cap on penalties that can be handed out by environmental regulators, as well as significantly broaden their scope to target a much wider range of offences. This will ensure that regulators have the right tools to drive compliance across a range of sectors, including water companies. Fines from water companies are being reinvested into the new Water Restoration Fund, which will deliver on-the-ground improvements to water quality and support local groups and community-led schemes which help to protect our waterways.\nFurther, the Environment Agency has launched the largest criminal investigation into unpermitted water company sewage discharges ever at over 2,200 treatment works. Environment Agency funding is closely monitored to ensure that it can carry out its duties and functions effectively. Its funding for inspections comes directly from the permits issued to companies; enforcement is funded by government, and in the current Spending Review period, the Environment Agency’s environment RDEL (Resource) grant for 2022/23 increased to £96 million from £56 million in 2020/21.\nThese measures and others are making progress and Ministers will continue to make further improvements where necessary. Our bathing waters continue to improve, with 93 per cent classified as good or excellent in 2022 compared to 76 per cent in 2010. There is now 80 per cent less phosphorus and 85 per cent less ammonia in our rivers compared to 1990 when water was privatised.\nDS",

There were a couple of left wing media commentators who were really quite hurt to be called ‘Tory scum’. When they hurled more than just abuse their aim was often no more accurate: Boris Johnson had the best line, demanding the reintroduction of ball games in schools to revive these essential skills, given that the mob had missed him with every projectile that they had thrown.\nOn that basis perhaps Colm Lock’s egg was just a luck strike. Nevertheless, he can be justifiably proud of it.

Perhaps the only real difference with politics is that such defeats are attended with the glare of publicity.\n*\nIronically, another group of politicians for whom I have a great deal of sympathy are the thirty or so Labour front-benchers who slogged it through the hard years in opposition, only to find that they have not been rewarded with a position in government.\nOpposition is a thankless task for a shadow minister, you are on your own marking your government opposite number, but without the special advisers and civil service back-up that your minister enjoys. You will spend your weekends travelling, at your own expense, to make a speech somewhere in the vain hope that someone is going to take any notice of what you have to say. I know, I did twelve years of it. To have done it faithfully, but not to have been rewarded with a government red box, will be a bitter pill to swallow.\nUndoubtedly, managing those the bruised egos will be a significant headache for the Labour whips, in addition to managing the expectations of their very large majority, many of whom may be rather unrealistic about their own prospects of achieving ministerial office any time soon.\nI suspect that the Government whips office will do what they did with their large majority in 1997. They simply won’t need them all to get their business through the Commons. So, they will be able to run shifts, allowing many to spend more time in their constituencies building up a reputation for being helpful, rather than plotting, airing grievances and frustrations in the Members’ Tea Room.\nAs to how it will all turn out, its far too soon to tell.",

Of course, the Runcorn by-election and the Local Elections on Thursday have created a greater urgency and accelerated this email correspondence over the last 48 hours.\nThe difficulty is that no such arrangement is on offer. On current performance, Reform is convinced that it can beat Labour without any pact with the Tories.\nEqually, for the Tories, nothing ever turns out to be as bad as first reported. It will take time to see if the Conservative Party can recover its reputation for competence and with that, its electoral support. Tories will want to watch as Reform has to survive the much greater level of media scrutiny that will now accompany its electoral success. The life of this Parliament will be a marathon and not a sprint: it is far too soon to make predictions as to how things will progress and what will be he impact of, as yet unknown events.\nNevertheless, when the next general election is much closer, if the polling and the way that political landscape has developed suggests that minority support for a further term of Labour government is likely to prevail, then both Reform and the Conservatives may review the question of an electoral pact as the lesser of two evils.\nA number of difficulties will arise for any such endeavour.\nThere can be no doubt that Nigel Farage has been one of the most influential politicians of my lifetime. He was once an enthusiastic Conservative, a devotee of Sir Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher. Yet he became convinced that the Conservatives would never be persuaded to leave the EU and for that reason would need to be destroyed and replaced. Inevitably, this history makes for a relatively difficult reconciliation.\nNext, as Reform has advanced at the expense of Conservative support, it has increasingly turned its attention to the battle to win support from former Labour voters. As it has done so, its rhetoric and policy is becoming more remote from the free market economics that are core beliefs of ‘Thatcherite’ Conservatives, and which were once Farage’s original inspiration.\nThird, Reform is determined to implement proportional representation which is anathema to Tories, who believe that it will perpetuate continental style coalition government.\nFinally, Farage is someone that many Conservatives detest. He has been an apologist for both Putin and also for some of the most egregious behaviour of Donald Trump.\nDetestation, however, is still negotiable and ultimately, expediency will prevail.\nA view will be taken on the basis of an electoral calculation of the consequences of not negotiating a pact. Until that time, both Conservatives and Reform, will be each hoping that their fortunes and the turn of events will enable them to avoid having to consider it.\nIt is just far too soon to be led by an over-excited press, to be speculating about it.",

Virtually every enterprise that I visit or speak to is under-recruited, they just can’t get the staff that they need.\nSo often in their response, like the Confederation of British Industry, they demand increased immigration to deliver the workers that they need.\nAs a small and crowded island that saw net migration rise to half a million in the year to June 2022, we cannot just go on importing the next generation of workers. An imported workforce comes with additional housing needs and demands on public services. We have to moderate our addiction to foreign workers, now even Labour says so.\nThere are now 630,000 more economically inactive adults of working age than before the pandemic. The Chancellor had the right priority when he announced last week that he is to fund the department of Work and Pensions to require hundreds of thousands more benefit claimants to meet a work coach to get the support they need to increase the hours that they work.\nI am an elected member of the Commons Work & Pensions Select Committee and when I’ve asked witnesses about the cause of the reduced workforce, I’m told that long-term sickness has increased because of the inability of the NHS to deliver the necessary healthcare. I’m sceptical: in the past work-related sickness was overwhelmingly musculoskeletal, but now it is stress and anxiety related. These conditions, however debilitating, are quite treatable. After all, work is good for mental health and self-esteem.\nGiven that I represent a constituency with one of the highest age profiles I was particularly interested in data that Phoenix Insights, a longevity think tank has shared with me. Their polling casts doubt on the suggestion that poor healthcare is a cause of economic inactivity. Of the 50 to 64-year-olds who have left the workforce since the pandemic, only 16% gave long-term sickness or disability as their reason for doing so. The main reason they gave was that they didn’t want to work any longer. In fact, 70% of those who left work in their early fifties said that they did not want to go back to work.\nInterestingly, we appear to have a more negative attitude to work that in the USA or Germany: 58% of workers in the UK liked their job, compared to 74% in the USA and 73% in Germany. 40% of workers in the UK said that the coronavirus pandemic made them rethink how they view working, compared to only 28% in the US and 30% in Germany\nI have misgivings about increasing benefits when real wages are falling. Perhaps cost-of-living pressures may still exert pressure to return to work, but I think there is a message in these statistics for employers too: quality of life in the workplace is going to be a key element in recruitment",

The danger arising from this ‘mission creep’ is that we will find it ever harder to escape from lockdown at all, with evermore devastating economic and social consequences.\nLast September I raised the issue of ‘false positives’ in the Commons with the Secretary of State. I was not satisfied with his answer (see my blog https://www.desmondswaynemp.com/ds-blog/false-positives/ ). Now however, given the shift in policy towards a target of reduced infections, typically being touted at below 1000 new cases daily as the condition for lifting lockdown, the issue of false positives will loom ever larger.\nI have seen estimates for false positives ranging between 1% and 6% over the last year. The Secretary of State told us it was 1%. Inevitably, it will vary dependent upon the type of test and the different laboratories processing results.\nLet’s be really conservative however, and take the published false positives figure for the lateral flow test at a mere 0.32%.\nNow, imagine that Covid-19 died out overnight -it completely disappeared off the face of the earth.\nNevertheless, with 500,000 or so tests carried out the next day we would still detect 1,600 new cases from the false positives and consequently refuse to lift the lockdown.\nIt gets worse because the ambition is to increase the level of testing tenfold in project ‘Moonshot’ , so the false positives will take us ever further from the desired level of infections.\nThe same principle will apply to any target based on the level of deaths from Covid-19, because all hospital cases are tested on admission and weekly thereafter.\nThe only sensible discussion of ‘acceptable’ death rates from Covid-19 would have to be based on a ‘tolerable’ excess over the current winter deaths from all respiratory conditions which, pre Covid-19, was typically 300 per day. Any question of tolerable death levels, is sensitive one, which is why it is essential to stick with a daily level of hospital admissions with which the NHS can deal effectively.\nSo don’t move the goal posts.\n(I am indebted to Professor Anthony Brookes of The Department of Genetics & Genome Biology at University of Leicester)",

No doubt many are. Together with the driven ideologues, are the touchingly naïve, who believe that everything can be free and that someone else will pay for it: ‘useful idiots’ as Lenin characterised them.\nWhen I actually found myself caught up in one such demonstration, in effect –and however unwillingly- becoming part of it, the mob reminded me, not so much of the Bolsheviks of 1917, as the sans culottes of 1789, such was their venom and anger.

A growing proportion of our population are coming into that category described as the ‘just about managing’. Many cannot lay their hands to a spare fifty quid at the end of the month. Rather than savings, so many have mounting debts.\nThe danger to democracy, and which ancient Greece foresaw, is that those who have nothing, will be prepared to risk everything.\nWhen some new political messiah comes on stage like a rock-star and promising the earth, including the ‘aspiration’ of writing off all your debts, why not take a punt on him, if you have nothing to lose?\nThe mobs demonstrating in Whitehall, purporting to speak for the survivors of Grenfell tower, the underpaid public sector workers, or whomsoever else, should serve as an warning to those of us who believe in free enterprise, that we need to put the issue of how we extend the benefits that flow from growth and free markets at the very top of our priorities.

The National Centre for the 3Rs (NC3Rs) is the UK’s leading scientific based organisation dedicated to replacing, refining, and reducing the use of animals in scientific research and testing. The NC3Rs supports the research community to use the latest science and technology to replace animal studies, providing new approaches for biomedical research, and avoiding the time and cost associated with animal models.\nWithout animal testing it is highly likely that a large number of potentially dangerous new medicines would be tested in healthy volunteers and patients in clinical trials. This would be completely unacceptable. That said, the Government’s commitment to the development of non-animal technologies is positive. Such technologies have the potential to reduce the reliance on the use of animals, improve the efficiency of drug research and development, and deliver safer, cheaper, and more effective medicines to patients. Ministers have also stressed that they continue to actively support and fund the development and dissemination of techniques that replace, reduce, and refine the use of animals in research.\nWith regard to your concerns about the wearing of bearskin caps Guardsmen take great pride in wearing the bearskin cap, which is an iconic image of Britain, and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is very sparing in the acquisitions that it makes. Individual soldiers do not possess their own hats, rather they are cared for and shared within the Household Division and, despite their constant use, every effort is made to carefully prolong the longevity of each ceremonial cap. On account of this, they usually last for more than a decade, with some having been in use for as long as 60 years.\nThe MOD would like to find an alternative material to bearskin should one prove acceptable. This is a commitment the MOD takes very seriously. The MOD have not to date seen evidence that a suitable faux fur product exists to be considered as an alternative. Until that material is sourced and proven, the UK goes to great lengths to ensure that the pelts that make the King’s Guards caps are procured in the most responsible way possible.\nBears are never hunted to order for the MOD.

Through the Bill, the Government will deliver on the manifesto commitment to introduce a ban on keeping them as pets, ensuring that all primates being kept privately in England are kept at zoo-level standards and that ownership of primates at levels below these standards is phased out.\nI also understand that live animals can endure excessively long journeys during export, causing distress and injury. EU rules prevented any changes to these journeys, but the UK Government is now able to pursue plans to ban the export of live animals for slaughter and fattening. This Bill will ensure that the UK is the first European country to end this practice.\nThe Bill will tackle the unethical trade of puppy smuggling by reducing the number of pets, including dogs, cats and ferrets, that can travel under pet travel rules. The Bill will also provide powers for the Government to bring in further restrictions on the movement of pets on welfare grounds, and allow for enforcement measures to support these restrictions.

On the other hand those two cheery souls might find a more useful outlet for their energy. It also brings out behaviour of the worst sort as evidenced by the hoarders who have cleared supermarket shelves.\nMuch of the advice that constituents offer me, is given in the expectation that I will pass it on to ministers, and I have done so, but forgive me for choosing not always to do so. For example, I thought that rather too much information was offered by the fellow who emailed me instructions on how to get-by without loo paper, and I’ve kept that one to myself.\nQuite a few have emailed me to say that the entire strategy is misguided: that only the elderly, weak and vulnerable should have been asked to isolate themselves, the rest of us should have carried on as normal and accepted a ‘tolerable’ death-rate in exactly the same way that we do with flu, which kills thousands every year. Instead, we have chosen to bring the economy to a full stop. These views are not a million miles from those that I expressed myself just a fortnight ago.\nWhat changed perceptions so dramatically was the statistical analysis by Imperial College London of what is happening in Italy, where an advanced modern healthcare system has been completely overwhelmed. The study predicted that a laissez faire approach here,would result in half a million deaths and even with the imposition of much more stringent social controls, the NHS will still be overwhelmed with demands for intensive care and ventilation well beyond its capability.\nThat scenario begs the question of whether there ever really was a sustainable choice available that could have sought to place a higher priority on keeping the economy thriving, above minimising the impact of the virus. Frankly, as admissions spiralled, scenes of mayhem at hospitals were reported on TV (and they will be) and the death toll mounted, then people would have started to isolate themselves entirely voluntarily and the economy would have closed itself down anyway -but in a much more disorderly and damaging fashion.\n*\nThe prospect of being cooped-up for an indeterminate period is not an inviting one.

I believe that we know best what our priorities are and how to pursue them, we need to be allowed to keep more of what we earn in order to do exactly that. The quid pro quo however, is that the state does less and takes less from us, but nobody appears to keen to engage in this important element of the debate.\nIf the burden of taxation is too high and we want to reduce it, then clearly there must be a commensurate reduction in government expenditure equal to the reduction in taxation. Either that, or we borrow the difference in the expectation that our children’s generation will pay off our debts – assuming, of course, that financial markets would continue to lend to such profligate borrowers.\nThe counterargument is that tax cuts will pay for themselves by stimulating economic activity so that the economy grows and generates greater tax revenues. I accept entirely that there are circumstances in which this will be the case, particularly where the tax cuts are aimed at stimulating investment to increase productivity. The danger lies in the time that it will take for this stimulus to take effect.\nSo, is the UK economy in a state that we can contemplate a tax cutting agenda immediately?\nWe certainly need to encourage investment to increase our productive capacity because our economy has been dogged for years by low productivity.\nIn my postbag however, the demand is for tax cuts that will address our ability to spend and consume: my constituents want more money in their pockets now, so that they can restore their living standards in the face of rising prices. Whilst this is entirely understandable and would certainly be popular, it would be a disastrous course to take.\nWe already have inflation because of a too expansionary monetary policy that was pursued by the Bank of England for too long. This has been exacerbated by the impact on world commodity prices resulting from the war in Ukraine and very from significant problems with supply chains caused by the bumpy international recovery from the pandemic. The UK economy is already at full employment: we have shortages of both skills and key inputs to the production process. Tax cuts targeted at our spending power in these circumstances will do nothing to promote real growth in the economy, they will simply drive prices up further. We’ll be left with more inflation and more debt.\nBeware of any offer of easy answers: If it sounds too good to be true…then it probably isn’t true.",

It does point out however, that capital projects like schools and hospitals cost up to 40% more than had they been financed by government in the traditional way. This is for the blindingly obvious reason that government borrowing costs are always lower than any credit that can be had by the private sector.\nThis points to the fault at the very heart of the Private Finance Initiative, indeed it’s in its very name.\nThe proper reason for turning to the private sector is to secure expertise, experience, skills, and a project management culture that might not be readily available in the public sector. The one thing that the public sector can always do better however, is to finance the undertaking more competitively.\nI have made my belief clear in this column over many years that the original motive for the private finance initiative owed more to meeting the Maastricht criteria for joining the Euro than it did to sound public finance. The mission was to get the borrowing necessary for important capital projects off the government’s books, even if it cost more in the long run.\nIn the event we didn’t join, but by then we had fallen into this bad habit.",

Written questions may not present information; they may not make an argument; they may not be pejorative; they may not seek an opinion; they have to be factual questions within the minister’s competence and the answer to which cannot be had from any other public source.\nSo, given my opposition to lockdown and the threat posed by the Indian variant to the lifting of all restrictions on 21 June, I put down the following question on 14 May:\n“To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if he will publish statistics on the (a) number of infections, (b) deaths and (c) hospital admissions by each covid-19 variant of concern”\nOn 25th May I got the following quite astounding answer\n“Data for hospitalisations and deaths is not currently available in the format requested.”\nI would have thought that this data is essential for any informed decision about removing the final stage of lockdown.\nOn 24th May My Colleague Dr Julian Lewis MP tried with\n“To ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if he will make it his policy to release to the media, on a daily basis, the numbers of people hospitalised with covid-19 who are (a) vaccinated and (b) unvaccinated against the virus.”\non 28th May he got no further with the following answer\n“The data requested is not currently held centrally in the format requested.”\nIncredible!\nIf not, then why on earth not?\nDr Lewis has now put down the following question:\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, pursuant to the answer of 28 May to question 6161 on the vaccination status of people hospitalised with the Indian variant of covid-19, for what reason such essential data are not held centrally in the format requested; in what format, if any, those data are held centrally; and if he will make it his policy, without further delay, to (a) gather centrally and (b) subsequently release to the media, on a daily basis, the numbers of people hospitalised with the Indian variant of covid-19 who are (i) vaccinated with (A) one and (B) both doses, and (ii) unvaccinated against the virus.”\nI can’t wait to read the answer!",

The choices that they made, overturning the choice of their MPs, were disastrous for Labour with Jeremy Corbyn and for the Tories with Liz Truss.\nParty Members should never have been granted that power. Nevertheless, taking acquired rights of members away from them is rather more difficult. Conservative Party membership is already increasing in response to the prospect of electing a new leader.\nChanging the Party’s constitution to remove the membership vote would be controversial and would take some time to deliver, if indeed the two thirds majority from the members is a realistic prospect.\nI fear that we are stuck with the existing system for the present. Perhaps in the medium-term we might placate members by reversing the current arrangements to allow the membership to have a role in thinning out the candidates, but to let MPs have exclusive choice between the final two candidates.\nA number of Conservative supporters and former supporters did suggest to me during the election campaign and afterwards, that the division of right-of-centre voters between Conservative and Reform should be healed by somehow engineering the election of Nigel Farage as the Leader of the Conservative Party. I do not think there is the remotest possibility of this happening, nor should there be.\nFirst, the suggestion is based on the false assumption that that those who voted for Reform were formerly Conservative voters and that the swiftest way to ‘repatriate’ them would be to engineer a Farage Leadership. Undoubtedly, the intervention of Reform turned a Tory defeat into something of a ‘wipe-out’ but is quite mistaken to believe that the collapse in Conservative votes was principally the work of Reform, and that therefore, an accommodation with it would repair the damage.\nLord Ashcroft’s polling suggests that only one quarter of those who voted Conservative 2019, but who abandoned the Party on 4th July, voted for Reform. The rest either stayed at home, or voted Labour, Lib Dem and Green. That polling bears out my own experience on the doorsteps.\nSecond, it is just pie in the sky. There is no such deal to be had.\nSomehow, I find myself on Farage’s mailing list. He emailed last week clearly indicating his belief that Conservatives are a spent force, that he aims to first destroy, and then to replace them. And to that end, he is already focussed on the next phase of the endeavour: the council elections next May.\nThird, the very idea is grotesque, that Conservatives should embrace a man as leader, who, when asked to name the politician he most admired replied that it was Putin.\nHe has become an apologist for the invasion of Ukraine; And he is the most enthusiastic devotee at the shrine of Donald Trump – stepping forward to defend even Trump’s most egregious excesses.\nWere such a leadership a possibility, and mercifully it isn’t, nothing could be more calculated to bury Conservatism for the foreseeable future.",

In these processes the European Parliament is a white elephant. It cannot initiate legislation of its own, and it has no power over the bureaucracy, the European Commission, or the Court where real power lies.\nAs a consequence, we have lost control of our own borders, over who can receive benefits, and so many other aspects of our national life.\nMany of our fellow countrymen accept these limitations on our democracy, and urge us to remain despite them, because they fear the economic consequences of leaving the EU. They believe we will be more prosperous if we stay.\nFrankly, a nation that is prepared to give up its right to govern itself, for the sake of its prosperity, deserves to have neither.\nMy argument however, is that, for us in the UK, this is a false choice: we can regain our right to self-government by leaving the EU and at the same time become even more prosperous.\nFar from securing prosperity for us, EU membership does not suit our economy and is making us poorer. Every year we run a substantial trade deficit with the EU. Last year that deficit was a staggering £68 billion. Our trade is predominantly with the rest of the world and it was never in our interests to have joined a club that discourages trade outside ‘Fortress Europe’. The reality is that this fortress has been crumbling for years. When we joined all those years ago, its share of the world economy was almost a third, now, notwithstanding adding 20 more members, that share of the world economy has almost halved to just 17%.\nIn addition, the EU’s single currency experiment has proved an unmitigated disaster. Yet those who warn us of catastrophe if we leave the EU, are the same people that told us that it would be disastrous for us if we didn’t join the single currency.\nIt is time to declare that the Emperor really is wearing no clothes, and to take back control of our country.",

Neither was the grotesque mutilation of their corpses. What really affected me were the scenes of the terrorists whooping with joy as they phoned home on their mobiles to boast to their families about exactly what they had just done, demanding that mothers be brought to the phone so that they could hear the detail and offer their congratulations.\nFor me, the ultimate degradation was the jubilant chanting over the corpses that ‘God is Great’.

I hadn’t been back in over thirty years. It all looked very much the same but the changes were very significant.\nFirst, the students were much more focussed on their studies than my generation were. This is hardly surprising given the students are now paying very substantial fees which my generation did not. Little wonder then that we treated our time at university more like a luxury consumer good, where the current generation treats it more like an investment from which they need to secure a return.\nSecond, the university has doubled in size. The income from tuition fees has enabled so many more places to be made available. In my day only a very much smaller proportion of sixth formers could expect to get a place at university (and because there were many fewer of us, the absence of fees was affordable). It was clear to me many more students were evidently enjoying the opportunity of a university education consequent upon the decision to charge fees.\nThird, St Andrews is, of course, a Scottish university and the Scottish government does not believe that Scottish students should have to pay tuition fees – so here is a salutary lesson: the numbers of Scottish students studying at the University is capped at 20% of the total student body. The reason for this is simple; because Scottish students don’t pay fees, the university cannot afford to take so many of them. The ‘privilege’ afforded to Scottish students of not having to pay fees is actually denying many of them the opportunity to study at one of the best universities in their own land.\nWhenever sixth formers visit Westminster I always try and encourage them not to be daunted at the prospect of incurring a very significant debt in order to pay for a university education. They won’t have to start repaying the loan until they are earning over £21,000 per year, and even then the repayment schedule is affordable with very modest monthly repayments. The key issue, as anyone with a mortgage will know, is not how many thousands of pounds you still have outstanding, but can you make the monthly repayments, and the student loan scheme is designed to ensure that they can. As for the outstanding capital sum, if they haven’t repaid it all after 30 years it is written off anyway, which is a much more advantageous system than a graduate tax, which is the alternative, and which they would end up paying for the rest of their working lives.",

The key therefore is to choose the question carefully.\nSo far as I can gather the question that the Government is asking is ‘how best can we supress the spread of the virus until a vaccine becomes available?’\nGiven that the virus spreads through social contact, we can hardly be surprised when the scientists come back with a recommendation to halt social contact by imposing lock-downs, preferably as restrictive and fierce as can be enforced.\nIt is a bit rich however, when you hear some of those scientists who break cover to complain that they recommended a full lock-down a fortnight ago, but that they were ignored.\nThey were not ignored, on the contrary, their advice was considered but rejected, which is very different indeed from being ignored.\nIn any event, when the advice is presented it comes with a caveat -boldly articulated up-front, namely that the measures proposed are designed to curb the spread of the virus, and that they all come with associated costs and impacts that may be damaging to the economy, to our health, and to our mental health.\nIt is not for the scientists to weigh-up those costs, their expertise is confined to the question that they were asked -how to stop the spread.\nRather, it is for the Government to make the assessment as to whether the cost and damage is worth the candle.\nSo, those politicians who are now insisting that we should just do what the scientists are telling us, including the Leader of the Opposition, have fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the advice and their own proper role in weighing it up.\nFurthermore, they equally fail to appreciate that there is a growing body of scientists and clinicians who believe that the strategy is the wrong one. The great Barrington Declaration, which gives voice to this growing dissent, has -as I write- been signed by 26,000 clinicians and 10,000 medical and public health scientists.\nThe resistance is growing in Parliament too: 88 MPs voted against the 10 o’clock hospitality curfew this week.\nMost dissent comes however, from within the governing party itself. This is because the coronavirus strategy has been particularly difficult for Conservatives like myself, for whom the belief that individuals make better decisions for themselves, their families and their communities than the state can make for them, is a core value.\nAs Winston Churchill summed it up ‘trust the people’.",

Exceptionally, we gave the decision whether to invade Iraq to Parliament, and look how that turned out.\nI say ‘exceptionally’ because giving Parliament a vote on military action is a recent innovation.\nOf all the military conflicts in which we have been involved (and there are a couple of hundred since 1800), Parliament voted on three: For the Iraq war; against attacking Assad in Syria, and in favour of air strikes against Daesh in Syria; and all of these in the last two decades.\nIt is an innovation of which I disapprove and I am glad that it now appears to have been abandoned.\nThe Government is accountable to Parliament for its decisions and the conduct of military operations, but it is not obliged to ask for Parliament’s prior permission.\nThe job of Parliament is to make the law, and government ministers must abide by that law, just as everyone else has to.\nIf Parliament wants to have a veto on military operations then it must pass a law to that effect. It is nonsense to have parliamentarians complaining about not being consulted first, when they make no legislative proposals to require it in future.\nOught Parliament to legislate to give itself decision making powers over military operations?\nI believe it would be folly for us to do so.\nIt would make us the most unreliable of allies, and unable to give assurances with respect to military plans.\nIt would rob us of the most important of military advantages: the ability to use surprise and to take the initiative. This weakness alone, would invite an enemy to seize the initiative in the knowledge of our likely parliamentary procrastination.\nIn seeking to persuade Parliament to authorise military action, governments would be tempted to share intelligence with it. This would be extremely dangerous: Intelligence is vital, but its value lies in its very secrecy; it is important that an enemy does not know what we know, and what we do not know. If they discover what we know it is a short step to figuring out how we know it, so enabling them to take preventive measures.\nOf course, those who would support the principle of prior parliamentary approval for military operations would be likely to try ameliorate these difficulties by making provision for emergency action by Government when there is simply no time to wait for a Parliamentary process. Herein lies perhaps the greatest danger: Governments potentially taking precipitate action in order to justify avoiding a difficult and possibly prolonged parliamentary proceeding, even for the best of motives.\nLet Government deliberate on the basis of intelligence, military and legal advice, that is what Ministers are for.\nIf they get it wrong, they are accountable to Parliament for their decisions.

The commentators claimed that no such bill had ever been so named before. I think they are wrong, and that they have ignored the statute of repeal passed by Parliament after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and known as the ‘Great Repealer’.\nThey share a name but their intentions are complete opposites. The aim of the 1660 statute of was to wipe the slate clean, expunging all the laws passed under Cromwell’s Commonwealth. The modern statute, shortly to be introduced, will have the very different effect of incorporating all EU regulation into UK law.\nFor a Eurosceptic like myself, the thought of accepting all that ghastly EU regulation into our own law, just at the moment when we thought were about to escape from it, requires some explanation.\nThat explanation is twofold. First, after 42 years and thousands of items of complicated legislation, the task of unwinding it all in the two years available before we are out of the EU, is just far too time consuming and difficult, especially when all government effort is focussed on detailed negotiation of our exit terms. Much more sensible therefore, to incorporate all current EU regulation so that our exit is seamless, and leaving us the luxury of repealing or amending it at our leisure over coming years.\nSecond, by retaining – at least for the present – all EU regulation, we will begin our status as an independent trading nation with exactly the same rules and standards as the rest of the EU. This will make it much easier for us to trade with the EU, making our departure somewhat less economically disruptive.\nMuch has been made of the ‘Henry VIII powers’ that will be in the bill, and the synthetic indignation expressed about them by leading opposition politicians. The name suggests that the Government is seeking to rule by proclamation in the way that Henry VIII did (and link it by association, with Henry’s tyrannical rule – he may have executed as many as 72,000 people, a much larger total than that achieved by Bloody Mary his daughter).\nI hate to spoil a good story with facts, but this is a load of nonsense. The so called Henry VIII powers are not uncommon in parliamentary bills. Often bills will grant ministers powers to make detailed regulations once the bill has become law. Somewhat less frequently, that power to regulate will extend to enabling the minister to amend other acts of Parliament. This power is narrowly defined in the statute, and is subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny: any such regulation must be approved by Parliament in a statutory instrument by a vote in both Houses. Not quite Henry VIII’s style.\nThe reason for granting these powers to alter the law by ministerial regulation is to enable the huge volumes of legal changes that will need to be made, without tying up our legislative programme in Parliament for years to come.\nWe have other fish to fry.",

I take the point however, and I share their President’s concerns.\nTypically, my correspondents go on to elaborate, claiming the expertise and knowledge to pronounce that Islam is, of necessity, an inherently violent creed. Here I think they are quite mistaken. Of course, its history is quite as violent as the history of any other religion, but overwhelmingly it has been characterised by contemplative sufism.\nMy correspondents quote blood-curdling passages claiming authentic interpretation from the Koran. Well, as a Bible-believing Christian I’m quite able to quote any number of much more blood-curdling passages from the Bible -so, straight off the top of my head, what about the savagery meted out to Achan (Joshua 7 & 8): Stoned to death with his whole clan, including women, children and livestock when it was discovered he had hidden some booty from the destruction of Jericho, sufficiently annoying God so that he denied victory to the Israelites in their first attempt to capture the City of Ai. Having sorted Achan, the Israelites had a second shot at Ai, resulting in complete destruction -including every living thing within the city.\nOn the face of it we are supposed to approve of these actions, after all, surely Achan, his family, their animals, and subsequently the all inhabitants of Ai ‘had it coming’. I rather think however, that there is a subtly in the account, and ‘between the lines’ the narrator is asking us “…and do you really believe that this was the will of God?”.\nI am not qualified to imagine what subtleties there may be in the Koran, I leave that to real Islamic scholars, rather than trust my correspondents.\nAs to the violent history of Islam. I wonder if it measures up to the blood- lust of Christendom: Crusades, pogroms, our wars of religion including the Inquisition, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, the Defenestration of Prague, the burnings during the reign of Bloody Mary, and on and on.\nSecular religions, Fascism and Communism, have taken an even greater toll.\nWhen my correspondents go on to claim that we are harbouring an alien and increasingly dangerous religious community in our midst I like to draw their attention to the contribution of Indian soldiers made to the defence of the Empire and to point to their WWI memorial in Barton on Sea in my constituency. Then, last week, I came across this magnificent passage whilst re-reading Churchill’s history of WWII\n“…the glorious heroism and martial qualities of the Indian troops who fought in the Middle East, who defended Egypt, who liberated Abyssinia, who played a grand part in Italy, and who, side by side with their British Comrades, expelled the Japanese from Burma, stand forth in brilliant light.\nThe loyalty of the Indian Army to the King-Emperor, the proud fidelity to their treaties of the Indian Princes, the unsurpassed bravery of Indian Soldiers and officers, both Moslem and Hindu, shine forever in the annals of war.”\nThat is something to be proud of, and to continue to build upon.

The subject was what he called the ‘cycle of deprivation’. In it he observed that an increasing proportion of our children were born to those least fitted to bring them up. There was a great furore from the ‘great and good’ over what they willfully misconstrued as a proposal for eugenics.\nThe problem however, remains. From time to time foster parents visit my surgeries to discuss aspects of the difficulties that they face. I often reflect on the work that so many of these amazing people do in trying to repair much of the damage that the natural parents have inflicted. Some children are born already damaged by their parents’ lifestyle. Others, at the age of five still cannot walk, talk, or are not toilet trained because they have spent their lives strapped in a buggy placed in front of the TV.\nThe tragedy is that so much of a child’s future prospects are determined by the attention and affection received in the early weeks of life, a truth dwelt on by Andrea Leadsom at the hustings in her aborted bid for the Tory Leadership this summer.\nRecently local campaigners for 70/30 came to my surgery: their aim is to demonstrate that we can reduce child maltreatment by 70% by the year 2030 through a proper prevention strategy.\nThe damage done to children by maltreatment costs the UK taxpayer £ billions in social services and other costs as these children go on to struggle with problems in later life. The 70/30 approach is to prevent maltreatment to children before it happens by investing resources to tackle the root causes. These might be maternal mental health problems, domestic violence, drug abuse or a whole host of other issues affecting parents. Early, effective support could help them deal with these problems before they get out of control. This might mean a mum-to-be who is struggling with her mental health – where the right support could make all the difference to her ability to cope. Or it might mean a couple who have unhealthy tension in their relationship – helping them to get things back on the right track prevents the severe stress a baby experiences in a tense or violent home.\nThe challenge is to get people thinking ahead to the point that we can really start seeing prevention as something urgent, not just something that would be nice to work on once we have finished intervening where things have already gone wrong. In fact, that is the whole point. We will never finish intervening until we have stopped things from going wrong in the first place. To use an analogy from WAVE Trust, the charity behind the 70/30 campaign, if your taps are on and your sink is overflowing, you will never finish mopping up unless you stop to turn the taps off.\nI certainly support the campaign.

While I appreciate your frustration with this decision, the Draft Online Safety Bill will be able to go further than the Digital Economy Act’s focus on online pornography on commercial adult sites. It will be able to protect children from a broader range of harmful content and activity, across a wider range of sites\nUnder the upcoming Online Safety Bill, companies will be expected to use age assurance or age verification technologies to prevent children from accessing services which pose the highest risk of harm, such as online pornography. This will capture both the most visited pornography sites and pornography on social media. These measures will also bring into scope more online pornography currently accessible to children than would have been covered by the narrower scope of Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act.\nThe final legislation, when introduced to Parliament, will also contain provisions that require companies to report child sexual exploitation and abuse content identified on their services. This will ensure companies provide law enforcement with the high-quality information they need to safeguard victims and investigate offenders.\nMore broadly, in line with the Government’s response to the Online Harms White Paper, the Bill will require all companies in scope to have a duty of care towards their users so that what is unacceptable offline will also be unacceptable online. They will need to consider the risks their sites may pose to the youngest and most vulnerable people and act to protect children from inappropriate content and harmful activity. Furthermore, the largest and most popular social media sites (Category 1 services) will need to act on content that is lawful but still harmful.\nDS.",

Well, whatever happened to that?\nThe Government continues to be in thrall to scientific modellers with doomsday predictions.\nThe value of the output from any model -however robust its design- depends upon the assumptions that are fed into it. Some of the terrifying numbers from the modelling that we have seen in the last few days are the result of assumptions that take no account of the data that is coming out of South Africa -that the new variant, despite being more infectious, appears to be milder and consequent hospitalisations fewer and shorter. Many of the alarming numbers aren’t even the output of models at all, they are mere extrapolations: assuming that what has happened, will go on happening at the same rate, irrespective of experience that things rarely do so.As I said in the Commons at the beginning of last week, this is all part of a ‘Ministry of Fear’ designed to ensure our compliance with instructions that compromise fundamental liberties, and indeed, condition us to demand even greater restraints on that liberty, so overawed are we by the present danger. Part of this work of terrorising the population is undertaken with enthusiasm by the broadcast media, a job made so much easier by the twenty four hour news cycle which enables us to constantly receive the same bad news throughout the day from the moment that we wake up in the morning, hearing on the radio that we’d die horribly drowning in our own phlegm, repeated until the moment we go to bed. What is astounding is that, as each new prediction is trotted out, no account is taken of the previous record of the source. Let’s take, for example, one of the media’s favourite modellers, Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London. In 2001, Professor Ferguson predicted 150,000 human deaths from foot-and-mouth; but under 200 died. In 2002, he predicted up to 50,000 deaths from BSE; in the end, 177 died. In 2005, he said that 150 million people could be killed by bird flu; 282 died. In 2009, a Government estimate based on his advice said that a “reasonable worst-case scenario” for swine flu would lead to 65,000 British deaths; in the end, 457 people died. He predicted 85,000 Covid deaths in Sweden consequent on their policy of avoiding lockdown; in fact, 6,000 Swedes have died. In July this year he predicted that 100,000 daily cases was almost inevitable following our release from restrictions. It just didn’t happen. Yet the broadcasters will quote the latest models as if they were the Gospel truth. My prejudice is that the latest scare won’t be anything like as bad forecast. We look to ministers to resist the measures being urged upon them which will damage society and the economy, but then, on the basis of past performance that expectation looks pretty shaky too.",

Friend very much and wish that that were true. The reason why the Office for National Statistics does the surveillance testing is to ensure that we are constantly looking, on a national representative sample, at what the case rate is, as well as, of course, using the tests, and as we increase the testing numbers, we will inevitably find more of the cases that are there. The ONS survey published on Friday shows a rise in the numbers commensurate with the rise in the numbers of tests that have come back positive, and that does take into account the point about false positives, which is an important one.\nThe reason I put the question is that I have received a number of representations from clinicians across the country (presumably prompted by the stand that I’ve taken) who believe that Covid-19 testing is giving a misleading impression about a second wave. They argue that of course we will detect more genuine cases of the disease as we do more testing. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the disease is increasing: we may simply finding more of it because we are looking for more of it.\nMore worrying is the belief that the a false impression is being created by the test which is unable to distinguish between active cases of the disease, and those who may have recovered from it some time ago but have remaining non-infective traces of it.\nI’m not sure that the Secretary Of State’s answer provides sufficient reassurance. He is stating that the Office of National Statistics conducts a survey by testing a representative population sample and then applying a statistical calculation to estimate the number of cases in the whole population.\nIf the ONS test suffers from the same inability to distinguish false positives it doesn’t escape the possibility of exaggerating the incidence of the disease.\nThe ONS does publish the following caveats:\n“we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, as COVID-19 is a new virus….\nThe estimates presented in this bulletin contain uncertainty. There are many sources of uncertainty, including uncertainty in the test”\nThe Government website -when I last looked- stated the daily number of tests processed in the UK was 227,075. https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/testing and the daily number of people tested positive is 3,105. https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/cases\nWhich means that 1.37% of those tested had a positive result. Clearly it doesn’t take a mathematician to tell you that a relatively small percentage of false positives will have a significant impact on our estimate of how many people are infected. In fact a report by the ONS in June put false positives at 2.4%: which even higher than the actual proportion of positives!\nWe are threatened with more restrictions to our liberty which will lay waste to even more of our employment opportunities, and will be more damaging to the health of anyone suffering from a medical condition other than Covid-19, all driven by policy reliant on what may be very misleading data\nAt some stage we will have to have a reality check and remind ourselves that whilst Covid-19 is a horrid and dangerous disease, it is only 24th in the league of UK killers at only 1.4% of deaths (the top scorer being dementia at 11%).\nIf we want to live normally we will have conquer our fear",

One professor has likened it to watching only one channel on the TV and then discovering that there were others with completely different programmes. Another said that it will give humanity a new “sixth sense”.\nWhat we do now know is that 1.3 billion light years away (and a light year is 6 trillion miles, so we are looking at a distance of 6 000,000,000,000 x 1,030, 000,000,000 = 7, 800, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000 miles) two massive objects spiralled into one another causing a storm in space, the waves from which just reached Earth after travelling, – by my reckoning – 1.4 billion years at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second).\nFrankly, the numbers are just too big to comprehend, but that is the point: We ought to stop and wonder at our lack of comprehension, and consider our place in the universe, and – by comparison – how trivial some of our preoccupations might seem. It puts me in mind of that great favourite among hymns:\nO Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder Consider the works thy hands hath made, I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, Thy power throughout the universe displayed Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to thee: How great thou art!\nSimilarly, when I was at School, above the science block entrance, were inscribed the words from the book of the prophet Micah “there are many things yet hid, for we have seen but a few of his works”.\nThis awe ought to arrest us and give us a proper sense of proportion. It did to me last week. I was giving a speech to a City audience about economic growth and I was agreeing with the Growth Commission which had said “economic growth can relieve humanity en masse from drudgery and poverty, nothing else ever has”. When, of course, it occurred to me that spiritual values like awesome wonder had often achieved exactly that. The Book of Common Prayer, for donkeys’ years was, and is, a relief from drudgery.\nI’m not sure what the City economists and accountants made of it.",

You may be interested to know that the Government has proposed amending national planning guidance to make clear that local planning authorities should place greater importance on social rent. In addition, the Government’s ‘Ending Rough Sleeping for Good’ strategy makes clear that increasing the affordability and security of housing is an important part of its work to prevent homelessness and rough sleeping. The Government’s commitment to doing so includes delivering a fairer private rented sector and supporting more stable tenancies. For example, the Renters (Reform) Bill will abolish Section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions, which can cause uncertainty and worry for households.\nThe Government is committed to reducing the need for temporary accommodation by preventing homelessness before it occurs. Since 2018, over 640,000 households have been prevented from becoming homeless or supported into settled accommodation through the Homelessness Reduction Act.\nIt is important to raise standards in rented homes, which the Government’s plans to apply the Decent Homes Standard to the private rented sector and strengthen local councils’ enforcement powers to help target criminal landlords is positive. When it comes to housing rights, the Government is making changes to the legal aid means test that will significantly expand legal aid eligibility. The Government is investing up to £10 million each year through the creation of a Housing Loss Prevention Advice Service. As of 1st August 2023, this is enabling people facing the loss of their home to receive early legal advice on housing, debt and welfare benefits issues as well as representation in court.\nDS",

Nevertheless, images and reports of the sheer barbarity of some Russian military units continue to shock: whether it be the castration of a prisoner; the targeting of civilians; torture under interrogation, or the insatiable appetite for looting.\nWar has always had terrible side effects, sometimes bringing out the best in humanity, but often the worst. Notwithstanding, we retain high expectations of the discipline and restraint of our own armed forces. We require thorough investigation and accountability if they fall short.\nWhat is it about the form that Russian forces have displayed in Ukraine and previously in Chechenia, that leaves their chain of command so apparently unconcerned?\nAt the Chalke Valley History Festival in June, I bought a copy of Anthony Beevor’s Russia: Revolution and Civil War 1917-1921. I was already familiar with the history, but I’ve always found Beevor’s accounts refreshing and gripping. Now that we are into the parliamentary recess, I’ve had the time to pick it up and read it. What I was certainly unaware of previously was the role of Winston Churchill -our Minister for War at the time- and the extent to which he tried to persuade the Prime Minister Lloyd- George and his cabinet to expand our commitment to the ‘Whites’ in the civil war against Bolshevism.\nWhat the book also brought home to me is the scale and cruelty of the killing. From Lenin down, there was a promotion genocide as a tool of policy, and of the idea that lives are entirely expendable. Given the mind-boggling numbers of people to be killed, time and motion would dictate that they be despatched as swiftly and efficiently as possible. But not a bit of it: ingenuity and blood-lust dictated that victims be killed in some of the most excruciating ways imaginable. Of course, this investment of time and energy in the means and the reporting of killing improved the effectiveness of terror as a tool of social control and obedience.\nThe excesses of the civil war were not ended by the triumph of Bolshevism and the creation of the Soviet Union. Stalin’s regime perpetuated the terror, populations were deported, starved, and exterminated. It is significant that when Khrushchev denounced Stalin’s crimes it was only in a secret session of the Politburo. The willing murderers and torturers enjoyed untroubled retirement. As Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov demonstrated, the habits of the regime survived till the very end of the Soviet Union. Putin, who was an official in the Soviet system, has sought to turn back the clock and to rehabilitate Stalin’s reputation.\nAfter the Second World War the Nuremberg trials exposed and punished the servants of the Nazi state. The enormity of the barbarism of the Soviet regime over the last century has never been similarly exposed, denounced, and its operatives held accountable. Perhaps this might go some way to explaining the treatment by Russian troops of their enemies: maybe it’s just the way things are done, it’s “part of the system”.\nPresident Regan described it as the Evil Empire",

We have also seen very substantial growth in our overseas aid budget: we are now the world’s second largest donor. I support this because I see it as a vital way that we project power and influence in our own national interest.

First, the absurdity and confusion of different lock-down policies pursued by the governments in England, Wales and Scotland during the pandemic. We now know from the leaked Hancock WhatsApp messages that restrictions were imposed on England, not based on any evidential effectiveness, but purely to keep up with zealous officialdom in Scotland.\nSecond, we’ve recently seen the UK Government intervene to veto absurd legislation in Scotland, which allowed people to redesignate their gender, because they could not be restricted, in the rest of our islands, to facilities consistent with their actual sex.\nEven worse still, as the UK Government of the has wrestled with the hideous complications of halting the traffic of migrants in small boats across the Channel, the Welsh government sought, on the contrary, to increase the ‘pull factor’ by paying the asylum claimants £1,600 per month and funding legal costs to resist deportation.\nIt is our good fortune that the UK Government still had the powers to thwart these daft intentions:\nWe need to ensure that devolution proceeds no further to rob us of them.",

As I’ve said before in this column, if you really want a particular thing out of a negotiation, you don’t reveal it, on the contrary, you show that you are absolutely indifferent about it, otherwise your counterparty will raise his price accordingly.\nNow however, Tim Farron has revived an earlier demand for a second referendum: One at the outcome of the article 50 negotiations, so that people can decide to either remain, or to leave on the basis of the negotiated terms.\nThere is a small fly in the ointment: So far, we have been told that article 50, once invoked, is irreversible (indeed the High Court based its recent judgement on this very fact) and that the EU won’t negotiate with us at all until we do invoke article 50. There is therefore, no logic whatsoever to any post article 50 referendum, because the moment we invoke the article there is already no going back, even if a subsequent referendum result demanded it.\n(Of course, this could all change with the Government’s appeal to the Supreme Court).\nThere is another glaring problem, obvious to anyone who thinks about it for a moment: The EU does not want us to leave; holding another referendum at the end of the negotiations presents the EU with an opportunity to offer the most dreadful terms imaginable (including cutting off its own nose to spite its face), confident that these terms will be rejected in the referendum.\nOf course, that is the objective of those that propose the second referendum: they want to reverse the result of the first one, so perhaps Tim Farron isn’t daft at all, but he must think that we all are.\nThe notion that we did not know what we were voting for on 23rd June, and that we need a second chance to get the right answer, is not untypical of elites who disparage and distrust democracy.\nThe Remain campaign painted a picture of the ‘hardest’ Brexit imaginable.

The al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza is an example of this. Before Christmas, the hospital was severely damaged again and a tank demolished its front wall. Most of the hospital staff were taken away by the Israeli Defence Force and the Church of England has asked the Government here to inquire about their wellbeing and whereabouts and to request that they be released.\nSir Desmond Swayne\nIntimidation by hard-line settlers has prompted the Patriarch to say that clergy are fighting for their lives, and that the Armenian quarter faces a ‘violent demise’.\nIs a Christian presence in Jerusalem still viable?\nAndrew Selous\nI am grateful to my right hon. Friend for bringing this issue before the House. He is right: a century ago, a quarter of Jerusalem was Christian; now, just 1% of the population is, and in the Armenian quarter of the old city, the Christian presence has come under intensified threat from intimidation and aggressive property acquisition by settlers. The Church of England is very concerned that the rule of law should prevail in Israel and the status quo be maintained. It is unconscionable that Christians should be driven from the holy land.”\nI quote this exchange that took place in the Commons last Thursday to draw attention to two important issues.

I don’t believe that I have a single constituent who isn’t horrified by the consequent destruction and suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.\nSecond, the long-standing concerns I have had about Israel’s stewardship of the West Bank. On Wednesday I heard a dreadful report (as yet, uncorroborated) of a visit by Israeli defence Force to a charity in Jenin which runs a home for disabled children, I’m told that they ‘trashed’ the place and took away all the Children’s winter clothes. I hope it isn’t true – and one has to be cautious about any partisan reports (as the BBC has learnt -or failed to learn- to its own cost).\nWhat I will say however, as a former minister responsible for our assistance to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, I reached the conclusion that the Government of Israel had abandoned any prospect of a two-state solution and that this was made evident by support for the building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank that would make any future Palestinian state geographically and economically unviable.\nWhenever, I’ve badgered current ministers about this, they always respond by saying that we constantly raise this issues with Israel.

Not only has it been under pressure from me and many like-minded members of Parliament who doubt the wisdom of lockdown and want it lifted as soon as possible. On the other hand and largely outside Parliament there has been a growing lobby over the last months, who demand a continuation of restrictions until we can deliver a state characterised as ‘zero-covid’.\nThe best thing about the Governments ‘roadmap’ to ending the lockdown is that it settles this question. The Prime Minister could not have been more explicit in his statement to the House of Commons:\n“There is therefore no credible route to a zero-covid Britain or indeed a zero-covid world, and we cannot persist indefinitely with restrictions that debilitate our economy, our physical and mental wellbeing, and the life chances of our children”\nHallelujah!. At least we’ve sent the zero-covid lobby packing. They’d have locked us down indefinitely.\nWhere I depart from the Government’s plan is that I believe it to be too cautious. There needs to be a much greater sense of urgency about the costs that lockdown is piling up, the damage it is doing to our health and to the futures of our children. We simply do not have time to be timid about this.\nThe Government has been overcautious. The modelling on which scientific advice has been based is itself too cautious. As with all modelling, its findings depend upon the assumptions that were fed into it in the first place. The calculations are based on a levels of vaccine efficacy and vaccine up-take that are significantly below the levels that we are currently actually experiencing.\nThis would not be too much of a problem were the plan genuinely not date driven, but data driven, as the Prime Minister claimed.\nDespite this claim, the PM announced a series of ‘not before’ dates for each phase of lifting the lockdown. These dates are only flexible in that they will be delayed if the level of hospital admissions, daily infections, deaths and the impact of new variants decline less swiftly than anticipated.\nThe dates will not be advanced however, if the data on admissions, infections, deaths, and variants proves much better than was expected. Given the pessimistic assumptions fed into the model, there really ought to be an swifter relaxation if things improve so much more quickly.\nBut let’s end on a positive note.

The NC3Rs supports the research community to use the latest science and technology to replace animal studies, providing new approaches for biomedical research, and avoiding the time and cost associated with animal models.\nWithout animal testing it is highly likely that a large number of potentially dangerous new medicines would be tested in healthy volunteers and patients in clinical trials. This would be completely unacceptable. That said, the Government’s commitment to the development of non-animal technologies is positive. Such technologies have the potential to reduce the reliance on the use of animals, improve the efficiency of drug research and development, and deliver safer, cheaper, and more effective medicines to patients. Ministers have also stressed that they continue to actively support and fund the development and dissemination of techniques that replace, reduce, and refine the use of animals in research.\nWith regard to your concerns about the wearing of bearskin caps Guardsmen take great pride in wearing the bearskin cap, which is an iconic image of Britain, and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is very sparing in the acquisitions that it makes. Individual soldiers do not possess their own hats, rather they are cared for and shared within the Household Division and, despite their constant use, every effort is made to carefully prolong the longevity of each ceremonial cap. On account of this, they usually last for more than a decade, with some having been in use for as long as 60 years.\nThe MOD would like to find an alternative material to bearskin should one prove acceptable. This is a commitment the MOD takes very seriously. The MOD have not to date seen evidence that a suitable faux fur product exists to be considered as an alternative. Until that material is sourced and proven, the UK goes to great lengths to ensure that the pelts that make the King’s Guards caps are procured in the most responsible way possible.\nBears are never hunted to order for the MOD.

They include discontinuing the maintenance of the Hurst Spit shingle bank and abandoning the existing sea wall between Keyhaven and Lymington Yacht Haven.\nWalking along the popular sea wall footpath from Lymington to Keyhaven will no longer be possible.\nOnce Hurst spit has been breached through discontinued maintenance, all of the salt marshes inside of Keyhaven river, all along the existing sea wall to Harpers post will ultimately be lost. This managed realignment will accelerate the loss of the intertidal habitat outside the sea wall and make the Lymington outer harbour area much more exposed.\nI understand that the Lymington River will almost certainly silt up, it will be subjected to huge wave action and become no longer navigable.\nHurst Castle will be cut off permanently from the shore and Lymington Harbour as a whole will be at risk. All of the features in that area will be given up to allow the tidal waters to penetrate inland and create new intertidal habitats for the birds further inland.\nThe cost of raising the existing sea wall to “Hold the Line” is in the order of £100 million, whilst the “Managed Retreat” option is closer to £280 million. The more expensive option of managed retreat is now the preferred option of the environment Agency because it unlocks central government funding for the proposed creation of the new intertidal bird habitat. However, I do not believe that enough weight has been given to local marine-related employment, or sufficient recognition given to the needs of businesses in the town of Lymington which depend of a thriving harbour, or the local amenity of sailing, motor boating, sea fishing, or simply walking your dog along the sea wall between Lymington and Keyhaven.\nThe annual budget for maintaining the shingle bank at Hurst of £40,000 is per annum, but there has been no maintenance this year. Given the new policy of “do nothing”, it remains to be seen if there will be any future maintenance of Hurst Spit between Milford and Hurst Castle, or whether this has already been abandoned to “Managed Retreat”. Given the relatively moderate cost of maintaining this structure in a normal year, this should not be allowed to lapse.\nThese proposals will change forever the shape of the coastline with profound impact on amenity and businesses.

The residents of that home are unaffected by these great national dramas: Of much greater importance to them are small acts of kindness, the gentleness with which they are treated, the respect and dignity afforded to them. Actually, if you think about it, the same is true for us all.\nAfter the referendum I would have thought that people would have had quite enough of it. As I write however, apparently two and a half million citizens have signed a petition demanding that it be repeated. Rather more inconveniently they have been filling my email inbox with this demand. One fellow even complained to me that he only voted ‘Leave’ because he expected ‘Remain’ to win. Well, after years of tramping doorsteps and feeling the full range of voter caprice, I’ve heard any number of extra-ordinary explanations for reaching a decision on how to vote, but voting for A because you expect B to win, has got to be the daftest.\nOthers complain that the margin of victory was too narrow and that such a momentous decision needed a more decisive mandate. It is a fair point, but you can’t change the rules after the decision has been made. It would indeed have been possible to have written such conditions into the referendum legislation beforehand but it is too late now. I would have cautioned against such provisions, after all, we tried it once before: In the first Scotland devolution referendum in 1979 the legislation required that, for an Edinburgh parliament to be implemented, the ‘yes’ campaign had not only to win, but also to secure a ‘Yes’ vote equal to not less than 40% of the registered voters on the electoral roll. Well they won, but they failed to make the 40% rule, so they didn’t get their parliament, and I remember the deep sense of unfairness and bitterness ae a consequence. The people have voted, and however we may, or may not like the result, it is done. As the Rubaiyat says “ the moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on: nor all your piety nor wit shall lure it back to cancel but half a Line, nor all your tears wash out one word of it.”\nCheer up!",

After all, what possible motive could opposition parties have in voting to accommodate the Prime Minister’s choice of early election date?\nThe rest is history. It begs the question however, if there remains any point in the Fixed Term Parliament Act, given that it has so easily been overcome, and we have in reverted to the status quo ante, where the Prime Minister effectively chooses the election date?\nIn any event, whatever the election result, a significant number of the 500 or so MPs who voted for the election on June 8th, will end up regretting that they did so.

Indeed the Home Secretary initially urged caution in the face of demands for more patrol vessels, because they would be likely to encourage many more attempted crossings. It is not clear to me why he appears to have changed his mind and redeployed the available patrol vessels so that they too can now patrol the channel.\nI do not underestimate the enormity of the expense and the hardship that refugees endure in making their journeys to Europe and then across it, nor should we underestimate the misery and poverty from which they initially fled.\nWhen I was the minister responsible for our humanitarian response it was clear to me that we could afford to feed, accommodate and educate ten refugees in their own region for the cost of assisting just one back in Britain. Furthermore, the ones that made it to Britain were not the most vulnerable, but the most resourceful.\nEveryone has a right to flee to safety in the face of violence and persecution. The moment you travel beyond the first place of safety in pursuit of a more attractive destination however, you have become, not so much a refugee, as an economic migrant.\nNow, nobody should be condemned for being an economic migrant: which one of us, in similar circumstances, would not see it as our duty to seek better prospects for our families by struggling to get to Britain?\nEqually, it is clear that there is a limit to what Britain can accommodate.\nIn economics there is a concept of ‘equilibrium’ which , I believe, is applicable: migrants will continue to be drawn to Europe until an equilibrium is established where life is no better here than it is in the places from which they were coming.\nOur proper response to the refugee crisis, therefore, is our massive investment in international development assistance to provide order, economic opportunity, education and healthcare in the places from which people are seeking to escape.\nTo those constituents who demand cuts in this assistance so that we can spend it on ourselves instead, the answer is simple: expect many, many, many more channel crossings until an equilibrium is established.",

The row was over the fact that in each of the two years since, applications for nursing degrees have fallen sharply (down 13% this year).\nI think the anger is largely misplaced. It seemed to me that the real scandal was that so many applicants for nursing were being turned away because there was a shortage of places on courses.\nThe savings from abolishing the bursary are being used to fund 25% more training places.\nSo long as the number of well qualified applicants is still sufficient to fill all the places available, including the extra 25%, (and they remain more than sufficient) then the number of nurses will increase, irrespective of the reduction in total number of applicants.\nThere may also be another benefit: One of the strategic mistakes made by government in the nineteen nineties was to accept the Royal College of Nursing’s agenda for a ‘degree-only’ nursing profession, and to abolish the status of the State Enrolled Nurse. This mistake accentuated the move to ‘high tech’ nursing and denied to the profession nurses whose primary role was just caring for patients rather than curing them. Sometimes anxious and vulnerable patients need not only to be ‘treated’ but to be spent time with, to be fed, or even just to have someone hold their hand.\nThe introduction of an entry to the profession through an apprenticeship -which is part of the new scheme- may, I hope, go some way to getting the balance right",

The bald figures are quite disturbing but, having swum 4 times per week throughout the reporting period, I’ve never come across a turd and I’ve never been ill.\nThere has been a 56% increase in sewage spills in 2023 compared to 2022. How do we know this?\nWe know it because 100% of storm overflows are now continuously monitored. In 2010 when Conservatives came into government only 7% of them were monitored. Previous administrations weren’t even collecting the data and so had no handle on the size of the problem. Now we know and we can take effective action.\nStorm overflows are a legacy of our Victorian sewage system where rainwater drains into the same sewers as our lavatories. But not all storm overflows result in a sewage spill, that only happens either by accident or, when deliberate, to avoid sewage backing-up to our lavatories.\nBecause the system is shared with rainwater, to be fair, the weather is bound to be a major factor influencing the statistics. 2023 was the 6th wettest on record, compared to 2022 which was the 8th driest.\nThe Government requires the water companies to make the necessary investment to end sewage spills. There has been a fourfold increase in inspections with 500 additional staff to carry them out.\nSince 2015 the Environment Agency has concluded 60 prosecutions resulting in £150 million of fines from the water companies.\nSorting this legacy is going to take time, but this is the first government to get the measure of it and address it",

We will improve the Troubled Families programme and champion Family Hubs to serve vulnerable families with the intensive, integrated support that they need to care for children…”\nIn this column last week, whilst discussing food banks, I quoted statistics on childhood obesity in which children from families with lower incomes were disproportionately overrepresented.\nMy source for this statistical analysis was the Nuffield Trust, based on data collected by the National Child Measurement Programme: One in five children in Year 6 (aged 10-11 years) were obese in 2017/18 (20.1%). Obesity in children aged 10-11 has increased by 2.6 percentage points since 2006/07. The proportion of children who were underweight has remained relatively stable over this time period.\nThere is a strong association between deprivation and obesity: In 2017/18, in Year 6 children obesity prevalence was over twice as high in the most deprived areas than the least deprived areas. Severe obesity prevalence was about four times as high in the most deprived areas than the least deprived areas.\nIn a rhetorical flourish I inferred that “the poorest are among the fattest”.\nI’ve received a large number of emails agreeing with what I said. This puts me in the awkward position of having to disagree with my supporters, because I’ve reflected on it, and believe that referring to the ‘fattest’ was insensitive, so I apologise to anyone to whom I gave offence.\nFurthermore, that statement is not a legitimate inference from the evidence I quoted: even when children from lower income backgrounds are overrepresented in the figures for obesity, it is equally possible for the richest to be amongst the fattest.\nI believe that the conclusion that I drew however, remains valid, and I stand by it. We need to provide support and assistance to some low-income families which goes well beyond merely supplying them with increased benefits. Many need help that will enable them to shop more cost-effectively and healthily.\nOne of the places where such assistance could be located are Children Centres. They were a welcome innovation and I regret that so many were closed as a consequence of the squeeze on local authority budgets. That was an inevitable consequence of the financial situation that the coalition government inherited. Now, as the financial situation improves, it is essential that that Children Centres and Family Hubs feel the benefit. Accordingly, I hope that the manifesto commitment that I quoted is a statement of this intent, and I shall certainly campaign for it.",

I am simplifying a complex measure, but basically the current law still requires ‘irretrievable breakdown’ to be proved through adultery, desertion or unreasonable conduct by one of the parties before divorce is granted. The Alternative is a separation of two years, but where one party opposes the divorce the other must wait fully five years to get one.\nThe reform approved by the commons last week will change this fundamentally: The long waits of two and five years are swept aside and the concept of ‘fault’ in divorce is removed.\nClearly, irretrievable breakdown on the basis of unreasonable behaviour means that at least one of the parties has behaved unreasonably and is at fault. The focus of the measure before Parliament is to grant ‘no fault divorce’: to simply accept that a relationship has broken down when either party applies for a divorce, rather than having to demonstrate it by attributing blame.\nThis is not uncontroversial. I have received a significant amount of correspondence opposing these reforms. Constituents have complained that they trivialise both marriage and divorce. Furthermore, that they fly in the face of the facts: there is fault in divorce, people do behave unreasonably, and surely the law should recognise this.\nSome of our clergy have complained that the sanctity of marriage is undermined by making it so easy to end it.\nI have a great deal of sympathy with these arguments, and I had to reflect for a long time before giving my assent to the bill.\nThe question of ‘sanctity’ in marriage is a religious one. Of course, a change in the law of marriage as a civil contract cannot change what the Church teaches about ‘Holy Matrimony’ and its indissolubility, or otherwise.\nThe key issue is the question of ‘fault’. I accept that there is fault in divorce, but in my experience it is the requirement to attribute that fault -to lay the blame- that can make divorce a so much more malicious affair.\nSo often divorced constituents have come to my surgeries seeking my assistance in a continuing warfare with their former spouse, where the children are being used as the weapons.\nIt was on the basis of lowering the temperature by removing the need for one party to blame the other when seeking a divorce, that I gave my consent to the bill.\nI hope, with the assistance of like-minded MPs, to extract a commitment from the Government during the remaining stages of the bill, to greater support for struggling couples earlier in their marriage.",

One of the particular features of this correspondence is that the authors want a continuing conversation with me, and any answer that I give only encourages further emails and argument. Whilst email lends itself to a conversation, I get over 100 emails daily in addition to the many other things that I need to do, which makes it difficult to conduct multiple conversations with constituents released from the disincentive of paying for a stamp and making their way to the post box.\nNow this daily flow has been augmented by scores from constituents outraged by what they consider to be a betrayal of the BREXIT vote implicit in the Government’s evolving negotiating position.\nA common feature of both sets of correspondents is their certainty that they speak for everyone else, that everyone they converse with agrees with them, and that as their representative I should do likewise.\nI think their belief that their own opinions are universally held springs from two sources. First: many people mix in company with people just like themselves, so it is not surprising if they hear opinions similar to their own. Second, we are a tolerant and polite people, when some bore keeps banging on about their hobby-horse, instead of taking issue and arguing with them, we take the line of least resistance by pretending to agree, even if only in the hope that it will shut them up.\nAs for my responsibility to represent them, my duty is to represent all my constituents, 99.99% of whom have not expressed any opinion to me whatsoever. I owe them my judgement by listening to the arguments and debate, a debate that takes place in Parliament with other elected representatives. I must not be prisoner to any vociferous email lobby.\nA common theme of the latest surge of email correspondence from those who believe that their pro-BREXIT vote is being betrayed is that this is such a gross affront to democracy that the entire edifice of government now needs to be razed. These are what I call the ‘crazies’, who adhere to a doctrine of ‘revolutionary defeatism’: they believe that because the BREXIT settlement will not be exactly to their specification, like Sampson we must bring the whole temple down on our heads -whatever the consequences, and a new democratic Britain will somehow emerge from the ruins.\nI am not going to join any political suicide squad. I voted for a ‘hard Brexit’ in the referendum, but there were plenty of other BREXIT flavours being touted. After all, for years constituents have been telling me that they were duped in the 1975 referendum because they only thought they were voting for a ‘Common Market’ not signing-up to political integration. Well, I voted ‘No’ in 1975 because I didn’t even want the market, and I want to be free of its limitations now. Can I be sure however, that many, perhaps even a majority of BREXIT voters, would be satisfied to be free of political integration and yet hang on to the market?\nMy duty must be to secure what is the best BREXIT achievable according to my judgement, but in doing so I must not put at risk the prospect of achieving any BREXIT at all: That really would be an affront to our democracy.",

We need to concentrate resources on those who really need them.\nOne difficulty is that a qualifying criterion for the payments is reliance on an ‘aid’ or ‘appliance’ (which might be something as simple as a bed or a chair – even one supplied by the NHS), which mightn’t actually add anything to one’s weekly cost of living.

The reason for the repeat performances were the wrecking amendments sent back to us by the House of Lords. I use the word ‘wrecking’ because they fundamentally undermined the purpose of the bill by tying any deportation up in interminable legal knots and appeals.\nGiven that a division can take up the best part of twenty minutes, to have to go through the division lobbies 18 times in an evening, is quite a demand on precious time. Of course, the rejoinder to that is that we ought to modernise our procedures and adopt instantaneous electronic voting.\nWell, such repeated voting happens very rarely, and the advantage of going through the division lobbies to vote is that it affords the opportunity to badger the PM and other senior ministers with issues that you want resolved.\nAnyway, the repeated ‘ping pong’ as the amendments went back and forth between the Lords and Commons generated a considerable correspondence from constituents. The bill is a popular one: overwhelmingly, voters want to see the small boats stopped. The ‘unhelpful’ amendments by the House of Lords filled my email inbox with demand for Lords reform, or even abolition.\nI am not an enthusiast for reform, and certainly not for abolition. More often than not, the Lords do a good job of scrutinising legislation in greater detail than the Commons ever have done for the last 25 years. We simply don’t give enough time to it. Overwhelmingly, most Lord’s amendments are accepted by the Commons without dispute.\nThere are four reasons why I don’t believe we will ever give over the time necessary for considered debate over Lords reform.\nFirst, there are always more pressing issues to deal with on the political agenda.\nSecond, whilst a part hereditary, part appointed House, is nothing that any of us would have designed were we starting from scratch. Nevertheless, it is there and, for the most part, works satisfactorily.\nThird, there is nothing approaching consensus of any kind with respect to what a reformed House of Lords should look like. The reality will never find sufficient agreement.\nFourth, MPs are jealous about their constituencies: they would never welcome an elected member of the Lords on their patch also claiming to represent their constituents.\nFifth, were we to elect the Lords, then the elected peers would have a legitimate demand for real political power.

  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_campaigns_water-fluoridisation-postcard-campaign/content_192.html": "The following is from a speech I made in the House of Commons in 1999 on the topic of water fluoridisation:\nThe existing state of the law governing the addition of fluoride to the water supply is most unsatisfactory. The water industry resents the discretion—and, therefore, the responsibility—that is placed upon it. Those who oppose the addition of fluoride to water resent very much the power and influence that is placed in the hands of health authorities and water companies. For my part, I share the natural suspicion of any free man with respect to the presumption of health professionals to decide what is good for me and whether or not I should consume it. Are we horses to be led to water and forced to drink?\nI am happy to take advice, from any informed source, about what may be good for me with respect to medicine or diet, but I reject utterly the notion that the decision about whether to consume should rest in any other mind than my own. However, it is not that philosophical question upon which I wish to dwell this evening.\nMy initiation of the debate results from the persistent lobbying of my constituent, Dr. Anthony Dunstan Fox, who practises in Barton-on-Sea. He has drawn my attention to the fact that fluoride compounds are a poison, so much so that I am persuaded that we should be taking considerable steps to remove fluoride compounds from our environment, not providing yet another source of them.\nThe state of the debate in this country is rather quaint. The Government pride themselves on their modernisations, so it is odd that we still appear to be addressing in this debate the preoccupations, fads and fashions of the 1960s and the 1970s. In the United States, for example, localities and cities are discontinuing their former policy of adding fluoride to the water. In Europe, that trend is equally apparent. Indeed, Germany—which is so much the model for the Government’s modernisations—has abandoned the policy of adding fluoride to the water.\nThat trend is a consequence of a growing consensus—a growing body of evidence—that fluoride compounds are a poison. In the United States, the Food and Drugs Administration has required since June 1997 the makers of any toothpaste product containing fluoride compounds to publish a health warning on the packaging. Consumers who ingest the product are advised to seek the advice of a poison control centre. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the Government’s most prominent scientists, toxicologists and lawyers, has voted unanimously to oppose any fluoridation of the water.\nThere is a growing volume of evidence of the poisonous consequences of fluoride compounds. In this brief debate, I cannot possibly do any justice to that evidence, nor am I qualified to do so, but I draw the attention of the House to the work of Dr. Phyllis Mollenix, the toxicologist at the Boston children’s hospital in Massachusetts. Her work attempts to define a causal relationship between the presence of fluoride products and changes in brain activity that may give rise to hyperactivity and learning difficulties. Hon. Members may be aware of the work of Professor Shusheela, who has tried to find a causal relationship between the presence of fluoride compounds in very small quantities and irritable bowel syndrome, anaemia, bone weaknesses, dental and skeletal fluorosis, genetic damage, still-birth and miscarriage.\nHowever, the medical establishment in this country is still wedded to the notion that fluoride compounds are good for us and should be put into the water supply. It is either unwilling or incapable of addressing the growing volume of evidence. That may be due to intellectual laziness, but if it is, it is strange that it is wedded to a campaigning zeal. Its unwillingness to consider the evidence goes back a long way. As far back as 1970, the British Dental Journal contained an article which stated:\n“Perhaps the greatest deterrent to meaningful political engagement of dentists in the promotion of water fluoridation is the mistaken but widespread assumption that to do so they must have full and complete knowledge of the detailed and voluminous scientific literature on the relationship of water fluoridation to dental and general health. They do not … as soon as dentists recognise their responsibility in the politics of fluoridation, their performance will be outstanding…the emphasis is on propagandising rather than education.”\nI doubt that any of the Government’s spin doctors could have put the point better. Indeed, it is an opinion of which Dr. Goebbels would have been proud.\nAll I can say about my party’s position on fluoridation is that it was inherited from the previous Administration. My party believes that there are benefits from fluoridation—a view I regard as curious—but the decision to add fluoride compounds to the water should be taken locally. I believe that it should be taken at a very local level—by the consumer. Whether any meaningful locality could be defined for the purposes of a water supply is problematical.\nI am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) for opening up the debate on this subject. He has asked the medical establishment—the British Medical Association in particular—to produce new evidence to prove that fluoride compounds are good for our dental and general health, and that they are not bad for us. I welcome his initiative but, when surfing the internet, I noted that the website of the pro-fluoridation lobby names him as one of its supporters. As I understand it, that is not his position, and I urge him to correct that.\nThe medical establishment clings to the tenuous belief that fluoride compounds are good for our dental and general health, despite the fact that the evidence is pretty thin. If fluoride compounds attack the bacteria that would otherwise decay our teeth, it is probably because they attack all living organisms, including us. I cannot imagine why any mammal would ingest fluoride compounds. They are pollutants and are increasingly evident in our environment largely as a result of industrial and agro-chemical processes, such as fertilisers. We should make strenuous efforts to remove those compounds from our environment rather than add another source. If we add fluoride to our water, it will be in our milk; it will be in our cereals; it will be in our vegetables; it will be in our soup; it will be in our tea; it will be in our beer.\nIt would be legitimate for the advocates of fluoride compounds to ask, “Where are the casualties? Where are the sick children, and the sick elderly people, who must be consequences of the fact that fluoride compounds are added to 10 per cent. of our water supply?” I would answer that question with another question: “What resources has the Minister’s Department—have we—put into identifying the victims? What new studies have we initiated to update ourselves about evidence of the damage that is being done by fluoride compounds?”\nIn that context, let me draw attention to the findings of Dr. Schatz. Dr. Schatz is no ordinary physician: he discovered streptomycin. In 1993, Dr. Schatz said that artificial fluoridation\n“may well dwarf the thalidomide tragedy, which was dramatic because it produced crippled children who are living testimonials to what that drug has done. Many victims of artificial fluoridation, on the other hand, die quietly during the first year of their lives, or at a later age under conditions where their deaths are attributed to some other cause.”\nI urge any water authority and any water company seeking to acquiesce to a health authority’s suggestion that fluoride should be added to water to bear those words in mind. I urge the Minister to consider them before introducing any measure that would ensure that my constituents and their children had to drink water to which fluoride compounds had been added.\nDS.",

The Government backs small businesses, including responsible short-term holiday letting, which brings significant investment to local communities. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the impact that large numbers of holiday lets concentrated in an area can have on local communities.\nThe Government’s proposed planning changes would see the introduction of a new national use class and, simultaneously, the introduction of a new permitted development right. The new permitted development right would provide flexibility where short-term lets are not a local issue and allow for this flexibility to be removed where there is a local concern. Any Article 4 direction to remove the permitted development right must be evidence based and should apply to the smallest geographical area possible, and could therefore be focused on those areas or streets that see the highest numbers of short-term lets, or individual properties.\nAs set out in the consultation document, when the use class comes into effect existing properties would fall into the short-term let use class where they met the definition or remain as C3 dwellinghouse. Any re-classification is not considered development and so property owners should not need to apply for planning permission where they meet the definition of short-term let. They would be classified as such and would not require planning permission.\nAs you may know, the Government has also consulted on plans for a short-term lets registration scheme. A registration scheme is important. Crucially, it will provide information to help local authorities enforce health and safety regulations and apply and enforce the planning changes.\nDS",

Clinicians, pregnancy services and any healthcare settings however, would remain bound by our present abortion laws which currently restrict terminations to within 24 weeks of pregnancy (except where specific exceptions apply). Given that 40% of abortions now take place at home with self-administration of what is referred to as ‘telemedicine’, the measure would introduce a two-tier system whereby a woman, acting on her own, can lawfully dispose of her unborn child right up until just before it would actually be born.\nPersonally, I find the prospect grotesque. I am not alone: Current polling indicates that only 1% of women support abortion up to birth. On the contrary, 70% actually support a reduction in the lawful time limit from the current 24 weeks.\nThose who demand absolute rights over their own bodies, neglect the fact that, where abortion is concerned, two bodies, two lives, are involved.\nGiven that this ‘Pandora’s box’ has been opened in New Clause 1 of this bill, those of us who have deep misgivings about the permissive nature of the current law will make our own attempts at amendments. We will seek to reduce the permitted 24-week window to a more realistic level in line with modern medicine’s ability to sustain life outside the womb, and we will seek to end the discrimination against Downs babies which currently allows them to be aborted up to 40 weeks.",

After all, I was for two years the minister responsible for it, but I have never been uncritical of it. It is precisely because I attach such importance to it, that I am horrified when any of it is wasted.\nWhen aid is wasted the damage is twofold: First in the ‘opportunity cost’ of the good use that it might otherwise have been put to; second because that waste, magnified by the press, undermines the whole case for such aid in the eyes of the public.\nLast week I saw press coverage criticising the fact that some of our aid was being used to support the Chinese film industry. Without having to read further, I knew the culprit: the ‘Prosperity Fund’.\nThis fund was set up by George Osborne when he was Chancellor and was given £1.5 billion to be disbursed over a five year period. I was one of the joint chairmen of the fund along with Greg Hands, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and Lord Price the Trade Minister. Its purpose was to use development aid to open up markets, from which there might subsequently arise opportunities to be exploited by UK enterprises.\n(The language had to be pretty tight because the expenditure remained governed by the International Development Act 2002 which requires that it be spent for the purpose of eradicating poverty.)\nThe other members of the board were ministers from spending departments across Whitehall. It was part of a strategy to reduce the proportion of development aid disbursed by the Department of International Development to only 75% of the total, and to divide the rest between Whitehall departments whose budgets were otherwise being severely cut.\nAlthough I ‘read the riot act’ to the board, pointing out the narrow definition of what can count as official development aid, and that government policy was not to tie aid to trade, and that all expenditure must be in accordance with the very limited provisions of the 2002 Act, and that departments would bear full responsibility for any projects that they sponsored, nevertheless I knew that I was watching a car crash in slow motion.\nIt was obvious to me that the sorts of markets that were going to generate subsequent opportunities for trade, were not going to be in the world’s most fragile, disordered, misgoverned, and poorest states; the sort of states that are in desperate need of jobs; the states that generate waves of migrants; the states that breed terrorism and grievance. These are the states where we need to deploy our aid, in our own national interest, in order that we can prosper in a more stable and peaceful world.\nRather, the targets of the fund, given its objectives, were bound to be in countries, though still qualifying for aid under international rules, were no longer what we would consider ‘poor’. It was in the rapidly developing economies of China, India, and Brazil that the fund’s opportunities would be found. And so it has proved.\nAfter years of denying to outraged constituents that we were giving aid to China, now apparently we are.\nA spectacular own goal.",

Nevertheless, I often found myself in disagreement with him.\nMy principal concern was that the success of his political party was dependent upon the destruction of my own Conservative Party.\nI have always regarded it as a strength of our voting system that it requires broad coalitions to come together as a political party to have any chance of success at the ballot box in a general election. Narrow, ‘single issue’ political parties have never succeeded in building the necessary breadth of support to triumph in our elections. My fear was always that significant support for Farage’s political party would be at the expense of the Conservative Party and that, whilst it would deny the Conservative Party the opportunity of winning and forming the Government, far from delivering success for his own party, on the contrary, it would deliver victory to parties with agendas that could not be more opposed to his own.\nNevertheless, though his political party was never in danger of winning, Nigel Farage has had a key role in our politics. Were it not for the threat that he posed to the success of the Conservative Party; I have no doubt that David Cameron would not have included a commitment to an in/out referendum on EU membership in his 2015 election manifesto. That commitment was designed explicitly to prevent Eurosceptic voters peeling off from the Conservatives to Nigel Farage.\nI believed that the commitment to a referendum was an absolute necessity if we were to have a chance of winning, but we wouldn’t have offered it were it not for the danger posed by Farage.\nI think it is safe to say that we would not have regained our national sovereignty had it not been for his intervention in our politics.\nNow, by being denied continued banking services by Coutts and Nat West Farage has, by the tenacity of his campaigning, exposed a growing threat to our liberty. It is an absolute outrage to discover that large public companies are acting as Orwellian thought police and withholding commercial services on the basis of their investigations.\nWhat I might believe is no business whatsoever of my bank. Its only proper concern is that my account is in credit, or if it isn’t, that they are being paid handsomely in recompense.\nIt is astonishing that the board Nat West Bank, so ready to trumpet its standards and values, should express its full confidence in its chief executive, after she has divulged client confidential (and false) information to a BBC Journalist to undermine Nigel Farage’s campaign. The board, by backing their chief executive, have made themselves culpable and should also resign.\nI doubt that shareholders in Nat West had any idea that the bank which they own had taken upon itself to censor the politics of its customers.\nIf my memory serves me correctly, it was in 2007 that we passed regulations that prevented any commercial undertaking from discriminating against customers on the basis of their sexual orientation. Clearly, we now need to go further and prevent enterprises from discriminating on the basis of a customer’s lawful political activity: My politics is no more the business of my bank, than what I do in bed.\nWell Done, Nigel Farage",

We aren’t consumed with worry about disease, slums, and malnutrition, so instead have resources to care about the environment and to demand political action from our democratic systems to address it.\nFor Example: Notwithstanding that our coasts and rivers are cleaner than they have been for years, every time a storm overflow discharges into the river Avon I get scores of emails demanding action, and that sort of political pressure drives the eye-watering £60 Billion investment now planned.\nEqually London was often ground to a halt by smog and fog so thick they were called ‘pea soupers’ it led to political action and the Clean Air Act.\nWhere is the campaign for clean air in Beijing?\nPeople who are worried about where their next meal is coming from, or about dying from malaria, are not in a position to be concerned about the extinction of endangered species or potentially rising water levels driven by climate change. And even if they were, they don’t enjoy the political freedoms and property rights that capitalism promotes, in order to demand a remedy\nSome comparisons: In the 198ies Total Green House Gas emissions in the USSR, with an economy a fraction of the USA generated, at the most conservative estimate, at least one and a half times as much pollution as the USA per unit of GNP.\nEast Germany provides an example as a socialist-capitalist contrast with West Germany. Before it folded, CO2 emissions in the German Democratic Republic were almost twice the West German level, in per capita terms – astonishing when compared to how much richer the German Federal Republic was.\nWhen the Soviet system collapsed, the enormity of environmental degradation became apparent including the disappearance of the Aral Sea, perhaps one of the worst environmental disasters, and directly attributable to socialist planning.\nI do not contend that Capitalism is an environmentalist’s paradise. Of course there are plenty of examples of capitalist excess that we need to address through regulation, as Adam Smith sets out in Book 5 of The wealth of Nations. This is why property rights, contract, rule of law, a free press, and democratic oversight are essential components of Capitalism.\nBut the present danger is this:\nA New puritanism is out to rob you of your liberty. To coerce you into giving up meat, to confine you to 15 minute cities, to take away the convenience and liberation of your own car, restrict you to public transport, stop you enjoying international travel.\nBut let’s be clear. We account for about 1% of Co2 emissions. Were we to stop at once, it would make no difference to climate change. The future of emissions will be determined in Latin America, India and China. Currently they have other priorities,\nRemember Alok Sharma in tears closing COP 26 when he thought he had unanimous agreement to abandon coal – but they pulled the plug on him at the last moment\nWhy?\nBecause their people are, per capita, much poorer, so they attach a much greater priority to increasing consumption. If you were poor your priorities would be exactly the same.\nAs Bill Gates points out in How to avoid a Climate Disaster, the solution lies in the technologies that enable us to enjoy increasing prosperity whilst repairing the damage to the planet’s climate.\nWhere socialist planning has sought to catch-up by investing in industrial espionage and the theft of intellectual property. It is the initiative and enterprise of capitalist economies that are the essential engines of innovation and technological advance,\nThis is Capitalism’s greatest strength, and frankly, without it we have no chance!\nOn the contrary, Capitalism -far from being the problem – it is the solution.\n[In the student debate Capitalism won – by a very comfortable margin]",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_category_ds-blog_page_19/content_557.html": "I’ve received a considerable correspondence characterised by bitterness and unpleasantness, Happily, it isn’t from my own constituents. Strangely, most of it appears to come from Scotland. I think stems from an account in the Glasgow Herald about a question I asked in the Commons a full a week before their article.\nThe gist of the correspondence is that I am a fool (and that is putting it rather more charitably than the emails do) for having voted for Brexit, only now to complain about bureaucracy at the borders.\nI’m afraid they’ve got quite the wrong end of the stick. My complaint was one about our own lack of urgency in implementing time-saving digital systems to replace paper. After all, we have -as part of our international development effort- implemented those systems in Africa to promote seamless trade within that continent.\nWe can get our own house in order, then we’d be in a position to challenge Europe’s level of ambition.\nFor the avoidance of any doubt, my support for Brexit is undiminished.\nUkraine 2\nSeveral correspondents have written to demand the imposition of a ‘no-fly zone’ over Ukraine as we did to prevent Saddam terrorizing the Kurds in Iraq.\nThe difference is simple: Saddam did not have Putin’s capability to press the nuclear button and vaporise us in nanoseconds.\nA NATO no-fly zone over Ukraine would require us to shoot down Russian aircraft that violated it: we would be at war with Russia, with all the consequences that Putin has indicated will follow.\nOne of the military mysteries of the Russian invasion, thus far at least, has been the very limited use they have made of their huge superiority of their air force in both numbers and technical sophistication. Suggestions to explain this range from a shortage of precision weapons (after a prolonged campaign in Syria), to lack of training in the complex field of mounting a large-scale operation co-ordinated with ground forces. In this respect operations in Syria have been confined to single aircraft or pairs of them, which is how they are being deployed in Ukraine. They have yet to mount operations to take and maintain control of the skies.\nSimilarly, the use of their superior numbers in tanks and other ‘state-of-the- art’ armoured vehicles has also been unimpressive. They have been snarled-up in huge traffic jams on roads, bogged down in mud when off-road, breaking down and running out of fuel. It is tempting to conclude that they just aren’t particularly good.\nIn the nineteen seventies our intelligence was that we faced the USSR’s highly trained and motivated military machine and that we had no hope of halting their advance -that’s why NATO would not subscribe to the undertaking of ‘no first use’ of nuclear weapons: We believed that our only chance of holding the advance was to use our battlefield nuclear capability.\nWhen the USSR disintegrated internally, the shortcomings of our intelligence was exposed: their military was nothing like as formidable as we had been led to believe.\nPerhaps that is still true of the Russian Bear.\nPay Rise\nI have received quite a correspondence condemning the 2.7 % pay rise for MPs.\nMy reply is simple: “Not me Guv”; For over a decade MP’s pay has been set by an independent body using a formula linking it to the level of pay in the public sector.\nIs the independent body making a reasonable fist of it, or is it being too generous?\nWell, if you average out the pay increases they have awarded us over the last decade it works out at 2.9% per year, which may be generous but not excessive. The important thing is that it is significantly below the rate of inflation. Hopefully, this will give a lead in pay negotiations: it is essential not to build inflationary expectations if we are to bring inflation under control.\nAs an aside, given the column inches given to the MP pay award in the newspapers, when David Cameron’s Coalition Government came to power in 2010, with very stretched public finances, it immediately cut all ministerial pay by 5% and then froze it for 5 years. This received no press coverage at all -funny that.\nNorthern Ireland Protocol\nIn my column of 12 June last year Making Beds (desmondswaynemp.com) I explained the rationale for agreeing the Northern Ireland Protocol in order to leave the EU with a trade agreement, despite knowing its faults. Basically, it was workable with goodwill and flexibility , but unfortunately neither have been forthcoming.\nI am surprised at the venom of correspondence from constituents who voted REMAIN and now demand that we forgo our right to unilaterally override the Protocol under the provisions set out in Article 16. It would appear that they still identify with the interests of the EU rather than the UK. They demand that we stick rigidly to the Protocol which we agreed to. What they fail to appreciate is that Article 16 is part of that very Protocol and we have every right to make use of it.\nFurthermore, a close reading of the Protocol reveals that it was always designed to be open to replacement by new arrangements and new use of technology.\nThe current way that the Protocol is implemented is undermining the stability of Northern Ireland, and that we cannot allow to continue.\nUkraine\nRussia is continually being warned by western powers that invading Ukraine is massive strategic error. That will depend however, on what his strategy actually is, and the extent to which we are successful in responding.\nIt is worth considering our own strategic errors.\nThe first was Ukraine’s own decision to unilaterally give up its nuclear arsenal in return for a guarantee of its territorial integrity and sovereignty in the Budapest Memorandum signed in December 1994.\nI grant that it would have been extremely difficult and expensive for Ukraine to have held on to those weapons, which it had inherited from the former Soviet Union. Nevertheless, had it retained but a fraction of the arsenal it would not be facing its own extinction as an independent nation state, because the assurance of mutual destruction would be a sufficient deterrent to their attacker. There is a lesson for us in this.\nOur own strategic mistake was, together with our allies, to fail to define our objectives in Afghanistan and an exit strategy from the very start of our intervention there. The consequent chaos and humiliation of our withdrawal sent a powerful message to both Moscow and Beijing about our weakness, divisions and lack of resolve. That perception in Moscow has had consequences for Ukraine.\nHow we now respond to Russian action against Ukraine will be closely watched in Beijing and, depending on our resolve, may have consequences for Taiwan.\nAnother party…and a riot ?\nI have always had constituents who are regular correspondents. Several send me a daily email. A couple send me several emails every day and one sends them throughout the night as well.\nThe number of repeat emailers has increased significantly during ‘party-gate’, presumably to wear me down until I agree with them, notwithstanding that -as I’ve said in this column- I’ll be keeping my own counsel.\nWhen I first heard the PM tell the House of Commons that there were no parties, a shudder went down my spine. Not because I didn’t believe him, but because I was sure that, what he honestly considered to be ‘work events’, others would judge to be parties.\nThe extent of the gulf between these two very different perceptions will only be revealed when we have the facts. That is why I insist on reserving judgement until we get the full account of what took place: when the police investigation concludes and Sue Gray can reveal all the detail that she knows.\nThis week several correspondents have emailed me the latest photograph of the PM at a party; “banged to rights”; “guilty as charged”. How can I any longer hide behind the excuse of awaiting the outcome of the inquiry when the evidence is before my eyes and in full colour…”of course the photo proves he is a liar -there he is actually at the party!”\nAs I look at the photo all I see is the PM standing in an office together with two colleagues, one of whom is seated in front of a screen (apparently he was hosting a workplace Christmas quiz over zoom). It is true that the fellow seated is sporting a string of tinsel and there is an open bottle of Champagne on the table. Nevertheless, if this ‘shock new revelation’ is the best they’ve got, then the PM would appear to be off the hook: it was no party.\nNo doubt, there is plenty more evidence for the police to sift through and which Sue Gray has yet to reveal to us. I will be patient and await the outcome.\nPublic commentary on broadcast media is even more vitriolic than some of my emails. Take, for example, the furore over Sir Keir Starmer escaping from a howling mob, outraged by his alleged failure to prosecute Jimmy Saville and -by implication in the commentary- they were clearly orchestrated by the PM’s remarks.\nHaving examined the footage for myself, they were only a handful of anti-vaxers led by Piers Corbyn; I heard them shouting, demanding to know why Sir Keir hadn’t backed Julian Assange; why he has abandoned the working class; why he has embraced the ‘new world order’ -whatever that may be.\nYes, there was a shout about Saville, but the notion that the activities of this bunch had been motivated by ill-chosen remarks from the PM is a measure of just how hysterical our broadcast news reporting has become.\nThe Calculation\nPreviously In this column Parties (desmondswaynemp.com) I described my original detachment from the PM’s difficulties, because I voted against all the rules of which he had fallen foul. I also explained the confusion between regulation and guidance and how it applied differently between dwellings and places of work: I am confident that the PM is clear in his own mind that he attended work events rather than parties.\nThe difficulty is that the public perception is of serial rule breaking in Downing Street and even more important, that the PM has not been straight with Parliament about it.\nI use the word ‘perception’ because we have yet to have see full facts from either Sue Gray or now, the Metropolitan Police. We are reliant on the hyperbole of journalists who were not present. A ‘prosecco-fuelled party’ might just have been a restrained glass of wine amongst properly distanced work colleagues in an office where they lawfully worked together. Access to the facts is important.\nAlso important, particularly for politicians reliant on the support of voters, is the public perception of these events, and that perception may already be settled opinion.\nThe calculation with which Conservative members of Parliament must wrestle is whether the PM is capable of regaining public trust and the authority to govern. He has, after all, managed it previously: My correspondence was equally large and angry following his failure to sack Dominic Cummings after his ‘eye-test’ at Barnard Castle. Yet he re-established a ten-point poll lead. Could he repeat the feat, or has he irretrievably trashed his brand?\nThey also need to consider the unpredictability of the outcome if they initiate the process of replacing the PM.\nThere remain dedicated and enthusiastic supporters of Boris in Parliament, in the voluntary Conservative party and amongst the Public: I know this because hundreds of them have emailed me. I recall, my own anger and bitterness when parliamentarians jettisoned Mrs Thatcher, which had consequences which lasted years.\nA member of the public put it to me yesterday, that it would be absurd to remove a strong charismatic leader at such a time of national and international danger. It is a proper consideration.\nBoris won a general election and delivered Brexit as promised. Does his parliamentary party owe him loyalty for having delivered them from the chaos of the 2017-19 Parliament, or has he become an embarrassment and permanent liability?\nA number of my parliamentary colleagues are loathe to give satisfaction to the broadcast journalists who always opposed Brexit and are out for revenge. Equally, they know they are receiving a significant number of template letters whose authors claim to have hitherto always voted conservative – when they know full well that it often isn’t true.\nAll these things weigh on the mind.\nTo save anyone asking however, I’ll be keeping my own counsel\n4-Day Week\nThe numbers of unemployed workers are back down to the sort of levels that we experienced before Covid-19 struck and the number of vacancies is at an all-time high.\nNevertheless, before the pandemic we also had record levels of employment too. Now however, we have about a million fewer workers at work. If we accept rough estimates that some 500,000 Europeans have returned to the continent, then that leaves us struggling to explain why half a million people have become economically inactive. Is it that the experience of lock-down and furlough have left them disinclined to return to the stress of the workplace and that they place a higher value on their time away from it? Might a shorter working week tempt them back to work? The demand for a shorter working week with no loss of pay has been on the agenda of the political left for some time. Most people recognise however, that it is economic suicide unless accompanied by greater productivity in the worked hours to compensate. A shorter working week will not suit many enterprises: Most of us will have experienced the frustration of enquiring about an important piece of work, only to discover that the key person to speak to is on leave. Adding 52 further such days per year on which that might occur with a 4-day week, would not necessarily make for greater productivity. Nevertheless, there may be enterprises which could cope well with a shorter week. In 1976 I worked in a factory that operated a three-day week. Initially they had been forced to do so, as everyone had, during the Miner’s Strike of 1973-4. When the strike was over and the 5-day week was restored however, this particular company -having discovered just how much more productive they had become during the national emergency measure- carried on with just the 3 days working.A trial for a four-day week is due to run for six months later this year if 30 or so companies can be recruited to participate. Employees will get 100% of their previous pay for 80% of their previous hours in exchange for 100% of their previous productivity. Academics from Oxford & Cambridge will monitor performance – but not nearly as closely, I expect, as the boards of directors will.\nI am sceptical because my experience was of a manufacturing unit. I ‘m not convinced that the model will work for our largely service based economy, but if firms are willing to experiment, the results may be interesting. Of one thing I’m certain however, it certainly wouldn’t work in the Commons.Beastly Whips\nI was surprised by the accounts of strong-arm tactics by Government whips. I know too many of them well and they are not unpleasant and aggressive ladies and gentlemen.\nI was myself a whip both in opposition and in Government and over the course of the decades I witnessed the waning of their influence.\nMy whip asks me how I plan to vote rather than telling me. It’s not unreasonable for me to let him know, so that he can at least get the responsible minister to address my reservations and see if he can persuade me with reasonable argument.\nThat one might believe a threat to turn off government largesse in one’s constituency strikes me as highly improbable. Government expenditure just doesn’t work like that. You’d have to be quite gullible to believe any such threat.\nSlightly more plausible would be a threat to stymie your prospects of becoming a minister, or other parliamentary career opportunity, were you flout the whip. Nevertheless, even that threat has diminished over recent years. There was a time when the Party Leader would focus on Cabinet appointments and leave the junior ministerial ranks to the Chief Whip to decide, but those days have gone. Equally, the appointment of so many serial rebels to high office has made nonsense of the notion that promotion is dependent on obedience.\nThe appointment to sit on Commons Select Committees, or to be Chairman of any of them was, until recently, entirely in the gift of party whips, giving them significant patronage and leverage. That however, was reformed under the Cameron premiership and those positions are now elected, removing another potential weapon from the armoury of the whips.\nThere have been other factors at work too which have led to more independence of mind among MPs.\nFirst, the ease of electronic communication has given MPs much more exposure to the opinions and influence of their constituents. It also provides a useful network for like-minded MPs to encourage one another under the radar in any potential rebellion.\nFinally, the opening-up of candidate selection processes to more democratic procedures, such as open primaries, introduced number of MPs who considered that it was more their own personal ‘brand’ rather than their party brand that won the day and, in turn, they exhibited a greater measure of independence. Though they were few in number, their attitude was very infectious.\nThe notion that whipping can influence a leadership challenge is just complete nonsense and it is secrecy makes nonsense of it. Whatever you may tell your whip, or anyone else for that matter, only The Chairman of the 1922 Committee ever knows if you really sent in a letter, and only you yourself will know how you voted in any subsequent ballot.\nIt’s a bit like the constituent who stopped me the other day and told me he’d only vote for me at the next election if I voted for a particular candidate after a leadership challenge. No doubt he trusted me to tell him who I voted for in any such ballot, but how would I ever know that he’d fulfilled his part of the bargain at the next election?\nWith whipping, I think we almost got to the position where, if you want to win, then you’ve got to win the argument. Which in a democracy, is no bad thing.\nParties\nI voted against the regulations that deprived of us of so much of our liberty during the various iterations of lock-down over the last couple of years.\nI also spent a significant amount of time explaining the regulations to constituents, advising them and answering their questions about what they were permitted to do. This was particularly the case for so many self-employed constituents who were unclear as to whether they could continue working. The principal difficulty was confusion between what was regulation and what was only guidance. This even confused police officers, with people being told to stop doing things which, in fact, they were entitled to do.\nI rather think that Sue Gray’s inquiry into parties in Downing Street will focus on this distinction between regulation and guidance and, in particular, the fact that Number 10 is a place of work and not a dwelling, where the rules were quite different.\nIf this does indeed turn out to be the Monopoly “get out of jail free card”, I fear it just won’t wash because the distinction between regulation and guidance was never clear in the minds of the public in the first place.\nAs far as they are concerned it looks like one rule for us and another for everyone else.\nA significant danger for the PM, were he to be exonerated by Sue Gray’s inquiry, is that some new allegation then hits the headlines.\nI have received a huge correspondence on this whole business, representing a number of different points of view. I’ve said I will reflect on all that constituents have said to me -and I will.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 17\n- 18\n- 19\n- 20\n- 21\n- …\n- 59\n- Next Page »",

They improve air quality, store carbon and benefit the rural economy. An important habitat in their own right, they act as wildlife corridors and enhance our cultural and national heritage.\nNow we have left the EU and the Transition Period is over, the Government is able to reward farmers for the work they do to sustainably manage every metre of hedgerow on their land in a way that is right for their area. Part of the sustainable farming incentive is the hedgerow standard, under which ministers will pay farmers to plant more hedgerows, leave them uncut or raise the cutting height. To provide habitat for wildlife, farmers and land managers will be incentivised to maintain and plant more hedgerow trees. I know that simple actions like planting trees within the footprint of existing hedges can make a big difference.\nHedgerows are legally protected by the Hedgerows Regulations 1997 which prohibit their removal without first seeking approval from the local planning authority. The authority is required to decide whether a hedgerow is ‘important’ according to the Regulations and should not be removed. Research has indicated that over 70 per cent of hedgerows in England and Wales are ‘important’. The Regulations therefore play a valuable role in providing statutory protection for a large proportion of hedgerows in the countryside. When granting planning permission, a local authority has the power to impose enforceable conditions on a developer in order to protect hedges or trees assessed as being worthy of retention, which might otherwise be harmed by construction or the new land use.\nDS.",

There was a great furore from the ‘great and good’ over what they willfully misconstrued as a proposal for eugenics.\nThe problem however, remains. From time to time foster parents visit my surgeries to discuss aspects of the difficulties that they face. I often reflect on the work that so many of these amazing people do in trying to repair much of the damage that the natural parents have inflicted. Some children are born already damaged by their parents’ lifestyle. Others, at the age of five still cannot walk, talk, or are not toilet trained because they have spent their lives strapped in a buggy placed in front of the TV.\nThe tragedy is that so much of a child’s future prospects are determined by the attention and affection received in the early weeks of life, a truth dwelt on by Andrea Leadsom at the hustings in her aborted bid for the Tory Leadership this summer.\nRecently local campaigners for 70/30 came to my surgery: their aim is to demonstrate that we can reduce child maltreatment by 70% by the year 2030 through a proper prevention strategy.\nThe damage done to children by maltreatment costs the UK taxpayer £ billions in social services and other costs as these children go on to struggle with problems in later life. The 70/30 approach is to prevent maltreatment to children before it happens by investing resources to tackle the root causes. These might be maternal mental health problems, domestic violence, drug abuse or a whole host of other issues affecting parents. Early, effective support could help them deal with these problems before they get out of control. This might mean a mum-to-be who is struggling with her mental health – where the right support could make all the difference to her ability to cope. Or it might mean a couple who have unhealthy tension in their relationship – helping them to get things back on the right track prevents the severe stress a baby experiences in a tense or violent home.\nThe challenge is to get people thinking ahead to the point that we can really start seeing prevention as something urgent, not just something that would be nice to work on once we have finished intervening where things have already gone wrong. In fact, that is the whole point. We will never finish intervening until we have stopped things from going wrong in the first place. To use an analogy from WAVE Trust, the charity behind the 70/30 campaign, if your taps are on and your sink is overflowing, you will never finish mopping up unless you stop to turn the taps off.\nI certainly support the campaign.

Our services will be unchanged with the guard continuing to open the doors.\nIt is the new trains that will come into service for the suburban lines that are the cause of the dispute. SWR has given assurances that guards will continue to be rostered for every one of these trains but that the driver will operate the doors whilst the guard in involved with other safety and ‘customer-facing’ services.\nWhen I met senior executives of SWR last week I urged them to give way and let the guards operate the doors. After all, they have accepted that each train will still have two members of staff. So, is it worth a strike, just over which one of them operates the doors?\nI pointed out that on our own London to Weymouth service the guard is quite capable of doing both the ‘customer-facing’ duties and operating the doors.\nThey responded by pointing out that on the suburban services there is much more opening and closing of doors, with shorter gaps. They insisted that it would be quicker and more efficient to let the driver do it, after all that’s the way the new trains were designed to be operated. They were absolutely clear that there was no need for the strike, given their willingness to continue to negotiate and the pledges they have made on jobs, and I certainly agree with that.\nOf course, we used to open and close the doors ourselves!",

Spent in the region, our money goes much further and helps many more people than it can in Europe. Given the needs of millions, I do not believe that the solution can be resettlement for just thousands.\nNever the less, in addition to existing asylum arrangements, the Government is committed to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees in the UK. Of the 1000 refugees already re-settled under this new scheme in the run up to Christmas, half were children, and this proportion is likely to be maintained. With respect to unaccompanied children however, the advice of the United Nations agencies is that they are better off remaining in the region where they have a chance of being reunited with their extended families. In cases where the UN clearly believes this is not the case and that remaining within the region puts them in greater danger, we have said that we will welcome them. We have not put a number on it, but I would anticipate something in the low hundreds.\nThe controversial argument continues with respect to what to do about unaccompanied children who have already made it to the European mainland. There is an argument that, having reached the safety of Europe, we have to give priority to others remaining in the region who are more vulnerable. Clearly however, as we can plainly see on our TV screens, they are sometimes in conditions in some parts of Europe that we would never tolerate in the UK. Accordingly, we have allocated £10 million to alleviate those conditions.\nFundamentally, the problem is that, if we agree to resettle refugees who are already in Europe, we send a powerful signal to others to pay the traffickers and attempt an all too often fatal crossing. It was for this reason, to break the business model of the traffickers, that we decided to take refugees for resettlement direct from the region and not from Europe. The same applies to unaccompanied children: giving them priority will encourage more parents to send their children ahead, and alone.\nThe problem is heart-breaking, we have to address it, but in doing so we must ensure that we are not making it worse.",

It’s a preoccupation of mine and I’ve spoken at universities a dozen times about it in the last three years.\nI accept however, that my constituents have more pressing concerns: my email inbox is populated, not by outrage about denying of freedom of expression, but concern about fuel bills because the new government has chosen to withdraw winter fuel payments from 10 million pensioners.\nThe Government insists that this is because it has inherited the worst economic situation since the Second World War. This is rubbish. The worst inheritance -by a country mile- was in 2010, when the Coalition Government arrived to a note from the outgoing Labour administration stating that ‘there is no money left’.\nOn the contrary, political commentators continue to castigate Rishi for not having delayed the election until after the glowing economic data, including the fastest growth among the richest nations, -and which arrived after polling day- had been published.\nI accept that there are all sorts of problems faced by the UK, which are common to all the developed nations, consequent upon the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. But being in government is about making choices.\nThe public finances were tight. There was no scope for a public spending spree. On the contrary, there was need for restraint and retrenchment. There was, however, no black hole. The new government could not have been taken by surprise: they had, in accordance with our constitutional conventions, access to the most senior civil servants from the beginning of this year – they were able to ask anything. The Office For Budget Responsibility audited the public finances just before the election, they reported no black hole.\nJust four days before the Chancellor’s announcement about her discovery of the black hole, she presented to Parliament the Estimates for Public Expenditure, by law these have to be the best estimates of the public finances that can be had, signed off by ministers and the most senior civil servants. But no black hole was reported.\nOf course, now there is indeed a black hole. That hole is one that the Government has chosen to dig itself, by giving in to public sector pay demands without any attempt to negotiate improvements in productivity. The Government has chosen to pay for this first, by withdrawing winter fuel payments from 10 million pensioners. And second, by undisclosed tax increases to be announced in October.\nThe Chancellor insists that the pensioners who really need the winter fuel payments will continue to receive them because they are already in receipt of means-tested benefits.\nIn this respect she fails to understand the psyche of pensioners who, despite many publicity campaigns, do not claim the means-tested Pension Credit for which they would qualify.\nMany pensioners on very modest incomes, regard their pension, quite properly, as something to which they are entitled because they always ‘paid their stamp’. To have to apply for a means-tested benefit however, presents a very different psychological hurdle.\nWithdrawing winter fuel payments from these vulnerable pensioners is a choice by the Government.\nIt is our choices in life which define us, not our inheritance.",

Nevertheless, I am not the personal ambassador or advocate for any my constituents.\nThough I typically receive 200 emails per day, they are overwhelmingly for the same correspondents.\nMy responsibility is to all my constituents, the vast majority of whom have never expressed any opinion to me at all, save through the ballot box. It would be entirely wrong were I to know-tow to the opinions of those. who shout loudest or longest.\nThe chief duty that I owe to my constituents is the exercise of my judgement in the debates and decisions in Parliament.\nOf course, I am influenced by arguments and experience that constituents bring to my attention, but when I differ, they often complain that I ignored them.

They have only been tested on their ability to reduce the severity of the recipient’s reaction to a dose of the virus. So, the rationale for having the vaccination is to protect yourself, we do not know if it will protect others from you.\nNotwithstanding the irrationality of excluding non-vaccinated patrons from premises, does our respect for the property rights of proprietors nevertheless extend to allowing them to exercise their right to exclude any customers, however irrational: I don’t think so. As a society we have moved beyond such an elevated view of the rights of property. For years now, equality legislation has constrained the rights of commercial undertaking from discriminating against categories of customers of whom they may disapprove. The unvaccinated should not be so excluded either.\nThe vaccination process is going to be a long haul until a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated to afford us ‘herd immunity’. I suspect it may well take until the summer or longer. So, I do nor depart from the position that I originally took, and still urge on the Government: Namely, that the virus is not particularly dangerous to anyone outside the groups with specific vulnerabilities, so it would have been much more proportionate to have designed measures to protect them, rather than to have imposed measures on everyone with truly devastating economic and other consequences.\nThe statistical basis upon which the most damaging restrictions were made have always, in my opinion, been highly suspect. Now government itself has had to recognise that decisions were made on an insecure foundation. On 30 October the Office for National Statistics reported that infection had doubled between 2nd October, and 17 October -from 4.89 infected people per 10,000 to 9.52 infected people per 10,000. It was on this alarming basis that a second national lockdown was imposed upon us. Well, they have now revised that estimate of 17 Oct right back down, and that the rate never went above 6.62 people per 10,000 and that wasn’t until well into the lockdown on 12 November.",

To be fair, a couple of my oldest Remainer friends won’t any longer speak to me -holding me personally responsible for our leaving the EU, an honour I certainly can’t claim – but they are rare and the choice is theirs, not mine.\nI’m confident that political ideology has never been much of a barrier when it comes to convivial personal relationships.\nI am therefore, all the more bemused by the way that the PM’s coterie of former advisers- despite sharing exactly the same ideological outlook and policy goals, have fallen out with one another so spectacularly to the extent that they clearly now hate each other’s guts.\nAs to the substance of some of the fallout from this, I can’t get excited about it. I am neither surprised nor alarmed that Sir James Dyson texted the PM, and that the PM sought to accommodate his reasonable requests in what was clearly the national interest.\nObviously I do not have one iota of the influence that the PM wields, yet friends, acquaintances and people of whom I have never previously heard, who have got hold of my mobile number or my email address, lobby me to wield what little influence I do have in their own particular interest.\nThe key point is that, in responding, I act in the interest of all my constituents when deciding how to accommodate them. I consider the process is proper so long as I do not become prisoner to any particular lobby: The measure of what is appropriate, must be what is in the national interest.\nAs the furore about leaks escalates, I recall David Cameron (whose parliamentary private secretary I was for 7 years) expressing his frustration at yet another leak of sensitive inter-departmental correspondence -properly handled through civil servants- expressing his frustration and asking “why can’t ministers just talk to one another?”\nCertainly, that was the way that I always operated. I recall a difficult meeting in a foreign capital where my ministerial counterpart was refusing to co-operate with a UK policy objective because another UK department of state was making difficulties over a quite unrelated issue. I couldn’t understand the fussy objections of my civil servants when, after the meeting, I got back into our car and simply phoned the responsible minister back in London to get it sorted out.\nNow as a back-bencher and having acquired so many mobile phone numbers during my time at number 10 and as a minister, when a constituent raises a time-sensitive issue with me, if I consider it important enough I will, of course, properly send correspondence to a minister’s private office, but I’ll also text or phone that minister to lobby them, or I’ll even bend their ear at breakfast in the Commons Tea Room.\nThis is the stuff of ordinary life. I believe in business they now call it ‘networking’.\nAs the photos of the various former aids, now at war, stare out at me from the Sunday papers, am I alone in thinking that they would do better dress properly and have a shave?",

The publication of the tackling violence against women and girls strategy will make progress towards ensuring that women and girls are safe everywhere – at home, online and on the streets. The strategy will increase support for victims and survivors, increase the number of perpetrators brought to justice and to reduce the prevalence of violence against women and girls in the long-term.\nSince the publication of the Hate Crime Action Plan in 2016 there has been an increase in reporting and improvements in identification and recording of crime by the police. However, rates of attrition within the criminal justice system remain worryingly high and targeted online abuse continues to present a significant problem. While in contrast to overall trends, under-reporting still exists within specific groups.\nYou may be aware of the wide-ranging Law Commission review into hate crime. The review, which has now been published, includes a number of recommendations around levelling up the protection for disability and LGBT victims, tackling sex and gender abuse, and protecting freedom of expression. The Government is currently reviewing the report and recommendations and I look forward to its full response in due course.\nWhile this is not making misogyny a hate crime, it can inform longer-term decisions once the Government has considered the recommendations made by the Law Commission.",

We have seen that happen before from flu and Norovirus, with scenes of ambulances queuing at A&E and patients being treated on trollies. Clearly, measures need to be taken to avoid it. Not locking-down would have been a risk, in my judgement a risk worth taking given the huge damage that the lock-down will cause. Nevertheless, I was on the losing side when it came to the vote, and that’s democracy.\nModern liberal democracy however, has come to mean much more that rule by majority. It includes the rule of law, due process, fundamental liberties such as freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of worship.\nIt is with regard to these values that I find the response to Coronavirus so shocking and worrying. The British people appear to have quietly shrugged it off as these liberties have been swept aside. The state has taken all the coercive powers of the law to tell us where we may go, whom we may meet, what we must wear, and to outlaw protests.\nOn that last count, even more sinister, is the way that the organs of the totalitarian state reach out to go beyond even what has been proscribed: I have received representations from intensive care doctors who have been warned that their employment is in jeopardy because they have expressed doubts about the lock-down policy.\nInstead of a rising chorus of protest against these enormities we are informed by pollsters, on the contrary, that the appetite of the people is for even more draconian measures. I am appalled.\nOur liberties did not come cheaply, they were bought by the struggles of our forebears, many of whom died in the pursuit of freedom.\nI am informed by my critics that I have failed to appreciate that the preservation of life itself is more important than liberty: ‘life at all costs’. I wonder to what extent such an overriding imperative is the product of the decline of religious belief.\nHappily a large number of elderly and vulnerable people have written to me with a quite different perspective.

As I said to ministers when I visited Israel recently, they aren’t giving us much to work with.\nThere are however, individuals and organisations in Israeli civil society who have the same concerns that were shared with me last week.

It is a strategy of clutching at any straw that happens to come to hand.\nTheir Lordships and the Opposition in the Commons will take every opportunity to delay. The Article 50 bill has, so far, proved something of a disappointment to them in this respect, but they are salivating at the prospect of the Government’s statute of repeal shortly to begin its long and tortuous progress.\nThe longer they can delay, the longer there is for the public to tire and to lose interest. The longer there is for cold winds to blow from elsewhere, for events to intervene, after all, we live in an increasingly unpredictable world.\nThe parliamentary opponents hide behind the need for ‘proper’ scrutiny, but their strategy is really one of delay and desperation. Democracy demands that they retain their freedom to continue to argue and that the voters made a mistake, but to delay the implementation of the properly made decision of the voters is a denial of democracy.

We rarely apply such a restriction to anyone else in society, so I’m not yet persuaded that it should apply to MPs. The argument for making such an exclusive arrangement for MPs would not necessarily be that they won’t give enough time an attention to their ‘proper job’ because that might apply to anyone with a second job. Rather, a more persuasive reason for excluding MPs from the possibility of ‘moonlighting’ would be that their other remunerated interests might unduly influence them when legislating. The way to deal with this possibility is to require full disclosure and to outlaw advocacy and lobbying. This is exactly what the current rules do. Of course, there will always be scope for some tightening up, but as we’ve seen recently, the penalty for breaking the existing rules can be devastating.\nA hundred or so MPs are on the Government payroll: In addition to their duties as MPs they have very demanding jobs as ministers -for which they are quite properly paid. In my opinion they are not paid nearly enough for the hours that they work and the responsibilities that they carry. It seems to me absurd that we pay the Prime Minister only £79,000 (in addition to the £82,000 we pay him for being an MP) which compares very unfavourably with senior roles in industry and the public services.\nGiven that we accept that MPs can have second jobs as ministers, it would be rather unfair to exclude the possibility of additional earning for extra responsibilities for MPs who are not ministers. That is why we don’t. On the contrary, MPs who are selected to chair legislative standing committees, select committees, or the Commons itself as Speaker and deputy speakers are paid for it.\nIf we accept that MPs, in addition to their responsibility to represent their constituents, have time to carry out these functions and be paid for them. Why should they not also do so by carrying on -in moderation- their former professions as nurses, doctors, dentists, lawyers, accountants, or whatever?\nIn Parliament we have all of the above, and we are better off for it. We are better informed by having professionals who are still up to date in their fields with their finger on the pulse with what is happening in industry, business and the NHS.\nI think it would be a great shame if we were to become a class of professional politicians increasingly detached from the experience and expertise of life outside Parliament.\nAs for independence of mind, as a whip, I always found it much more difficult to lean on MPs for whom their political career was not the ‘be-all and end-all’ and who had other professional interests to fall back on.\nIt seems to me that the greater danger is not that we are too open to undue influence, but rather that we would excluding from our deliberations people of great knowledge and ability, who might command significantly greater remuneration elsewhere. In short, the danger is mediocrity.\nOf course the solution to that one, would be to pay MPs so much more. My political antenna tell me that this would be deeply unpopular.

(I don’t often blow my own trumpet, but hey, nobody else is going to: So, for the entirety of the last parliament my attendance at the at the Work & Pensions Select Committee was an unmatched 100%.)\nPlaces on select committees are allocated by an algorithm to ensure that they broadly represent the composition of the Commons itself. Nevertheless, unlike business in the Commons chamber, the objective of each committee is not just to secure a majority, rather it is to reach a consensus. Each committee represents the whole House of Commons and a report of a select committee is undermined if it is not the unanimous report of the whole committee.\nThe Chairmanship of each committee is critical. It is a position suited to a highly skilled and authoritative person with the benefit of an established track record. Accordingly, the Chairman only has a casting vote in the proceeding of the committee and, in recognition of their workload, receives a significant increment to their salary.\nOf course, strongly led select committees are not necessarily to the Government’s advantage: they often give ministers a pretty hard time.\nAs with membership, so with chairmanships: they are divided up between the parties on a formula mirroring the composition of the Commons. Essentially, the choice of which party gets which chairmanship however, is down to the governing party, with the exception that the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee is, by convention, always a member of the governing party, and the Public Accounts Committee is always chaired by a member of the Opposition Party.\nNow, when I was first elected in 1997, both the membership and the chairmanships of select committees were controlled by the whips offices. It certainly suited the government to ensure that the chairmen of the select committees in its gift were in the hands of someone trusted to ‘toe the line’. I recall a couple of tremendous rows when the Blair Government nominated individuals who were clearly ‘unexpected’ appointments, substituted to replace incumbents that had established a formidable reputation for independence of mind.\nWhen the Coalition Government arrived in 2010, we changed the system: both the chairmen and the members of select committees had to be elected and not merely chosen by whips. Each party had to elect their allocated number of members, but the chairman had to be elected by the whole House: To be successful a candidate would need support from well beyond their own party.\nWhere a party has such an overwhelming majority however, the new mathematics in the Commons potentially changes everything.\nWhat I have found particularly surprising is that my support is now being solicited for the chairmanships of select committees by brand new Labour members who have never even previously sat on one. They are seeking to supplant senior party colleagues that established a reputation based on their record. Well, that’s democracy: We still have free choice between the candidates and their merits.\nThe ‘word on the street’ however, is that this novelty is being encouraged the by the Government whips in the hope that potentially ‘difficult’ and independent-minded chairmen’ might be replaced by ‘trusties’.\nI can offer no evidence. But it would be a great shame if the reputation of robust select committees were to be neutered.",

Consequently, we should tax them less but expect them to do more for themselves, rather than do more for them and charge accordingly.\nNevertheless and notwithstanding my prejudice, I approved of last week’s tax-raising budget because my honest-finance gene is stronger than my ideological gene: You have to pay for what you’ve spent. Whilst I’d prefer not to have government spend so freely (particularly when much of it was to stop enterprises trading and pay employees to do nothing), it’s too late now -the £470 billion bill is coming in and has to be repaid.\nThere is, of course, a vital agenda to increase investment, productivity and enterprise so that greater tax revenue is generated by increased economic activity and any chancellor of the Exchequer needs to be alive to the danger that his proposals to raise levels of taxation reduce the potential for revenue growth through economic growth. I think that Rishi Sunak was careful to avoid that danger last week in the way that he structured the tax increases for businesses and incentivised investment.\nI have never however, shared the belief -that appears to be held by a number of my colleagues- that deficits can be very largely financed by cutting taxes in the expectation that revenues will rise sufficiently consequent upon the change in economic behaviour prompted by the tax cuts.\nThe ‘Laffer Curve’ as it is known amongst economists, predicts that in certain limited circumstances cutting tax rates can lead directly to an increase in tax revenues. Equally, an increase in tax rates can reduce the tax revenue taken. A chancellor would be negligent not to look for these opportunities and dangers, but it is never a panacea for filling a large deficit. And if it clinches the argument (it should, given the prejudices of those of my colleagues who embrace it) Mrs Thatcher certainly never believed in it.\nWe’ve spent the money, and we have to pay-up.",

The shortest direct to slaughter export journey from Great Britain to continental Europe in 2018 was a journey time of 18 hours. Most domestic journeys to slaughter in the UK are significantly shorter. In 2020, the Government carried out a consultation on ending live animal exports, and 87 per cent of respondents agreed that livestock and horses should not be exported for slaughter and fattening.\nNow that the UK is no longer in the European Union, the Government can end live animal exports, further strengthening animal welfare protections. The Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Bill delivers the Government’s manifesto commitment by banning the live export of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses for slaughter and fattening. It will prevent unnecessary long export journeys, instead using shorter and less stressful domestic journeys. The Bill will ensure that animals are slaughtered domestically, in high welfare UK slaughterhouses and preventing the export to unknown and likely lower welfare slaughterhouse conditions. These new rules will still allow live animal exports in other circumstances, for example for breeding and competitions, provided they are transported in line with legal requirements aimed at protecting their welfare.\nWhile no animals have been exported for slaughter from Great Britain since the Government announced its intention to bring forward a ban in 2021, this Bill makes this permanent. This legislation reinforces the UK’s position as a world leader on animal welfare, boosting the value of British meat and helping to grow the economy.\nIt is positive that the Bill had its Second Reading in the House of Commons in December, and the Bill continues to progress through Parliament.",

This makes us third in the EU in terms of the numbers that we have accommodated, accounting for 15% of all claims from unaccompanied children in the EU.\nIn the year ending September 2019, 6,035 family reunion visas were issued to children and partners of those granted humanitarian protection or refugee status in the UK.\nThere is no intention for this to change following the UK’s exit from the EU. The Prime Minister has made it clear that we intend to ensure that unaccompanied children who are seeking international protection in an EU Member State can continue to be reunited with family members who are here, as well as children here in the UK with family in the EU. This is a negotiating objective of the Government for our future relationship with the EU.\nThe purpose of the bill now in Parliament is to give parliamentary approval to the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU which we signed up to in October last year, not to determine the future relationship which is still to be negotiated and agreed.\nThe misery of the last Parliament was that, the absence a Government majority enabled MPs to use any bill as a ‘Christmas tree’ on which to hang any number of obligations that would tie the Government’s hands in future EU negotiations. The current bill reverses that: it simply approves the agreement we’ve already made, and lets the Government get on with negotiating our future relationship unfettered by any imposed parliamentary negotiating mandate.\nIt is for this reason that the amendments supported by my email correspondents were so inappropriate.\nTo say that MP’s voted against refugee children being reunited with relatives living in the UK is just utter nonsense. We didn’t. The UK will continue to be one of most generous and accommodating European nations in our acceptance of refugee children.",

President Macron’s demand for more detail will be accommodated, but in the proper forum: at the negotiating table.\nI had also expected to be deluged with vituperative emails from the Zealots among my constituents, incandescent about delay and betrayal. I am glad that I was wrong about that too: I have had only three. Which is just one quarter of the number of constituents who, in the same time window, have emailed asking me to write to the Secretary of State for Defence about the massacre of songbirds on UK bases in Cyprus. We may have been divided on the European question but at least we remain a nation of animal lovers.\nI understand the frustration of the three correspondents however, who have written demanding no delay or transition, and in favour of a completely clean break unconstrained by any agreements or continued expense. I have never believed that leaving the EU without agreement would be the catastrophe that many commentators predict. Their predictions of disaster are merely an extension of the project fear they deployed during the referendum campaign, they have merely moved the goal posts.\nWere we to leave without agreement we would continue to trade with the EU on the basis of World Trade Organisation rules, which are the rules which already govern the greater part of our trade, which has always been outside the EU. Indeed, the release from the EU common external tariff would provide a huge boost to that trade. Furthermore, some countries outside the EU trade with it rather more successfully on World Trade Organisation rules, than we have managed to do so from within the EU internal market.\nClearly, a two year transition period announced in the Florence speech delays all the economic advantages that many of us believe would accrue from our departure.\nI have campaigned for 42 years to leave the EU, I can live with a further two years to reach that goal.\nWhilst I remain sanguine about leaving without agreement, nevertheless I believe that there remains an advantageous agreement to be had. The imposition of tariffs and customs restrictions on our EU trade certainly won’t be to our advantage, especially in those enterprises where overseas investment in the UK was based on free access to European markets.\nWe simply have to be hard headed in the negotiations about the balance of advantage in terms of savings from freer trade, weighed against the bill we are expected to pay for it.\nWhat my 3 correspondents ignore is the changed reality arising from the outcome of the election in June: a government without a parliamentary majority.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_inflation-3/content_447.html": "In this column on the 8th, and again on the 15th of April last year I gave my analysis of the inflation that we were facing:\nInflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, there is no such thing as cost-push inflation. (desmondswaynemp.com)\nInflation-2 (desmondswaynemp.com)\nMy fears were not misplaced. I expressed my view that notwithstanding the severe impact of the war in Ukraine and the post Covid supply glitches that were affecting the world economy, my view was that inflation was caused by the growth in the money stock (principally in the form of credit and bank balances) relative to the availability of goods and services: Control of the stock of money is an essential element in restraining inflation.\nIn 1997 Gordon Brown handed responsibility for the control of inflation to the Bank of England, and with it, the power -independent of Government – to set in interest rates. I voted against that decision because I believed that politicians are democratically accountable in a way that the Governor of the Bank couldn’t be.\nIt is now clear that the Bank has made a complete Horlicks of it, but of course, most people still blame the Government anyway. It is galling to see the former Governor, Mark Carney, making highly political statements putting the problem down to Brexit. What twaddle: if that were the case why are interest rates are at similar levels in the United States, in Canada, in Australia and in New Zealand and they are at the highest level in Europe for 20 years?\nAnd Since 2016, cumulative growth has been 4% in Italy and 5.5% in Germany, whereas in the UK it has been 6.8%. The UK had the highest growth of any G7 country in both 2021 and 2022.\nFurthermore, In July last year, British exports to the European Union were the highest, not just since Brexit, but since records began.\nNothing to do with Brexit then, our problem is that the Bank, for too long, neglected the importance of restraining the money stock.\nThat’s not to say that politicians would have made a better job of it. Also, it can be said in mitigation, that the Bank placed a higher priority on avoiding a recession and in that it has thus far been successful, -even though the eurozone is currently in recession. (Though my present fear is that, with monetary growth now much tighter, it takes months for this to impact inflation, and the Bank, by pressing ahead with rate rises will cause the very recession that we have, so far, avoided).\nOf course, one very significant contributor to our inflation is the level of Government borrowing.\nWe can certainly blame the Government for that. But, again, it was done to avoid the ghastly recessionary consequences of Covid lockdowns and then the need to pay half our energy bills following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nThe principal restraint now on any intervention to assist people with their rising mortgage costs is that we’d make inflation worse by increasing borrowing even further (equally it would be unacceptable to help out mortgages without extending that help to rents).\nThis is going to be a difficult time for families like mine. But voters should beware of political parties with big spending plans: they will multiply our misery.",

The\nact requires us to achieve a 57% reduction in emissions by 2032 from the levels\nin 1990. So far, we’ve cut 42% at the same time as the economy grew by over\n70%: So, we’ve decarbonised our economy at a faster rate than any other rich\ncountry. The last time the UKs emissions were this low was in 1890.\nIf we are to meet our latest target of at least 80%\nreduction in emissions by 2050 however, then we are going to have to raise our game still further. In response the\nGovernment has set out a comprehensive plan for the whole economy in the Clean Growth Strategy published in\nOctober 2017.\nThe publication of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has raised the question as to whether any of this is nearly enough, and consequently the Government is now awaiting advice this week from the Committee on Climate Change on how to move to a ‘Net-Zero’ emissions target.\nLast week Opposition MPs were demanding a guarantee to implement these recommendations -whatever they may be. I think it’s more sensible to wait just a few more days and see what the recommendations actually are, then think how we can implement them effectively.\nI was told that the total of all our emissions going back to 1900 are equivalent to just one year’s emissions from modern China -I haven’t ‘fact-checked’ this, and it may be complete nonsense, but it makes the point that this is a planetary issue requiring an international response. It will be no good for the climate, or for Britain, if we cut our own emissions whilst they are more than made up for by increases from elsewhere.\nWe need to use the UK’s leadership to drive forward the climate agenda at the united Nations.\nWe’ve played an important role in establishing the Paris Agreement of 2015, and in the subsequent detailed work to implement it.\nIn this respect our International Development budget has been a vital component in establishing our leadership: we are the world’s second largest donor, and we are providing developing countries with £6 billion in the current spending round as ‘climate finance’ to help them cut their own emissions and to invest in resilience against the impact of climate changes that are already adversely affecting them.\nAll of this effort, of course, was well underway before pupils abandoned their classrooms to protest, or their parents and teachers glued themselves to Waterloo Bridge, but if it helps…",

In addition, the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Act introduced tougher sentences for animal cruelty, increasing maximum sentences. The Ivory Act came into force in 2022 and has recently been extended to cover five more endangered species.\nThe Kept Animals Bill, introduced in June 2021, was designed to implement several of the Government’s ambitions for animal welfare. This included banning the live exports of animals, seeking to prevent pet theft, and new measures to tackle livestock worrying. The Bill’s multi-issue nature means that there has been considerable scope-creep, and the Bill risks being extended far beyond the original commitments in the Conservative Manifesto, as well as and the Action Plan for Animal Welfare. Therefore, the Government will now be taking forward measures in the Kept Animals Bill individually during the remainder of the Parliament. The Government remains fully committed to delivering its manifesto commitments on animal welfare.\nSince 2010, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has had a strong track record in reforms. This includes: a ban on the use of conventional battery cages for laying hens; mandatory CCTV in slaughterhouses across England; a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses; the strongest ivory ban in the world; mandatory microchipping of dogs; and new regulations for minimum standards for meat chickens; and the modernisation of the licensing system for dog breeding and pet sales.\nFinally, the Government supports a series of Private Members’ Bills which will deliver important reforms on animal welfare. These include the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill, which will ban the import of hunting trophies for specific species; the Shark Fins Bill, which will ban the import and export of shark fines; as well as the Animals (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill, which will ban the sale and advertising of activities abroad which involve low standards of welfare for animals.",

I recall the way that expression of such concern was derided by the ‘establishment’ over the last decade. During the 2001 election campaign there were howls of anguish and indignation, indeed there was even a walk-out, when I raised the subject at a hustings organised by a New Forest church.\nNow that we have the leave of the Archbishop to discuss it, I can say that – overwhelmingly – immigration has been the subject most often raised with me by constituents over the last 19 years. It has been their top concern, where their dislike of the EU has been way down the list by comparison.\nThe two are intimately connected however, to put it bluntly, we can’t control immigration because of our membership of the EU. Most of our immigrants come from the EU and the terms of our membership require that they be given free movement into our country, and the same employment rights as British subjects. So, when governments announce honest intentions to reduce immigration, they fail because they have absolutely no way of limiting the greater part of the source of immigrants.\nWe are often told that immigration is good for us and promotes prosperity and economic growth. It is true that foreign entrepreneurs bring their skills, enterprise and investment here. In the end however, it comes down to a question of numbers and a balance of advantage: 70% of EU migrant workers in the UK claim in-work social security benefits, at the same time they consume public services and acquire a pension liability; The notion that this is all economic gain is fanciful.\nClearly, the Government recognises this, and that is why we tried to create levers to control the flow of EU migrants. We failed: the re-negotiation has come up only with an ‘emergency brake’ which requires the consent of the EU Commission if we wish to operate it. The brake consists of nothing more than a temporary diminution in amount of benefit payable. It is certainly better than nothing, but it does not amount to control of our borders and I do not believe that it will diminish the numbers of migrants.\nThis brings us to a key principle underlying the whole EU debate: Control. Pundits demand that both sides paint a picture of what the future holds inside, or outside the EU. Of course, neither of us can with any certainty, because we live in an unpredictable world and we are not clairvoyants. The real issue therefore, is that we are likely to fare far better in this unpredictable world, if we have control of our own affairs to pursue our national interest, rather than that control should reside in Brussels.",

Inside, it had been transformed into the offices of a local partner charity of Railway Children UK, Amani Centre for Street Children, who work with close to 1,000 (former) street children and youths across Tanzania.\nWorking on the streets with Amani’s dedicated social workers is where I met some “hardcore” street children and youth. Arusha is a big city (about half a million people, half of them below the age of 18), and the children who live on the streets there become involved deeply and quickly into a number of dangerous street behaviours, including serious substance use. Walking through the dingy and dirty alleyways and slum areas, we encountered children and youths who, in their fight to cope with street life, were happy to see us and the Amani staff. Some young children were carrying sacks bigger than them, filled with empty plastic bottles for recycling which earn them around 75pence a day. Often part of this goes on their transport back to the place where they sleep, and the rest is enough for one basic meal (a plate of rice, with some beans) and some street substances. Many of the children and youths we met were carrying around empty bottles filled with glue and petrol for sniffing, they had cuts and bruises which looked as though they hadn’t been cleaned in weeks, and were wearing dirty, ripped clothes.\nThey were surprisingly friendly towards me and the Amani street educators, giving us “high fives” and pats on the back, participating in the special group session that the street workers conducted, making jokes and discussing their problems openly.\nThe young children who are rescued by Amani street educators are taken to a temporary shelter in Moshi, the Amani Children’s Home. Here they receive a whole range of services to help rehabilitate them, re-start their education, and they are later reunited with a caring family member. The older youths are counselled intensively and given the options of going to study basic vocational training or joining a Youth Association Model – a group of youths developing a joint ‘business plan’ and life skills plan to get out of street life.\nThat afternoon we travelled through the hectic Arusha streets, past the pavement hawkers and rows of boda-boda “motorbike taxi” drivers to meet one of the Youth Association groups. They had already started their life skills session by the time we arrived in the centre of the city – Daraja Mbili. One adolescent boy stood in a circle of 20 boys, speaking with passion and conviction. We stood on the fringes and just watched for a while, as the youths challenged each other and debated the issues their business was facing. We were welcomed into the circle and Hija, the youth who had been leading the discussion when we first arrived, introduced his team to us. Hija is the chairperson of the NMC Youth Association which has 21 street youths in total, and is working on the business plan of creating and running public bathrooms, and charging for them. The transformation of the youths we had seen on the streets the night before into the motivated and dedicated youths in front of us was remarkable. Each youth had their own independent role and worked every day to help the start this business and make it a success.\nAt the end of the day, we travelled to the outskirts of Arusha to visit the family of a former street child, who was rescued by Amani and now reunified with family. I was with Hassan and Naomi, two of Amani’s dedicated family reunification workers. Speaking with them on the way, I gained more of a picture of how challenging it is to reunite former street children with their families. The reasons the children run away from home range from lesser issues like stealing from their family or neighbours, to having suffered severe physical and sexual abuse. The child we were going to see, Karim, had run away from home because of extreme poverty. Around 50% of Tanzanians live in extreme poverty; not eating 3 meals per day, unable to afford basic healthcare or education for their children, and living in a substandard home.\nKarim’s mother had been given a conditional grant by Amani to help her repair her home, pay for medicine, and buy enough food for them to eat 3 nutritious meals a day. Although we had to stoop down to enter the shack in which they were living, they greeted us warmly and sat close together on small stools. The reunification seemed to be working. I stayed for some 45 minutes, listening to the translated version of the counselling from Amani’s social workers. It was family therapeutic intervention, and the main aim of the session was to help both the mother and child understand each other’s needs. Naomi explained to me that Amani’s staff had been trained for one week by Railway Children UK on this method of counselling and it was working remarkably well with the families of reunified children.\nThe most notable part of my experience on the Arusha streets was witnessing the tenacity of the street children to survive, the level of fun and comradery they managed to maintain, and the close relationships they had built with Amani’s social workers. They were like family. This seems to be the reason Amani is so successful in working with these children and youths – they treat them like family and give them guidance in the same way parents would.\nLater that week, I travelled 80km north of Arusha to the Amani Children’s Centre in Moshi to see their holistic care programmes for rescued street children.\nThe huge yellow building that is Amani Centre for Street Children can hold up to 90 children maximum, aged 7 to 15/16. As I walked through the building, I went past the nurse’s office, counselling room, the colourful Starters Classroom and both the boys’ and girls’ dormitories. I learned that Amani’s programme is extremely extensive, offering street children healthcare, counselling, accelerated formal education, food, clothing, and a safe temporary shelter whilst they trace the families of the children in order to be able to reunite them.\nThe main thing that struck me at Amani was how happy the children were. They were laughing and playing, and reading outside. They seemed just like normal children, there was no evidence of the trauma and suffering they had gone through on the streets. And the caring atmosphere that I had previously witnessed on the streets continued at Amani Centre. Staff and children interacted as though they were family, and there was a warmth and friendliness to the atmosphere. A good number of children came up to greet me wearing huge smiles, and I happily joined in with a small group of kids playing hopscotch.\nI was most moved by the story of one girl, Neema. Although only 13 years old, Neema had already gone through more hardships than most adults face in their lives. One of the weekend caregivers explained to me that she was the daughter of a commercial sex worker and that her mother had also sold her to men in exchange for money as she was growing up. Despite all of those challenges, Neema is a confident and cheerful girl at Amani Centre. When I first arrived at the Centre she was darting between the tasks of reading a story book on a bench outside, and playing a board game using pebbles with her friends. But when the lunch bell sounded, Neema took pride of place alongside the cooks, helping to organise the plates of food for all 60 children at Amani and ensuring everyone got their fair share without any quarrels. The staff told me that Neema was a natural leader, kind listener, and could be trusted with any task. When I asked her what she would like to do when she grows up, she told me her dream is to be a teacher.\nI hope the above has conveyed the special experience I have been given, to get to know and understand the situation of street children in Tanzania. As I am part of the cross-party parliamentary group (APPG) on Street Children, I hope to take what I have learned from my time in Tanzania, both with Railway Children and with Amani, back to the UK Parliament to discuss with my colleagues. It is clear that issues involving street children are fundamentally important to the development of countries across the world, and that we are in a position to help those less fortunate than ourselves to become positively contributing members of their societies.\nAbout Amani (Notes):\n- Amani Centre for Street Children (full registered charity name)\n- Amani Centre for Street Children was founded in 2001 by three Tanzanian volunteers. It is a Tanzanian registered charity.\n- The HQ is based at the Amani Centre in Moshi, Kilimanjaro, Tanzania.\n- The Amani Centre can house up to 90 children at any point in time and offers services to children including; food, clothes, accelerated formal education, healthcare, professional counselling, reunification with families.\n- Amani also has a drop-in Centre and night shelter in the bigger city of Arusha, approximately 80 km from Moshi, where it works with street children and youths, and rescues young, vulnerable girls who are engaged in sex work.\n- Amani has a smaller Satellite Centre in one of the poorest regions of Tanzania, Singida, where they focus on rescuing and reunifying children.\n- In total, Amani works with almost 1,000 (former) street children and youths.\n- Amani is supported by individual fundraisers and also relies on grants from foundations and larger institutions.\n- Amani is co-funded (as a sub-grantee) by DFID and USAID.\nWebsite: www.AmaniKids.org",

My alarm bell rings because most of us still aspire to own our own homes, and it just won’t do if we can’t.)\nClearly, the economics all this requires such an increase in housing supply as to bring about a reduction in house prices and rents.\nThe forth most frequent thing that constituents write to me about however, is that whenever there is a housing development proposal, they complain that they don’t want it built anywhere them.\nSo, how to square this circle?\nThere is nothing new under the sun: Go back a hundred years and you will find that politicians were wrestling even then over how to solve the housing problem.\nOver the years all sorts of things have been tried, some with modest success, and some with consequences the very reverse of what was intended: perhaps the best example of this being the introduction of rent controls which led to a drastic reduction in accommodation available, and a significant deterioration in the quality of that which remained.\nLast year 217,000 houses were built, which is better than in any of the previous 18 years, but there is a big backlog of under-building to address.\nThere is no silver bullet.\nAt the Conservative Party conference there was a proposal to give incentives to landlords to sell to their tenants. It’s a helpful initiative, but it changes only the tenure not the total supply.\nHere are some other suggestions.\nFirst, the evolution of the new local planning process may, over time, lead to a reduction in the level of protest over proposed housing developments. Local politicians, instead of having housing targets imposed upon them, will assess the genuine local housing need and -knowing their own ‘patch’- designate the places where building can be more sympathetically accommodated. That process will be strengthened when they can also specify the type and even the style of development.\nAt present so much of this discretion is in the hands of the developers rather than the community.\nSecond, we need a much better quality of dwelling. I am inundated with complaints about poor quality of newly built houses, and the fact that the individual purchasers are at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with large developers when things have to be put right. There needs to be a better balance in these disputes. I am glad that a minister already working on what can be done.\nThird, to address that part of the market where private sector developers have little incentive and interest, we just have to get councils building again. The very recent lifting of the cap -which had been placed on the ability of councils to borrow against the security of the flow of future rental revenue, in order to fund development, ought now to get things moving.\nSocial housing however, should be for need, not for life. It is unreasonable for people to be allocated social housing on the basis of need, yet to remain in it so many years later when their income and family circumstances have changed dramatically.\nPerhaps most controversially, we should consider the price of land. The extortionate value of building land encourages development suitable to the most expensive end of the market and drastically reduces the scope for building something affordable for the first-time buyer.\nIt encourages ‘land-banking’ –the hogging of land by speculators in the expectation that when planning permission is granted their land will be worth many multiples of what they paid.\nTheir capital gain will be taxed, of course, but notwithstanding the historic right to dispose of property at the best price that the market will bear, ought we to artificially put a cap on it?\nFinally, I offer my sympathy, but no apology to the many buy-to-let landlords who have written to complain to me about the phased withdrawal of tax relief on their principal cost of doing business, namely on their mortgage interest payments.\nThe simple fact is that this relief put them at an advantage against every first time buyer in the market, it meant they could afford to offer more to secure a purchase: it just wasn’t fair.",

It was my token gesture of support as a student in straightened circumstances – although £1 was worth a lot more then. It was right to stop good schools being interfered with, and it still is.\nI do not carry any ideological baggage about grammars. I voted against the 1998 legislation that prohibits the opening of new grammars, and I would vote to repeal it: no school should be ruled out on principle. Equally, I am no enthusiast for any widespread return to selective schools.\nI was surprised, and delighted, by the scale of the Prime Minister’s ambition to improve education, and by the way that she explicitly linked this great endeavour to Brexit. I will need some persuading however, on the detail of the plans. The key objective that both the PM and the Secretary of State have set out, is to get many more good schools. I agree with that.\nMany selective schools are very good schools, but I am not convinced that selection is a significant factor in making any school a good one. I have visited some fantastic comprehensives in ‘deprived’ and unpromising areas. I believe that the key difference is made by the quality of teachers and, even more importantly, their leadership.\nHow do we get more good teachers and excellent heads?\nReturning to selection won’t fix it. Rather, we need to raise the whole status of the teaching profession -which will come at a cost. (The recently introduced requirement that new teachers have at least a 2.1 honours degree, was well intended, but I fear that in practice it is unhelpful: inspirational teachers don’t necessarily have the best degrees, and we should remember that Einstein got a third).\nSelection and choice can be opposites: you cannot choose a school that will not admit you. A school’s ability to select pupils, is equally its ability to reject them. Each of the 4 market towns in my parliamentary division supports one secondary school. Imagine that Burgate School acquires the ability not to select a proportion of pupils from Fordingbridge. I don’t relish the prospect of informing parents that they will have to have their children bussed elsewhere. So, one component in the debate that will now follow, will be about the quality of provision that will be made for pupils that are not selected. We have be told that there will be no return of secondary moderns, but this will be a ‘hard sell’.\nA journalist asked me if, with an effective working majority of only 15, how difficult will it be to get these measures through the Commons. As a whip in both opposition and in government, I have witnessed the House become much more independent over recent years, irrespective of a government’s majority. I think we have reached a position where, if ministers want to get their measures on the statute book, they have to win the argument. I’m all ears.\nI think the government accepts that it has to persuade, otherwise the PM would not have sent out such a clear message by promoting some serial ‘rebels’ to ministerial and cabinet rank in July.",

Notwithstanding, the recent innovation of our pretended Supreme Court, the reality is that Parliament remains supreme as it always has.\nWe have no separation of powers: executive, judiciary, and legislators are all mixed up together in Parliament.

The further amendment went another step by requiring that if the Government couldn’t meet that reporting obligation because of a prorogation, then a Royal Proclamation would require Parliament to meet the next day and for five subsequent days.\nThis perceived “Remainer triumph” is based on one quite false assumption, namely that there ever was a serious plan to prorogue Parliament in the first place. There wasn’t. It just isn’t serious politics. Regular readers of this column may recall that I addressed the issue several weeks ago and reminded them that when King Charles I prorogued the Long Parliament, it didn’t end well for him.\nOf course, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson refused to rule out the possibility of a prorogation, but refusing to rule something out is very different from having a plan to do it. The first rule of any serious negotiator is to keep all possibilities open.\nThe damage that the defeat has done, is not that it has removed a serious option, but that it sends a further signal to the EU -as if one were needed- indicating that Parliament will oppose a no-deal BREXIT, and therefore that the threat is a paper-tiger and that they need not engage seriously in negotiations to avoid it.\nOnce again Parliament has had the effect of acting like a fifth column in undermining the Government’s BREXIT negotiations.\nHow reliable is the signal that Parliament has sent?\nThe Government defeat was large, but does it really indicate that a majority in Parliament would vote to block a no-deal BREXIT?\nI doubt it.\nThe actual vote was on the question of potentially side-lining Parliament at a key moment in our history, not something to be taken lightly in a modern parliamentary democracy that takes itself seriously.\nFrankly, in such a circumstance it isn’t difficult to persuade democrats of any persuasion to resist the Government whip on such a question.\nIt is a quite different question however, to ask democrats representing constituencies that voted by 70% and upwards in favour of leaving the EU, instead to vote to change the law and prevent the UK leaving on All Souls Day.\nThe last time the Commons voted on the possibility of availing itself of such a power, it demurred and the proposal was defeated by 11 votes.\nI conclude that no-deal remains on the table, and the EU better believe it.",

In the UK we are accustomed to having political leaders with a Christian faith. Those that are not Christians have been the exception rather than the rule. Furthermore, we Christians tend to disagree just as much as those with no belief. On all the great questions of conscience in my time in Parliament, the Christians have pretty well divided themselves evenly between both the ‘aye’ and ‘no’ lobbies.\nThe row with which Farron was confronted was driven by the belief, common among journalists, that for Christians, ‘sin’ is principally all about what people get up to in bed. (It really isn’t.)\nMercifully, Farron and the gay sex row was only a footnote in the election. During that long campaign however, it occurred to me that there were much bigger and much more important moral questions. Here is just one of them.\nI am profoundly concerned about just how corrupting our ‘transactional’ politics has become. By transaction I mean “vote for me and I’ll give you ‘whatever’.\nBefore the great Reform Act the transaction was at least open and above board. For example, “vote for me and I’ll pay you a guinea”. The voter having declared his vote in public at the ballot, could then expect the candidate to pay up. Corrupt, depressing, but essentially an honest and transparent transaction. The arrival of the secret ballot however, removed any certainty that the voters have fulfilled their part of the bargain. So instead, politicians still offer all sorts of inducements to voters, but now they are to be paid for with other people’s money.\nThe voter however, is so often told that whatever is on offer, will be ‘free’ and that others will foot the bill: that the rich will pay for it; or the corporations will pay for it. It has a whiff of the French Revolution about it, but we have become so inured to it that we are blind to the corrupting belief that we deserve to have something for nothing, and for which others ought to pay: At this election some voters were even told that their debts would be written off at the public expense, others were told that breakfast would be free.\nWhen did we lose the sense that we all have responsibilities, and that everyone must make a contribution?\nMy heart sinks every time when I am on the doorsteps and the voter asks “what are you going to do for us”.

Frankly, I’d prefer an agreement but I don’t much care for this one: It surrenders our chief bargaining card (money) before the key negotiations on our future relationship even begin; it leaves us in a potentially indeterminate transition beyond our control; and it treats Northern Ireland differently.\nI have to weigh-up my dislike for this proposal however, against two risks identified by the PM: leaving the EU without agreement, or not leaving the EU at all.\nOn no agreement, before I can come to an assessment I will need to be much clearer as to the state of our preparations, and I will need to scrutinise in detail the position papers that the Government has released.\nOn the risk of no BREXIT, I asked the PM to-day how that might come about, her answer didn’t give me much to work with. The law and parliamentary procedure are clear: we leave on 29 March-whatever. We would nevertheless be in uncharted political territory with the Government, having lost its flagship measure, proceeding towards a no-deal Brexit, perhaps opposed by a determined majority in Parliament. Who knows what might happen next.\nI am certain of one thing: this deal, however bad, is much better than staying in the EU. Whilst it constrains our economic autonomy it nevertheless gets us out of the super-state, freed from ‘ever closer union’, freed from common fisheries and common agriculture, and released from unrestricted freedom of movement.\nI’ve read all 185 pages, before I come to a decision I need to read some of them more carefully, digest them, reflect on them, discuss them, and I won’t be hurried.\nNow, to the other question of the day: will I be writing a letter the Chairman of the 1922 Committee asking for a no-confidence ballot?\nNo I won’t. My assessment is that the PM would win such a ballot, in the meantime it would add another uncertainty and distraction to our politics at a critical time.\nIf my assessment is wrong, and were such a ballot triggered, and the PM were to lose it, it would potentially add an even greater distraction and uncertainty, and I doubt that it would deliver us a different proposed deal to deliberate upon at this late stage.\nI’d prefer to concentrate on resolving the first question, and that would also be assisted if I were to receive fewer emails, well –if you don’t ask…",

We can all see where this is going…and yet these were the same members who lined up in the Article 50 debate to announce that, notwithstanding having campaigned to remain, they now accepted the will of the voters.\n…Really?\nMeanwhile the Lords moved on to the issue of a “meaningful vote” to follow the conclusion of the negotiations with the EU.\nBy ‘meaningful vote’ they mean not just having the ability to accept or reject the agreement reached, so that that, were Parliament to reject the agreement, then we won’t just leave the EU next March without any agreement and revert to World Trade Organisation rules.\nOn the contrary, they mean to give Parliament the power to determine exactly what happens next. This will include delaying, deferring, or cancelling our departure. In effect, the meaningful vote is to be even more meaningful than the referendum of June 2016 –and that is really what this is all about.\nOf course, I can entirely understand the desire of elected representatives wishing to determine, or at the very least to influence the outcome of the negotiation process in what is, after all, a parliamentary democracy. The problem is that the very presence of a parliamentary meaningful vote at the end of the process fundamentally undermines our negotiating stance: it invites the EU to offer such poor terms with the confidence that Parliament will be bound to reject them.\nAlready there have been a number of meetings in Brussels between parliamentary opponents of BREXIT and the EU with the object of co-ordinating just such an outcome.\nA well-funded campaign has begun, and which will continue for the rest of the year, with the object of persuading us all that we made a terrible mistake and that either we, or our Parliament must undo it.\nGiven the arguments that we heard about the customs union and the internal market in Parliament last week, it is clear that no agreement reached with the EU will ever be good enough to persuade the hard core of remainers to accept it.\nAs I have warned before in this column, their strategy is one of ‘demoralise and delay, in order to defeat’.\nThe question is whether we, as voters, have the stamina and the will to continue to demand that our decision be honoured.",

In or out of the EU, our future prosperity depends upon how competitive we are at producing goods and services.\nI have argued that, on the balance of probabilities, we are likely to me more competitive out than in. The world offers no nation a free ride however, and we will have to work to earn our keep. Out – at least, we can do so without one hand tied behind our back.\nSo, I don’t believe that in order to reclaim our self-determination as a free and independent nation we have to sacrifice any of our prosperity. I know many others however, fearful of the consequences for prosperity, who have therefore, and with a heavy heart, decided to opt to stay in the EU.\nAs John Adams, one of the founding fathers of the USA, observed: a man who is prepared to sacrifice his liberty for prosperity, deserves to have neither.\nIn the end the EU is a political institution determined on an ‘ever closer union’ between its member states. Democratically expressed opposition to its proposals have proved completely ineffective: the Irish, the Danes, and Dutch have all voted in referendums to reject the relentless process of integration, only for the proposals to be driven through anyway.\nThe Prime Minister has negotiated a declaration, to be inserted in any future treaty, that the UK is no longer to be bound by this principle of ever closer union. To secure this concession however, he had to sacrifice our trump card in any future negotiation by signing away our ability to impede further integration within the Eurozone. Without that possibility, we go into negotiations armed with very little that we can bargain with.\nThe record of our resistance to adverse changes is instructive: on the 74 occasions that we have pushed our opposition to the vote in the European Council, we have been on the losing side on every one of those 74 occasions.\nTime and time again, we have been told that the latest concession of power from the UK to the EU represents the high water mark of integration, and that it will go no further. Only for the process to continue relentlessly. If we vote to stay in the EU, I have no doubt that it will give new democratic legitimacy to the project, with renewed and accelerated impetus to integration.

I thought we should have started almost a decade ago. Indeed, I recall Ed Davey as Secretary of State with responsibility for energy policy in the Coalition Government, telling his party conference to “get fracking!”. Alas, now he is Leader of the Liberal Democrats he has changed his tune.\nFracking has certainly transformed the energy situation in the USA and ended their reliance on unstable and unsavoury regimes.\nMy prejudice is that the dangers are somewhat overdone, after all, we have been fracking for thermal energy in the UK at hundreds of sites without incident, but the technology is largely the same as fracking for shale gas.\nTo be realistic however, Fracking was unlikely to be a ‘silver bullet’ to our energy supply problems and certainly would not have had a major impact in the short term (that’s why it was a missed opportunity not to have got it underway when Ed told us to). Nevertheless, it could have made a useful contribution to our energy mix. Given that we will still be reliant on hydrocarbons for years to come, even as we strive for ‘net zero’, I’ve always thought that we’d be better off extracting our own than relying on increasingly expensive and unreliable imports.\nSo, I voted against labour’s motion to in the Commons last week, the chaos surrounding which, appeared to be the last straw for Liz Truss as PM.\nIt almost seems ancient history now but I think an explanation should still be had.\nThe vote was billed as a ‘matter of confidence’. In other words, any Conservative defying the three-line whip and not voting with the Government to defeat the Labour motion, would have the whip withdrawn: they would no longer be members of the Conservative parliamentary party.\nI quite understand the difficulties faced by a number of my colleagues on the question of fracking. Some have constituencies that are very much against it and which have experienced mild tremors at the first exploratory sites. More importantly, there was a clear commitment in the Conservative election manifesto of December 2019 to maintain the fracking moratorium. So, they found themselves being whipped against what they understood to be the policy on which they were elected.\nNothing however, is ever quite so straightforward. The Labour motion sought to repeat the trick that was pulled during the last Parliament in what was then an attempt to derail Brexit. This time the object was to suspend the Standing Orders of the Commons (the nearest thing we have to a written constitution) in order to secure legislative time to pass laws against fracking. In our system such legislative time is in the hands of the Government: you don’t get it unless you win an election. So, turning things upside down and taking legislative initiative away from the Government, as the Labour motion sought to do, was properly considered to be a matter of expressing no confidence in the Government.\nThe problem was that the Chief Whip had informed the parliamentary party that it was a matter of confidence and that Conservatives therefore had to vote with the Government, but the minister winding up the debate told the House that it wasn’t a matter of confidence. Result: utter confusion all round and a gaggle of members in the doorway to the ‘No’ lobby arguing whether it was or it wasn’t. Nobody however, was physically forced into the division lobby (nothing is ever quite so dramatic or exciting as reporters would have it).\nThe resulting furore has led to the cancellation of the last of the Truss deregulating policies. The opportunity we missed years ago, is to be missed again.",

Some of our allies were sceptical, but our ministers travelled relentlessly to European capitals to repeat the warnings.\nWhen it came to the crunch we froze more Russian Assets than the USA and very much more than the EU.\nOur humanitarian assistance to countries bordering Ukraine taking the refugee crisis, has been\nfaultless.\nI have been inundated however, with complaints about our dilatory response on the issue of Ukrainian refugees.\nSecurity is important: bona fides do need checking; there will be Russian agents and migrants from other countries masquerading as Ukrainians: we cannot just open the door without checking.\nI have no difficulty with the two schemes that have been announced which strike me as fair and proportionate. I anticipate that family sponsored refugees will mostly dwell with their families that sponsored them. Equally individual and community sponsored refugees will reside in the housing that their sponsors have identified. This is an important consideration. Shortage of housing is easily the biggest headache in my inbox; and we still have 12,000 Afghan refugees in hotels to find homes for.\nWhat has driven me, my correspondents and my parliamentary colleagues into a state of rage is the lamentable implementation of these schemes.\nWhen many thought we were ‘crying wolf’, ministers really believed our own intelligence sources that an invasion was coming with all its predictable consequences – so we had weeks to plan and deploy forward processing centres in countries bordering Ukraine, well in advance of the arrival of refugees. It is deeply regrettable that this week we were still acquiring premises and defining the details on the schemes.",

I don’t believe this perception is down to the statutory provisions that we have made in recent years to protect minorities. In fact these do no more in principle than the ancient common law prohibition against occasioning a breach of the peace: incitement has always been unlawful.\nRather, I put it down largely to the caustic nature of contemporary public discourse. Such is the fury with which unfashionable opinions are greeted, that those that hold them are terrified to express them. We appear to have lost the ability to disagree just because we believe that our opponents are wrong, now we need to denounce them as wicked as well.\nOver the last couple of years a large number of academics, clinicians, and civil servants have contacted me to draw attention to concerns that they have about public policy within their areas of expertise. They have included professors and senior people at the very top of their professions. What has been remarkable is the extent to which they wish to remain anonymous. They believe that there is something serious that needs to be out in the public debate, but they are not willing to put their heads above the parapet and say it themselves. They fear the hostile reaction from their own colleagues and fellow professionals. They believe that they have lost their voice, but as a parliamentarian, I still have a voice, so they put their trust in me to give voice to their concerns.\nWell, the fundamental guarantee that I do have an unrestrained voice is set out in the one written part of our largely unwritten constitution: The Bill of Rights 1689.\n“that freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached in any court or place out of Parliament”\nSo, my privilege is that I cannot be taken to task for anything that I say in Parliament, this the fundamental guarantee of the rights of a free parliament…until now at any rate.\nA new edition of the code of conduct for MPs has been published for consultation. It recommends that the scope of the Commissioner for Standards be extended to what takes place in the Commons, its division lobbies and in its parliamentary committees. This will give a policing function over elected members to an official in a clear breach of the guarantee set down in the Bill of Rights.\nThis is compounded by the addition of a new principle of ‘respect’ to be added to the standards, which will require MPs to “demonstrate anti-discriminatory behaviours“ through the promotion of “inclusion and diversity” amongst others.\nIt may sound anodyne enough but it was differing interpretations of inclusion and diversity that has just driven a professor from her job at Sussex University. I have no doubt that this would have a further chilling effect on free speech, and it is a fundamental attack on democratic choice.",

However, tackling climate change is a top priority for the Government and Ministers are committed to leaving the environment in a better state than they found it.\nThe UK already has a world-leading emissions reduction framework in place. The Climate Change Act 2008 made the UK the first country to introduce a legally binding, long-term emissions reduction target.\nIn October 2021, the Government published the Net Zero Strategy, building on the Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution. To oversee progress on achieving net zero, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) provides expert advice to the Government on climate change mitigation and adaptation. The UK’s 2050 net-zero target was considered, in line with advice from the CCC, to be the earliest feasible date for achieving net-zero carbon emissions.\nFurther, through the Environment Act 2021, the Government has set four legally binding targets for biodiversity in England, including halting the decline in species abundance by 2030, as well as reversing species decline, reducing the risk of species extinction, and restoring or creating more than 500,000 hectares of wildlife-rich habitats by 2042. The Government set out its plan to deliver on these ambitious targets through the Environmental Improvement Plan, which includes short-term interim targets in addition to those long-term targets. This overall suite of targets will ensure that the policies, actions and commitments in the plan are collectively driving progress towards the goal of leaving the environment in a better place than we found it.\nFinally, the UK played a leading role at the UN biodiversity summit, COP15, in December 2022. The agreement made includes a global commitment to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030 and also protect 30 per cent of land and oceans by 2030. This builds on the actions agreed during the UK’s own COP and G7 presidencies, including securing the Leaders Pledge for Nature last year which commits world leaders to taking action to drive sustainable food production, end the illegal wildlife trade and tackle climate change.\nDS",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_category_ds-blog_page_22/content_650.html": "A couple of weeks ago, in Parliament’s debate following the overthrow of the elected government of Afghanistan, I put the question of what we might do were it to happen here: would we join the Resistance or would we flee?\nTo say that the question was not well received would be an understatement. Nevertheless, I believe it is an important question: do we believe that our liberty, democracy and values are worth fighting and dying for?\nWe enjoy these freedoms because so many of our forebears fought and died for them. It is a difficult question for us to face with a measure of humility as we watch events unfold from our comfort and security. Yet in our own generation and in Afghanistan 457 of our men and women fought and died for those very values and many more suffered horrific injuries.\nAlso, as we consider the reasons behind complete collapse of the trained and well-armed Afghan forces in the face of a numerically much inferior enemy, we must also remember that over the last few years no less than 70,000 members of the Afghan security forces bravely fought and died for these values too.\nThe resistance continues in the Panjshir Valley where elements of the Afghan Army, together with the Vice President have pledged to fight on under the leadership of the Sandhurst-trained Ahmad Masoud, the son of the mujahedeen leader ‘The Lion of Panjshir’ who was assassinated on the orders on Bin-Laden in 2001.\nAre we going to leave them to it, or will we assist in the way that we supported Ahmad’s father in his resistance to the Taliban?\nRealpolitik demands answers to certain questions. First, what are their realistic prospects?\nThe Taliban are already claiming victory in the Panjshir but this is fiercely denied by the resistance. I hope we have much better military intelligence as to what exactly is happening than we had earlier this summer.\nSecond, what would the consequences of western support for resistance in the Panjshir be?\nCurrently the Taliban have ‘hostages’ in the form of all those that we failed to evacuate in the last weeks. We want them granted safe passage out of Afghanistan. Notwithstanding announcements of amnesty, there are many reports of summary reprisals against Afghans who assisted NATO and the Government of Afghanistan. I do not doubt that western assistance to the resistance in the Panjshir will make the predicament of those Afghans now in fear and hiding very much worse.\nOn the other hand, I doubt that the Taliban have much appetite for our good opinion so the only leverage we really have is financial. To put it bluntly we will need to ‘incentivise’ the provision of safe passage out of Afghanistan. So, in the end it comes down to danegeld, but as the English discovered with the Vikings, payment doesn’t always lead to compliance with the obligations for which the payment was made.\nIf the prospects of resistance are realistic then an assessment needs to be made on the basis of risk to those Afghans who are -in effect- now hostages, as against the potential benefits to Afghanistan as a whole of an effective and successful resistance.\nI do not know the answers to these questions, but I believe it is important to ask them. Just as it is important for us to examine ourselves and ask, what would we have done had it happened to us.\nImbecile!\nYou should never underestimate your adversaries. I recall that in the ‘Cameron camp’ during our years of frustration as the Official Opposition, we never underestimated the skills of Tony Blair as the consummate political performer. We even used to refer to him as ‘The Master’. Clearly, you cannot win 3 general elections in a row with majorities to dream of, without an immense ability to manage your political party and to reach out beyond your committed and faithful supporters. I always saw Tony Blair as a political ‘star’ of similar calibre to Bill Clinton in the USA. All this, without sharing his political outlook or his policies… that is until now:\nWhen Blair spoke out last week about the ‘imbecilic’ decision to leave Afghanistan in the way that the US Biden administration did, I do not think I could have come up with a better way of describing it. A monumental strategic error has been made.\nAfter a twenty-year commitment, expensive in both lives and money, I entirely understand the urge to withdraw. But to do so without first establishing the capabilities of Afghan forces, and to do so in a way that so undermined their morale, and to have done it during the Taliban’s fighting season instead of waiting till winter until they return to their tribal fastness, and to have done it with so little planning for the detailed logistics of withdrawal, all of this amounts to an enormous blunder with incalculable consequences.\nA Regime that assassinated female judges, female TV presenters, bombed girl schools, markets and weddings has been handed control. It remains intimately connected with Al Qaeda; it has released 500 of the world’s most dangerous terrorists which we left imprisoned at Bagram -when so much sacrifice went into their capture. And now we discover that we have left them with the pick of $85 billion’s worth of the most modern weapons. Frankly, it is just incredible that such an act of self-harm could have been allowed to happen.\nSo, were the billions of pounds that we spent and the British lives that we sacrificed, in vain?\nI certainly don’t believe so: Hundreds of terrorist outrages were prevented by the work of our troops in Afghanistan.\nIt was a righteous cause and the years of education and healthcare that improved so many lives were certainly of enormous benefit to millions.\nThe one bright spot of the last few days has been the magnificent performance of our Armed Forces in the most difficult and stressful of circumstances, evacuating 15,000 souls in the last fortnight, retaining their professionalism and efficiency in the face of such extremes of human misery. They really are The Best.\n*\n…and Gazing at the photograph of our paratroopers crammed aboard the military aircraft bringing them home, there isn’t a Covid mask to be seen. Hallelujah!\nAfghanistan, Sanctuary and Resettlement\nTo my mind there is a clear distinction between sanctuary and resettlement.\nThere are many brave Afghan men and women who are currently in grave danger and it is right that we offer them sanctuary, if they can get to us or if we can rescue them. Given their bravery and commitment to their native land, I would expect such sanctuary to last as long as the danger itself. Once the opportunity arises (if it does, but it may never) I anticipate that they would want to return to help rebuild their country.\nThere are very many more Afghan men and women who are not in grave danger, nevertheless they have lived difficult lives in a war-torn country, they are about to lose what rights they have and their life chances and opportunities are about to get very much worse. There have been demands in Parliament that we resettle permanently as many of them that wish to come to our shores and are able to escape.\nWith the best will in the world, though we regret their desperate situation, we are in no position to make that unlimited offer.\nAngela Merkel made such an offer in 2015 and the result was one million takers.\nWe ought to help as many as we can, but it does come down to a question of numbers. In the circumstances, our offer to accommodate 20,000 Afghans -especially the most vulnerable women and girls, is proportionate. Particularly so, when our support to other nations in the region which take refugees is taken into account.\nThere are countless places in the world where life is so much less eligible than here in Britain: Countries where there is ghastly oppression, injustice, poverty, warfare, famine and disease. The people of those countries would dearly wish to come to Britain for a better life -and many try to. It is to our credit that we wish we could be more generous in our welcome. I believe that our contribution is better made in development aid deployed to the places from which they seek to escape (that is why I was dismayed by our decision to cut our aid budget, though we remain the world’s second largest donor).\nSome go further and argue that not only should we have a much more generous resettlement scheme, but that -because of our involvement in Afghanistan over 20 years – we are obliged to do so. I do not agree and I revert to the distinction that I have drawn: We do have an obligation to provide sanctuary to those who, by assisting us or by the roles they have played, have put themselves in particular danger. For the wider population, beyond our offer of 20,000 places, our obligation has been met in blood and treasure over 20 years as we sought to bring a measure of security, education, healthcare and economic development to their country.\nI wish that we had completed the job and that we had avoided the huge strategic error of withdrawal. I pray that we will learn the right lessons.\nDisaster in Afghanistan\nMy contribution to this column last week was quickly overtaken by events. The Chief of the Defence staff, Sir Nicholas Carter’s analysis that the Afghan security forces were pursuing a sensible strategy of consolidating in the cities, turns out to have been quite detached from actual events on the ground.\nEqually, my own suggestion that we might be being too hasty in our determination to expedite evacuations, turns out to have been ill-informed. Nevertheless, the concern about providing asylum for translators has been a long running saga over recent years and is likely to have had an impact on the morale of those who had no alternative but to continue taking the fight to the Taliban.\nIn 2016 I had a meeting with President Ghani where one item on my agenda was to get a more constructive approach from his government regarding facilitating the return to Afghanistan of failed Afghan asylum seekers from the Britain. His response was that he was a ‘war president’ and his first concern must be the men and women who were fighting the battle, rather than taking up any of his time with arrangements to accommodate those who had chosen to run away. It was a fair point.\nMy own view was that our proper contribution to Afghanistan was not in providing asylum, but rather in the hundreds of lives sacrificed by our armed forces and the billions of pounds that we spent on education, healthcare, humanitarian aid and economic development. The humiliating defeat of this enterprise inevitably means we will face what we sought to avoid, namely enormous new demands on our ability to provide sanctuary and asylum.\nThere is no hiding the magnitude of the disaster. An enormous unforced strategic error has been made by the decision to withdraw before the Afghan armed forces were capable of defeating the Taliban.\nOur enemies will be celebrating the humiliating defeat of western democracy and a huge morale boost will be given to Islamist terrorists the world over.\nIt is pure wishful thinking to believe that the Taliban will not return to their former policy of harbouring foreign terrorists and promoting the violent assault on our values. The disaster in Afghanistan is unlikely to be confined there.\nAlmost as an afterthought, Afghan students who had been successful in the highly competitive Chevening Scholarship scheme, which enables them to study for a master’s degree in the UK, have been told that there is now no time to arrange their visas. But, hey, don’t worry: they can defer their scholarships until next year.\nAs if the Taliban regime will be going to facilitate such an endeavour.\nThe Republic of Afghanistan\nI visited Afghanistan twice as a minister with responsibility for driving forward the economic development effort that we were making there. In fact, I had spent some time in the country on a number of visits in the mid-nineteen- seventies when it was a very different country. I recall hiring a horse for a couple of days and riding out on my own to the stunning lake at Band-e-Amir and to the standing Buddhas at Bamiyan (- subsequently destroyed by the Taliban).\nGiven the blood and treasure that we have sacrificed over the last twenty years, I believe that NATO’s withdrawal is a profoundly mistaken policy. It is some years since NATO troops were actually involved in the fighting: with the exception of US air attack missions, NATO’s contribution has been largely confined to training and mentoring the Afghan security forces, whom we are now abandoning.\nThe advance of the Taliban is a catastrophe for women, girls and religious minorities, as well as to the ordinary liberties of everyone in that country. The prospects for educated women, many of whom have taken leading roles in the Parliament, media and the professions, are particularly bleak.\nWe can expect another even greater wave of refugees seeking to arrive on our shores.\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Nick Carter has said that we shouldn’t write-off the Republic yet: that there are signs that the population is showing the sort of defiance needed to win this battle; that they are rallying in support of the security forces which are pursuing a sensible and realistic strategy of consolidation to fight the Taliban to a stalemate. He says we must help them stay firm and force the Taliban to the negotiating table. He concludes that much depends on who wins the “battle of the narratives”\nHe’s right: winning the ‘battle of the narrative’ is vital for morale, the maintenance of which, is a most important principle of war and essential to success.\nOur policy however, appears designed to do the exact opposite. We do seem to be ‘writing-off’ the Republic. Our proper concern for the safety of Afghan interpreters who served our armed forces is laudable and indeed, our sacred duty. Our haste however, in securing their evacuation, sends a clear signal to those who are still fighting, that we believe there is no hope. Now a similar commitment is being given to evacuate Afghan journalists.\nI pray that the Afghan warriors, so many of whom have been trained by UK forces at our ‘Sandhurst in the Sand’, will prove the defeatists wrong.\nLiberty and Safety?\nSeveral constituents have written to me, outraged at the prospect of ‘Covid passports’ and quoting Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the USA, who said\n“those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety”\nFranklin couldn’t have been writing in more different circumstances: his concern was the liberty of the Pennsylvania legislature, for the purpose of meeting military expenditure, to insist on its right to levy taxes on the State’s founding family, rather than to be bought off with a lump sum in return for an acceptance by the assembly that they had no right to tax them.\nHowever impressive the quote may sound (and I’ve used it myself) it is a bit of a tight fit when it comes to shoe-horning it into the debate on compulsory vaccination.\nMy retort to the constituents who quoted Franklin to me is that, on the contrary, I have secured both my safety and my liberty by freely choosing to be vaccinated: a course that I recommended to them, and which I recommend to everyone else.\nNevertheless, regular readers of this column will know that I am deeply concerned about the creeping encroachment on liberty. I’ve twice used this column to set out my opposition to Covid passports and to the decision to make Covid vaccination compulsory for anyone working in residential care homes.\nI do not want to live in a society where we would routinely have to produce our bona fides in order to secure access to venues and enjoy our full civil rights. I’m confident that were such a system introduced -and we are not there yet, with the parliamentary battle still ahead of us – it would be very difficult to subsequently dismantle it and it could be the fore-runner of a system of identity cards.\nI understand the Government’s preoccupation that, whilst we have had enormous success with the vaccination programme, progress with the youngest age cohorts has been less impressive. From the outset I believed that the vaccination roll-out for younger people should have been incentivised on the basis of ‘carrots and not sticks’.\nFrankly we have made a poor job of trumpeting the effectiveness of the vaccines: We have thoroughly undermined them by maintaining restrictions even after the vulnerable groups had been vaccinated and by insisting on isolation and quarantine conditions notwithstanding fully vaccinated status. This sends completely the wrong message to younger and less vulnerable people. Which is possibly why the Government is now having to raise the prospect of making their lives less convenient and agreeable should they choose not to bother.\nAs for those who write to me about the Government’s malign and hidden agenda to deprive us of liberty. I reject it utterly. Though I disagree with their policy, I know these ministers personally, they are among my friends, they have the best of motives, even if they are mistaken. But I do accept that the threat to our personal freedoms are growing in intensity and we have to decide whether we insist on holding on to them, or we are going to allow the growing power of the state to take them from us whenever it chooses.\nChannel Crossings\nAs the trickle of migrants crossing the Channel in overcrowded and unsafe inflatable boats has started to become a flood, so the correspondence in my email inbox has increased by the same proportions.\nThough some correspondence is informed and sensitive, for the most part that is not the case: correspondents simply demand that it be stopped and that arrivals be sent back.\nIt reminds me of King Canute ordering the incoming tide to turn.\nSending the arrivals back does require the agreement of the jurisdiction to which we are going to send them: what reason would France have for agreeing to that?\nWe are already paying France a small fortune for the policing their beaches to prevent boats from launching, which has had some modest success.\nOnce launched however, France interprets international maritime law as preventing them from interfering unless the boats ask to be rescued. France sees its role as safely shepherding the migrants into UK waters where we will intercept them. A senior member of the Commons Home Affairs Committee has announced that France’s interpretation of maritime law is perverse and they must change it -so, we are back to King Canute: we hold no power over France to make them change (unless, of course, we can think of a sanction to make the French miserable, whose effects won’t rebound equally upon us).\nNow that crossing the Channel in small boats has been established as a successful means of illegal entry to UK, the numbers attempting a crossing are bound to increase until migrants assess that it is not worth undertaking the expense or encountering the danger because the probability is that they will be expelled, or that they will be held in conditions less eligible than their current circumstances.\nWe’ve already encountered the difficulty of finding somewhere to expel them to, so we are left with the ‘ Australian’ approach of deterring them on the principle of less eligibility. The Australians send them to detention centres in Papua New Guinea. This is controversial even in Australia and I rather suspect that the British public would not have the stomach for it.\nNevertheless, the Borders Bill currently going through Parliament specifies a 4 year prison term for illegal entry and empowers ministers to implement detention centres for the processing of asylum claims overseas.\nI seriously doubt that we will fill our -already bursting- prisons with tens of thousands of migrants, including the prospect of separating families.\nEqually, it is not clear what sort of inducement would be required to persuade another country to house our ‘processing centres’ and whether they would turn out to be as grizzly and embarrassing as Australia’s.\nThat we need to identify a workable solution, I do not doubt. Clearly, our generous resettlement schemes are being overtaken by unlawful migrants who, no matter what they may have endured and from what horrors they have fled, have had sufficient sums to purchase the services of criminal gangs to deliver them to our shores.\nOf course, we could reduce the attraction of the crossings, just making them so much more dangerous by withdrawing our cutters and patrols altogether. I’m confident that this would not be the answer. I wonder how many constituents would be emailing me then, when the bodies of children start washing up on the beach.\nEliminating EVAL without a vote\nWhen I first entered the Commons, the Father of The House (its longest serving member) was Ted Heath, who was followed by Tam Dalyell, one of the most independent minded and effective members. I remember him once rising after a particularly long and vapid ministerial answer and simply saying “why?” leaving the minister floundering. Tam was one of the few Scottish members opposed to devolving powers to a Scottish parliament. It was he who framed what became known as the “West Lothian Question” (he was the Member for West Lothian when he framed it though he was subsequently the Member of Linlithgow).\nBasically, at issue in the question was, if having once devolved Scottish educational matters to a parliament in Edinburgh, the fairness of the Member for Linlithgow voting in Westminster on educational matters in England which would have no effect in his own constituency.\nThe matter came to a head in the election campaign of 2015 because of the collapse of Labour support in its former Scottish Heartlands: Labour’s only prospect of getting into Government was believed to be, on the basis of polling, by relying on the support the Scottish nationalist MPs. Under such a scenario, England representing 80 of UK would have been governed at the will of Scottish MPs voting on matters whose own laws were devolved to an exclusively Scottish Parliament.\nTo the surprise of many it didn’t happen: a majority Conservative government was elected. One of its manifesto pledges however, was to address the issue with ‘English Votes for English Laws’ (EVAL). So, we changed the Standing Orders of the House of Commons (the nearest thing to a written constitution that we have) to exclude Scottish MPs from detailed stages of legislation not affecting Scotland and for the House to sit as an English Grand Committee in which Scottish MPs would not vote. The procedure was clumsy but effective.\nOut of the blue last week the Government introduced a motion to remove the procedure and to return to the status quo ante. I am at a loss as to its motive. The Covid-secure Westminster was empty and utterly ineffective. There were a handful of us there to vote against the measure, but to divide the House you need to supply two tellers, one for the ‘Aye’ Lobby and one for the ‘No’ lobby. Alas, so many of us have been persuaded not to act as ‘supper-spreaders’ by crowding the lobbies and instead to accept the innovation of voting by proxy. But if you are voting by proxy you cannot be a teller. So, when it came to the vote we couldn’t find anyone amongst us to be our second teller: Accordingly, English Votes for English Laws was ditched without a single recorded dissenting vote.\nDemocracy?\nCompulsory Vaccination is Here\nI am an enthusiast for vaccinations but I never dreamt we’d make them compulsory. In my blog of 3/12/20 Vaccination Passports (desmondswaynemp.com) I said it was unthinkable. Nevertheless, compulsory vaccination for anyone working in a care home will be introduced later this year, that includes any tradesman entering the premises to do repairs, or whatever.\nWe haven’t had compulsory vaccination since 1853 – which was soon reversed because it swiftly led to a collapse in the number of people willing to be vaccinated for smallpox, such was their suspicion of the new law.\nOf course, many clinicians have to have hepatitis vaccinations in order to practice, but they go into the profession knowing that. It is very different thing to turn round to a care worker mid-career and say ‘take the jab or lose your job’. This is no way to treat dedicated staff, who could well go elsewhere and do less demanding work for higher pay.\nI have received desperate representations from a number of care homes who are already under-staffed and fear that they will have to reduce their number of beds or even close.\nThis extraordinary departure from accepted norms was dealt with in our Covid Potemkin Parliament in a mere 90 minutes on a motion that was designed to obscure its purpose. The Statutory Instrument was almost double-Dutch and referred merely to a ‘medical procedure’.\nThe Government’s Impact Assessment of the measure was withheld from us and the minister either wouldn’t or couldn’t tell us what was in it.\nDemocracy is under attack from within, ably assisted by Covid-19\nUBI – Daft Economics\nI recall watching the early evening TV news in Jonesboro, Arkansas back in the mid-nineteen eighties and seeing footage of myself descending aircraft steps to the commentary “economist and professor, Mr Desmond Swayne flew into town to-day”. Well, it must have been a very thin day for news and they do use the term ‘professor’ very much more loosely than we do in the UK. Nevertheless, I was on a lecture tour of US universities, corporations and business organisations and the following morning I addressed a business breakfast at 7 AM, where most of the attendees had come from work, having already started an hour earlier -that’s productivity.\nIt is some now time since I passed myself off as an economist, but the facts of economic life are blindingly obvious. I am a member of the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee and we recently produced a report, the Future of Work. Select Committees are encouraged to reach their conclusions by consensus from the evidence presented to them during an inquiry. I’ve never been persuaded that consensus is a virtue: It is often the lowest common denominator and gives rise to some rather bland conclusions. On this occasion however, we couldn’t reach a consensus and voted on party lines not to include a recommendation on UBI within the report.\nNo matter how slight your acquaintance with the science of economics, UBI -the provision of a universal basic income, has got to be amongst the daftest of ideas. That it has attractions, I have no doubt: I’ve spoken to lots of furloughed employees who, despite having only 80% of their income (compensated somewhat by no longer having commuting costs) have rather enjoyed being paid to stay at home without having to work at all.\nEven Lenin insisted that “He who does not work shall not eat”. Who on earth would work if they were provided with an income that enabled them not to have to?\nThe argument advanced in favour of UBI is that it would not stop us from working but would provide a level of security against the possibility of a reduction in our earned income. But that is exactly what Universal Credit is there for. The difference is that UBI is to be paid to absolutely everyone where Universal Credit is only paid to those in need. It shouldn’t take an economics professor to spot that paying an income to absolutely everyone irrespective of their need, will mean you will have very much less available to concentrate on those who really are in need. Either that, or you tax everyone into to penury. .\nThey’d have understood this at breakfast in Jonesboro, even if they don’t in some parts of the Houser of Commons.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 20\n- 21\n- 22\n- 23\n- 24\n- …\n- 59\n- Next Page »",

I believe that it will have significantly added to the economic damage that the virus has inflicted, and I believe that it is an affront to our liberty.\nSo much of the correspondence that I have received reinforces the lockdown’s cruelty in preventing people visiting loved ones, when -in my estimate- sensible precautions would have enabled them to do so with very low risk.\nFrom the outset people have sought my advice. Now, generally, whilst I’m happy to give an opinion, I don’t give advice: I point out that I’m not qualified to give advice, and that I don’t have professional indemnity insurance for when it turns out that I’ve given bad advice.\nDuring the lockdown however, I have abandoned that caution. It was clear that there was a significant difference between public perceptions of the demands of the lockdown regulations and what the regulations actually state, a difference often reinforced by guidance given by officials.\nI sought to be helpful by publishing the regulations on my website.\nI was then besieged by requests for advice from people genuinely struggling to understand how their needs were affected. Principally, their enquiries were about whether they were permitted to continue working, but they covered the whole range of activity from where they could exercise and how often, even could they still move house. I was happy to accommodate them by pointing where they could use their discretion and common sense in interpreting the rules and the guidance.\nThen, someone facing a dilemma somewhat similar to that faced by Dominic Cummings asked for my advice, and I told him that what he proposed to do, seemed reasonable to me in the circumstances -particularly so, given the guidance of the Deputy Chief Medical Officer at the daily press conference on 24th March.\nSo, on the central charge of one rule for Cummings and one for the rest of us, I cannot condemn him.",

So, when the Gross Domestic Product numbers were published last week, confirming further economic growth ahead of the rest of the G7, and the headline was ‘boost for Starmer’ : the irony was not lost on me.\n*\nI am sorry to have lost so many diligent and committed colleagues at the election, many of whom will now have to find employment to support their families. I used to meet with a dozen colleagues on a Tuesday morning for a short Bible study. Alas only two of us have survived.\nI suppose that its very nature, politics is a risky career and politicians go into it knowing the odds.\nAny career, profession, or employment can end in disappointment, defeat, and failure. Perhaps the only real difference with politics is that such defeats are attended with the glare of publicity.\n*\nIronically, another group of politicians for whom I have a great deal of sympathy are the thirty or so Labour front-benchers who slogged it through the hard years in opposition, only to find that they have not been rewarded with a position in government.\nOpposition is a thankless task for a shadow minister, you are on your own marking your government opposite number, but without the special advisers and civil service back-up that your minister enjoys. You will spend your weekends travelling, at your own expense, to make a speech somewhere in the vain hope that someone is going to take any notice of what you have to say. I know, I did twelve years of it. To have done it faithfully, but not to have been rewarded with a government red box, will be a bitter pill to swallow.\nUndoubtedly, managing those the bruised egos will be a significant headache for the Labour whips, in addition to managing the expectations of their very large majority, many of whom may be rather unrealistic about their own prospects of achieving ministerial office any time soon.\nI suspect that the Government whips office will do what they did with their large majority in 1997. They simply won’t need them all to get their business through the Commons. So, they will be able to run shifts, allowing many to spend more time in their constituencies building up a reputation for being helpful, rather than plotting, airing grievances and frustrations in the Members’ Tea Room.\nAs to how it will all turn out, its far too soon to tell.",

We do also need to consider however, that the desire to smooth the transition will also have the effect of prolonging it: The longer that transition, the more we delay the full economic benefits of exiting the EU.\nAs part of this transition process and to inform our new immigration policy, the Government has commissioned a new study of Industry’s needs for migrant labour. I find it hard to believe that we do not already have this information. In any event, we need to be cautious about such studies. They are very dependent upon the assumptions and models that underlie them, and they can be interpreted to suit a particular point of view rather that add to the sum of knowledge. Furthermore, the capital and infrastructure costs of immigration (the impact on housing, hospitals and schools) are rarely taken into account when measuring the economic impact of immigration.\nNo matter how smooth we want our transition to be, we need to address over the longer term some key questions about the scale of our reliance on migrant labour:\nWhat is it about our education system that prevents it from equipping our young people with the skills that industry requires?\nWhat is it about our welfare system that ensures that, even in areas where unemployment remains relatively high, low skilled jobs are filled almost exclusively in some industries by migrants?\nWhy is our largest employer, the NHS, so dependent upon migrant healthcare professionals when half our own applicants for student nursing places are turned down, and students with 4 straight A grades at A level still cannot get a place in medical school?\nUntil we have resolved these issues we are unlikely to make much headway in reducing immigration irrespective of our discontinued membership of the EU.",

The reality is that tertiary education is one of our major export industries which is worth about £20 billion to the UK economy. It also allows own students to study at university at substantially lower fees, in effect subsidised by foreign students.\nThose foreign students return to their native countries with a British education and goodwill towards us, which will have a beneficial impact on developments, commercial and diplomatic, for years ahead.\nIt is right however, that we have clamped down on short and ‘low value’ courses which attract migrants who really aren’t interested in study but just want to find a way of getting into Britain.\nWe need however, to cut the 150,000 dependants that postgraduate students have been bringing with them. So, beginning with courses starting in January, students on taught postgraduate courses will no longer have the ability to bring dependants; only students on designated postgraduate research programmes will have that entitlement.\nAll this begs the question of why we include students, here temporarily, in our migration statistics at all, when most other jurisdictions don’t. The answer is simple: we always have; So, any government that chose to exclude them would be accused of ‘fiddling the figures’.\nWhich leaves us with the other half of the net migration figure: those on work visas.\nAs I’ve said before in this column, there isn’t an enterprise that I have visited that isn’t having difficulty recruiting staff. We have a million vacancies, yet 21% of our working age population, nearly 9 million people (including 3 million ‘on the sick’) are economically inactive.\nLittle wonder then, that businesses and public services sponsor so many visas for overseas workers, making a mockery of the ’points-based immigration system’ which was modelled on Australia’s.\nThe argument is made that -were we to abolish the list of critically short occupations allowable and to raise the salary threshold, the consequent fall in the number qualifying migrants would fuel inflation and cause some sectors to grind to a halt.\nI am sceptical. The counter argument is that, whilst migration is generating greater national income, the income per head of population is not growing in proportion. Genuine economic welfare may actually be falling as a result of the pressures on housing and public services arising from the growing migrant populations.\nFurthermore, despite the numbers arriving, the shortages persist: 70,000 people were recruited from abroad for care roles in the year to June, while the number of vacancies in the sector dropped by only 11,000.\nForeign workers cost employers 20% less than UK employees: this incentive to recruit from abroad should certainly be removed.\nBut the strain on our society, economic an social, of immigration well beyond what we can safely absorb, will not be assuaged until we can curb our appetite for foreign labour and address economic inactivity amongst our own working age population.",

Parents are now badgered by their children to get them one at an ever-younger ages. I understand that they are now by far the biggest strain of modern parenthood: trying to understand the technology, monitoring it, nagging, negotiating and fighting about it.\nOf course they have their uses, not least the reassurance that you can maintain contact with your children and know where they are. Beyond that however, they open the door to far too many dangers.\nThe National Crime Agency has issued an unprecedented alert to schools, after cases of “sextortion” increased eight-fold (this is blackmail where criminals, posing as teenagers, make contact with real children online).\nApart from enabling these approaches from sexual predators, smartphones expose children to inappropriate and extreme content: Seeing hardcore pornography, extreme violence, cyberbullying, self-harm and anorexia content are now all too commonplace occurrences for young people.\nSmartphones and the apps that they support are intentionally designed to be highly addictive. According to the regulator Ofcom ‘many children are spending six and even eight hours a day on social media – sometimes even more’, instead of playing and interacting in the real world with friends. Little wonder then, that teachers say that children find it increasingly difficult to concentrate, that they are often anxious, and that so many are lacking in self-esteem.\nCertainly, the Online safety Act is a good start with its very large fines for the media giants when they break the law.\nAlso, The Department for Education has published new guidance which backs head teachers in banning mobile phone use throughout the school day, including at break times, to tackle disruptive behaviour and online bullying.\nThe new guidance says that schools should prohibit the use of mobile phones, but they will have a free hand on how to do this. Schools will be supported to prohibit mobile phone use with examples of different approaches including banning phones from the school premises, handing in phones on arrival at school, and keeping phones securely locked away at school.\nFrankly, the smartphone has abolished normal childhood and polls say that 60% of parents want them banned for under-sixteens. The Government has now launched a consultation on this. I’m for going further and I would consider banning access to social media until adulthood.",

It is high time that we woke up, and addressed our neglected defences.\nWe have ignored the signs for so long:\nCyber-attacks on the Baltic states and throughout Europe; The annexation of South Ossetia and the aggression in Georgia; The annexation of the Crimea and war on Ukraine; Their complicity and lies over the destruction of the the MH17 flight from Amsterdam killing 298 passengers; The routine harassment of foreign diplomats; The persecution, imprisonment and assassination of dissidents and critics internally; The unbridled gangsterism and cleptocracy that has enabled Putin and his associates to amass fortunes in the £billions despite their modest official salaries; The campaign of assassination on foreign soil including ours; The horrendous human suffering in Syria which is a direct consequence of their active and lethal support for the Assad regime; Interfering in the elections of democratic states and the promotion of ‘fake news’.\nI could go on.\nThis wilful determination to avoid confronting the Russian menace has a long pedigree in our political establishment.\nDuring the Soviet ‘red terror’ with the shooting, starving, and deporting of millions there were many prominent UK politicians, trade unionists and intellectuals who simply denied that it was happening and continued to peddle the myth that the Russian Revolution was the most progressive thing to have happened in the history of civilisation, and that a utopia was under construction.\nWhen the Kulaks were being liquidated or transported to Siberia, the definition of what actually constituted a ‘kulak’ was extended to include all the clergy and the persecution of all religion was intensified with the intention of eliminating it altogether. The instinctive reaction of Ramsay MacDonald’s government was one of denial, with the active complicity of our ambassador to Moscow Sir Esmond Ovey, together with the Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson and his deputy Hugh Dalton.\nNotwithstanding this conspiracy of silence and denial, the truth of what was being done continued to emerge, causing the Archbishop of Canterbury to call for a national day of prayer throughout the Empire in support of Russian Christians of all denominations along with the adherents of other faiths.\nThe British Government’s quite extraordinary response was to order all military church parades not to observe the Archbishop’s prayers on Sunday 16th March 1930 and to prevent non-conformist servicemen from leaving barracks to attend their own church services.\nThe motives for complicity by silence were both ideological and financial. There was enormous support for the Soviet Union amongst British socialists and a corresponding disdain for religion. Then there was a determination to profit by promoting growing trade with the USSR–including the lucrative timber trade, reliant as it was on Soviet slave labour.\nIt is more difficult to discern what ideology might contribute to our wilful blindness in recent years (although there does still seem to be an unaccountable reluctance to criticise Russia on the part of the political extreme left).\nSo is it all just down to the money?",

Therefore, in those circumstances, whatever the misery and the innocent civilian casualties, there was no prospect for ceasefire, for compromise, we just had to prevail at whatever cost, or face oblivion.\nConstituents email me daily drawing my attention to the horrors on their TV screens, demanding my support for a ceasefire.

Events proved them wrong.\nI certainly hope that the same fate awaits all those economists, forecasters, pundits and journalists who have been almost hysterical in their denunciation of Kwasi Kwarteng’s Economic Statement to the Commons last week.\nPreviously in this column I have expressed my misgivings about the Government’s largesse and, most recently, its willingness to pay our energy bills (though I am persuaded that politically it had no alternative. Equally, the economic damage of recession as businesses and consumers retrenched in the face of their rising bills, would have been much greater than the costs of the relief package).\nA number of correspondents have sought to goad me with the charge that the Government has now found the ‘magic money tree’ notwithstanding having denounced Jeremy Corbyn on account of his belief in its existence. I reply by pointing out to them that our scope to borrow eye-watering sums to address energy bills, is based on our comparatively healthy debt to national income ratio. And that this relative health is entirely the consequence of the fiscal restraint of the 2010-2015 Coalition Government which inherited an economic basket case and fixed it. They really did fix the roof, even though the sun wasn’t shining. It hurt but it worked.\nI share entirely the free-market ideology that underpins the Chancellor’s statement. I support his vision for enterprise and investment to drive economic growth. My only reservation is that reduced taxation should be matched by reductions in government expenditure: A bigger role for free enterprise ought to be matched by a smaller role for the state.\nThere are risks: The higher borrowing might spook financial markets and drive up the costs of servicing our debt. The tax cuts might, with so many supply constraints still present as an overhang from the pandemic economy, add fuel to inflation, to which the Bank of England will respond with further interest rate increases. Nevertheless, alternative courses were hardly attractive with the prospect recession and stagnation. The Chancellor was right to be radical.\nWhat particularly upset my correspondents was the abolition of the cap on banker’s bonuses. I am glad he grasped this socialist nettle. It is grotesque to limit the pay for people simply because we do not like them. It’s like cutting the pay of Premier League footballers just because we think they earn too much. We’d soon regret it when they went to play elsewhere. The Financial crisis of 2008 was caused by a confused and ineffective regulatory environment and not by bonuses.

Of course, when it became clear that I was so determined, they quite properly facilitated the decision that I had made. I have no doubt that on both occasions I was right, and that the outcome was successful.

The al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza is an example of this. Before Christmas, the hospital was severely damaged again and a tank demolished its front wall. Most of the hospital staff were taken away by the Israeli Defence Force and the Church of England has asked the Government here to inquire about their wellbeing and whereabouts and to request that they be released.\nSir Desmond Swayne\nIntimidation by hard-line settlers has prompted the Patriarch to say that clergy are fighting for their lives, and that the Armenian quarter faces a ‘violent demise’.\nIs a Christian presence in Jerusalem still viable?\nAndrew Selous\nI am grateful to my right hon. Friend for bringing this issue before the House. He is right: a century ago, a quarter of Jerusalem was Christian; now, just 1% of the population is, and in the Armenian quarter of the old city, the Christian presence has come under intensified threat from intimidation and aggressive property acquisition by settlers. The Church of England is very concerned that the rule of law should prevail in Israel and the status quo be maintained. It is unconscionable that Christians should be driven from the holy land.”\nI quote this exchange that took place in the Commons last Thursday to draw attention to two important issues.

I hope it isn’t true – and one has to be cautious about any partisan reports (as the BBC has learnt -or failed to learn- to its own cost).\nWhat I will say however, as a former minister responsible for our assistance to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, I reached the conclusion that the Government of Israel had abandoned any prospect of a two-state solution and that this was made evident by support for the building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank that would make any future Palestinian state geographically and economically unviable.\nWhenever, I’ve badgered current ministers about this, they always respond by saying that we constantly raise this issues with Israel.

The Lords have already amended the Withdrawal Bill to require the UK to remain within the customs union.\nWill the Commons follow their lead?\nOf course, to do so would be extraordinary given that 80% of us voted less than a year ago for political parties committed explicitly to leave the customs union (whatever they have decided subsequently).\nDesire to stay is bizarre: it would require us to hand over the conduct of our trade policy to EU officials without any influence over their decision making, their priorities, or any ability to hold them to account for their conduct of it.\nAny trade deals negotiated between the EU and other third countries would require us to open our markets on the terms negotiated but without reciprocal concessions for us.\nIt is the daftest of policies. Why on earth would anyone contemplate it?\nThe answer is simple: it is at least one way of scuppering BREXIT.\nThe customs union is the essential core of the EU. It was there from the foundation and long predates the internal market. If you like, think of it as the walls of Mordor, it protects the fortress from trade from the rest of the world with a common external tariff. Or think of it as the “one ring to rule them all…and in the darkness bind them” as It holds the EU together in one mercantilist relationship against free trade with the world.\nRemaining within it would be a betrayal of ‘taking back control’ and all that we voted for in the referendum, but there is no arguing with its adherents. It is the nearest thing to a religious belief. To accept the will of the people would, for them, be like denying the existence of their god.\nDo not despair, the battle is not lost yet, but it will be very tight indeed.\nIf we were to lose it however, who would be to blame?\nDon’t blame the Lords, they have no power if overawed by the Commons.\nSo blame the Commons, but remember that it was the voters who determined its current composition less than a year ago.\nIf we did lose that vote, whatever advisers in in Number 10 may do, or however few ministers resign, I will certainly be one of those shedding tears into my beer.",

They maintain the distinctive character of our countryside and provide crucial habitats and food for wildlife. Hedgerows can store carbon, improve local air quality and benefit the rural economy by boosting job creation for hedgerow planting and management in local communities.\nProtection of hedgerows is a key component of the Government’s Environmental Land Management Schemes. Through the Countryside Stewardship schemes, Ministers are supporting farmers to maintain and restore over 10,000km of existing hedgerows while planting an additional 4,000km across the nation. As of January 2023, there were around 32,000 Countryside Stewardship agreements. This is a 94 per cent increase from 2020, and this included payments for 52,800km of hedgerows maintenance and management.\nFurther, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs’ (Defra’s) new Sustainable Farming Incentive (SFI) hedgerow standard will pay farmers to assess the condition of hedgerows and manage them in a way that will work for wildlife and improve biodiversity. SFI payments were increased by 10 per cent at the beginning of this year, providing more money for farmers deliver change.\nThis increased support for farmers will result in the creation of more hedgerows and flower-rich grass areas on the edge of fields. This will help the UK to meet its environment targets and contribute to the UK’s aim of halting biodiversity loss by 2030.\nCross compliance rules ended at the end of last year. This is because gaps between cross compliance rules and regulatory requirements are already covered by existing and ongoing strong domestic legal framework, such as through generalised provisions in Farming Rules for Water and the Water Resources Act, guidance like the Code of Practice for the use of Plant Protection Products, and standards in the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme. As a result of these, my Defra colleagues do not believe farmers will lower standards and there will not be significant negative environmental impacts in these areas.\nFinally, Defra recently carried out a consultation on how best to maintain and improve existing protections for hedgerows, as well as how they can be enforced. The consultation is now closed and a response will be published in due course.\nDS",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_the-budget-3/content_507.html": "I always find that it is best to reserve one’s thoughts on the budget until the Commons has finished debating it, and that was only on Tuesday evening – although there will be another thrash when the Finance Bill begins its parliamentary proceedings.\nNormally votes on the budget resolutions keep us till late into the night. This time however, there were only two divisions: Labour voted against the reductions in pension taxation and the Scottish Nationalists voted against the freeze in alcohol duty (what were they thinking!).\nPersonally, I much preferred the short-lived proposals in Kwasi’s Autumn statement. His mistake was to announce his intention to implement them all at once, and at the same time as a very generous scheme to subsidise all our gas and electricity bills.\nBy contrast, the tax increases in this budget will hurt, particularly the increase in corporation tax for businesses and the freezing of personal allowances for the rest of us. Nevertheless, our addiction to public expenditure and the expectation that the state will take ever greater responsibility for ‘looking after us’ has to be paid for somehow.\nAnd we must kick the habit of borrowing: I am alarmed that the government debt that our pension funds and other institutions have acquired may now be crowding-out productive investment opportunities.\nThere were two ‘give-aways’. First the abolition of the lifetime-limit on pension savings. This is a very sensible measure to remove the incentive to retire early for so many professionals, especially highly skilled doctors.\nLabour, by opposing the measure, because they say it is only of benefit to ‘the rich’ have, first got their sums wrong, and second, they’ve lost all sense of proportion. 27% of those who will benefit are doctors, 5% are teachers, 13% will other public sector employees such as senior police officers and many will be skilled technicians, scientists and entrepreneurs. It is in all our interests to encourage them to continue working and earning.\nIn any event, for all labour’s confected rage, I recall that, as Treasury Lord Commissioner, I signed into law ‘The Pensions Increase (Pension Scheme for Kier Starmer QC) Regulations 2013’. I believe the advantages extended to Sir Keir should also be available -for all our sakes- to keep skilled operators in the workforce when we are so desperately short of them.\nThe second big announcement was the extension of free childcare provision. I understand the rationale – clearly the affordability of childcare is one of the major restrictions that prevent parents from working. However, I do have reservations. First, there is a structural problem: The providers are in the private sector but the price is determined, not by the market, but by government. The problem hitherto has been that the price government has set is insufficient for the providers and, consequently, supply has diminished; It’s no good having a right to hours of free childcare if you can’t find people who will provide it.\nWhether the extended childcare that the Government is offering can be delivered, will depend entirely upon the price that it sets.\nAs we have the highest childcare costs in Europe we should attach a higher priority to reducing some of the bureaucratic impositions that bind the providers.\nAlso, there has to be a amelioration of the very substantial tax disadvantages experienced by single-income families when one parent looks after the children full-time. It just isn’t fair.\nAnd finally, nothing is free. The Government’s hands will be in our pockets to pay for it one way or another.",

I confess that I always found the parents much harder work, but never to the extent of anything anywhere near the threshold of what might be described as ‘verbal abuse’.\nUndoubtedly society has become coarser and more disordered, but there remain spectacularly well-disciplined schools in some of the least favoured areas.\nAs with any walk of life, some teachers are outstanding and others less so. Yet when I became a teacher, my parents were very proud. That is because their generation had such respect for the profession. I believe the esteem, even awe, in which the profession was once held has significantly diminished. To some extent, at least, that may account for the difficulties that teachers now face.\nWhy has the high esteem in which the teaching profession was held been so diminished?\nThis is my prejudice: The unionisation of the profession over several years, by adopting the mores of the factory shop-floor, and by embracing strike action, have fundamentally changed the perception of what was once a profession, even a calling, into what is now -almost- just another ‘job’.\nThe teaching unions continue to display such antics and ideology at their Easter conferences that they are fortunate indeed very few are watching or listening. But those same unions welcomed so many heresies of the modern age into the classroom over the years, that cumulatively have made the work of their members so much more difficult and less rewarding.\nHaving left teaching and returning as a school governor just a few years later, I recall being dismayed at the disorder and familiarity -and we all know what that breeds- experienced in classrooms. Some teaching methods struck me as just draft.\nThe decline in literacy and numeracy that resulted, could not be ignored. The imposition of the National Curriculum, of Key Stage tests, of OFSTED, were all part of a remedy to hold the teaching profession accountable.\nInevitably they have, to some extent, become part of the problem. They certainly make the lives of teachers much more difficult, but they were introduced for very good reasons.\nThere remains within the profession a minority that have taken leave of their senses, exemplified in what can pass in some schools for sex education – as I described in this column on 9th March Abolishing Childhood (desmondswaynemp.com)\nReturning to what teachers may have to deal with in the classroom. Of course, in my day it was somewhat easier because we had the threat of the cane.

Of course, the Runcorn by-election and the Local Elections on Thursday have created a greater urgency and accelerated this email correspondence over the last 48 hours.\nThe difficulty is that no such arrangement is on offer. On current performance, Reform is convinced that it can beat Labour without any pact with the Tories.\nEqually, for the Tories, nothing ever turns out to be as bad as first reported. It will take time to see if the Conservative Party can recover its reputation for competence and with that, its electoral support. Tories will want to watch as Reform has to survive the much greater level of media scrutiny that will now accompany its electoral success. The life of this Parliament will be a marathon and not a sprint: it is far too soon to make predictions as to how things will progress and what will be he impact of, as yet unknown events.\nNevertheless, when the next general election is much closer, if the polling and the way that political landscape has developed suggests that minority support for a further term of Labour government is likely to prevail, then both Reform and the Conservatives may review the question of an electoral pact as the lesser of two evils.\nA number of difficulties will arise for any such endeavour.\nThere can be no doubt that Nigel Farage has been one of the most influential politicians of my lifetime. He was once an enthusiastic Conservative, a devotee of Sir Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher. Yet he became convinced that the Conservatives would never be persuaded to leave the EU and for that reason would need to be destroyed and replaced. Inevitably, this history makes for a relatively difficult reconciliation.\nNext, as Reform has advanced at the expense of Conservative support, it has increasingly turned its attention to the battle to win support from former Labour voters. As it has done so, its rhetoric and policy is becoming more remote from the free market economics that are core beliefs of ‘Thatcherite’ Conservatives, and which were once Farage’s original inspiration.\nThird, Reform is determined to implement proportional representation which is anathema to Tories, who believe that it will perpetuate continental style coalition government.\nFinally, Farage is someone that many Conservatives detest. He has been an apologist for both Putin and also for some of the most egregious behaviour of Donald Trump.\nDetestation, however, is still negotiable and ultimately, expediency will prevail.\nA view will be taken on the basis of an electoral calculation of the consequences of not negotiating a pact. Until that time, both Conservatives and Reform, will be each hoping that their fortunes and the turn of events will enable them to avoid having to consider it.\nIt is just far too soon to be led by an over-excited press, to be speculating about it.",

My host, after all, was merely following government guidance. Ministers have told us that notwithstanding the success of the vaccination programme, “reclaiming our lost freedoms and getting back to normal hinges on us all getting tested regularly”\nIndeed, starting from the 9th April provision was made for each of us to take lateral flow tests twice weekly.\nI wonder how many readers of this column have done so, or intend to.\nIt certainly doesn’t sound much like a return to normal life to me.\nActually, I think it’s plain bonkers.\nIn England there are 56.3 million of us, with each of us testing twice per week that’s 104 tests annually, 6 billion for all of us put together. The tests come in at £5 each, which amounts to £30 billion per year.\nIs this a sensible way to spend such a vast sum of money, (instead we might increase England’s NHS budget by fully 40%)?\nAnd another thing…I’ve already raised my concerns about the accuracy of tests in Parliament.\nThe lateral flow test gives false positives at a rate of only 0.3% – only 3 in every 10,000 tests. Nevertheless, were we all to obey the guidance to test ourselves twice per week, then 34,000 of us would end up having to isolate ourselves every week to no purpose, then multiply that by the numbers in the household who will then have to do likewise.\nVery quickly the appetite for testing will diminish, if indeed it is ever first established, as people fear the consequent inconvenience of a false positive result. After all, the one thing most of us learnt at school is that, if you fear that you may not like the answer…then don’t ask the question\nWhy on earth are we behaving as if the vaccination programme is not the success that it clearly is?\nCould it be that we already ordered and paid for the tests before the vaccination success was evident, and that the Government feel’s obliged not to waste them, and to waste our time instead.",

We are reliant on the hyperbole of journalists who were not present. A ‘prosecco-fuelled party’ might just have been a restrained glass of wine amongst properly distanced work colleagues in an office where they lawfully worked together. Access to the facts is important.\nAlso important, particularly for politicians reliant on the support of voters, is the public perception of these events, and that perception may already be settled opinion.\nThe calculation with which Conservative members of Parliament must wrestle is whether the PM is capable of regaining public trust and the authority to govern. He has, after all, managed it previously: My correspondence was equally large and angry following his failure to sack Dominic Cummings after his ‘eye-test’ at Barnard Castle. Yet he re-established a ten-point poll lead. Could he repeat the feat, or has he irretrievably trashed his brand?\nThey also need to consider the unpredictability of the outcome if they initiate the process of replacing the PM.\nThere remain dedicated and enthusiastic supporters of Boris in Parliament, in the voluntary Conservative party and amongst the Public: I know this because hundreds of them have emailed me.

It is difficult to find anything to say that can lift the human spirit about a time during which we have witnessed scenes of barbarity that nobody should expect to see except perhaps in the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch.

I am not quite sure how we get it back from hungry children in South Sudan, but that can wait, because it is far too soon to tell. Final statistics are not yet available and all we currently have are estimates. Last year at this stage a similar overspend was estimated, and the year before a bigger one. In the end it was found that we spent exactly the right amount.\nThey claim that the expenditure is unscrutinised. It isn’t. It’s subject to thorough scrutiny by two parliamentary committees; the Independent Commission on Aid Impact, and the National Audit office. The public can scrutinise it for themselves using the Aid Tracker tool on our website. We are up at the top of the league for transparency.\nThey claim we rush money out of the door with reckless abandon as the year-end approaches. We don’t.

What really upsets some people that they believe that ‘charity begins at home’. Their fundamental error is thinking of it as charity. It isn’t. It is an investment. It is spent in our national interest in order that we can live in a safer, more stable, and more prosperous world. We spend it for our benefit. The huge numbers of migrants fleeing poverty, violence, and injustice should bring home to anyone the truth that, unless we invest to deal with their problems at source, those problems are coming in our direction.\nAs for being one of the largest donors, the UK always takes the lead, it’s what we do.

In addition, the Government’s consultation on this received more than 7,000 responses.\nFollowing this research, as well as engagement with trainers, behaviourists, e-collar manufacturers, the animal welfare sector, veterinary and dog keeping organisations, the Government will ban training collars in England that can deliver an electric shock to a cat or dog by a hand-held remote-controlled device.\nThis ban will not extend to collars which use alternative stimuli, such as noise, spray or vibration. Invisible fencing systems which help animals quickly learn to stay within a boundary and have welfare benefits, such as keeping pets away from roads, will also still be permitted. These new regulations will come into force on 1 February 2024.\nDS",

There is no question that it was entirely foreseeable and a consequence of the relatively light touch of the French approach to the policing of their beaches.\nIt also puts into perspective the many emails that I have received from constituents demanding that our own Border Force abandon the ‘taxi service’ shepherding the dinghies to our shores when they reach our territorial waters.\nOur officers have received training on how to turn back the dinghies but the circumstances in which this is permissible are very limited and it is fraught with danger – they are the flimsiest of craft.\nJust consider what the state of public opinion and overseas commentary would now be, had the loss of life occurred on a boat that we had turned back: we would be an international pariah.\nCritics on the opposition benches in the Commons argue that the cross channel route would be rendered obsolete if only we would open up more lawful routes by which applicants for asylum can reach the UK.\nI do not believe it is fair to fault us on that score: The UK initiated a scheme for 20,000 vulnerable Syrians. We are about to initiate a similar scheme for 20,000 vulnerable Afghans, which is in addition to the 15,000 that we evacuated from Afghanistan in August – most of whom are still living in hotels and short-term accommodation as we try and find permanent dwellings for them across the UK.\nIn addition, we have set up a scheme in response to China’s repression in Hong Kong, which is projected to receive around 422,000 applications in its first four years. The scheme requires that applicants hold a British National Overseas passports which were issued to citizens following the handover of Hong Kong from the UK to China in 1997. Whilst the scheme allows applicants to bring adult children with them to the UK, nevertheless, many young people have had to flee alone, having been involved in the protests against the loss of liberty. They do not qualify themselves because they were not born when Hong Kong was handed over to China and they have left their qualifying parents behind, who wish to remain in Hong Kong. So, now there is an amendment before the Immigration and Borders bill to extend the scheme to these young people as well.\nI share the desire of the constituents that we be compassionate to those whose circumstances are so much less fortunate than our own, but the political reality is that the desire to come to the UK for a better life is pretty well unlimited and inevitably has to be rationed.\nAs I have so often argued in this column, our most effective contribution is the one we make as the world’s second largest donor, in the form of our international development aid to alleviate the conditions in the places from which the occupants of the dinghies are fleeing.",

It reminds me of one of my favourite books The Coffee Table Book of Doom. Here is a flavour from the advertising blurb:\n“…with the apocalypse at hand, don’t fret about dying uninformed. The Coffee Table Book of Doom is a revelatory…superbly illustrated and erudite compendium of all the 27 doom-laden horsemen we need to worry about – personal doom, gender erosion, asteroid impact, pandemics, super storms, sexual ruin – and much more besides.”\nActually, the definitive ending of the world was supposed to have been in 2012 when the 5000 year old Mayan civilisation’s calendar ran out.\nWe can comfort ourselves with the thought that every generation thought that it would be the last. Even Our Lord predicted that ”these things will come to pass” within the lifetime of some of his listeners –Matthew 16.28 (he was right: the second temple was destroyed in 70 AD and the world as they had known it really did come to a dramatic and very violent end).\nLet us start with a brief tour of some of the current threats to world stability and prosperity.\nOne of the falsehoods of the EU referendum campaign was the IMF analysis that stated that BREXIT would be the greatest current threat to the world Economy. It was nonsense, but there are major threats to the world economy:\nThe very sticky, if not completely fixed currency exchange rates, are preventing many countries from emerging from recession and to deal with their sovereign debt, or rebalancing trade surpluses and deficits;\nThe very low interest rates which have reduced incentives to save and invest, with consequent weak productivity growth;\nThe danger to the free trade and prosperity potentially posed by the new US administration’s protectionist rhetoric.\nOne symptom of all the world’s troubles is the tide of humanity on the move, in pursuit of safety and a livelihood. Although many are fleeing violence and persecution, the overwhelming motive is the need to find a secure future: in the end it is all about jobs. The world needs 600 million new jobs over the next decade if we are to avoid a growing army of young people who are under-employed, increasingly frustrated and angry. That itself is a threat to our future, and can only be addressed by investment in the growth of the world economy.\nClimate change is a threat to our entire planet. The agreement in Paris in December 2015 signalled that, at last, 195 UN member states were taking it seriously enough to do something about it, but now this consensus has been undermined by the declared policy stance, and early actions of the US administration.\nIn the 21st century we have the obscenity of famine looming in South Sudan, Yemen and northern Nigeria. South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, is stricken by drought –an entirely predictable phenomenon for which relief can be planned in advance. What is really starving the people is a vicious civil war. Warfare is the cause of Starvation in northern Nigeria with Boko Haram, and in Yemen where the Houthi rebels – armed by Iran- have overthrown the legitimate government which is backed by a coalition of Gulf States.\nWhich brings me to the civil wars within Islam between the orthodox Sunni, Shi’ism, and Sunni Islamists. At the very least this religious conflict is a feature –if not the entire cause- of the conflicts in Iraq, Yemen, Libya and Syria. It threatens to destabilise Jordan, Lebanon, and the Sahel. It contributes to so much violence in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and indeed on the streets of the western nations. I think it is proper to refer to it as a civil war within Islam because, notwithstanding the attacks launched at minorities, Christians and secular governments, overwhelmingly the greater number of victims are themselves Muslims.\nLooking elsewhere, there is no difficulty in identifying other dangers to peace and stability:\nA resurgent Russia, a gangster state laundering its corrupt cash in the world’s financial system, has fostered war and violence in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. It has intervened in Syria, is shaping up to do so in Libya, and is suspected of having launched cyber attacks on the Baltic States;\nChina’s militarisation of the South China Sea threatens Taiwan, Vietnam, Japan, The Philippines, international navigable waters, and the supremacy of the USA in a worrying potential new area of conflict;\nThe hermit state of North Korea’s development of increasingly longer range missiles to deliver its nuclear capability adds perhaps the most unpredictable element to our brief tour.\nWe’ve hardly scratched the surface, but let’s return briefly to Palestine where we began.\nOur Department for International Development employees in Jerusalem, who travel into the city daily on a tortuous commute from the areas around Bethlehem, are young people in their mid-20s to mid-30s. The only interaction that they ever have with an Israeli subject is when, during that journey, they are challenged to show their papers under the operation of what I would call the ‘pass laws’ that exist to ensure that people’s ability to live, stay and work in their own city is restricted.\nI entirely understand how we got to that dreadful situation: because of the obscenity of suicide bombing. Israel could not possibly tolerate the wholesale slaughter of its innocent citizens. The key question for us is, having got to this dreadful situation, how we get back from it. It is one thing to demand, quite properly, face-to-face negotiations, but pursuing a policy in respect of illegal settlements makes those negotiations much more difficult, particularly when that policy is driven by an increasingly strident ideology.\nIn February when a Bill was passed in the Knesset retrospectively legalising 4,000 homes in illegal settlements, the Israeli Minister of Culture welcomed the result, saying that it was\n“the first step towards complete…Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.”\nThe words “Judea and Samaria” were chosen carefully.\nWhen President Trump was elected, the Israeli Interior Minister, no less, welcomed it by saying that we are witnessing\n“the birth pangs of the Messiah when everything has been flipped to the good of the Jewish people”.\nit is absolutely clear that a significant proportion of the Israeli political establishment is in thrall to an increasingly strident settler movement that regards Palestine as a biblical theme park— Judea and Samaria.\nThe more strident and aggressive outriders of the settler movement are not people we would necessarily welcome as our neighbours. I particularly refer to what is now happening in Hebron. Setting aside some of the ruses that are used to acquire property, when the settlers move in, it is actually their Palestinian neighbours who have to erect grilles and meshes over their windows, and fences around their yards, to exclude projectiles and refuse. The reaction of the security forces to protect their newly resident citizens is to impose an exclusion zone, and to cordon off and sanitise the access and areas around those properties. So proceeding, Palestinians find that they are excluded from the heart of their city and, indeed, from the environs of their own homes. It has all the appearance of what we used to describe as petty apartheid.\nSecretary Kerry explained at the turn of the year why the United States would no longer pursue its policy of exercising its veto in respect of UN Security Council resolution 2334. He said that if the two-state solution were abandoned, Israel could no longer be both a democracy and a Jewish state because, as a consequence of abandoning the policy, it would have to accommodate Palestinian citizens and all their civil and political rights within the state of Israel. My fear is that, on the contrary, there is an element within the Israeli establishment that believes that it can do exactly that. It can, while the world is distracted by more pressing conflicts elsewhere, proceed to annex the West Bank of the Jordan and to tell the Palestinians to seek their civil rights in Jordan, or in reserved ‘bantustans’.\nSo, what is to be our response to all the dangers and problems that confront us in the world?\nI think it must be threefold:\nFirst, we must keep faith with the rules based post WWII order. That means reforming and strengthening the United Nations system.\nSecond, we must hold fast to the principles of free trade, whatever may be the short term temptations of protectionism. Trade dwarfs aid, and the agenda for free trade, so important to our own prosperity, is of even greater significance to the developing world, and the least developed nations.\nThird, we need to stick to the commitment we made over 40 years ago to spend 0.7% of our national income on development aid internationally. We are the only G7 nation, thus far, to have done so. It is important that we continue to give leadership to the world in this vital area. If we had met the commitment when we made it, and if all the other wealthy nations had done so too, we might now be dealing with a much more secure and stable world than we are now facing.",

In 2019, the Gambling Commission introduced new age and identity verification rules to ensure operators verify customers’ age and identity details quickly and robustly. Furthermore, in 2020, the Government and Commission strengthened these protections further, including a ban on credit card gambling, making participation in the self-exclusion scheme GAMSTOP mandatory for online operators, as well as issuing new guidance for operators to address the potential for some customers to be at heightened risk during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Gambling Commission is looking at the role technology and data can play in preventing harm from arising and it will soon publish its enhanced requirements for customer interaction, thereby making sure gambling operators are doing proper checks, and the Government is looking at this in their review too.\nDS.",

In fact, I had spent some time in the country on a number of visits in the mid-nineteen- seventies when it was a very different country. I recall hiring a horse for a couple of days and riding out on my own to the stunning lake at Band-e-Amir and to the standing Buddhas at Bamiyan (- subsequently destroyed by the Taliban).\nGiven the blood and treasure that we have sacrificed over the last twenty years, I believe that NATO’s withdrawal is a profoundly mistaken policy. It is some years since NATO troops were actually involved in the fighting: with the exception of US air attack missions, NATO’s contribution has been largely confined to training and mentoring the Afghan security forces, whom we are now abandoning.\nThe advance of the Taliban is a catastrophe for women, girls and religious minorities, as well as to the ordinary liberties of everyone in that country. The prospects for educated women, many of whom have taken leading roles in the Parliament, media and the professions, are particularly bleak.\nWe can expect another even greater wave of refugees seeking to arrive on our shores.\nThe Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Nick Carter has said that we shouldn’t write-off the Republic yet: that there are signs that the population is showing the sort of defiance needed to win this battle; that they are rallying in support of the security forces which are pursuing a sensible and realistic strategy of consolidation to fight the Taliban to a stalemate. He says we must help them stay firm and force the Taliban to the negotiating table. He concludes that much depends on who wins the “battle of the narratives”\nHe’s right: winning the ‘battle of the narrative’ is vital for morale, the maintenance of which, is a most important principle of war and essential to success.\nOur policy however, appears designed to do the exact opposite. We do seem to be ‘writing-off’ the Republic. Our proper concern for the safety of Afghan interpreters who served our armed forces is laudable and indeed, our sacred duty. Our haste however, in securing their evacuation, sends a clear signal to those who are still fighting, that we believe there is no hope. Now a similar commitment is being given to evacuate Afghan journalists.\nI pray that the Afghan warriors, so many of whom have been trained by UK forces at our ‘Sandhurst in the Sand’, will prove the defeatists wrong.",

Its central floor tiling design\ndisplays words from Psalm 127 “Unless the Lord Build the House, those that labour, labour in vain”;\nThe hammer beam ceiling of Westminster Hall, the only surviving part of the original palace dating back 900 years, is held aloft by 26 carved angels.\nThe first official daily business in Parliament is prayers: in the Commons read by Mr Speaker’s Chaplain, and in the Lords by one its 26 Bishops.\nOf Course, as with the rest of the nation, we have long abandoned the notion that the season of Advent, like Lent, was supposed to be a fast in preparation for the subsequent feast.\nNevertheless, the nature of the building, lit with Christmas lights, in the dark mornings and early evenings, makes it much easier to ‘plug into’ the proper spirit of Advent: Hope.\nAnd don’t we need such hope when our TV screens are filled with the intolerable suffering of children in so many ravaged and war-torn places.\nAdvent carol services, of which there have been four in the last week at Westminster, begin with Isaiah’s prophesy of Christ’s Birth 700 years before the event. Isaiah’s was a time of hope when Israel had returned from 70 years exile in Babylon, to rebuild Jerusalem.\nAdvent is about Hope In darkest of times; Hope in the promise of a New Heaven and a New Earth.\nKarl Marx regarded such hope as an ‘opiate’ to make the miserable lives of the proletariat tolerable by placing their hopes in the joys of a future life; An opiate propagated by the bourgeoisie to prevent the proles from rising and taking revolutionary action to change the terms of their miserable existence.\nArguably, religious belief in a future life may dull the disappointments of this one. Nevertheless, if we have religious hope, it in no way constitutes any disproof of what it is that we hope for. In the same way, during a night of anxiety we might hope for the dawn.

Nevertheless, it was debated in the Commons again last week (though no vote took place).\nThe one change that has taken place is that the Royal College of Physicians has moved from a stance of opposition to medical assistance in dying, to one of neutrality. This change was secured after a ballot of its members. Curiously, the rules for the ballot required a majority of 60% to maintain what was then the status quo (opposition to doctor assisted dying). At 43.4 % most physicians voted to keep the College’s opposition, 31.6% voted to have the College support it and Only 25% thought the college should be neutral. The College has therefore adopted the position taken by fewest of its voting members!\nI wonder what consideration was given to how profoundly the proposal would change the nature of the medical profession. How will our attitude to doctors change when, in addition to healing, they also bring the instruments of death?\nSuicide itself used to be against the law.

Are we really ready for the scale of what is proposed?\nI have every sympathy for those with a terminal condition but who do not have the means to visit the Dignitas Clinic in Switzerland, and who want to have the option of their doctor killing them when their condition becomes too painful and undignified to bear any longer.\nThe consequences of changing the law to accommodate them however, strike me a potentially much worse.\nWhat begins as an ‘option’ may quickly become an ‘expectation’.\n“After all, you wouldn’t want to become a burden, would you?”\nA clinical director from Canada visited Parliament recently and made a presentation in the House of Lords at which I was present.

(desmondswaynemp.com) in which I argued that inflation is driven by the quantity of money rising faster than the goods and services available for it to purchase. As against material and production cost increases being passed on by the producers to consumers in higher prices.\nAs any producer or retailer knows, you can’t just pass on your additional costs to consumers in the expectation that they will pay-up. There will be a price that the market will bear, beyond which consumers will reduce their consumption and switch to other products. A retailer needs to consider whether a price increase will actually reduce his total revenue, because a reduction in sales might be proportionately greater than the increase in the price charged.\nAny enterprise facing increased costs needs to consider whether those costs are worth incurring given the price that consumers are willing to pay, or whether it is better just to pack-up and do something else instead.\nIn a consumption driven economy like ours, when external factors (like war in Ukraine or the closure of strategically important ports in China due to Covid) send basic commodity prices up, consumers prioritise what they need to spend and reduce discretionary expenditure. Inevitably, there will be hardship and unemployment among the suppliers of those discretionary items.\nEqually, workers -faced by higher prices, demand higher wages. Which, when granted, will reduce the demand for their labour resulting in further unemployment.\nSuch is our concern about unemployment that governments seek to generate additional demand in the economy, through increased public and private expenditure financed by credit (i.e. more money) in order to sustain full-employment at the higher level of prices. This is inflation: you need more money to buy the same amount of stuff; your money holds less value relative to what it can buy; Money, like anything else, is less valuable because there is more of it.\nFrom the late sixties to the late seventies governments tried to control inflation by regulating prices and wages instead of dealing with the fundamental causes -which were their own policies of expanding the money supply in an attempt to cure rising unemployment.\nSince the shock of the financial melt-down of 2008, governments have similarly stood by as central banks sustained economic activity through a new way of increasing credit (‘quantitative easing’). We enjoyed the party, but now we have the inflation hangover.\nThe whole world economy has endured the same oil and food price shock, but inflation differs in each developed economy according to the monetary expansion engineered over the last decade. Japan eschewed that policy; that’s why its inflation is only just over 1%.\nWe need stop drinking now, and recover from the hangover",

There were even some cads whose business always seemed to count for more that the Government’s majority.\nThe problem was that I had to act at the first sign of trouble: if you have to get ministers back from Asia, Africa, and the Americas you cannot afford to wait. 48 hours or so later, with the problem vote imminent, the whipping operation having been in overdrive, many of the rebels had been ‘burnt-off’, but I couldn’t have known that at the early stages of the operation. Consequently, one could end up winning embarrassingly easily, but having put one’s colleagues to enormous trouble.\nIn reality, the current pairing whip will have a much easier ride.

Britain’s support for the Fund is saving a life every three minutes and will dramatically improve the lives of millions of people.\nWhen we announced our support to the fund back in September 2013, we explained that we would give our contribution to the fund over three years – so long as others joined us in ensuring it meets its target and our contribution came to no more than 10 per cent of the total replenishment by the time that three year period ended. This is exactly what we are doing. The claim by The Times that the UK has breached our own rules on donations is just plain wrong.\nThe Global Fund has already saved millions of lives and Britain’s support is turning that success into long lasting change that brings us one step closer to a world free from AIDS, TB and malaria. This is in all our interests and is something readers of The Times, and people across Britain, can be proud of.\nEvery week there is some story or other in the papers designed to undermine our international aid programme and suggest that it is a waste of money. When I read this latest story I was visiting some of the poorest people in the most awful circumstances, people that we are seeking to help by giving them a livelihood and hope. This is in our national interests: it stops people trying to risk the desperate journey to try and get a better life by illegally entering Britain; and it stops others from turning to terrorism.\nWhen constituents complain to me that we are spending 0.7% of our income on overseas aid, I remind them that this means we are still spending 99.3% on ourselves.",

The need for radical, robust action to protect one of the world’s most iconic and treasured species is beyond dispute. Ivory should no longer be a commodity for financial gain or a status symbol.\nThe legislation we have passed implements a ban on ivory sales which builds on work at home and overseas to tackle poaching and the illegal ivory trade. Our soldiers are training African park rangers in proven poacher interception techniques in key African countries, and our Border Force officers share their expertise in identifying smuggled ivory with counterparts worldwide to stop wildlife trafficking.\nWhat we have been doing goes much further than the EU, which is a shame, because they have a president called ‘Tusk’ !",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_student-finance/content_391.html": "I visited my alma mater St Andrews University last week to deliver a seminar and a lecture, and have an obligatory swim in the North Sea. I hadn’t been back in over thirty years. It all looked very much the same but the changes were very significant.\nFirst, the students were much more focussed on their studies than my generation were. This is hardly surprising given the students are now paying very substantial fees which my generation did not. Little wonder then that we treated our time at university more like a luxury consumer good, where the current generation treats it more like an investment from which they need to secure a return.\nSecond, the university has doubled in size. The income from tuition fees has enabled so many more places to be made available. In my day only a very much smaller proportion of sixth formers could expect to get a place at university (and because there were many fewer of us, the absence of fees was affordable). It was clear to me many more students were evidently enjoying the opportunity of a university education consequent upon the decision to charge fees.\nThird, St Andrews is, of course, a Scottish university and the Scottish government does not believe that Scottish students should have to pay tuition fees – so here is a salutary lesson: the numbers of Scottish students studying at the University is capped at 20% of the total student body. The reason for this is simple; because Scottish students don’t pay fees, the university cannot afford to take so many of them. The ‘privilege’ afforded to Scottish students of not having to pay fees is actually denying many of them the opportunity to study at one of the best universities in their own land.\nWhenever sixth formers visit Westminster I always try and encourage them not to be daunted at the prospect of incurring a very significant debt in order to pay for a university education. They won’t have to start repaying the loan until they are earning over £21,000 per year, and even then the repayment schedule is affordable with very modest monthly repayments. The key issue, as anyone with a mortgage will know, is not how many thousands of pounds you still have outstanding, but can you make the monthly repayments, and the student loan scheme is designed to ensure that they can. As for the outstanding capital sum, if they haven’t repaid it all after 30 years it is written off anyway, which is a much more advantageous system than a graduate tax, which is the alternative, and which they would end up paying for the rest of their working lives.",

It was all over in half an hour. And that was it, until a couple of years later, we got a slightly more detail in the Biology O Level syllabus.\nIt may seem surprising, but we managed to marry and raise families.\nOf Course, in those days, we didn’t have easy access to pornography: there were no mobile phones, laptops or internet; hence no internet pornography. Even video was some years off. The best one could manage -if you had the courage – was to reach up to the top shelf for the latest edition of Health and Efficiency, and then avoid the shopkeeper’s disapproving stare as he placed it in a paper bag. Life was a great deal simpler.\nLast week I wrote to the Prime Minister together with Miriam Cates MP and other like-minded colleagues, to remind him of a pledge that he made during his leadership campaign: to end inappropriate sex education in our schools.\nWe enclosed a evidence that many children are being subjected to sex education that is wholly inappropriate. Children are being taught about extreme and dangerous sex acts, encouraged to share intimate details about sexual desires with classmates and teachers, and even primary school children are being indoctrinated with radical ideologies about sex and gender. Many of the resources used would make adults deeply uncomfortable, especially if they were expected to view them in their place of work. It is unconscionable that our children are being forced to engage with such disturbing materials in school.\nMany of the resources are produced by external agencies, some of which take extreme and political positions on these issues, including campaigning to end the rights of parents to withdraw their children from sex education. Surprisingly, a number of schools refuse to allow parents to view lesson materials in advance.\nIt is, of course, important that children are taught about tolerance and discrimination and are expected to treat others with dignity and respect. But exposing children to explicit materials and radical ideologies amounts to the abolition of childhood.\nAt Prime Minister’s Questions this week, Miriam followed up our letter with this:\n“Graphic lessons on oral sex, how to choke your partner safely, 72 genders—this is what passes for relationships and sex education in British schools. Across the country, children are being subjected to lessons that are age-inappropriate, extreme, sexualising and inaccurate, often using resources from unregulated organisations that are actively campaigning to undermine parents. This is not a victory for equality; it is a catastrophe for childhood. Will my right hon. Friend honour his commitment to end inappropriate sex education by commissioning an independent inquiry into the nature and extent of this safeguarding scandal”\nThe PM replied saying that he shared our concern and that he had tasked the Department for Education to ensure that schools are not teaching inappropriate or contested content in relationships, sex and health education. He said “our priority should always be the safety and wellbeing of children. Schools should also make curriculum content and materials available to parents. As a result of all this, we are bringing forward a review of RSHE statutory guidance and will start our consultation as soon as possible.”\nGood, but not before time!\nThat we have reached this current pass raises the question, have some of teachers entirely taken leave of their senses?",

After discovering that I would be given the name of a female politician and have to respond with one of three reactions: “snog, marry, or avoid”. I explained that it really wasn’t my cup of tea and declined the opportunity. I forgot all about it until last week, listening to John Pinar and other journalists relishing every detail of the Westminster ‘sexgate’ scandal.\nWhen Geoff Hoon was appointed Secretary of State for Defence he used a debate to announce an increase in the number of roles within the armed forces which would now be open to females. I welcomed it, but suggested he might even have gone further. I pointed out however, that there was an administrative overhead that would need to be paid, in order to maintain discipline and morale. I quoted St Bernard of Clairvaux “to be always with a woman and not to have intercourse, is more difficult than to raise the dead.”\nThis provoked a furore: I was universally condemned. There was even an early day motion denouncing me.\nI confess to having felt rather smug subsequently, when the papers were full of reports of courts martial cases concerning improper relationships.\nThe point I made about the forces, with St Bernard’s help, applies equally to Westminster: you need administrative arrangements and rules so that people know exactly where they stand and what standards are required of them.\nThe current ‘feeding frenzy’ of allegations where the most minor risqué remark is reported in the same breath as a very serious criminal offence is just absurd. It is just about as proportionate a reaction as the Junior Anti Sex League in George Orwell’s 1984.\nAs, I tweeted last week, I recall my housemaster’s advice when he reminded us of the rule that no boy be alone with a girl in his study “believe me boys, this is for your own safety”. I suspect that a number of parliamentary colleagues wish that they had had that advice, and taken it.\nSo, had I answered John Pinar’s question, whoever he might have offered me, without doubt: ‘Avoid’",

Now however, we have about a million fewer workers at work. If we accept rough estimates that some 500,000 Europeans have returned to the continent, then that leaves us struggling to explain why half a million people have become economically inactive. Is it that the experience of lock-down and furlough have left them disinclined to return to the stress of the workplace and that they place a higher value on their time away from it? Might a shorter working week tempt them back to work? The demand for a shorter working week with no loss of pay has been on the agenda of the political left for some time. Most people recognise however, that it is economic suicide unless accompanied by greater productivity in the worked hours to compensate. A shorter working week will not suit many enterprises: Most of us will have experienced the frustration of enquiring about an important piece of work, only to discover that the key person to speak to is on leave. Adding 52 further such days per year on which that might occur with a 4-day week, would not necessarily make for greater productivity. Nevertheless, there may be enterprises which could cope well with a shorter week. In 1976 I worked in a factory that operated a three-day week. Initially they had been forced to do so, as everyone had, during the Miner’s Strike of 1973-4. When the strike was over and the 5-day week was restored however, this particular company -having discovered just how much more productive they had become during the national emergency measure- carried on with just the 3 days working.A trial for a four-day week is due to run for six months later this year if 30 or so companies can be recruited to participate. Employees will get 100% of their previous pay for 80% of their previous hours in exchange for 100% of their previous productivity. Academics from Oxford & Cambridge will monitor performance – but not nearly as closely, I expect, as the boards of directors will.\nI am sceptical because my experience was of a manufacturing unit. I ‘m not convinced that the model will work for our largely service based economy, but if firms are willing to experiment, the results may be interesting.

Plastic bags are forbidden here: you may not bring any into the country.\nFor the last year or so I’ve cycled for an hour every morning that I’ve been in The Forest, from my home in Burley up through Bolderwood and the Deer Sanctuary, to the Canadian War Memorial. Yet I am still shocked afresh every day at the amount of litter that has been gratuitously thrown from cars. My particular bugbear are the blue polythene bags. It just wouldn’t happen in Rwanda.\nRwanda has an authoritarian regime which, nevertheless enjoys widespread popular support, as the outcome of the presidential election has just shown. The regime is not without its critics (to whom the BBC has given a disproportionate voice). The reality is however, that Rwanda is a haven of order and stability in a troubled region. It is a corruption free zone. You can be in the middle of Kigali at one in the morning, or out in the jungle, and either way you will be perfectly safe. Yet the country borders that basket case, the Congo, the only place on our planet where people still eat one another.\nStability and order are recipes for investment and economic growth, and Rwanda is the easiest place in which to do business in Africa.\nIt was not always so. Just 23 years ago, the Rwandan genocide consumed a million souls in just 100 days, a greater rate of productivity than even Hitler’s death camps achieved. Whole professional and managerial sections of society were wiped out. Every trapping of civilisation was lost: Rwanda was little more than a charnel house. The social and economic recovery from this national trauma has exceeded all expectations, but it comes at a cost.\nI said that the regime was authoritarian. Only so much dissent can be tolerated. The media is not free in the sense that we in the UK would understand the term. The regime is determined to maintain control, and that includes control of the media. This is entirely understandable given recent history: they know the consequences of losing control. It was, after all, the free press and radio that told people where to go and incited them to kill whoever they found there.\nAny politician who tiptoes ever so slightly towards ethnic politics will find himself joining the chain gangs in bright pink uniforms labouring at the side of the road. Yes, it appears that penal servitude remains part of the criminal code.\nSo that’s two things we could do with back at home: banning plastic bags; and hard labour for anyone who drops one.",

The difficulty for a member of a rival political party, like myself, is that you don’t necessarily want the best and most effective candidate to win. The interests of my own party and, I sincerely believe, of the nation too, are best served if they instead choose a complete dud.\nNevertheless, Kate Forbes has been treated most shamefully by the public media whose focus has been almost exclusively on her Christian beliefs which are, more often than not, at odds with current fashionable social mores. What she would actually do in the Edinburgh government, and the direction in which she would take her party, has been almost entirely crowded-out by discussion of her Christian beliefs -including that marriage is exclusively between one man and one woman.\nI remember when Tim Farron became leader of the Liberal Democrats and was treated in a similar fashion for exactly the same reason.\nWhat is rather odd, even somewhat sinister, is that politicians who adherents of other religions which, nevertheless share the same traditional approach to marriage and sexuality, are never exposed to similar criticism. The treatment of Hamza Yusef, another rival for the SNP leadership, would be an obvious case in point.\nIt is as if our liberal intelligentsia has decided that Christianity, uniquely among religions, must be hounded from the public sphere and confined to ‘safe spaces’ out of sight in churches.\nAs the Government Whip who was responsible for shepherding the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 through all its Commons stages, I have some ‘skin in the game’.\nI was clear in my own mind that the legislation properly distinguished between marriage as a legal status which the state has every right to define, and Holy Matrimony which is a religious matter instituted for quite different purposes.\nNotwithstanding that distinction, Christian MPs divided almost equally in support and opposition to the measure (as indeed they have on almost every ‘conscience’ vote in my experience since I’ve been in the Commons). The implications of biblical accounts of what Jesus actually taught are not always straightforward -especially if you’ve read the New Testament in its original Greek.\nEnoch Powell ( himself a former professor of Greek) in his discussion of John ch8: the woman taken in adultery, leaves me struggling with what Jesus could possibly have meant when he told her ‘neither do I condemn thee’ before issuing what he knew to be the impossible command ‘go and sin no more’.\nAs a Christian, I don’t share the positions taken by Kate Forbes or some of her beliefs, but she has every right to a hearing in the front line of our national politics.",

Basic ‘due diligence’ revealed that many of them were on the record with all sorts of blood-curdling statements about the destruction of Israel, and they had associations with terrorist organisations.\nIn this light it is important to see the conflict from the Israeli point of view: it is impossible to negotiate a settlement with opponents whose aim remains the obliteration of Israel. The horrific attack by Hamas from the Gaza strip which they control and govern is just the latest and worst in a long history of terrorism. The curtailment of civil rights in Israeli occupied Palestinian territories, of which I previously complained, is itself very largely a consequence of the security measures that have had to be taken to protect Israeli citizens from the terrorist threat.\nIsrael has endured, bombings and killings for so many years. This latest atrocity is the last straw. The Government of Israel must destroy the terrorist organisation that is Hamas, in order to prevent it from continuing its own quest to destroy Israel and all Israelis.\nThe action against Hamas now presents huge dangers to Israel itself, to the occupants of the Gaza strip , and to the stability of the whole region. Nevertheless, what other course is open to Israel?\nIt must protect itself from continued attacks\nEqually, no peace process can proceed whilst armed terrorists are determined that there should be no peace until Israel is wiped from the map.",

(How on earth is one supposed to know if you are unwanted, until you’ve called?)\nIf there is an epidemic, it is an epidemic of these little notices. Some are more specific, such as ‘no canvassers’ or ‘no religious callers’. The best one I spotted this year was “no purveyors of religious wisdom of any kind”. Others are downright rude.\nMy correspondence by letter has almost completely dried up, to be replaced by a vast amount of email.

I have no doubt that it is time to test parliamentary opinion once again.\nMy own opinion, however, is unchanged.\nI accept that it is very difficult to stand out against the appeal of Esther Rantzen and others with terminal illnesses who wish to end their suffering on their own terms and at a time of their choosing. It is hard to prolong their suffering, or the suffering of others that surround and give support to them.\nNevertheless, hard cases can make bad law.\nI fear that what may begin as a choice, will swiftly become an expectation. There will be an ever so subtle pressure on the elderly and infirm to end the effort and expense of carrying on living.\nOne can see the attraction from the economic point of view of the healthcare providers: it will be much more cost effective to make available a service that despatches terminally ill patients, than to continue to manage complex nursing requirements. Canadian clinicians visiting Westminster have warned us of this. And that the provision of the new life ending service there has been at the expense of palliative care.\nNo patient should live in fear that their end will be grizzly, undignified and painful. Terminal conditions, properly managed and with the right palliative care can make for a good and peaceful death.\nI debated this subject last year at the University of Durham. I was up against Baroness Meacher who was then sponsoring an assisted dying bill in the House of Lords. She was determined to keep the terms of reference as narrow as possible: there had to be a terminal prognosis of death within six months, with brace of safeguards including certainty that the patient was of sound mind.\nShe was rather undermined however, by her seconder, a psychiatrist who argued, on the contrary, that the service should be available to absolutely anyone who wanted it, indeed that one shouldn’t need to be ill at all.\nThere is a significant danger here. Those jurisdictions that have embraced assisted dying have all begun with tightly defined criteria and strong safeguards. Very swiftly however, the criteria have been extended including even, in some cases, to children.\nIn 2016 a teenager survived, physically unharmed, a bombing at Brussels Airport, which killed thirty-two others. She suffered post traumatic stress disorder and at the age of 23 in 2022 had her life ended by doctors at her request. I think we need to consider very carefully the direction of travel of assisted dying, and where that road will end.\nFor certain, the creation of a ’dying service’ would profoundly change the nature of the medical profession.\nParliamentary opinion has hitherto been very different from public opinion polling on this question, possibly because we argue in detail, rather than give an instantaneous opinion to a pollster, nevertheless I have great respect for parliamentary colleagues – and for Esther Rantzen too -who argue in favour of change, though I disagree with them profoundly.",

My expectation is that it will complete its progress in the Lords and arrive in the Commons early next year.\nI have used this column previously to describe the pitfalls facing private member’s bills in the Commons. To be successful they really need to be of very limited scope and wholly uncontroversial. The principal enemy of such legislation is time: A vote on the scale that defeated the 2015 bill is rare because opponents of any private member’s bills don’t have to trouble themselves to vote against the measures: They just need to take up time available debating it until that allotted time runs out.\nThe only hope for a controversial private member’s bill is for it to be rescued by the Government by being granted government time. Given, the pressure that the Government is under to find time for its own legislative priorities, this is unlikely.\nThe signals that are currently leaking out of the Government are that no such assistance will be made available to an assisted suicide bill in this parliamentary session.\nSo, that looks like the end of that. The question is however, why would the Government pass up the opportunity of supporting such a measure, because opinion polls have for many years shown consistent popular support for legalising assisted suicide?\nPollsters ask for an instant opinion on complex issues which might rarely, if ever, have occupied the minds of members of the public who have their own busy lives to take up their time. The whole point of representative democracy is that the elected representatives are required to look in detail at the implications of any proposal, to listen to the arguments, before taking the time to decide -time that members of the public ordinarily just do not have.\nMy estimate is that in 2015 when assisted suicide was so decisively defeated, many MPs actually came to the Commons sharing the public prejudice in favour of it. After all, few of us relish voting against something that we know our electors support. When they heard the debate examining the consequences of changing the law however, they changed their minds about it\nSuicide is contagious, our own figures -without allowing the possibility of assistance- are quite worrying enough. The experience in those jurisdictions where assistance is permitted show even more alarming trends.\nMy principal concerns are first, the profound way that our perception of the medical profession will change when the doctor comes not always with the intention of curing, but of killing.\nSecond, nobody wants to feel that they are a burden to others, so the frail, sick and elderly will come under ever so subtle pressure to avoid being a burden to the rest of us; to eschew expensive care and to follow the ‘selfless’ examples of others by accepting medical assistance to end their lives.\nFor an already overburdened healthcare system just imagine the savings to be had. It is a short distance from assisted dying to euthanasia.\nRather than contemplating legalising assisted suicide we should, on the contrary, be investing in giving patients dignity in dying by providing much better palliative care, so that nobody feels the need to end their lives prematurely either for fear of an agonising death subsequently, or because they have been made to feel a burden to the rest of us.",

Supply days are given to the Opposition to decide what is debated and, by convention, the Government does not intrude with its own business which would otherwise crowd-out the time available for the subject chosen by the Opposition. For a minister to take up the time with a statement is rather ‘bad form’, and the person responsible for scheduling the business of the House is the Leader.\nNow, the Leader of the House has a dual function: as a cabinet minister she is clearly part of the Government, but equally, she is Leader of the whole House of Commons and therefore should be sensitive to the views of back-benchers on both sides of the chamber. Allowing a Government statement on an Opposition day, at the very least, shows a certain lack of sensitivity, which irritated Mr Speaker.\nIn the scale of crimes and insensitivities however, it doesn’t rank that highly, and it’s not as if it hasn’t happened before under governments of both colours.\nThe next day Mr Speaker explained -without apologising: He told us that his overheard remark ‘stupid’ referred only to his opinion about the decision to put on a Government statement on an Opposition day, and he stood by it.\nThe other word: ‘woman’ must have been lost in translation. Certainly, it didn’t refer to the Leader because everyone knows that she is both hard-working and very clever.\nWell, who cares anyway?\nHow many times have any of us MPs muttered something much worse under our breath after receiving a duff reply from the minister at the despatch box. As Ken Clarke pointed out, if we are all to be referred to the police for such indiscretions then not a single member of Parliament would be left.\nFrankly, we have more important fish to fry.\nReferring the matter to the Police is more than stupid, it’s just plain bonkers.\n*\nThe announcement of another stupid EU directive, this time requiring owners of ride-on mowers to get motor insurance for mowing their own lawns, reminded me of our wisdom in voting to leave this wretched interfering institution and, hopefully, managing it before the directive requires our compliance.\nFor my own part however, I dispensed with my ride-on a year or so ago, on the grounds that the discipline of having to push one instead, would be beneficial to my weight and consequently to my health.\nIt is depressing that we are all soon to be asked to pay higher taxes to fund the NHS when so much of its increasing costs are down to the unhealthy lifestyles of its patients, so many of whom don’t seem to realise that their joints and vital organs were never designed to carry the weight that they are placing on them.\nPerhaps, as a stealth tax on sitting, the objective of EU directive isn’t so stupid after all?",

Kemi Badenoch raised the absurdity of a judicial decision to allow the migration of a family of six from Gaza under the scheme exclusively designed for Ukrainians (this is just yet another in a long history of ridiculous immigration judgements) . The PM agreed, saying that the judgement was clearly ‘wrong’.\nThe Chief Justice has written to complain that it is the role of government “visibly to protect the independence of the judiciary” and that where it disagrees with judges, then the proper course it to appeal to a higher court.\nWell, strictly speaking she is correct, but she protests too much. The independence of the judiciary was not being questioned, politicians were merely remarking on the stupidity of their decisions not their independence.\nCleary the Lady Carr has ideas above her station if she thinks that the decisions of her judicial colleagues should be above the criticism of elected representatives, particularly when they so often offend against common sense.\nI have long believed that Parliament should bring the judiciary to heel (see my blog of 25/09/19: Yes, it is a coup and my demand that Boris make ‘bygones’ his…top priority). Alas, that important agenda remains unaddressed.\nEvery now and again, someone will write to me demanding a written constitution for the UK. I never agree. We have far too many priorities for legislative time, to be able to set aside so much of it for the enormous task of finding an elusive consensus to establish what the constitution ought to be, what the powers -and the limits on powers- should be. It would require an enormous consultative undertaking and plebiscite. Properly done, it would take years.\nInstead, we have no special category for constitutional laws, they can be amended or repealed just like any other law, so that no Parliament can be bound by its predecessor.\nBut now, I’ve come to the view (however disagreeable I find it), that we do already have a written constitution, and that it is the Human Rights Act 1998: The Act requires that every government bill introduced to Parliament must be certified by a minister as being compliant with the Human Rights Act.\nWhen courts subsequently rule that legislation is not compliant (irrespective of what ministers thought). Then Parliament meekly rushes to amend the offending statute.\nIt remains true in theory, that Parliament could simply ignore the court’s judgement, but in reality we inevitably surrender to rule by judges. Little wonder then that Lady Car has such an elevated conception of her status.\nParliament is currently, once again, meekly in the process of surrendering to the courts in the most egregious of cases. We are rushing through legislation to amend the Northern Ireland Legacy Act to enable Gerry Adams to resume his legal action seeking compensation for a conviction for escape from lawful custody during the conflict waged by the IRA in Northern Ireland, the Court having ruled that preventing the claim, as the Act set out to, is contrary to human rights.\nYou couldn’t make it up.",

She asked me if I had previously known about the video or if my permission had been sought. Well, I didn’t know, but I couldn’t object: proceedings in parliament are everyone’s property. Overall, the video was, despite a rather sinister voice-over, not on the loopier end of the Anti-Vax spectrum.\nNow, I don’t want to be offensive, but clearly, whilst most are sane enough, some of the anti-vax emails that I get are from constituents who are clearly deranged, some others are just a bit odd.\nThere is a spectrum: belief that the vaccination is an excuse to inject us with microchips to control our subsequent behaviour, is obviously at the nuttier end. Where expressions of concern about the speed at which vaccines have been tested and approved, come at the other end.\nTo be fair the ‘normal to nutty’ proportions do not differ significantly between anti-vax emailers and those who email me on any other subject, or indeed those who take the trouble to write to me.\nI am not ‘anti-vax’. As a child, my father’s occupation took me to all sorts of remote places, as a soldier I served where there were issues with biological weapons, as a minister I visited some of the world’s poorest and most conflicted places. Consequently, I have been vaccinated against almost every medical condition, perhaps with the exception of rigor mortis.\nOn the contrary, I see vaccination as the escape clause from our current enforced confinement with all its devastating economic consequences: The more people who are vaccinated the better, and the sooner the better.\nThe thrust of the interview however, was to explore whether anti-vax opinions, being injurious to our public health policy, ought to be censored on social media and any other platform.\nI am deeply nervous about extent to which we allow the ‘tech giants’, or any other agency, to censor views of which they ( and we) disapprove.\nI believe in freedom of expression, and that there is no right of ‘not to being offended’. Equally, we are under no obligation to respect opinions with which we disagree, we have every right to argue robustly against them.\nAnd that is the proper course with the anti-vax movement: not to silence them, but to defeat them by exposing the falsehood of their claims.\nCurrently most of my emails are from people wanting to be vaccinated immediately, and who believe I can pull strings to get them to the front of the queue.

It is vital that this behaviour is reported to the police.\nMore broadly, I welcome the publication of the tackling violence against women and girls strategy to ensure women and girls are safe everywhere. The strategy will increase support for victims and survivors, increase the number of perpetrators brought to justice and to reduce the prevalence of violence against women and girls in the long-term.\nA number of measures in the strategy are focused on practical action to increase physical safety in public places.

There is also a firm commitment to delivering more social and genuinely affordable homes, underpinned by the £11.5 billion Affordable Homes Programme (2021-26) which will deliver tens of thousands of new homes. The Government has proposed amending national planning guidance to make clear that local planning authorities should place greater importance on social rent.\nThe Government is investing £2 billion between 2022 and 2025 to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping, targeted to areas where it is needed most. This will work alongside the ‘Ending Rough Sleeping for Good’ strategy which puts prevention at the heart of the Government’s plans to end rough sleeping once and for all. The strategy set an ambition for no one to leave a public institution – whether that’s a prison, hospital or care – to the streets. The Government is committed to reducing the need for temporary accommodation by preventing homelessness before it occurs. Since 2018, over 640,000 households have been prevented from becoming homeless or supported into settled accommodation through the Homelessness Reduction Act.\nRightly, Government funding for accommodation for people facing homelessness reflects the fact that there is no one size fits all approach. There is, for example, a £10 million Night Shelter Transformation Fund to increase the availability of quality single-room provision within the night shelter sector.

Virtually every enterprise that I visit or speak to is under-recruited, they just can’t get the staff that they need.\nSo often in their response, like the Confederation of British Industry, they demand increased immigration to deliver the workers that they need.\nAs a small and crowded island that saw net migration rise to half a million in the year to June 2022, we cannot just go on importing the next generation of workers. An imported workforce comes with additional housing needs and demands on public services. We have to moderate our addiction to foreign workers, now even Labour says so.\nThere are now 630,000 more economically inactive adults of working age than before the pandemic. The Chancellor had the right priority when he announced last week that he is to fund the department of Work and Pensions to require hundreds of thousands more benefit claimants to meet a work coach to get the support they need to increase the hours that they work.\nI am an elected member of the Commons Work & Pensions Select Committee and when I’ve asked witnesses about the cause of the reduced workforce, I’m told that long-term sickness has increased because of the inability of the NHS to deliver the necessary healthcare. I’m sceptical: in the past work-related sickness was overwhelmingly musculoskeletal, but now it is stress and anxiety related. These conditions, however debilitating, are quite treatable. After all, work is good for mental health and self-esteem.\nGiven that I represent a constituency with one of the highest age profiles I was particularly interested in data that Phoenix Insights, a longevity think tank has shared with me. Their polling casts doubt on the suggestion that poor healthcare is a cause of economic inactivity. Of the 50 to 64-year-olds who have left the workforce since the pandemic, only 16% gave long-term sickness or disability as their reason for doing so. The main reason they gave was that they didn’t want to work any longer. In fact, 70% of those who left work in their early fifties said that they did not want to go back to work.\nInterestingly, we appear to have a more negative attitude to work that in the USA or Germany: 58% of workers in the UK liked their job, compared to 74% in the USA and 73% in Germany. 40% of workers in the UK said that the coronavirus pandemic made them rethink how they view working, compared to only 28% in the US and 30% in Germany\nI have misgivings about increasing benefits when real wages are falling.

The notion that we didn’t know what it was really about is, in my opinion, nonsense. The Remain campaign painted the bleakest of prospects for the UK if people voted to leave.\nOn only one thing were both sides in agreement: the importance of the vote and its finality in settling the question for at least a generation.\nYet, I am a democrat, and voters do have a right to change their minds. I have never favoured that particular species of democracy evident in many less developed parts of the world: ‘one person, one vote, once’ …and rarely, if ever again.\nI can’t say, however, I have detected any enthusiasm for re-running the referendum beyond a handful of my constituents. On the contrary, there is a frustration, expressed even by many who voted to remain in the EU, to simply get on with the process of leaving, end the uncertainty, and make a fresh start. I rather suspect that were we to oblige our former prime ministers, the result would be even more emphatically in favour of leaving the EU.\nSo, I am certainly not afraid of the result of a second referendum, but I do believe it would be deeply damaging to hold out the prospect of having one. The former prime ministers are incredulous that none of their dire warnings of the approaching apocalypse came true after the June referendum, nevertheless they continue to repeat them. Tony Blair says that people will demand a second referendum when they feel the pain caused by the result of the first one. (He is wrong on two counts: I don’t believe in the pain, rather I believe we will prosper; and second, even were there to be the prospect of pain, I think voters have already made up their minds and steeled themselves against it).\nThe problem is that a second referendum is designed to deliver the very pain that its supporters believe is necessary to deliver a reversal of the previous outcome.\nCurrently there are increasingly important voices in Europe pointing to the need to negotiate mutually advantageous exit terms with us. A second referendum will silence them and present the hawks – who really want to force us to remain in the union – with an opportunity to negotiate the worst possible terms for our departure, in the misplaced confidence that UK voters will reject them in the final ballot. The consequence will be that the UK will vote to leave anyway, but will do so on terms that will be damaging to Europe, and much less advantageous to us. It would be a spectacular own goal.",

It has also come to include the independence of many other institutions including, of course, the press and broadcast media. These refinements guarantee our rights and liberties. Democracies can be quite as prone to tyranny as any other form of government. It is worth remembering that Hitler first achieved power after winning an election.\nThese proper restraints on democratic power are nevertheless, a source of constant frustration. A number of citizens not only fail to understand their importance, they appear not to be aware of their existence. Much of my correspondence is taken up with demands that this or that be done, where there is no lever that government can pull address the complaint.

Last week I listened to an interview on the wireless with Lord Howard a former Home Secretary and a former leader of the Conservative Party (whom I served as parliamentary private secretary during that period of leadership) and for whom I have enormous respect. He insisted that the Government was relying on the ‘best’ scientific advice.\nHow does he know, and can we be sure?\nCertainly, there is no shortage of scientific advice, often contradictory advice. How are we to judge whether we have been led by the ‘best’ advice or by deeply flawed advice?\nI am nervous about the extent to which the Government appears to have relied on advice from Professor Neil Fergusson’s modelling of the pandemic. Although he has now resigned from the Government’s scientific advisory group following the exposure of his lover’s breaking of the lockdown rules, it was apparent nevertheless that he had very significant influence at a key moment.\nHis computer modelling predicted that some half a million deaths would result from the our earlier voluntary approach to social distancing and reliance on building up a herd immunity in the population. That devastating prediction prompted a rethink from which the current policy of lockdown was the result.\nThere are plenty of scientific voices that reject Ferguson’s methodology and his assumptions. At the time of his prediction his computer model had not been released for peer review. The code has now been made available to the scientific community and is subject to some pretty critical commentary.\nI am not qualified to comment on the validity of the criticism of the computer code that he has released.\nWhat we non-scientists can appreciate however, is that Professor Fergusson ‘has form’: He predicted that 136,000 of us would die of mad cow disease; that 200 million worldwide would die from avian flu. The reality however, was deaths of a few hundred in each case.\nIn the current pandemic his model has been used to predict the deaths that would have resulted from the Sweden’s comparatively relaxed social distancing policy up until the beginning of this month. The result was predicted deaths 15 times greater than the actual number of deaths.\nThe pandemic’s damage to our livelihoods could not have been avoided, not least because we are a trading nation and the effect on international markets has been severe, nevertheless the policy of lockdown has imposed severe additional damage to our economy and costs that we will have to bear for many years. It was done for the best possible motive -to save lives.\nRecession and unemployment also take a heavy toll of life too",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_author_dswayne_page_3/content_93.html": "I spent the best part of 5 years in the last Parliament serving on the Work & Pensions Select Committee. The experience reinforced my prejudice that the principal problem that we face is a culture of welfare dependency.\nOur out-of-work benefits are not particularly generous by European standards and those who are dependent upon them are not, by any stretch, enjoying a ‘cushy’ lifestyle. Nevertheless, recipients grow accustomed to the life and learn to ‘get by’, particularly so, when they are relieved of the inconvenience of going out to work for a living.\nThe trends are particularly worrying amongst the young\nMore women are now out of the workforce due to sickness than those who don’t work because they are raising children. Whilst the number of young men off work due to sickness has trebled in the last decade and three quarters of them indicate that they have no interest in finding a job.\nThe economically inactive population of working age now stands at a record 10 million.\nThe bill for sickness benefits is currently running at £65 billion annually, and is predicted to rise to £100 billion by 2030.\nThis has to be set against a background of several years with vacancies at record, or near-record, levels and enormous pressure from employers on government to ease immigration control in order to enable them to recruit from overseas.\nSome 40% of those claiming sickness benefits state that mental health issues are their reason for doing so. Yet nothing could be better for mental health than the stimulation of work, with a consequent improvement in self-esteem.\nMinisters have undertaken to bring forward reforms to the welfare system this year with the intention of encouraging recipients back into the workforce. We will have to wait and see what they propose. I did however, try and steer the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in the direction of the work of Jeremy Bentham and his utilitarian principle of ‘the greater good for the greatest number’. I do not believe that society can, or should, carry a growing cost of an increasing proportion of its members who are not working.\nThe most effective way to achieve this would be a return to Bentham’s policy of ‘less eligibility’: that life on benefits must be less eligible than the meanest form of independent existence, so as to discourage anyone from choosing to live on benefits.\nHow could we implement such a policy without cruelty and a return to the Victorian workhouse?\nI think we need to ensure that, as far a possible, welfare rights have to be balanced with responsibilities. We need a system of ‘workfare’ where benefits are paid in return for socially useful work. This would be good for the self-esteem of many claimants with mental health problems and encourage them to take a further step towards paid employment.\nHolding The Line\nThe future of the Western Solent has been under discussion for the last few years. The question has been the extent to try and ‘hold the line’ through engineering works in the face of rising sea levels and climate change, or whether we try and manage the retreat as the coastline realigns.\nThere is a consultation underway: the detailed proposals can be found at https://www.hurstspit2lymington.co.uk/ and representations must be submitted by email HurstSpit2Lymington@environment-agency.gov.uk by 11th January\nI find the proposals for ‘managed retreat’ pretty alarming. They include discontinuing the maintenance of the Hurst Spit shingle bank and abandoning the existing sea wall between Keyhaven and Lymington Yacht Haven.\nWalking along the popular sea wall footpath from Lymington to Keyhaven will no longer be possible.\nOnce Hurst spit has been breached through discontinued maintenance, all of the salt marshes inside of Keyhaven river, all along the existing sea wall to Harpers post will ultimately be lost. This managed realignment will accelerate the loss of the intertidal habitat outside the sea wall and make the Lymington outer harbour area much more exposed.\nI understand that the Lymington River will almost certainly silt up, it will be subjected to huge wave action and become no longer navigable.\nHurst Castle will be cut off permanently from the shore and Lymington Harbour as a whole will be at risk. All of the features in that area will be given up to allow the tidal waters to penetrate inland and create new intertidal habitats for the birds further inland.\nThe cost of raising the existing sea wall to “Hold the Line” is in the order of £100 million, whilst the “Managed Retreat” option is closer to £280 million. The more expensive option of managed retreat is now the preferred option of the environment Agency because it unlocks central government funding for the proposed creation of the new intertidal bird habitat. However, I do not believe that enough weight has been given to local marine-related employment, or sufficient recognition given to the needs of businesses in the town of Lymington which depend of a thriving harbour, or the local amenity of sailing, motor boating, sea fishing, or simply walking your dog along the sea wall between Lymington and Keyhaven.\nThe annual budget for maintaining the shingle bank at Hurst of £40,000 is per annum, but there has been no maintenance this year. Given the new policy of “do nothing”, it remains to be seen if there will be any future maintenance of Hurst Spit between Milford and Hurst Castle, or whether this has already been abandoned to “Managed Retreat”. Given the relatively moderate cost of maintaining this structure in a normal year, this should not be allowed to lapse.\nThese proposals will change forever the shape of the coastline with profound impact on amenity and businesses. We need to consider very carefully before we give them up.\nSitting Hours\nReports in the press suggest that representations have been made to the new Modernisation Committee, principally by newly elected MPs, for shorter and more family-friendly hours in the Commons. There is nothing new under the sun…(and change if usually for the worse).\nWhen I was first elected in 1997 the Commons sat from half past two o’clock in the afternoon until half past ten o’clock (and not infrequently until much later) from Monday to Thursday, and from half past nine o’ clock in the morning until half past two o’clock in the afternoon on a Friday.\nThat didn’t mean we took the mornings off Monday through Thursday. On the contrary, the morning was precious for meetings with councillors, constituents, and experts. They were vital for briefings, telephone calls and correspondence.\nTony Blair’s newly elected government set up its own modernisation committee and the hours were changed. Monday was left unaltered – to allow for MPs from far flung parts to get to Westminster.\nTuesday and Wednesday sittings were changed to start at half past eleven o’clock and finish at half past seven o’clock. Thursday to begin at nine thirty o’clock and finish at five o’clock.\nWe were told that this would allow us evenings with families, or enjoying the theatre, or whatever. We were sold a pup.\nMost MPs have their families in constituencies well beyond the reach of a finish at seven thirty in the evening. They would arrive home after their children had gone to bed, and they would be up the next morning to get to Westminster, before their children were awake.\nFurthermore, a seven thirty finish is not quite what says on the tin: it simply means that the main business must conclude by seven, with an adjournment debate for half an hour thereafter. The main business will more often divide the House. So there will usually be at least one vote and sometimes several more before the adjournment debate. The notion that you might get to the theatre in time is utterly fanciful.\nThat is before you consider that, as happens so often, you get a message from the whips informing you that “the business may go beyond the moment of interruption”, in other words, its going to be a late one.\nSo, we gave up our mornings in which so much could be squeezed, for the illusion of a family friendly leisure time at the end of the day. When, in reality, what had been done in the morning, now had to fill the evenings, but so much less efficiently, because the councillors, officials, experts or whomsoever that you wanted to interact with, are by then at home in front of the telly.\nWe found these changes so shocking that within eighteen months we had voted to restore the status quo ante on Tuesday, and we very nearly got a majority to get back our Wednesdays too.\nThen a new Parliament, with more newer, younger and more gullible members, voted to recapture Tuesday for modernisation.\nI fear it all going to start again, and the result will be even worse.\nThere is something a ‘bit off’ about getting into a new job and immediately agitating to reduce the working hours.\nNon-Crime Hate\nWe are fortunate in Hampshire that our police force is led by a “copper’s copper” who would not have been out of place in Dock Green. Other parts of the country are not so well favoured, like Essex for example.\nThe very concept of Police investigating and recording ‘non-crime hate incidents’ infuriates me. We have enough crime to fully occupy every policeman that can be had. That they should find time to harass citizens for expressing opinions that fall short of any criminal intent under common or statute law, is outrageous.\nWe pride ourselves on being a tolerant nation that enjoys freedom of expression. Which, in turn, means none of us have any right not to be offended. It is ridiculous for police forces find the time to pursue those who have given offence, but who have not committed a crime in doing so. Equally, it is deeply worrying that our current Government is encouraging them to do so.\nWe are all subject to the law, subjects, the police and ministers. There is a clear danger however, that we are increasingly being subject to arbitrary government.\nA last blast on assisted dying\nThat is the only question that need concern us. The rest of the bill is irrelevant. It contains a number ‘safeguards’: a prognosis of death within six months; confirmation by two doctors; Oversight by a judge. The purpose of these safeguards is solely to assuage the reservations of MPs with tender consciences and so to get the bill over the line. The safeguards cannot possibly endure. They will be swiftly swept aside by subsequent changes to the law.\nIf you concede that doctors should be allowed to help their patients kill themselves in order to end their suffering, then how can you possibly sustain a distinction between those who are within six months of death and those who are not yet quite there. If it is suffering that we are seeking to end, then how can we demand that someone endure it until they are within six months of death. There is no logic to it at all.\nThe bill is about changing the nature of medicine so that it can deliberately kill as well as cure.\nMy duty is also to represent the vast majority of my constituents who have yet to express any opinion at all. I can only do that, of course, by listening, but -having done so- by making up my own mind.\nMore assistance will be demanded\nWe’ve now had sight of the Assisted Dying Bill that we will debate on 29th November. The lobbying has been under way for some time. Already I’ve had literally hundreds of letters and emails.\nNow the meetings have started too, with invitations to discussions led by any number of eminent people. On Tuesday I went to one addressed by Liz Carr, the actress who is one of the stars in the BBC drama Silent Witness. She’s made a documentary entitled Better off Dead. It is well worth watching, whatever angle you come at the subject from. You’ll find it on BBC i-Player.\nThe principal strength of the Bill is that it avoids, to some extent at least, the profound impact on the medical profession that authorising practitioners to kill their patients would have. The key point here is that patients will have to do the deed themselves, having first secured a terminal prognosis of death within six months, confirmed by two doctors and signed off by a judge. Only then can the prescription be had, which -I reiterate- must be administered by the patient.\nThe difficulty with this is that it is also the Bill’s weakest point too. Most of the reservations of those who oppose the bill are that it is the start of a slippery slope. That once the principle of assisted death is breached, then the permitted circumstances will be swiftly extended, as they have in so many other jurisdictions. This was certainly my own reservation when I blogged previously Medically Assisted Death .\nThe problem is that the Bill’s method fails to address the aspirations of those who have been campaigning hardest for the service. Patients with progressive wasting conditions want to continue life as long as its quality is bearable. When it becomes unbearable, they want to die. The terrible dilemma they face is that, whilst they do not want to die early and before they are really ready, their condition may, at any time, rob them of the ability to take the potion themselves, making them them reliant on what remains the unlawful agency of someone else. They will have to die by their own hand early or run the risk of being unable to do the deed at all, so either facing exactly the sort of death that they feared or having to secure unlawful assistance.\nThis Bill will not help them. So, the self-administration requirement will be the focus of the first campaign to extend the Bill’s provisions and allow the doctor to administer the drugs.\nNext, campaigners will question the cruelty of the requirement for a six-month terminal prognosis. If you are suffering unbearably and expected to live for a year, why should you have to endure another six months of agony before you qualify. Indeed, if you are in agony, or extreme misery, and are desperate for the relief of death, why should you need a terminal prognosis at all?\nIf the Netherlands can be so humane as to accommodate the death wishes of those who experience a much wider are extremity of circumstances, why shouldn’t we?\nThe cast iron guarantees of the Bill -death in six months; two doctors, a judge, and self-administration, are merely an aiming target for further reform. It is indeed a slippery slope.\nContempt of the liberal elites is unabated\nOn Thursday, at the Oxford Union, I debated the motion ‘this House would re-join the EU’.\nWhat, so soon?\nWe gave our membership over 40 years before we decided to leave. We’ve not even been out of it 4 years yet. Those 4 years that have been dominated the economic impacts of war in Europe and a pandemic. We should give ourselves rather more ‘ordinary times’ in which to judge.\nThe premise in the motion ‘re-join’ implied that we would be going back to the way we were. We wouldn’t. The EU has changed dramatically; it’s engine, the Franco / German alliance, has collapsed; Schengen is in disarray; and the block is struggling to address the rise of the far-right.\nNeither could we expect the same membership terms – Mr’s Thatcher’s rebate, and John Major’s opt-outs -including a treaty obligation to join the Euro.\nThe favoured statistic of the joiners is that, in years to come, our economy will be 4 to 6 % smaller than if we hadn’t left. The genesis of that statistic however, is the same Treasury forecast which predicted an immediate recession in 2016 following the referendum, with unemployment rising by 10,000 per month. In fact it fell by almost that much and we ended the year as the best performing developed economy.\nForecasting is always bedevilled by incomplete data and questionable assumptions. Typical of its sort, we’ve just had a new analysis from a prestigious business school. It begins by saying that we have seen only modest gains from our accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But that membership hasn’t even started yet -that’s not till 15th December. The report goes on to note a catastrophic decline in aspects of export performance. The problem is that the boffins failed to spot that the export reporting codes have changed and they’ve simply missed the data.\nThat we have significant economic problems is not in dispute. Nevertheless, we are doing comparatively well: in the last quarter for which statistics are to be had, our GDP growth was twice that of the EU, (though EU growth is not a high bar).\nOur future prosperity depends not being in or out of the EU, but rather on how hard we work, our risk appetite, the business-friendly nature of our tax and regulatory regime. In an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be agile and flexible.\nThat agility is bound to be enhanced by our ability to make decisions quickly in our own best interest rather than reliance on mechanisms that require a qualified majority negotiated between 27 member states.\nIn the EU Council of Ministers, we so often didn’t push our objections to a vote because we could see we hadn’t a chance. On the 72 occasions when we did force a vote – we lost every time.\nWe were increasingly governed by people we didn’t elect and couldn’t remove.\nIn this respect Brexit has already delivered: we are no longer required to implement damaging arrangements to which we were opposed.\nThe proposer blamed the Conservative Party for taking us out of the EU. When I pointed out that it was the people who made that choice, my opponent, Rachel Johnson, responded that it was the fault of the Conservatives for granting the people a referendum: proof that the contempt for democracy by the liberal elite, is unabated.\nSlavery Reparations\nI have no difficulty with the Government compensating those who have been damaged by the British state in recent years. The Horizon scandal and the Tainted Blood scandal being two obvious examples.\nI just don’t hold the same view when both victims and perpetrators have been dead for over a century.\nRecently I was at a lecture by a clergyman who told us that we all needed to apologise and atone for slavery. I disagreed vociferously on the ground that I had nothing for which to apologise, as I haven’t ever enslaved anyone.\nNow some Commonwealth nations are demanding mind-boggling sums from Britain as reparations for the slave trade. They badgered the Prime Minister into abandoning his original stance ‘this is not on the agenda’, to one of ‘opening a discussion’. Such discussions open the door to a slippery slope: The original flat refusal to engage was the correct response and he should have stuck to it .\nMany Britons were engaged in the ghastly slave trade and profited mightily from it from about 1650 to well into the 19th Century. Africans and Arabs profited from it too.\nMonstrous though slavery is, it had been a universal institution for millennia. Even the Maroons -the escaped slaves in Jamaica- kept their own slaves. Freed slaves in North Carolina owned slaves until the American Civil War in 1861.\nBritain abolished the Slave trade in 1807 and slavery throughout the Empire in 1833. We used our naval power to impose our own abolition of the trade on the rest of the World: 13% of the Royal Navy’s manpower was assigned to the West Africa Anti-Slavery Command. Historians have called that endeavour “the most expensive example of moral action”\nWhilst contemporary UK subjects can’t claim the credit for the action of our forbears in stamping out the trade. Neither should we be asked to pay compensation for being involved in it in the first place.\nSome of the Caribbean nations that suffered under the enslaved plantation system have prospered whilst others much less so. It is not the history of slavery that has blighted those that have not prospered, so much as other circumstances, not least weak and corrupt government.\nWe must not pay up\nBritish Time\nAround this time of year I get half a dozen emails demanding an end of the practice of turning the clocks back one hour to Greenwich Mean Time and promising all sorts of economic benefits from doing so.\nSome of my correspondents have simply forgotten, a few others weren’t even born when we last tried exactly that experiment. We kept British Summer Time all year round, but we renamed it British Standard Time. I was twelve when the experiment started in 1968. It was dreadful living in Scotland going to school in the dark. I doubt that any economic benefits were delivered because by 1971 the nation had had enough: Parliament voted by 366 to 81 to end the misery and restore the status quo ante. I’m always amazed that some people want to try it out again.\nYou cannot chase two gazelles\nAs we approach the budget, full of apprehension, with both business and consumer confidence plummeting, the former having taken a further hit with this week’s second reading of the Employment Rights Bill -adding five billion pounds to business costs, I’ve been considering how Labour’s first few months have gone so spectacularly wrong.\nI put it down to lack of focus on what ought to have been their main effort.\nAs officer Cadets, our training at Sandhurst drummed into us the that first principles (of war) were the selection and maintenance of the aim: you have to choose your overriding priority and then stick to it.\nThe Massai put it rather more elegantly: Huwezi kuwafukuza swala wawili which, paraphrasing from the Swahili, means ‘you just can’t chase two gazelles’.\nLabour’s stated overriding objective was economic growth, summed up by the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, as ‘invest, invest, invest’. Yet the main effort of the first weeks after the election was clearly something quite different: The new administration was determined to frame a narrative in the public mind that it had been bequeathed a disastrous legacy by the wicked Tories who had pursued a ‘scorched earth policy’ leaving behind a wasteland, everything broken and a massive financial black hole; And that, as a consequence, things would have to get worse before they could get better, and the Government was going to have to do some very painful stuff by withdrawing Winter Fuel Allowance from some nine million pensioners, with much worse to follow in the Budget on October 30th.\nThis political strategy has a long lineage: You get into Government and announce that you never realised things were really this bad. The Coalition Government did exactly that in 2010 when it inherited from Labour a financial deficit of fully 10% of the national income, which dwarfs the mere 4% (and already in steep decline) that the new Labour Government inherited this July.\nNevertheless, Labour’s pursuit of this same strategy was clearly at odds with their stated priority of securing growth through investment, which requires confidence and optimism, not the misery spouting from government commentary. Little wonder that business confidence, which had been soaring, plummeted.\nThe Government’s stated priority would have been much better served by rehearsing the positives that it had inherited Viz. the fastest growth and the second lowest debt in the G7, inflation firmly under control and interest rates falling, record low unemployment. All of which is now at risk as a consequence of the bucket of cold water that the Government has poured over them.\nAdd into this mix ‘wardrobe-gate’ and the mayhem in 10 Downing Street with the defenestration of the PM’s Chief of Staff, Sue Gray, and it makes nonsense the corporate stooges who wrote to The Times last week praising political stability.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4\n- 5\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",

A minority have complained however, that the action was disproportionally harsh given that many in the Government were rebels previously and were never so sanctioned. Indeed, I’ve rebelled on occasion with not so much as a harsh word from my whip.\nPolitical parties are, under our electoral system, ‘broad churches’ that share a general approach to political and social issues but nevertheless there are bound to be disagreements about some policies or the details of their implementation. No-one should be punished for such disagreement.\nWhen I was a whip my only expectation was that those colleagues for whom I was responsible, would inform me with reasonable notice that they had difficulty with a forthcoming vote. I would organise a meeting with the responsible minister to see if their reservations could be addressed.\nIf they still objected and voted against, well that was all there was to it.\nIt is a different story however, if the vote in question is actually an issue of fundamental confidence in the Government itself. In which case potential rebels are warned -in terms- that the consequence of rebellion will be the removal of the whip. This was the case with respect to the vote on Tuesday night: they were warned.\n(Those former serial rebels, now in the Government, never breached party unity on an issue of confidence.)\nSo why did the Government treat the vote as an issue of confidence?\nThe vote on Tuesday night was not just an issue of policy. It was a vote to take away the Government’s power to govern and hand that power to an alliance of opposition parties.\nThey then subsequently used the power so given to them, to enact a law forbidding the Prime Minister from pursuing his clearly stated policy of leaving the EU on 31 October irrespective of whether a deal had been agreed or not.\nThis pledge by the PM was the basis on which he so recently won the leadership backed by two thirds of his party and his MPs.\nIt is hard to see how the rebels could have remained in the governing party after doing this and given the warning they had received.\nThe result the action on Tuesday and Wednesday is an act of surrender to any terms the EU may impose: The PM is instructed and bound by Parliament, so that if no new agreement is reached, to ask the EU for a further extension of our membership and accept whatever terms they attach to it.\nIt takes away whatever negotiating cards we have. Why would the EU even consider new proposals when they have been guaranteed such an outcome, with every prospect of our continuing payments, and a the possibility of our leaving being put-off indefinitely?",

My logic being that any confidence whatsoever constitutes a rejection of the ‘no’ in the motion. To be honest, I stole the line from Sir Anthony Selden at an earlier debate in which we were on opposite sides at a King’s College London.\nI voted for the Boris in the confidence motion last night, but everyone is entitled to their doubts: I was one of his most vociferous critics on Covid-19 restrictions. Though I have to acknowledge that they had wide public support and that he rightly lifted the restrictions early and in the teeth of opposition from other political parties. Equally, as I have made it clear in this column previously, I have not been at all comfortable with the size and scope of his Government’s policies “wrapping its arms around the whole country” and I have been excoriating about some profoundly un-Conservative legislation. Yet, I had to temper that with the prospect of the prolonged and unpredictable process that would have been unleashed had I chosen to take the opportunity to ditch a Prime Minister with whom I had ideological differences. That self-indulgence would have occurred at time when the national situation demanded the full concentration of Government and, in any event, I might have ended up with a PM that I was even less comfortable with ideologically.\nMany voters went into the polling stations in two minds in the 2016 EU referendum, they could have as easily voted either way. So also, many colleagues went into the 1922 Committee last night still weighing up the case on either side, a consideration of how much confidence they had. They made their decisions and the result was far more decisive than ones on which most decisions are made, and certainly more so than the EU referendum result.\nOn the ‘partygate’ issue, on which so much of my correspondence has dwelt, I had no doubt whatever as to the right course. I sometimes wonder if my correspondents have read a quite different Sue Gray Report to the one that I had. That report details a number of disgraceful goings-on but from which The PM is exonerated. I believe that the PM attended what were legitimate work events which, after he left, became parties of which he was unaware. As I have indicated in this column previously, there is a common misunderstanding that No10 is a house when, in reality, it is a door into a large estate of offices.\nThe fact that the police have not imposed fixed penalties on the PM for those events re-enforces Sue Gray’s conclusions. The one fixed penalty which was imposed, was the occasion where the PM and colleagues, seated and working in the Cabinet Room, were interrupted by the PM’s wife bearing a birthday cake. Frankly, I don’t believe it was a breach and the penalty ought to have been challenged in court.\nThe Standards Committee is still to deliberate on whether the Commons was knowingly misled about ‘parties and rule breaking’. As I have previously indicated, what happened was disgraceful, the spirit of the rules and guidance were certainly not being observed, but I have no doubt that the PM was unaware of that at the time he made his statement in the Commons and he was proportionate and honest in his assessment that he had attended ‘work events’.\nA large number of my correspondents have written to inform me about their own anguish at not being able to visit dying loved ones or give them a fitting funeral. I have the greatest sympathy for them. The rules were inhumane and, I believe, disproportionate. That was the real mistake.\nThe Public perception which has given rise such anger has been driven by an unfair and hysterical media narrative.\nThe PM was elected for a full term. We are only half-way through. The first half took the shocks of the pandemic and the economic consequences of war in Ukraine. The outcome of the next election will depend substantially on the progress that his government makes in the time that is left.",

We still have the best part of the 100 hours or so of scrutiny to go.\nIt is important to remember what the purpose of the bill is, because that purpose occupied little of the debating time.\nIts purpose is to provide predictability, continuity and certainty to businesses, Government and individuals by ensuring that our domestic law is the same the day after we leave the EU as it as it will be on the day before we leave.\nWhat has happened however, is that the bill has been hijacked by MPs who want to use it as a vehicle to wrest control of the negotiations with the EU from the Government, and to have Parliament dictate the terms of any agreement itself.\nOn the face of it this is a not unreasonable thing to demand in a democracy. After all, Parliament is the elected, representative and sovereign body, and the Government is accountable to it.\nThe problem with this is twofold. First, the one thing Parliament is least fitted for is negotiating a treaty. Binding the hands of the Government in public debate in terms of the sort of agreement that it demands will leave the Government’s position completely exposed and at a huge disadvantage in negotiations with the Commission: If you play high stakes poker you need to conceal your hand, as the EU is doing.\nSecond, the demand to legislate on the terms and process, and indeed the outcome of the negotiations –which is the thrust of the amendments- is a demand to put off Brexit indefinitely until Parliament gets what it wants, even if that isn’t available. This became explicit during the debate: They will use the provisions with which they seek to amend the bill, in order to prevent Brexit if they do not like the agreement that the Government reaches. They want a veto and they were clear that this means delaying Brexit indefinitely. It is for exactly this reason that they do not want a leaving date in the legislation.\n(This strategy is an invitation to the EU to offer less eligible terms, given that the 27 are still canvassing for us to change our minds about the whole thing.)\nAs far as possible they try and maintain the fiction that they have accepted the will of the people expressed in the referendum result and that their only purpose is to improve the terms on which we will depart. But the mask slips: sometimes quite explicitly in what is said; sometimes in extravagant applause for an unreconstructed ‘remain’ speech.\nTheir real strategy is to delay the whole process long enough for the public to lose interest or, as they desperately hope, until it changes its mind.\nSo it comes down to this: do they have the numbers to wreck the Bill?\nThe answer:\nIt’s still too soon to tell.",

I have found this powerful drama resonating in my mind all week with the media coverage since the Panama leaks.\nIt has been a gruesome and unedifying spectacle. I am glad that the Prime Minister has said that he ought to have handled it a lot better, but there is nevertheless something deeply distasteful about the interest in private matters, the assumption of guilt by association, and the attribution of the basest of motives to any action. I was appalled to see Mrs Cameron’s gift to her son described in The Times as a ‘tax dodge’. No it isn’t, it’s a gift. If his mother survives for 7 years after making it, then it is still a gift, even though it will not attract any tax. That is our law, if we don’t like it, then we can change it, but we shouldn’t criticize people for acting lawfully.\nI really dislike the precedent that has now been set. Is there to be no privacy?

I definitely heard shouts of ‘property is theft’ though I may have imagined the cries of ‘la guillotine’!\nWhen the Greeks invented democracy they never intended that it should apply to everyone.

Last year, the law changed for one year to increase State Pensions by 2.5 per cent, when average earnings had fallen and price inflation increased by half a percentage point. If this action had not been taken, State Pensions would have been frozen.\nThis year, the anomaly remains. As millions of people have left furlough and the labour market has changed significantly, reported average wage growth is due to be over 8 per cent. It would not be right to increase pensions by this figure – it is not what the triple lock was ever intended to deal with, would cost £4-5 billion, and would have to be funded by increasing taxes on working people.\nOn 7th September it was announced that there will be a move to a Double Lock for one year only. This means the state pension will rise next year by the higher of inflation or 2.5 per cent, now confirmed as a 3.1 per cent increase.\nThis approach will ensure pensioners’ spending power is preserved and that they are protected from higher costs of living. It will also ensure that as we are having to make difficult decisions elsewhere across public spending – including freezing public sector pay – pensioners are not unfairly benefitting from a statistical anomaly.\nColleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions have assured me that this measure is temporary for one year, and the Triple Lock will apply as usual from next year for the remainder of this Parliament, in line with the manifesto commitment.\nThe triple lock guarantee was put in place in 2011, which has led to the state pension increasing by an average of 3 per cent annually since. In total, the basic state pension has increased by 35 per cent or £2,050 since 2011. It is now worth £137.60 per week – relative to earnings, the highest it has been in 34 years. The full rate of the new state pension is £179.60 per week, up from £155.65 when it was introduced in 2016.\nThese measures have meant there are 200,000 fewer pensioners in absolute poverty, compared to a decade ago.

What if the right of protestors to demonstrate prevents others from going about their lawful business?\nWe’ve all seen how groups like Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil have made life a misery for people trying to get to work or preventing from dealing with important family commitments.

But I am not so bound. The chief duty that I owe to my constituents is my judgement. I must not be a prisoner to any lobby, even were it to shout loudest.\nMy duty is also to represent the vast majority of my constituents who have yet to express any opinion at all.

On the contrary, the matter is as complicated as you can get, with international treaty obligations…and the rest.\nThe Government is wrestling with the complexities and is determined to get on top of them. The opposition parties however, believe that the solution is to make more ‘safe and legal’ routes available so that migrants are spared the danger and expense of paying gangsters to bring them by dingy.\nI think this is naivete of the first order: the ‘safe allocations’ would quickly be exhausted and everyone else would simply resort to dinghies once again.\nAt least a part of the problem is of our own making. We are a ‘soft touch’ and we allow ourselves to be taken for fools. For example, the Albanians -who make up about one third of this year’s arrivals in small boats, yet there is no war or oppression in Albania. Equally, if you claim, as an Albanian, that you have been trafficked as a modern slave, surely it is reasonable that, once having been rescued, you be returned to your home.\nGiven the choice, I’d rather live in the UK than Albania, but as a country that has an acute housing shortage and which saw net migration of half a million in the last year for which figures are available, we cannot be in the business of making such choices freely available.\nSo, how is it that we accept the claims of well over half of our Albanian asylum applicants?\nWhy does France accept only 2.3 % of their Albanian claims?\nWhy do Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and eleven other European countries not accept any of such Albanian claimants?\nClearly, there is something wrong with our law, our processes, or our judgement. Actually, it is probably all three.",

After all, the virus will spread much more successfully if its host remains active rather than being laid low in bed.\nThe problem is that social distancing and lockdown may skew that process of natural selection in favour of variants that are more infectious: -infectious enough to get round aspects social distancing; and potent enough to gain hospital admission because that’s where some of best opportunities for greater spreading are to be had.\nThis artificial advantage for more infectious and potent variants afforded by our lockdown in response to Covid-19, applies not just to covid-19 itself, but to every virus that is out there.\nThis may have implications for future flu and other epidemics.\nIt’s another good reason to get back to normal life -urgently.\nA Recipe for Perpetual Lockdown\nRegular readers of this column will recall that my main effort has been to focus attention on the number of hospital admissions as the key to release from lockdown: once there is no danger of the NHS being overwhelmed then, I submit, the lockdown restrictions on our lives -that are so costly- should be lifted.\nAlas, the goal posts have been moving from hospital admissions to the number of infections, or the number of deaths. The danger arising from this ‘mission creep’ is that we will find it ever harder to escape from lockdown at all, with evermore devastating economic and social consequences.\nLast September I raised the issue of ‘false positives’ in the Commons with the Secretary of State. I was not satisfied with his answer (see my blog https://www.desmondswaynemp.com/ds-blog/false-positives/ ). Now however, given the shift in policy towards a target of reduced infections, typically being touted at below 1000 new cases daily as the condition for lifting lockdown, the issue of false positives will loom ever larger.\nI have seen estimates for false positives ranging between 1% and 6% over the last year. The Secretary of State told us it was 1%. Inevitably, it will vary dependent upon the type of test and the different laboratories processing results.\nLet’s be really conservative however, and take the published false positives figure for the lateral flow test at a mere 0.32%.\nNow, imagine that Covid-19 died out overnight -it completely disappeared off the face of the earth.\nNevertheless, with 500,000 or so tests carried out the next day we would still detect 1,600 new cases from the false positives and consequently refuse to lift the lockdown.\nIt gets worse because the ambition is to increase the level of testing tenfold in project ‘Moonshot’ , so the false positives will take us ever further from the desired level of infections.\nThe same principle will apply to any target based on the level of deaths from Covid-19, because all hospital cases are tested on admission and weekly thereafter.\nThe only sensible discussion of ‘acceptable’ death rates from Covid-19 would have to be based on a ‘tolerable’ excess over the current winter deaths from all respiratory conditions which, pre Covid-19, was typically 300 per day. Any question of tolerable death levels, is sensitive one, which is why it is essential to stick with a daily level of hospital admissions with which the NHS can deal effectively.\nSo don’t move the goal posts.\n(I am indebted to Professor Anthony Brookes of The Department of Genetics & Genome Biology at University of Leicester)\nDisputing Deaths\nI Have been taken to task for ‘spreading misinformation’ because in this column on the 5th of September 2020 I stated that UK deaths in the preceding 12 months had been by no means exceptional.\nA critic however, has provided figures clearly showing a 15% increase in deaths in 2020 over the average of the preceding three years.\nFirst, the criticism is based on figures for the whole of 2020, where my column was written at the beginning of September before the surge in infections and deaths consequent upon the advent of the new variant. Only two weeks after publication of the column, the Secretary of State told me from the despatch box, on the record, that average deaths were consistent with the long-term average. I consider my column to be a fair analysis at the time it was written.\nFurthermore, when I wrote the column I was considering a much broader sweep of recent history than my critic.\nFrom early in the pandemic I have complained about how we are manipulated by the ways in which statistics are presented, especially without context.\nMost recently I have been appalled by the way that last year’s figures for deaths have been presented with attendant hyperbole.\nOn the morning of their release the BBC R4 Today Programme trumpeted that they were the worst since WW2. The statistician in attendance said that this was a quite illegitimate comparison given the number of profound changes since then, not least the vast increase in population. Nevertheless, the BBC persisted with the characterisation.\nLikewise, The Guardian ran with a headline on the 12 January 2021 that “2020 was deadliest year in a century in England and Wales.” Such a sensationalist headline looking at deaths recorded in a calendar year did not account for the size or composition of the population.\nA useful measure for understanding deaths is the Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMRs). ASMRs take into consideration both the population size and age-structure allowing comparisons over time. The ONS notes that the provisional ASMR in 2020 for England and Wales was 1043.5 deaths per 100,000 population which was around 8% higher than the five-year average. Since 2001 the ASMR has decreased annually but an increase was seen in 2019 and 2020. It is granted that the ASMR was higher in 2020 than recent years but it was surpassed in 2008 (1,084.2), 2007 (1,085.1), 2006 (1,099.1), 2005 (1,137.6), 2004 (1,155.4), 2003 (1,224.8), 2002 (1,225.5) and 2001 (1,229.8).\nAnother way of assessing the number of deaths in the UK is the Crude Death Rate (deaths per 1,000 population). Based on ONS’s monthly deaths spreadsheet and population projections for 2020 a provisional crude death rate for England and Wales can be calculated at 10.1 deaths per 1,000 population, compared with 8.9 in 2019. The ONS’ Annual data: Deaths (numbers and rates: total, infant, neonatal) shows that the crude death rate in England and Wales was higher than 2020 when records began in 1953 (11.4 deaths per 1000 population) until 2003 (10.2 deaths per 1,000 population) in every single year.\nThere is little doubt that the UK had a greater number of deaths in 2020 than in the preceding decade. However, it is far from exceptional. Under the Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR) measure the rate of mortality was higher in every year prior to 2008. Likewise, under the crude mortality rate every year preceding 2003 saw a higher mortality rate than 2020.\nIn any event, given that my principal complaint is that lockdown is a failed policy: It comes at an astronomic economic and social cost. So, the more dramatically one presents the death rate, the more its abject failure is manifest.\nScientists and politicians ought to be able to dispute the interpretation of data sensibly and without rancour or name-calling.\nHoliday in Hell\nI despair.\nApparently the polls show a large majority approve of ten-year prison sentences for anyone caught trying to evade quarantine after a visit to Portugal etc.\nThis new offence and sentence will come into effect without either a debate or vote in Parliament.\nWhat have we come to?\nImagine ending a trip confined to your hotel room for ten days, and having to pay a whopping bill, in addition.\nThe UK is not some backwater that can cut itself off from the world, on the contrary, we are one of the world’s greatest trading and travelling nations. Restrictive measures may have devastating consequences for our national income and livelihoods.\nThe danger is that it is always easier to impose a quarantine policy than to lift it.\nThe policy is a direct precautionary response to new strains of Covid-19 that have emerged in specified countries.\nWill the Government feel able to lift the quarantine once our vaccination programme is sufficiently advanced?\nOr will there be a temptation for further precaution against the possible emergence of new mutations of the virus?\nAfter all, mutate is what viruses do. What’s more they do it anywhere, not just in the designated destinations. Indeed, currently the world’s most successful mutant variant originated in Kent.\nThe fear of a new mutant variant need not be confined to Covid-19, any virus could be mutating anywhere.\nIf we are ever to return to normality and prosperity we have to encounter risks with a proper sense of proportion.\nHow I Came to Recant\nSpeeches from Hansard that I made years ago in debates about the repeal of Section 28 and reducing the age of sexual consent have surfaced, in which my antediluvian prejudices are quite shocking, even to me.\nHow could I have ever believed such things, let alone said them?\nMy transformation from extreme social conservative to libertarian deserves some explanation. How was it that I opposed those measures only to become the champion of the Equal Marriage Act, the Lord Commissioner responsible for whipping it through all its stages in the Commons.\nLong term readers of this column would have witnessed that transformation as it took place in these blogs. I call it a transformation not an evolution, because it was sudden.\nI put my original prejudice down to intellectual laziness. I simply never challenged, or even thought about the views that I held. Furthermore, when I received a very large correspondence in support of my position and against the liberalising measures that we were debating, it was so much easier to simply reply by stating that I agreed with them, rather than investing any intellectual effort in the matter.\nMy mind changed when the Government presented Parliament with the Sexual Orientation Regulations. The purpose of this measure was to prevent the providers of any commercial service from discriminating against a potential client on the basis their sexuality.\nIt prompted a huge lobbying campaign by certain elements of organised religion. I received hundreds of letters, most of them containing the same example: a Christian couple running a B&B would be required by regulation to accept as guests a gay couple, notwithstanding the offence to their deeply held religious beliefs.\nIn a flash of enlightenment the question occurred to me ‘ what Gospel is it they could possibly have been reading?’\nHow on earth could they imagine that, were Our Lord the landlord, that he would have turned the quests away?\nHaving made that leap, I then put time and effort into studying the Scriptures. The result of which study I put to use when the controversy arose when the Equal Marriage Bill was before Parliament. I published a number of defences of the Bill from a biblical perspective. One of which, entitled Too Much Leviticus, was even written-up in The Guardian in a column by Chris Bryant MP (a former Vicar) and which prompted an attempt by a national evangelical association to reclaim me for the ‘truth’. It resulted in a very unpleasant meeting, the only one in which I’ve ever had to ask my guests to leave.\nIt is easy to forget the virulence and bitterness of the Campaign against the Bill. My stance led to a significant number of resignations from my political association. I was assured that I was destroying marriage, to which I responded that the marriages to which they were objecting would be occasions of joy and celebration to the participants, their friends and relatives, but wouldn’t make a blind bit of difference to anyone else.\nEvents have proved me right: marriage has survived and, I believe, it has been strengthened.\nThere are examples of politicians having radically revised their opinions. The ‘journey’ of John Bercow comes to my mind. Many of my colleagues derided him for it, but -though I still disagree with him about almost everything- I rather respect him for it.\nMaintenance of the Aim\nFor months now, I have been attempting to keep the focus of the Government and of the readers of this column, upon what was the stated Aim of our Coronavirus policy. (I have never doubted the wisdom of that aim, although I have always questioned the government’s lockdown policy as a means of achieving it)\nWe’ve all seen and heard it so often, and can call it to mind instantly: our united purpose is to save lives by protecting the NHS.\nThe logic is simple: if the NHS is overwhelmed by too many hospital admissions then not only will it be unable to provide care to those with suffering with Covid-19 – resulting in many more of their deaths, but equally it will be unable to treat people with many other serious and life-threatening conditions, so they will die in greater numbers too.\nSo, we aim to save lives by limiting the number of hospital admissions.\nThe aim is not just to save lives themselves, but to do so by protecting the NHS.\nThis is an important distinction.\nWere the objective just to save lives, then we would only achieve it by a policy characterised as ‘zero Covid’.\nThis is the very ‘mission creep’ against which I have been warning. Right on cue this week Jeremy Hunt, Chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, has argued forcefully that the aim should, instead of being expressed in terms of hospital admissions, rather it should be a specific reduced target of daily infections.\nBy failing to maintain the original aim, we lose the proper sense of urgency about achieving it, as if we had the luxury of delay until some other desirable objectives were achieved in addition.\nOf course it would indeed be wonderful, were it possible, if we extended our objective to complete ‘zero Covid’ so nobody had to die of it again, or as far along that path as can be practically achieved.\nHowever fanciful this may sound, there is nevertheless a growing lobby in support of it. Daily it is expressed in cautionary statements about the need to maintain restrictions on our lives and not to lift them too quickly.\nThe danger is that we are losing proper and realistic appreciation of the cost in terms of the long term damage to livelihoods, education, and a terrible toll on mental health. In short, we’ve lost all sense of the cost/ benefit analysis of current lockdown measures, and the sense that we urgently need to lift them as soon as possible, before they inflict even more lasting harm.\nThat moment of ‘possibility’ was defined by a level of hospital admissions with which the NHS could cope. Substituting some other new objective appears to be defined only by the length of a piece of string, keeping us in devastating elements of lockdown almost indefinitely.\nUnhelpful Comparisons\nAs controversy has raged about my views on lockdown I have been encouraged by an enormous correspondence overwhelmingly in support of the stance that I have taken.\nThere is however, an element in that correspondence which I must contradict: When commenting on the staggering number of deaths, some of my correspondents add that overwhelmingly those who have died were elderly or suffered from other life-limiting conditions, as if this somehow made the scale of lesser importance compared to the deaths of others. We must not diminish in any way those who have died. No life is worth less than another. All their lives were shortened and they have friends and families who grieve.\n*\nOne other aspect of my correspondence includes unflattering international comparisons of UK performance in terms both of the number of deaths and the damage sustained to the economy. I suspect that the fatuous conclusions drawn are more the result of ignorance than malice, but the fact is that these comparisons do not compare like with like. There will come a time to focus on comparative performance and the lessons to be drawn, but not yet.\nOf one comparison though, I am absolutely certain: if you are unfortunate enough to be struck down with the virus, then there is no better place to be in the world than in the care of the NHS and its fantastic staff. I’ve heard from so many of them: they’re exhausted and emotionally drained, yet they just carry on regardless. It has been a magnificent effort\nVaccinations for Schools\nShould we bring forward school staff to the front of the vaccination queue?\nClearly, if our priority is re-opening schools, it follows that this priority should be reflected in the vaccination programme.\nThe counter argument is more nuanced. We believe that schools are safe; they are not vectors of infection; that school staff are no more exposed to the possibility of infection than other occupations. The Schools are closed only because of the impact on community activity generated by children coming and going, which is at variance with the requirement to ‘stay at home’ (regular readers of this column will know that I have profound difficulties with this aspect of the policy, but I simply state the case as made by the Government).\nGiven all this, it would be quite wrong to fast-track hundreds on thousands of school staff at the expense of the most vulnerable citizens.\nI’ve said it before: this is war!\nThe first principle of war is the selection and maintenance of the aim.\nThe selected aim is to save lives by preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed by hospital admissions. The key must therefore, be to vaccinate first those who -were they to catch the virus- be most likely to end up in hospital.\nOnce the most vulnerable have been vaccinated, by all means then prioritise school staff thereafter.\nMy question to the PM last Wednesday and his answer sum up the matter precisely.\nSir Desmond Swayne To lift lockdown, will my right hon. Friend focus exclusively on the progress of vaccinations of those who are most likely to be hospitalised if infected? Mission creep beyond hospitalisations would inevitably lead to the diminution of our sense of urgency to lift the restrictions – wouldn’t it?\nThe Prime Minister My right hon. Friend is completely right and he gets to the heart of the problem in the pretend policy that has been announced by the Opposition party. If we were to interfere with the JCVI 1 to 9 list, which is intended to target those most vulnerable and those most at risk of dying or of hospitalisation, we would, of course, interpolate it with other people appointed by politicians, taking vaccines away from the more vulnerable groups and, as he has rightly said, delay our ability to move forward out of lockdown. He is spot on.\nSpend to Expedite Vaccination\nThe idea of paying everyone £500 for a positive Covid-19 test appears to have got the thumbs down. I was encouraged nevertheless, because it indicated that at least some government advisers are thinking radically. In that respect it was a mild corrective to the very depressing impression that there is a loss of any sense of urgency on the part of government about the need to find ways of expediting the lifting of lockdown restrictions. It is just incredible to hear government scientists musing in public about keeping businesses closed until June: There would be no such businesses left.\nThe cost of lockdown to the Government alone is £9 billion per week, never mind the cost to the Economy as a whole; the future of young adults; and of our children’s education.\nSo profound are these costs that we should consider spending any amount of money on initiatives that could contribute to ending them. Whether paying for positive tests to encourage testing is an idea with such merit, is something on which we might reflect further.\nBut here is an idea from the Adam Smith Institute on we should spend vast amounts straight away.\nExpediting the vaccination program is the principal means by which we can reduce hospital admissions and so prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and therefore, justify ending the lockdown.\nThe restraint on our vaccination effort is limited supplies of vaccine.\nThe Pfizer vaccine costs £16 per dose, but the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine -because it was seed-funded by the Government on the basis of a not-for-profit distribution – costs a mere £2 per dose.\nWe should offer AstraZeneca a commercial rate for each dose in order to subsidise an exponential growth in its productive capacity, allowing us to proceed much faster with vaccinations and ending lockdown.\nThat greater productive capacity would also be a further contribution on our part to enable developing countries to acquire the vaccine inexpensively, leading to fewer new strains and greater freedom to travel.\nIt would be worth every penny, and seems vastly more promising that paying someone for testing positive.\nDemoralising the NHS?\nI have been criticised by a family doctor on the grounds that a question I put to the PM in Parliament was ‘demoralising for NHS staff’.\nI am at a loss as to how this could be the case.\nThe question to the PM was this:\n“Pubs cannot compete with supermarkets for off-sales. Even within a household, people cannot play tennis or golf. Notwithstanding the assault on liberty and livelihoods, why are the regulations pervaded by a pettifogging malice?”\nI used the word pettifogging to describe the interference in the minutiae of our lives, and malice because of the unfairness of allowing supermarkets -which have so done well out of lockdown- to sell alcohol for consumption off the premises but to prevent pubs from doing so.\nIn all this I merely represent the views of my constituents: I have been lobbied hard by pub landlords, golfers and tennis players. There is something rather vindictive about preventing one from playing golf alone, or with a member of your own household. It is hard to see how the restriction reduces the spread of the disease.\nI’m sure that very few NHS workers were ever aware of the exchange, and I doubt that many more have had it brought to their attention by the intervention of this local doctor.\nIn any event, I’m confident that they will ignore it and carry on with the magnificent job that they have been doing on behalf of us all.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 23\n- 24\n- 25\n- 26\n- 27\n- …\n- 59\n- Next Page »",

Once again, size really matters: Both Russia and Ukraine are struggling to recruit sufficient forces.\nWhilst, Ukraine has mobilized in a war of national survival in which reserve units -like the Azov at Mariupol, have played a critical role, we by contrast, have optimised our forces for expeditionary operations much further afield beyond the NATO area, fighting ‘wars of choice’ against adversaries over which we have significantly greater capabilities.\nWe now need to prepare for war in Europe against a ‘peer adversary’. With that in mind, what can we learn from Ukraine’s experience against that very peer adversary?\nI suggest the lessons are:\n-The importance of number of manoeuvre formations that can be put into battle\n-The quantity of infantry, thickened by anti-armour and anti-air capability, to protect long lines of communication\n-Engineers to keep those lines open\n-The manpower challenges of protecting civilian populations and infrastructure\n-The even greater manpower requirements of urban warfare and the need to rotate exhausted troops.\nWhen we were last able to deliver these sorts of capabilities we relied on Territorials to swiftly reinforce the British Army of The Rhine. The Territorial Army, with an establishment of 86,000 in formed units, providing potent blocking formations equipped with artillery, anti-tank missiles and mortars.\nWe make much less use of reserve forces that our the USA, Australia and Canada. Whilst our regular forces are among the best in the world, they are increasingly difficult to recruit and expensive to retain. If we are to pose a risk, sufficient to deter any aggressor, without impoverishing the taxpayer, then it has to be by recovering the ‘citizen’s army’ of reservists.",

These are very serious matters that I know are shared concerns for many Members on all sides of the House.\nMPs from across the House have spoken on many occasions about medical licensing and medical device licences, the processes and policies of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, our covid response and compensation for the vaccine injured, which was recently raised on the Floor of the House by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kenilworth and Southam (Sir Jeremy Wright), the former Attorney General. These are totally legitimate and correct debates to have. Parliamentary scrutiny and debate is one of the many checks and balances that we have in this country to ensure that we are taking the right course of action on these and all other matters. That is what many colleagues do.\nWhat other colleagues are not doing is promoting false propaganda, which is widely known to originate from the Kremlin, abusing and undermining colleagues and the occupant of the Chair, and using the autopsy of a 14-year-old girl as clickbait on their social media feed, all of which the hon. Member for North West Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen) has done in the past week. He might like to reflect on that.",

In response to concerns about a perceived increase in pet theft during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) launched the Pet Theft Taskforce in May 2021. The taskforce’s findings and recommendations, published in September 2021, included the creation of a specific offence.\nThe Pet Abduction Bill, introduced by my colleague Anna Firth MP, would introduce a new criminal offence in relation to the theft of a dog or a cat. The Government supported the Bill during its Second Reading.\nMore widely, Defra has been making improvements to the cat and dog microchipping regime in England in line with the taskforce’s recommendations. This includes introducing legislation last year to extend compulsory microchipping to include cats, as well as dogs. This increases the likelihood of lost or stolen pets being reunited with their owner. In addition, police forces are working together to better coordinate and share best practice and advice on the steps owners can take to protect their pets.",

How was it that I opposed those measures only to become the champion of the Equal Marriage Act, the Lord Commissioner responsible for whipping it through all its stages in the Commons.\nLong term readers of this column would have witnessed that transformation as it took place in these blogs. I call it a transformation not an evolution, because it was sudden.\nI put my original prejudice down to intellectual laziness. I simply never challenged, or even thought about the views that I held. Furthermore, when I received a very large correspondence in support of my position and against the liberalising measures that we were debating, it was so much easier to simply reply by stating that I agreed with them, rather than investing any intellectual effort in the matter.\nMy mind changed when the Government presented Parliament with the Sexual Orientation Regulations. The purpose of this measure was to prevent the providers of any commercial service from discriminating against a potential client on the basis their sexuality.\nIt prompted a huge lobbying campaign by certain elements of organised religion. I received hundreds of letters, most of them containing the same example: a Christian couple running a B&B would be required by regulation to accept as guests a gay couple, notwithstanding the offence to their deeply held religious beliefs.\nIn a flash of enlightenment the question occurred to me ‘ what Gospel is it they could possibly have been reading?’\nHow on earth could they imagine that, were Our Lord the landlord, that he would have turned the quests away?\nHaving made that leap, I then put time and effort into studying the Scriptures. The result of which study I put to use when the controversy arose when the Equal Marriage Bill was before Parliament. I published a number of defences of the Bill from a biblical perspective. One of which, entitled Too Much Leviticus, was even written-up in The Guardian in a column by Chris Bryant MP (a former Vicar) and which prompted an attempt by a national evangelical association to reclaim me for the ‘truth’. It resulted in a very unpleasant meeting, the only one in which I’ve ever had to ask my guests to leave.\nIt is easy to forget the virulence and bitterness of the Campaign against the Bill. My stance led to a significant number of resignations from my political association. I was assured that I was destroying marriage, to which I responded that the marriages to which they were objecting would be occasions of joy and celebration to the participants, their friends and relatives, but wouldn’t make a blind bit of difference to anyone else.\nEvents have proved me right: marriage has survived and, I believe, it has been strengthened.\nThere are examples of politicians having radically revised their opinions. The ‘journey’ of John Bercow comes to my mind. Many of my colleagues derided him for it, but -though I still disagree with him about almost everything- I rather respect him for it.",

Inevitably MPs will be familiar with the candidates in away that ordinary party members cannot possibly match. MPs will have seen them perform and they will know their strengths and weaknesses. In the last week I’ve had any number of enquiries from party members asking for my assessment of particular candidates, about whom they freely admit they know nothing at all. Political parties need to have confidence in their leadership if they are to function effectively in either government or opposition. The final choice of leader by a wider party membership however, raises the possibility of a leadership choice that a parliamentary party decidedly didn’t want. This is exactly what befell the Parliamentary Labour Party after Ed Miliband’s resignation in 2015. Labour MPs voted very decisively against Jeremy Corbyn but their wider party membership chose him anyway, with all the unhappy consequences for them that followed.\nAgainst this possibility of ending up with a dud chosen by the membership, the parliamentary voting rounds are skewed to engineer who ends up in second place and not just who comes first: Subterfuge is almost designed into the system.\nA parliamentary ballot can be organised in hours, but involving the party membership adds weeks. Hustings and debates have to be organised in addition to the logistics of the postal ballot itself. This delay may paralyse effective government at a time when events demand swift and focussed leadership.\nCan we get this genie be put back into the lamp? It is always harder to take something away than not to have conceded it in the first place. One of the benefits of party membership that are ‘sold’ to members is their role in influencing the choice of party leader. I can‘t see them giving it up willingly. Nevertheless, in the five Conservative leadership contests that have taken place since William Hague’s reforms, in only three of them have the membership actually had that deciding vote. This is because the second placed candidate in the parliamentary stages has chosen to withdraw before reaching the membership ballot stage. This happened in 2003 when the parliamentary party ensured that Michael Howard was unopposed. It happened again in 2016 when Andrea Leadsom withdrew from the contest against Theresa May. Last week Boris hinted that it may be the case again this time when he taunted Keir Starmer at Prime Minister’s Questions that it might be their last outing together because his successor could well be chosen by ‘acclaim’ this week, avoiding the prolonged process entirely. It doesn’t look likely, anyway it would infuriate the members. I fear that we are stuck with this system however unsatisfactory.",

It dwarfs the ban on hunting which generated the next largest. Whilst I have read them all, I am afraid I have had to resort to “your views are noted” as there simply isn’t time in the day to answer them individually.\nWhen, and if, we get to that vote these are the issues that I have to wrestle with:\nI thoroughly disapprove of the agreement because it dispenses with our strongest cards before we even begin the negotiation on our future trading relationship.\nIn any negotiation the strongest position to be in, is to be able to walk away if you don’t like the terms offered. The withdrawal agreement takes that ability away and leaves us trapped in a deeply disadvantageous limbo if agreement on the trading relationship isn’t reached.\nOur next strongest card is our money. We were constantly told that ‘nothing is agreed until everything is agreed’. Yet the withdrawal agreement would have us commit to the financial settlement before we even begin the trading negotiation.\nSo disagreeable are the terms of the limbo that results from a failure to reach a trade deal, that we will be induced to settle for pretty poor terms in order to avoid it. Already the 27 are lining up with their demands.\nThese are huge risks. In reaching my decision however, I have to balance them against what might follow a Government defeat: Parliament might vote for the ‘Norway’ option leaving us even more wedded to the EU (incidentally, Norway has a very small population and an economy which is a fraction of our own); or it might vote for a second referendum with the huge frustration and disunity that it would provoke; or it might vote to delay the leaving date, prolonging this desperate uncertainty. All of these are potentially worse that the PM’s agreement might turn out to be.\nIn a ‘one to one’ with the PM last week, I pointed out that none of these eventualities can arise without her Government bringing forward the legislation to enact them. Parliament on its own can’t do any of them. I asked if she would stand firm and that we would leave on 29 March 2019. She said yes.\nIn the current climate, and with events moving so fast, can I rely on that answer?\nWell, I’m still wrestling with that one.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_neutering-select-committees/content_307.html": "There is a parliamentary select committee for each department of state. Their purpose is to scrutinise policy and performance, as well as to consider -in expert detail- the problems and issues that each department is -or ought to be- addressing. These committees have powers to summon witnesses and evidence, and they can employ experts to advise them.\nMembership of a select committee comes with an additional workload in terms of the reading and visits required in preparation for weekly evidence sessions, followed by lengthy negotiation over the contents of the committee reports. Parliament publishes attendance statistics for each committee. (I don’t often blow my own trumpet, but hey, nobody else is going to: So, for the entirety of the last parliament my attendance at the at the Work & Pensions Select Committee was an unmatched 100%.)\nPlaces on select committees are allocated by an algorithm to ensure that they broadly represent the composition of the Commons itself. Nevertheless, unlike business in the Commons chamber, the objective of each committee is not just to secure a majority, rather it is to reach a consensus. Each committee represents the whole House of Commons and a report of a select committee is undermined if it is not the unanimous report of the whole committee.\nThe Chairmanship of each committee is critical. It is a position suited to a highly skilled and authoritative person with the benefit of an established track record. Accordingly, the Chairman only has a casting vote in the proceeding of the committee and, in recognition of their workload, receives a significant increment to their salary.\nOf course, strongly led select committees are not necessarily to the Government’s advantage: they often give ministers a pretty hard time.\nAs with membership, so with chairmanships: they are divided up between the parties on a formula mirroring the composition of the Commons. Essentially, the choice of which party gets which chairmanship however, is down to the governing party, with the exception that the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee is, by convention, always a member of the governing party, and the Public Accounts Committee is always chaired by a member of the Opposition Party.\nNow, when I was first elected in 1997, both the membership and the chairmanships of select committees were controlled by the whips offices. It certainly suited the government to ensure that the chairmen of the select committees in its gift were in the hands of someone trusted to ‘toe the line’. I recall a couple of tremendous rows when the Blair Government nominated individuals who were clearly ‘unexpected’ appointments, substituted to replace incumbents that had established a formidable reputation for independence of mind.\nWhen the Coalition Government arrived in 2010, we changed the system: both the chairmen and the members of select committees had to be elected and not merely chosen by whips. Each party had to elect their allocated number of members, but the chairman had to be elected by the whole House: To be successful a candidate would need support from well beyond their own party.\nWhere a party has such an overwhelming majority however, the new mathematics in the Commons potentially changes everything.\nWhat I have found particularly surprising is that my support is now being solicited for the chairmanships of select committees by brand new Labour members who have never even previously sat on one. They are seeking to supplant senior party colleagues that established a reputation based on their record. Well, that’s democracy: We still have free choice between the candidates and their merits.\nThe ‘word on the street’ however, is that this novelty is being encouraged the by the Government whips in the hope that potentially ‘difficult’ and independent-minded chairmen’ might be replaced by ‘trusties’.\nI can offer no evidence. But it would be a great shame if the reputation of robust select committees were to be neutered.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_arming-israel/content_360.html": "Understandably, I’ve received a large number of emails regarding arms exports to Israel following the fatal attack on the World Central Kitchen relief workers.\nSince 2015, the UK has licensed at some £500 million of military exports to Israel. These have included components for F-35 stealth bomber aircraft, components for Israeli armed and surveillance drones, and military intelligence and technology.\nThe case for these arms sales is twofold. First, Israel is a strategic ally in an unstable region where UK vital interests are at risk. This is particularly so, with respect to Iran, the region’s principal troublemaker, and exporter of terror (as we’ve seen again just last week in London with an attempted assassination on an Iranian Journalist).\nSecond, modern Israel has, since its creation in 1948, had to fight wars launched by hostile surrounding states determined to end its very existence. It has also been subject to continuous terrorist attacks and hostage taking, of which the 7th October last year was the most brutal. We would have failed in our obligation to our friend and ally had we withheld armaments with which to defend themselves.\nHamas is a terrorist organisation dedicated to the complete destruction of Israel and its replacement with an Islamic State of a particularly unpleasant kind. Hamas is also the Government of Gaza. Therefore, a proper and lawful retaliation by Israel in response to the 7th October attack by Hamas, inevitably involved a military assault on Gaza with brutal consequences for non-combatants. Hamas will have been well aware of these consequences when it planned its attack on Israel. Furthermore, Hamas’s military doctrine has always involved using its civilian population as a human shield. That is why it operates from schools and hospitals. And that is why it ordered the population not to comply with Israel’s warning to evacuate south of Wadi Gaza before the first Israeli Defence Force incursion into Gaza City. The ghastly misery of Gaza is first and foremost a calculated result of the actions by Hamas, with the intention to radicalise and recharge fighters for another generation.\nIn my estimate Israel has fallen for Hama’s strategy of radicalisation by its wholly disproportionate response and apparent disregard for non-combatants, with all the possibilities now arising from a new generation full of hatred.\nNotwithstanding some pretty suspect casualty statistics from Hamas-controlled sources, and some frightfully shoddy reporting by the BBC and others, nevertheless we can see from our own TV screens, from independent reporting, from the experience of aid workers, and from the dire reports by the United Nations, that the suffering of the civilian population is intolerable.\nFor months UK diplomacy, together with the USA, has sought to restrain Israel. We have demanded more access for humanitarian aid; we have demanded military operations which take much greater care to protect civilians and reduce collateral damage. We have deployed all the influence that we have as friendly powers. There comes a time however, when we have to do more than say that we are very concerned, or even very cross. At some stage we have to hold Israel to account for its misjudgements and the way that it is operating.\nI think that a temporary suspension of our arms sales would now be a salutary, if not overdue, way of indicating to Israel the measure of our dismay.",

It pays a taxable grant worth 80 per cent of the average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total.\nAlternatively, those who paid themselves a salary through their own company, were eligible for the ‘furlough’ Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, available to employers, including owner-managers, and individuals paying themselves a salary through a PAYE scheme.\nThe main complaint I ‘ve been getting is that those people who pay themselves a dividend from their company rather than a wage, are not covered.\nThe difficulty is that incomes from dividends aren’t wages, they are a return on investment, and are taxed differently because of that.\nEven setting aside this difference of principle, under current reporting mechanisms, it is not possible for HM Revenue and Customs to distinguish between dividends derived from an individual’s own company and dividends from other shares that they possess.\nThe Government did consider providing a new system for those who pay themselves through dividends, but this is much more complex. The information required by the other support schemes, is already held by HM Revenue and Customs.\nA dividend scheme would require owner-managers to make a claim and submit information that HM Revenue and Customs could not efficiently or consistently verify to ensure payments were made to eligible companies, for eligible activity.\nSome of my correspondents suggested that that a ‘pay now, but clawback later’ approach could have been taken, but that would have required manual and highly resource-intensive procedures to ensure compliance, and there would still be a high risk that incorrect or fraudulent payments could not be recovered.\nThe proper recourse for those who do not qualify for the schemes is to fall back on Universal Credit, which has performed incredibly well, in paying out on time for a surge of millions of new applicants.\nThe difficulty is that you cannot qualify for Universal Credit it if you have savings of more than £16,000, and this is where the perceived unfairness lies. None of the Covid-19 schemes are subject to a savings threshold, so I can quite understand the disappointment of those who’ve worked so hard, but don’t qualify, and are now having to live off their savings, whilst others are receiving help.\nShould the savings threshold have been raised, or suspended, during the pandemic?\nIt sounds easy, but it raises questions about hundreds of thousands of applicants denied Universal Credit because of their savings before Covid-19 even came along.\nDoes the very existence of a savings threshold discourage thrift by penalising the thrifty when they run in to hard times?\nBut then you wouldn’t want to see millionaires claiming Universal Credit even if they had lost their job.\nEqually, one of the reasons that we save is for “a rainy day” as my Granny used to say. And isn’t losing your income that rainy day?\nNothing is simple, and nothing will ever be 100% fair",

I campaigned until the last possible moment –‘knocking-up’ pledged voters as the close of poll approached, having risen at 3 am in order to be at the rendezvous and start leafleting by 4.30 am (taking care not to rattle letter boxes or wake the dogs). I continued to present a determined optimism to my fellow activists, reminding them that the bookies would no longer take bets on a Conservative majority, whilst secretly preparing myself for defeat. I confess to having been duped by the polls. I was mentally adjusting to defeat. I had even typed up my final tweet to be released when my result was announced, quoting Julien from Stendal’s classic Le Rouge et le Noir:\n“Au milieu de tant de perils, il me reste moi”\nIn the event I never sent it, because by the time my result came through, the unfolding national picture was already confounding the polls.\nI have three particular reflections on the election campaign. First, the brutal punishment meted out by voters to the Liberal Democrats. In my estimate they did the right thing in 2010 by setting aside their profound differences with the Conservatives, and coming into a coalition government in order to give 5 years of stable government so necessary for the recovery of our economy. It never really worked for their voters however. The party itself has always believed in coalitions as the proper and normal form of government, and they were always intent on achieving power through coalitions. Their voters however, have been disproportionately made up of protest voters, objecting to those in political power, rather than seriously seeking to get it themselves. In my experience it was always a deeply frustrating experience arguing with a Liberal Democrat voter on the doorstep: no matter how far you could demonstrate how Lib Dem policy differed so dramatically from their own point of view (often particularly on Europe), they maintained their determination to vote for them. Why? I believe it was because they never expected those policies to be implemented, because they never expected the party to win power. Their vote was essentially against governments. Consequently, when the party became part of government they were bound to lose the support of this significant segment of their former supporters.\nSecond, whilst canvassing this time I have been quite astounded by the proliferation of those notices on doors announcing that canvassers and cold callers are unwelcome. In the past voters used to complain that nobody had called, now they make it clear that they don’t want you to. I came across several notices stating ‘no unwanted callers’. Well, how would you know if you were unwanted or not until you’ve called? The demeanour of many residents when they answer the door makes it clear that absolutely nobody is welcome. Are a significant number of our people determined to seal themselves off entirely from contact with the world outside the security of their castles?\nThird, demand for electoral reform voiced by the disappointed leaders of the single issue parties is quite at variance with the clearly expressed wish of the British people. As recently as 2011 we held a national referendum with a high turnout in which we rejected such electoral reform by 70% to 30% -enough to settle the question for a generation.\nThe British electoral system makes life harder for small parties, but we knew that very well when we voted to keep it in 2011. The advantage of our system is that it encourages ‘broad church’ political parties that seek to reach out to a wide range of voters, and that it has tended to deliver decisive government that have majorities necessary to implement their legislative programmes. It was a bizarre experience to hear Nigel Farage demanding the sort of continental voting systems that deliver perpetual coalition, and the enduring political establishments of which he has claimed to so disapprove",

One of the particular features of this correspondence is that the authors want a continuing conversation with me, and any answer that I give only encourages further emails and argument. Whilst email lends itself to a conversation, I get over 100 emails daily in addition to the many other things that I need to do, which makes it difficult to conduct multiple conversations with constituents released from the disincentive of paying for a stamp and making their way to the post box.\nNow this daily flow has been augmented by scores from constituents outraged by what they consider to be a betrayal of the BREXIT vote implicit in the Government’s evolving negotiating position.\nA common feature of both sets of correspondents is their certainty that they speak for everyone else, that everyone they converse with agrees with them, and that as their representative I should do likewise.\nI think their belief that their own opinions are universally held springs from two sources. First: many people mix in company with people just like themselves, so it is not surprising if they hear opinions similar to their own. Second, we are a tolerant and polite people, when some bore keeps banging on about their hobby-horse, instead of taking issue and arguing with them, we take the line of least resistance by pretending to agree, even if only in the hope that it will shut them up.\nAs for my responsibility to represent them, my duty is to represent all my constituents, 99.99% of whom have not expressed any opinion to me whatsoever. I owe them my judgement by listening to the arguments and debate, a debate that takes place in Parliament with other elected representatives. I must not be prisoner to any vociferous email lobby.\nA common theme of the latest surge of email correspondence from those who believe that their pro-BREXIT vote is being betrayed is that this is such a gross affront to democracy that the entire edifice of government now needs to be razed. These are what I call the ‘crazies’, who adhere to a doctrine of ‘revolutionary defeatism’: they believe that because the BREXIT settlement will not be exactly to their specification, like Sampson we must bring the whole temple down on our heads -whatever the consequences, and a new democratic Britain will somehow emerge from the ruins.\nI am not going to join any political suicide squad. I voted for a ‘hard Brexit’ in the referendum, but there were plenty of other BREXIT flavours being touted. After all, for years constituents have been telling me that they were duped in the 1975 referendum because they only thought they were voting for a ‘Common Market’ not signing-up to political integration. Well, I voted ‘No’ in 1975 because I didn’t even want the market, and I want to be free of its limitations now. Can I be sure however, that many, perhaps even a majority of BREXIT voters, would be satisfied to be free of political integration and yet hang on to the market?\nMy duty must be to secure what is the best BREXIT achievable according to my judgement, but in doing so I must not put at risk the prospect of achieving any BREXIT at all: That really would be an affront to our democracy.",

Well, as I wasn’t there, it seems reasonable to await the findings of the Cabinet Secretary, rather than rely on the assumptions of screaming headlines. Where many of my correspondents are plain wrong however, is the conclusion they have jumped to in taking the view that the PM couldn’t not have known that a party was taking place in his house: Number 10 Downing Street isn’t a house, it is just a front door which gives access to a large suite of open plan offices and meeting rooms on three floors stretching all the way to the Cabinet Office and largely populated by career civil servants. The PM’s flat is in the rafters above Number 11 Downing Street. Having been in the flat a number of times under a former regime, I can attest that, once inside, it is perfectly possible not to have any idea of what is happening behind the front door of Number 10.\nGiven that everything in Government leaks, I am very suspicious that it has taken a year for the story to surface, but I’ll wait on the outcome of the investigation.\nHaving asked the Secretary of State on Monday 6th December how many positive cases with the new variant were actually ill – to which the answer appeared to be ‘none’ – I was devastated by the absurd decision to implement ‘plan B’ only three days later. Of course, some patients with the new variant will end up in hospital. I will be disappointed, but I hope that the numbers are limited. I almost get the impression however, that some crazed control freaks will welcome hospitalisations as the opportunity to impose an even more restrictive measures on our lives.\nNotwithstanding my opposition to the restrictions that have been imposed upon us, there are two bright spots. First, the requirement to isolate after contact with the new variant which was announced on Monday, has already been revoked and replaced only by the need to take tests. So, at least we are spared another ‘pingdemic’.\nSecond, constituents have complained about the absurdity of requiring them to work from home, yet allowing social gatherings and parties to proceed unhindered.

The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the publication of the Government response to this consultation and accompanying call for evidence.

Anyway, on my reading of the proposal, enjoyment of my the log fire will not diminish: Moderately sized deliveries of logs (not less than 2 cubic meters) for storage and seasoning at home before burning will be permitted, as will the sale of kiln-dried wood.\nSecond, the measure is not driven by climate change activism so much as clean air / health activism. The PM25 particles that are targeted by the ban are among the most damaging because they are the smallest and therefore, penetrate further into our lungs. The presence of these micro particles has been in very steep decline for 40 years but there has been a slight rise since 2017, perhaps reflecting the growing popularity of wood-burning stoves.\nHaving raised the issue of climate activism however, there are other privations which will no doubt be demanded of us.\nThere has been Citizen’s Assembly taking place over 4 weekends , where a random selection of our fellow citizens have been deliberating, with the help of ‘experts’ , to consider what changes in lifestyle we will be prepared to tolerate in order to reduce our carbon footprint.\nMy own view is that the only legitimate and accountable citizen’s assembly is Parliament.\nThe legitimacy of this climate assembly rests on the fact that it was commissioned by the select committees on The House of Commons -before the election.\nWell, we will see what they come up with…but no Parliament can bind its successor.\nAs we scramble to cut our emissions by all sorts of sacrifices however, aren’t we missing something rather obvious?\nLast week BP announced plans to eliminate its carbon footprint by 2050. Shell, which made a $15 billion profit last year, responded by saying that it will examine BP’s proposals to understand exactly how they are calculated and set up, but the chief executive added “once we understand them we’ll think about them but, at the moment, I don’t think we need to get into an arms race of CO2 targets”.\nOn the contrary, a CO2 reduction arms race is exactly what we need to get the oil companies into: they represent 10% of the world economy and their product is by far the greatest source of emissions worldwide. If we require them to become carbon neutral our problem will be largely solved.",

Nothing should dampen the joy of seeing her family reunited. I visited her husband Richard twice during his hunger vigils -once outside the Iranian Embassy and, more recently outside the Foreign Office. He has proved a magnificent and brave campaigner, matching his wife’s courage and endurance at Evin prison in Iran.\nThe reality we cannot escape from however, is that Iran took Nazanin as a hostage and we have paid a ransom for her return.\nThe historical £400 million debt that we owed to Iran was indeed legitimate: In the nineteen seventies the Shah of Iran ordered and paid for UK tanks for his army. They were never delivered because the Iranian Revolution brought to power a regime that we could not possibly of have justified arming. That regime, in breach of all international standards and law, took 52 US diplomats hostage. Since when, international financial sanctions, in one form or another, have prevented the settlement of the debt we owed to Iran.\nThe secret terms of the treaty we signed, we are assured, prevent the £400 million being spent on any of Iran’s current military adventures in Syria, support for the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon or any of its other sponsorship of terrorism. On the contrary, it must be spent on humanitarian objectives. This fig leaf, the exact terms of which we are prevented from knowing, is our comfort blanket, reassuring us that we really didn’t pay a ransom after all; No, we just settled an historic debt that we genuinely owed and that we’ve done the just and honourable thing.\nNotwithstanding my joy for the return of Nazanin, I cannot be alone in believing that Iran has secured what it set out to achieve when it took her hostage in the first place.\nA precedent has been set and the world is a more dangerous place as a consequence.\nAnyone who travels to jurisdictions beyond the ‘rule-of-law’ -as we understand that term in western liberal democracy, places themselves at huge risk.",

Was it just pure creativity and self-expression, or was there some other reason?\nThroughout the history of art, artists have had differing motivations, from worship, to enlightenment, the desire to inspire, to educate, to make political statements, to shock, even to disgust. Some artists will have had no motive whatsoever, just to let the work of art speak for itself.\nPicasso described his paintings as a form of diary: a way of washing the ‘dust of daily life’ from his soul, as he put it.

Their alliances with business and with the technological advances of the third industrial revolution are vital to our economic prosperity as a nation. In all this the income from tuition fees has had a transformative effect. Without that fee income I just do not believe that government would make good the lost revenue, with all the other pressing demands on the public finances.\nImportant scientific research and innovation would be less well funded, and the opportunities for students to go to university would diminish.\nScotland is an object lesson: Scottish students pay no tuition fees. As a consequence universities like St Andrews limit the number of Scottish students to a mere 20% of total, and in their own country, but you can hardly blame the universities for preferring students that pay the fees.\nWhen we were devising the current system of student finance back in 2010. We sought to gain the advantages of a graduate tax with without the disadvantages.\nOur system is progressive: wealthier graduates pay more; the income threshold at which you start to repay will shortly be raised from £21,000 to £25,000. Also, any outstanding balance is written-off after 30 years. This writing-off of significant balances was a deliberately designed feature of the system, in order to reduce the costs paid by less well-off graduates.\nThe disadvantage of a graduate tax is that many graduates that achieve high levels of income would end up paying more than the cost of their degrees, and this is avoided under our arrangements.\nI believe that I would have no difficulty persuading a student about to begin an engineering degree at –say, Imperial College London, that if it ended up costing him £50,000, he’d be getting a bargain and should have no doubt that it would result in higher levels of income, rewarding him for the investment that he had made.\nI know that I could not make the same case for all courses at all institutions: many students are not getting the same value for money, but they are all paying the same amount.\nThe disappointing part of our reform was that it was supposed to create a demand-led market in higher education, but it hasn’t. Amongst other innovations we expected shorter degree courses to be offered to students who wanted them. We expected universities to charge different fees depending both on reputation and what was actually on offer.\nUnfortunately, the imposition of a maximum fee of £9,000 per year has had the perverse effect of almost all universities charging exactly the same, and without the incentive to compete and innovate.\nThe Government, I believe, has just made exactly the same mistake with its proposal for a maximum charge for electricity. I fear that all the electricity companies will end up charging the maximum just in the way that universities have.\nIt is competition that drives prices down and innovation up, not government controls. The job of government is to promote competition by ending restrictive practices. Trying to fix prices has rarely, if ever, worked.",

Clearly, by sending your hosts to bed, to hospital, or even to their deaths, there will be fewer opportunities to spread than if you keep them up and about mixing with others.\nDespite the alarming graphs and charts, presented -as ever- without proper context, the success of the delta or Indian variant has become our dominant variant based on exactly this strategy.\nAccording to the NHS’s own data hospital cases have risen significantly since 27 May, but comparatively very few of these patients are actually occupying hospital beds. So, the rest probably pitched up at A&E -presumably because they couldn’t get an appointment with their GP – before being sent home.\nFor days however, establishment voices have been demanding an extension of restrictions to prevent even the smallest increase in hospital admissions so that the NHS can get on, uninterrupted, dealing with all the backlogs of other illnesses and conditions that have built up over the last 18 months. So it has come to this: enterprises are to be restricted, to remain closed, basic freedoms and social interactions remain banned, all as a means of managing NHS waiting lists.\nIs England just an NHS served by a nation, rather than a nation served by an NHS?\nBy this logic there is no chance of the restrictions being lifted as we approach the flu season this autumn. Indeed, a number of the Government’s Scientific advisors have been sounding-off that we will have to abide by their dystopian distancing and masking regulations forever!\nBy rolling over and implementing their latest advice, the Government has transformed the victory of the vaccination campaign in to the defeat of their road map to the lifting of the restrictions.\nBut if you thought you were ok because your wedding can now go ahead with more than 30 guests… before you celebrate, read the small print; only where the venue can accommodate higher numbers including the full distancing requirements.

Even this will be difficult because Israel is acutely aware that Hamas has a history of appropriating humanitarian aid for its own purposes. Screening the aid and ensuring that it is not stolen will be a complex operation.\nEqually, using civilians as a ‘human shield’ is central to the standard operating procedure of Hamas.\nI do not believe that either side sees a ceasefire as being in their interests.\nThe ferocity and ‘in your face’ barbarity of the Hamas attack on Israeli settlements was clearly designed to provoke an overwhelming response from Israel. Hamas has been building its network of underground tunnels and arsenal for years. It has chosen its moment to draw Israel into a very costly urban warfare for which Hamas is well prepared. It is not in the interests of Hamas to hold a ceasefire now, when it is on the brink of achieving the very objective which its attack was designed to provoke.\nIsrael, on the other hand, has been attacked by an organisation whose only purpose is to completely obliterate it and replace it with an Islamic state. There is no settlement that can be negotiated with such an adversary. One side can only prevail by annihilating the other.\nTo survive this existential threat Israel must take this opportunity to destroy Hamas, or face prolonging the bloodshed of further attacks by Hamas in the future.

Indeed, I did so for longer that the mere minute that was officially encouraged. I confess however, that my mind wandered, and I found myself thinking about my own life rather than that of Queen Elizabeth II, an act of pure self-indulgence, please forgive me. My excuse is that she is part of the constant backdrop to my entire life, having been born four years into her reign. Everything that I can remember happened whilst she was our Queen: Her broadcast was part of every Christmas Day.\nI swore my allegiance to her on ten occasions. As my mind ranged over the years, I recalled my Grandparents. They were enthusiastic Royalists. One granny had collection of coronation mugs which now adorn my office at Westminster. My grandpa, a soldier of the first world war , who saw the angels of Mons, had a photograph of the young Queen displayed in the ‘back room’ , he would always refer to her as “my Queen” and would stand to attention when the national anthem was played at the end of the evening’s broadcasts – yes! the telly -a very substantial item of furniture- stopped every night and didn’t resume till late afternoon the following day. There were only a couple of channels, and they were just black and white. Do you remember the Test Card with 359 lines?\nAfter the national anthem the image on the screen would disappear into a white dot in the centre and a high-pitched whine would continue until it was switched off.\nThey never had a fridge: they didn’t need one; the cupboard in the front room was quite cool enough. The front room was only for entertaining, I only ever recall it being used once a year for ‘Hogmanay’ which was also my grandpa’s birthday. Life during the day was lived in the ‘scullery’ (a sort of annex to the kitchen) in which a coal fire was lit first thing in the morning. After tea in the evening, life would move into the ‘back room’ where another coal fire was lit.\nIn the mornings my brother and I would scratch designs into the frost that had formed on the inside of the windowpanes. We would be sent down the street to fetch Granny’s “messages” (her shopping). This could be quite confusing because she would always refer to shops by the names that they had been known by years previously, when they had been opened by former Italian Prisoners of war that had decided to settle in the town. There were no supermarkets, you queued at each shop and asked for what you wanted at the counter. On our way to and from the shops we would rush up the footbridge if a train was passing and stand enveloped in smoke.\nEven the money was different: We were given a threepenny bit to put in the collection on Sundays. We got two shillings pocket money (called a ‘florin’, now replaced by 10P) and if you got a ten bob note (50P) on your birthday you were a wealthy boy – or even a postal order, remember them?\nThere were no mobile phones, no constant noise of social media, no tyranny of email. If you wanted to telephone someone you had to ring the exchange and ask to be put through to their number. Remember button A and button B in the telephone box?\nOf course, the downside was that if you were travelling and were planning to meet someone, you had no way of letting them know that you would be late, or even not going to make it at all, potentially ending a relationship when you had arranged to meet up with your girlfriend in Rome.\nThey lived modestly, but my grandpa always took pride in his appearance.

Our countryside is of great importance and it cannot be understated just how much the scenery means to people.\nMinisters are continuing to support and enhance access to the countryside. This includes completing the England Coast Path, supporting the network of National Trails, ensuring that rights of way are recorded and protected, as well as developing ways to support access through financial provisions in the Agriculture Act for environmental land management. The new schemes will make a significant contribution to the goals of the 25 Year Environment Plan, including beauty, heritage and engagement with the environment. I believe that public access is a key way for people to engage with the environment and so supporting greater access is an important aspect of achieving this goal.\nFurther, ministers are looking at ways in which the UK’s new agri-environment schemes could fund the creation of new paths, such as footpaths and bridleways, providing greater and safe access for cyclists, horse riders and pedestrians. I know that they are working in close collaboration with interested parties to explore the best ways of making further enhancements to our wonderful access network.\nFinally, ministers have now published the England Trees Action Plan, which sets the UK on the path to at least 12 per cent woodland cover by the middle of the century. Over £500 million of the £640 million Nature for Climate Fund is dedicated to trees and ministers aim to treble woodland creation rates and plant 30,000 hectares of trees per year by the end of this Parliament.\nDS.",

In 1997 I eventually backed William Hague for his winning final round, having first supported Michael Howard, then John Redwood before they were eliminated. And in 2006 I eventually landed on David Cameron’s side, having supported Liam Fox in the first ballot.\nIn only one contest have I been on the losing side at the final stage, when Theresa May won in 2016.\nI had spent the previous ten days trying to persuade any colleague who would listen, that she’d be a disaster. And was I right…or was I right?\nI knew that my ministerial career depended on the result: Some time before, a number of my emails to David Cameron had leaked and filled two pages of the Sunday Times, including one in which I gave my rather too frank assessment of Theresa. She summoned me to what -in the Army- we called a ‘meeting without coffee’ and I knew I’d be ‘terminated’ if she ever won, and so it proved.\nI have enjoyed the leadership contest and the commitment that all the candidates made towards core Conservative values, including significantly lower taxes. The principal dispute being not whether, but just when it would be prudent to reduce the tax burden.\nI am very glad that the focus of political debate is, once again, on the great dividing line: the size and role of the state; the question of whether the problems that we face are to be resolved by government taking ever greater responsibilities for managing our lives and charging us ever higher taxes to pay for it. Or whether we can re-ignite private initiative, enterprise and productivity to address our challenges.\nOf course, a number of constituents have complained about the measure of unpleasantness that has crept into the contest. Frankly, I tell them not to be so squeamish. This is more than a debate about principle, policy, outlook and ideology. It is also about ambition: who gets the top job. The key supporters of each candidate have skin in the game too. If their champion wins they can expect the rewards of office. Of course, this adds an element where sparks may fly as each campaign seeks to maximise -what the advertising profession calls the ‘brand differentiation’ of their respective pitches.\nHaving first supported Suella, then Kemi, I’ve now given my backing to Rishi. I find him the better performer at the despatch box and the more natural communicator generally.\nThe key policy dispute comes down to when we can reasonably start cutting taxes. On this question my heart is with Liz Truss but my judgement is with Rishi’s more cautious approach. I addressed the issue of inflation in this column on 15th May Inflation-2 (desmondswaynemp.com) . I am doubtful that any tax cut will increase productivity swiftly enough to avoid inflationary effects at a time when we are already at full employment. I know that Patrick Minford, one of Maggie’s favourite economists, takes the view that interest rates are too low and an increase to, say 7%, necessary to prevent the inflationary consequence of a tax cut, would itself result in more efficient allocation of capital. Nevertheless, I fear the consequences for so many mortgages, and of servicing our debts of such a policy choice.\nIn any event, we can wait and see if my score in backing the winner improves",

It is important to address the fact that begging can cause harm to the individuals involved as well as to wider communities and public spaces.

See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.”\nWe’ve certainly been hearing those rumours in recent weeks. The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer, appears to be one of ‘doves’ when he told us last month that Western armies and political leaders must anticipate conflict with Russia in the next 20 years. Other analysts and commentators have put the prospect of total war very much closer.\nGeneral Sir Patrick Sanders, Chief of the General Staff, has said that our forces would not be large enough to defend the country if there was a war, and it and that it is essential that we lay the foundations now for “national mobilisation”. Others have explicitly called for the return of conscription.\nI accept entirely, notwithstanding that we already have the 4th largest defence budget in the world, we do need to beef-up our defences in the face of Russia’s expansion of defence expenditure to a third of their entire national budget. We are one of the few NATO members to reach the current defence expenditure target of a mere 2% of national income. So, we have a lot of ground to catch-up.\nThe purpose of the increased the defence capability that we now need to acquire, is not so that we are able to fight the next war, but so that we can avoid having to do so.\nAs the Roman said ‘Si vis pacem, para bellum’, which loosely translates as ‘if you wish for peace, then prepare for war’. Only our readiness will deter the enemy from the risks of making war upon us. It is the possibility of defeating us that will tempt the enemy to try: Deterrence is cornerstone of our defence policy.\nDo we have time?\nI certainly don’t accept the hyperbole that the threat is imminent. Russia’s military performance against Ukraine does not indicate that they will be capable of successfully taking on NATO in the short term. Furthermore, NATO retains very impressive capabilities, far in excess of what Russia has encountered in Ukraine, which should make Putin think twice.\nAs we were surprised by Ukraine’s ability to resist, similarly in the nineteen-eighties we believed that the Soviet capability was so great, that our only chance of holding their advance was to resort to first use of battlefield nuclear weapons. Very swiftly, at the end of that decade, the myth of Soviet superiority was exposed by its complete collapse.\nThat Russia has had to empty its prisons to field troops in Ukraine, may indicate that we may, as in the eighties, be overestimating their capability.\nI shall return in this column, to the question of how we might improve our defence without breaking the bank, and certainly not by resorting to conscription.\nIn the meantime, whilst we do live in very dangerous times… “but the end is not yet”",

One the contrary, and as anyone can see on every coin, the Monarch reigns by the Grace of God (D.G) and is ‘Defender of the Faith’ (F.D).\nThe coronation oath requires the Monarch, as ‘Supreme Governor’ of the Church of England to defend the ‘Protestant Reformed Religion, by law established’.\nOnly in the Last hundred years has Parliament delegated powers to the Church of England to alter its liturgy and doctrine. Even that delegation isn’t absolute: any proposed changes to Church canon law have first to be ratified by Parliament’s Ecclesiastical Committee.\nAn MP is appointed as a Church Commissioner and answers questions every month in the Commons on behalf of the Church.\nRecently tensions have arisen between the Church and Parliament over the issue of Gay Marriage.\nParliament passed the Equal Marriage Act in 2013, but it specifically excluded the Church of England from its provisions. Were same-sex marriages to take place in the Church of England, Parliament would need first to amend the 2013 Act. Recently, some parliamentarians have threatened the Archbishop of Canterbury with exactly that prospect, given their frustration at what they consider to be the slow progress of the Church on this question. After all, it was only last week the Synod considered merely providing prayers for same-sex couples in church. These prayers will ask for God’s blessing on the individuals, not their union. The Church’s doctrine of marriage will remain unaltered, namely that it can only take place between one man and one woman.\nThe problem for the Church is that in its legislating Synod there are two irreconcilable blocks, neither of which has a majority. About 45% are traditionalist and resist change to doctrine and practice, whilst another 45% are liberal progressives that promote the very changes that the traditionalists resist.\nThe Progressives want same-sex marriage, whilst the traditionalists want no change. Blessings for same-sex couples is a compromise or ‘fudge’ that satisfies neither side.\nIt is difficult to see how this can end well. The Bishops will now go away and come back with proposals for the prayers to be used in these blessings, but they will need to be accepted by a two-thirds majority in the Synod. Currently, that majority just does not appear to exist, or anything like it.\nMy personal prejudice is that Christianity has always spent too much time worrying about sex and sexuality, and there are much more important issues to address.\nNevertheless, a way out needs to be found in order to prevent collateral damage to the international Anglican Communion and to the integrity of the relationship between the Established Church and the State.\nThe Church of England is comprised of two provinces: Canterbury and York. That division is purely one of Geography. Perhaps we could instead make the division doctrinal: traditional parishes could opt for, say, Canterbury, and liberal progressive parishes for York. Schism and disestablishment could be avoided.\nIt might just work.",

(I was surprised: members of my own regiment would never have allowed an after-dinner speech to stand between them and the bar).\nI told them that I believe that the war in Ukraine has changed everything: we have seen a whole nation mobilized in a war of national survival. Most of the fighters are not regular soldiers, reserve units -like the Azov at Mariupol, have played a critical role.\nWe, by contrast, have optimised for expeditionary operations much further afield beyond the NATO area, fighting ‘wars of choice’ against adversaries over which we have significantly greater capabilities.\nThe Chief of the General Staff in his lecture to the RUSI Land Warfare Conference stated that we must now prepare for war in Europe against a ‘peer adversary’. With that in mind, what can we learn from Ukraine’s experience against that very peer adversary?\nI suggest the lessons are:\n-The importance of number of manoeuvre formations that can be put into battle\n-The quantity of infantry, thickened by anti-armour and anti-air capability, to protect long lines of communication\n-Engineers to keep those lines open\n-The manpower challenges of protecting civilian populations and infrastructure\n-The even greater manpower requirements of urban warfare and the need to rotate exhausted troops\nAs my colleague Julian Brazier, formerly MP for Canterbury, says “mass is back; Quantity has a quality all of its own”\nThe last time that the main threat came from Russia the Territorial Army provided potent blocking units equipped with Anti-tank missiles and mortars. Yet, there are current proposals to strip them of them. Which would seem to me to send a signal that the infantry is not taken seriously except to backfill regular units.\nI do not underestimate the importance backfill or of augmentees. They are a vital resource, many ‘serial mobilizers’ have made magnificent contributions providing critical support to the regular Army, enhancing the reputation of the Reserves. Many sacrificed their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nBut over-focus on backfilling has a danger: Reserve peace-time activity must also work for people with challenging civilian careers too or we will lose the very capabilities that have made the reserves so versatile and deployable.\nMy prejudice is that we are rapidly losing our ability to mobilise our reserves as fighting units. Their establishments are to be cut by a further 10%: The Army element of the Integrated Review would reduce reserve unit size below the capability to deliver realistic training -striking at the heart of unit spirit.\nWere I not the blockage between the bar and my audience I might have gone on to explore a number of short-comings, not least recruiting – Gadzooks! We used to do our own. We’d send a troop out to shopping centres on a Saturday and bring in the Black Country’s finest. They would start training on the very next drill night. Now I get emails from frustrated constituents who have been made to wait almost a year.\nEvents this year prove that size matters once again, we cannot carry on reducing the Army. Equally, regular soldiers are very expensive at a time when there is little ready money.\nThe Chancellor, did say in the autumn statement that he would spend more on defence but first he needed to re-open the Integrated Review prepared before the Ukraine war. This is the opportunity to make the case for the reserves.",

Under plans to modernise the way we work, employees will have the right to request flexible working from day one. Delivering on a commitment set out in the Government’s 2019 manifesto, around 2.2 million more people will be given the right to request flexible working.\nThe proposals, which were open to consultation up to December 2021, considered whether the current limit of one flexible working application per year continues to represent the best balance between individual and business needs. The consultation also looked at cutting the current three-month period an employer has to consider any request.\nIf an employer cannot accommodate a request, as may be the case, they would need to think about what alternatives they could offer. For example, if they couldn’t change their employee’s hours on all working days, they could consider making the change for certain days instead.\nResearch has shown companies that embrace flexible working can attract more talent, improve staff motivation and reduce staff turnover. In addition, flexible working can boost a business’ productivity and competitiveness.\nHowever, there are some circumstances where businesses will not be able to offer flexible working and therefore there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. An employer should still be able to reject a request if they have sound business reasons. Therefore, is important that government does not prescribe specific arrangements in legislation. Instead, the new plans would provide a strengthened legislative framework that seeks to encourage conversations around flexible working to be more two-sided, balancing the needs of employee and employer. It also shifts the focus to what may be possible, rather than what is not.\nDS",

Virtually all of them clash with times at which the House of Commons is sitting.\nI attend as many as I can, particularly if they are ‘drop-in’ events where you can arrive, receive an individual briefing, and leave.\nWhat I increasingly refuse to do however, is attend ‘receptions’ for a briefing. The House of Commons now charges the commercial rates for its refreshment services in this prestigious and sort-after location. Even 5 years ago I invited a dozen or so Normandy Veterans to tea. The Commons wanted £500 for a very small dining room; £25 per head for the tea, plus £5 per head because it was a Friday. In the event, my secretaries and I made the tea and served it elsewhere in the Palace of Westminster.\nPaying a corporate entertainment rate is fine if you are a wealthy corporation. What is worrying however, is that so many charities are paying these rates to entertain MPs. The way charities go about it is to get their supporters to email their MP asking them to attend the reception. Now, I’ve done enough fund raising and rattling the collection tin to be nervous about using those funds to enable MPs to quaff wine and canapés at the expense of those who were generous enough to put their hands in their pockets and make a donation. Did they really expect their donations to be spent in this way?\nWhen I politely decline these invitations and explain that I am happy to receive a briefing, but without putting the charity to such expense, I have been surprised by the dusty response that follows. Constituents have replied saying that I don’t care enough about the issue that the charity seeks to highlight. On the contrary, I care enough to want them to spend their money more wisely.\nOften the charities are medical ones, and allied to an ‘All Party Group’ of MPs and peers. It seems to me that there is such an all party group for every disease and condition known to man, perhaps with the exception of rigor mortis.\nEssentially these groups exist to raise the profile of the disease so that greater priority is attached to it. For my part, I believe that the decisions about medical priority should be made by clinicians rather than politicians: all this lobbying is being targeted at the wrong people; Complaints about the priority attached to a particular disease, its diagnosis and its treatment ought properly to be taken up with the medical profession.",

This was particularly the case for so many self-employed constituents who were unclear as to whether they could continue working. The principal difficulty was confusion between what was regulation and what was only guidance. This even confused police officers, with people being told to stop doing things which, in fact, they were entitled to do.\nI rather think that Sue Gray’s inquiry into parties in Downing Street will focus on this distinction between regulation and guidance and, in particular, the fact that Number 10 is a place of work and not a dwelling, where the rules were quite different.\nIf this does indeed turn out to be the Monopoly “get out of jail free card”, I fear it just won’t wash because the distinction between regulation and guidance was never clear in the minds of the public in the first place.\nAs far as they are concerned it looks like one rule for us and another for everyone else.\nA significant danger for the PM, were he to be exonerated by Sue Gray’s inquiry, is that some new allegation then hits the headlines.\nI have received a huge correspondence on this whole business, representing a number of different points of view.

I can’t imagine why. Given the size of his parliamentary majority, there was no prospect of the Government being defeated and the Bill being lost.\nThe occasion was the second Reading of the Bill. The opportunities to improve a bill by amendment come at committee and report stages. To be orderly at second reading, an amendment cannot seek to improve the bill, on the contrary, it must be fatal to the bill e.g. “That this House declines to give a second reading to the xxx Bill because…”. Hence the term ‘wrecking amendment’.\nThe PM’s concern was that the Opposition were using their amendment merely as a ruse to secure a vote on a public inquiry into sexual grooming gangs just to achieve the political objective of embarrassing the Government with a vote that it didn’t want, and in which ministers would have to whip their members to vote contrary to both popular will and the advice of Andy Burnham, their most successful regional mayor.\nThe PM appeared to be horrified that the Tories would be so destructive as to vote against a perfectly good bill just because it didn’t contain provision for an inquiry, notwithstanding that it contained so many other desirable measures. When, in any event, the Tories could have supported the bill as it stood, then moved amendments at latter stages to include the inquiry.\nOf course, it was -partly- a political ruse: It was important to secure a vote on a matter which had hit the headlines in a big way, even though the Government didn’t want the embarrassment of the issue getting a further airing.\nFor my own part, I am not an enthusiast for public inquiries. They are very expensive and time- consuming. On this occasion however, I think that Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, who himself commissioned one of the earlier enquiries, was right in his assertion that there is proper scope for a limited national inquiry to pull together the threads from the local inquiries and explore the question of why the establishment failed comprehensively. Such an inquiry would not impede proceeding swiftly the recommendations made on the basis of the earlier findings.\nThe PM’s concern about the Opposition’s naked political expediency by voting against a sensible measure just to embarrass the Government is however, quite misplaced. We would have voted against this frightful Bill in any event.\nThough the Bill does include some measures to improve child protection, nevertheless it undermines the long-standing combination of school freedom and accountability that has been the foundation of the dramatic improvement in England’s educational standards. These were first introduced by Tony Blair with the enthusiastic support of the Conservative Opposition. These successful policies were then extended under the following Tory years. This Bill now seeks to abolish academy freedoms which have been at the heart of that success. It ends freedom over teacher pay and conditions, making it harder to attract and retain good teachers. It ends freedom on Qualified Teacher Status, making teacher recruitment harder. It removes school freedoms over the curriculum, leading to less innovation. It repeals the requirements for failing schools to become academies and for all new schools to be academies and it will undermine school improvement and remove the competition which has led to rising standards. The Bill will make it harder for good schools to expand, reducing parental choice and access to a good education.\nIt is just dreadful.",

Recently their chosen subject for this remorseless treatment has been the closure of bank branches in rural areas. It is an emotive subject and I’ve made my own representations earlier this year against the closure of the last branch in Fordingbridge.\nThe problem isn’t a new one. I recall that when I was working in banking over 20 years ago, we had spotted that our branches were increasingly a cost to us without the benefit of generating much revenue. A cunning plan was hatched to make the branches more productive by having them sell insurance and other financial products to our customers. Well look how that turned out: The banks haven’t yet fully put the payment protection insurance scandal behind them, at a cost of £ billions.\nThe fact is that I haven’t been in a branch of my bank for years, I just don’t need to. It is unrealistic to expect banks to maintain a branch network which is increasingly under-used. Those settlements in this constituency with whom I joined in protest at the closure of their bank, have defied predictions and continued to thrive. The reason is this: there is not much you can do in a bank that you can’t do in a post office, and there is a lot more that you can do besides.\nIt is the post office that is at the heart of communities across the UK, with millions of customers and small businesses relying on their local branch every day to access a wide range of important services. Last week the Government announced up to £370 million of new investment in the Post Office to ensure that the network continues to develop.\nFigures published this month reveal that branch numbers are the most stable they have been for decades. There are more branches than last year, with the network growing in size for the last two years to over 11,600 post offices across the country. The number of rural branches has also risen to 6,185. Today, 93% of us live within one mile of a post office.\n£2 billion of investment in the Post Office since 2010 has led to over seven and a half thousand branches being transformed and modernised, bringing almost a million extra opening hours per month for customers, with 4,400 branches open on a Sunday. Over the next 3 years new technology will be implemented to support products and develop new ones.\nFor the first time in 16 years the Post Office has made a profit.

None of us can predict what it will be like to remain in a changing EU, any more than we can predict what it will be like as an independent nation in a changing world.

At a time when we still have a substantial deficit in the public finances and are rightly imposing wage restraint on public sector workers, we cannot afford, either economically or politically, for our politicians to be paid more, whatever international comparisons there might be.\nMinisters should not only share in the restraint being exercised by everyone else, they should be leading the way, and we have tried to do exactly that: We cut the pay for ministers by 5% after the 2010 election and then froze it for the 5 years of that parliament; last week I signed a disclaimer forgoing any rise in my ministerial salary during the lifetime of this parliament too.\nSome constituents have written to me demanding that if the increase for MPs goes ahead, then I should reject it or give it to charity.

These regulate the food and drink provided at both lunchtime and at other times of the school day. The standards set out that meat or poultry must be provided on three or more days each week, and milk must be available for drinking every day.\nCurrent standards provide a robust yet flexible framework to ensure that pupils receive high quality and nutritious food that builds healthy eating habits for life. The Government continues to promote compliance with the School Food Standards and will keep this under review.\nIn February 2022, the Levelling Up White Paper outlined the Government’s plan to strengthen adherence. This includes piloting work with the Foods Standards Agency, funding of up to £200,000 in a pilot Governor Training Scheme and encouraging schools to complete a statement on their websites setting out their whole school approach to food.\nAlthough the School Food Standards regulate the food and drink provided at both lunchtime and at other times of the school day, the Government believes that head teachers, school governors and caterers are best placed to make decisions about their school food policies, taking into account local circumstances and the needs of their pupils.

I was once the Accommodation Whip, so I know from bitter experience.\nThere is insufficient office space on the parliamentary estate, and what there is, varies from the truly grand to the absolutely frightful, pokey, cramped and windowless. Some are close by, but others are a hike.\nFurthermore, there is a financial incentive to cram as many staff into the estate as possible because there is no rent payable, whereas if you accommodate your staff in your constituency you will have to rent an office for them to work in.\nThe Accommodation Whip is constantly badgered by colleagues who believe that they deserve a better office than the one they’ve got. The simple fact is that you have no stock of empty rooms, and quite a few members are having to share rooms with one another.\nThe worst time for the Accommodation Whip is the aftermath of a large government reshuffle such as the one that Boris has just implemented.\nWhen you become a minister you give up your Commons office, because you are the ‘cat that got the cream’ and you are going to get a grand office elsewhere in Whitehall in your new department of state. So, in the Commons you are allocated little more than a booth on the ministerial corridor (and some are a lot better than others).\nThe difficulty presented by a reshuffle is the mismatch in circumstances between those being promoted and those being sacked. The latter tend to be more senior, their pride has already taken a substantial knock, and they want to be comforted by getting a decent Commons office appropriate to their seniority. Alas, those being promoted into their places tend to be junior and consequently are vacating the least desirable accommodation in the Commons.

First, it is always best to concentrate relief where it is most needed and this is better done by raising the threshold to protect those on the lowest incomes. Second, the complaint betrays an ignorance of the student loan interest rate system (I don’t blame them for that, because it’s complicated, and it is complicated in order to be fair to students, very few of whom will be paying 6%.)\nThe Government introduced a new tiered rate of interest for students taking out loans from September 2012.\nThose with incomes above the income threshold and paying-off loans taken out before 2012 (known as plan 1) will, for the current year (1 September 2017 – 31 August 2018), pay a rate equal to the retail price index (3.1%) -but subject to a low interest cap- which means that they will actually only pay 1.25%\nFor those who took out loans after the new system was introduced in 2012 (plan 2), interest accrues at a variable rate over the life of the loan dependent upon their level of income: while studying the interest rate added is RPI + 3%, when a student graduates however, and is earning under the income threshold the interest rate falls to RPI and when a student is earning over the threshold the interest rate starts at RPI and rises gradually back up to RPI + 3% only when a graduate is earning over £41,000 per year.\nThe intention of the scheme is to make repayments more progressive so that graduates earning more would repay more. The amount of interest charged therefore depends on the circumstances of the student, which is much fairer.\nWhat we should not return to, is a system where opportunities are fewer, and where 18-year -olds who don’t go to university end up paying higher taxes to pay for the courses of the lucky few who do get a place at university.\nThat said, students do need to be much more forceful in demanding value for their money. An undergraduate complained to me recently that an effective lecturer and tutor on her course had been replaced by a dreadful one, I enquired as to what the students on the course had done about it collectively or individually, the answer was ‘nothing’.

Of course, the Runcorn by-election and the Local Elections on Thursday have created a greater urgency and accelerated this email correspondence over the last 48 hours.\nThe difficulty is that no such arrangement is on offer. On current performance, Reform is convinced that it can beat Labour without any pact with the Tories.\nEqually, for the Tories, nothing ever turns out to be as bad as first reported. It will take time to see if the Conservative Party can recover its reputation for competence and with that, its electoral support. Tories will want to watch as Reform has to survive the much greater level of media scrutiny that will now accompany its electoral success. The life of this Parliament will be a marathon and not a sprint: it is far too soon to make predictions as to how things will progress and what will be he impact of, as yet unknown events.\nNevertheless, when the next general election is much closer, if the polling and the way that political landscape has developed suggests that minority support for a further term of Labour government is likely to prevail, then both Reform and the Conservatives may review the question of an electoral pact as the lesser of two evils.\nA number of difficulties will arise for any such endeavour.\nThere can be no doubt that Nigel Farage has been one of the most influential politicians of my lifetime. He was once an enthusiastic Conservative, a devotee of Sir Keith Joseph and Margaret Thatcher. Yet he became convinced that the Conservatives would never be persuaded to leave the EU and for that reason would need to be destroyed and replaced. Inevitably, this history makes for a relatively difficult reconciliation.\nNext, as Reform has advanced at the expense of Conservative support, it has increasingly turned its attention to the battle to win support from former Labour voters. As it has done so, its rhetoric and policy is becoming more remote from the free market economics that are core beliefs of ‘Thatcherite’ Conservatives, and which were once Farage’s original inspiration.\nThird, Reform is determined to implement proportional representation which is anathema to Tories, who believe that it will perpetuate continental style coalition government.\nFinally, Farage is someone that many Conservatives detest. He has been an apologist for both Putin and also for some of the most egregious behaviour of Donald Trump.\nDetestation, however, is still negotiable and ultimately, expediency will prevail.\nA view will be taken on the basis of an electoral calculation of the consequences of not negotiating a pact. Until that time, both Conservatives and Reform, will be each hoping that their fortunes and the turn of events will enable them to avoid having to consider it.\nIt is just far too soon to be led by an over-excited press, to be speculating about it.",

It is an issue my ministerial colleagues are looking at closely as part of the continued drive to maintain the highest animal welfare standards in the world. However, I am not aware of any current plans to ban the use of the snare trap.\nWhen practised to a high standard, and in accordance with the law, snaring can offer an effective means to reduce the harmful impacts of foxes on livestock, game and wildlife. I know that snares are commonly used in the UK to catch certain animals prior to their killing and current legislation provides strong protection for threatened species and the welfare of trapped animals. Those committing an offence can face prosecution, an unlimited fine or even a custodial sentence.\nSnares are controlled in England and Wales under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This prohibits the use of self-locking snares and the setting of any type of snare in places where they are likely to catch certain non-target animals such as badgers. It also requires snares to be inspected on a daily basis. I also know that snares must not be set where there is evidence of regular use by non-target species\nThe Animal Welfare Act 2006 prohibits causing unnecessary suffering to animals under the control of man, including those animals caught in traps. Trapped animals should be released from a snare trap as soon as reasonably practicable after discovery to ensure they do not unnecessarily suffer. Not doing so could be a breach of the 2006 Act and could lead to prosecution.\nThe onus is on trap operators to act within the law and consider their responsibilities in ensuring that their activities do not harm protected species or cause any unnecessary suffering. Of course, if you believe an individual is inflicting unnecessary suffering on animals, the matter should be reported to the police.\nDS.",

They regarded the last one as so divisive and unpleasant that they have no enthusiasm to repeat the process, particularly given that they were assured that the last one was to be a once in a generation experience.\nI expect we’d feel the same if were told we had re-run the EU referendum.\nWhat generated substantial correspondence from my constituents the last time that Scotland had an independence referendum, was the question of the franchise: There are a surprisingly large number of people living in the New Forest, who regard themselves as Scottish and believe that they should have a right to vote on the future status of what they see as their own country.\nThe difficulty is that we are all British subjects and there is no legal means of distinguishing between us as citizens of our kingdom’s constituent parts. The right to vote in Scotland, like voting in any other part of Great Britain, is dependent only upon having a residential address there (assuming you are old enough, a UK subject or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland for general elections, or of any other EU country for local elections).\nIf the residents of Scotland are to have a second independence referendum, and were they, this time, to vote to leave the UK, one of the principal difficulties would be in defining our separate nationalities. How would we go about it?\nWould it be decided simply on where you are living on the determining date?\nHow else could we proceed, given the extent to which we are inter-married?\nHow would people claiming a heritage in one part of the Kingdom, but living in another, have their nationality resolved?\nAn independent Scotland might well set about this task quite differently from the remainder of the UK, leaving some people potentially stateless.\nAt the very least it would be a very distressing and dismal process.\nThe Union of England and Scotland over 400 years ago was sought by the Scottish Parliament for financial reasons, after a currency crisis. Since then however, we have effectively become one country and one people to such an extent that unwinding the union will make our leaving the EU a piece of cake by comparison.

I am glad to see that there is a significant overlap in the words and phrases that I banned and that Rees-Mogg has now banned, including the frightful ‘ongoing’, but -for the life of me- I cannot see what he has against ‘very’.\nMy own bete noir was our widely-shared habit of turning nouns into verbs. Although I am often guilty myself, I detest it in others.\nThe word ‘showcasing’ would drive me into an apoplectic fit and my staff quickly learnt to avoid it.\nI must have been a dreadful pedant as a schoolmaster. It was some time ago. Indeed, 39 years ago I taught at Charterhouse where Jeremy Hunt, lately Foreign Secretary, was a mere junior boy and too young to attend any of my classes. Now he joins me on the back benches.\nA number of colleagues and constituents wished me well as the reshuffle commenced. Of course, one wouldn’t be a politician without the desire to rule one day. As Arthur Miller said “a salesman’s got to dream boy, it comes with the territory”.\nThe luxury however, of not anticipating any crumbs to fall from the table, was that when parliamentary business ended early last Tuesday and Wednesday and whilst anxious colleagues were continually fretting and checking their phones, I relaxed in Hyde Park reading Andrew Robert’s excellent biography of Churchill, confident that I could catch-up with events listening to Ritala Shah on the wireless at ten o’clock.\nI thoroughly enjoyed being a minister and there are aspects of it I miss. I recall however, that Digby Jones, the businessman and former head of the CBI, was made a minister by Gordon Brown. When Jones resigned 18 month later he was reported as saying it was a most “dehumanising experience” .\nI know what he meant.\nAs a minister you are confined to your own brief which can be very frustrating when great events -the focus of the nations attention- are taking place beyond it and you may not give your own commentary. Equally, you can sometimes become aware that matters at the heart of your brief -on which you have become the nation’s expert- have been decided above your head and you weren’t even asked your opinion. It happens\nAfter 5 years as David Cameron’s parliamentary secretary in the frustration of opposition, we finally got into Downing Street in 2010.

This has broadly been the status of our legal framework: we are permitted to do anything that isn’t against the law. There are many jurisdictions where the reverse is the case: you may only do what the law specifically permits you to do.\nMany of my constituents have an appetite for much greater regulation of our lives. They write to me proposing new laws to address any number of real or imagined problems. They have ‘happy thoughts’ about “how much better organised life would be in only we had a law to make us do…” whatever the bee in their bonnet may be.\nPutting their happy thought in an email to me does no harm. Alas, parliamentary colleagues have the opportunity, afforded the annual private members’ bill ballot, to put their happy thoughts into law.\nThere are 13 sitting Fridays per year on which the Commons deals with the private members’ bills that were successful in the ballot. It is a minority taste: Most MPs clear off to their constituencies where they have more pressing demands on their time like visiting schools, councils, enterprises, police, NHS and many more.\nWhen, constituents write to me to ask me to be in Westminster on a Friday to support a particular bill, I reply telling them that, even were I in favour of the bill, the best thing I can do to support it is to stay away. The greatest enemy of any private members’ bill is the limited time available to it. Opponents need not trouble to muster numbers to vote against it. All they need do is speak at length about it. If you did support it, then it would be foolish to come along and help the opponents by taking up some of that time yourself.\nSuch is the potential damage and cost of the proposals in so many private members’ bills, sensible and public-spirited MPs will organise small teams of colleagues dedicated to ‘talking-out’ the offending bills. It is essential too that the Government Whips have some oversight of this process. It is also vital that the whip on duty at close of business shouts “object” at the right moment to prevent any undebated bill going through ‘on the nod’.\nGiven all this, the message gets through to most colleagues that, if they want their bill to proceed, then it must be of narrow scope and almost wholly uncontroversial.\nAlas, every now and again the system malfunctions. Perhaps the dedicated team didn’t show on a particular Friday, or the whips were asleep at the wheel, or even -extraordinarily- the minister at the despatch box indicated support for the intentions of the bill. Whatever it was, the result can be a disastrous piece of legislation. Here is one such: we now have the prospect of employees being entitled to sue their employer for damages if a customer upsets them.\nWe all know how difficult it is to keep a small business going, why would we throw another burden on them by making them responsible for the speech and opinions of their customers?\nHow daft is that?",

However, no data was provided for 72.2% of the total 367 deaths in 2023, meaning the form was left blank by the healthcare provider present.\nReasons for Applying: Since 2017, on average 52.1% of applicants have applied because they felt like a burden. Interestingly, ‘Inadequate pain control’ ranks far lower as a reason for wanting an assisted death.\nLength of Death: Oregon has sadly set a new record for the longest assisted death. In 2023 it now stands at 137 hours – 5 days and 17 hours after ingestion.\nMental Competency: A tiny 0.8% of applicants were referred for psychiatric evaluation. This means only 3 people the whole year were queried for having sound mind to make the decision to end their life.\nI don’t think any of this is an advertisement for what is euphemistically now referred to as ‘dignity in dying’.

Many commoners subsidise their commoning activities from other sources of income.\nA critical part of the equation to sustain commoning for a new generation is the provision of properties with affordable rents. A local home together with a back-up bit of land is an essential ingredient for managing ponies and cattle on the Forest.\nThe problem is that there is an ever grater premium on Forest properties, and you just can’t manage your livestock commuting from an address miles and miles away.\nThe problem isn’t new. It was spotted some time ago.\nThere are 65 Crown properties which were built to meet the needs of the Forestry Commission’s staff, most of whom were themselves commoners. In 1992 the recommendation of the Illingworth report was accepted by the Government, namely that these properties should be let to commoners at a rent equal to 15% of their income.\nThis policy was re-stated to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State in 2006 who said:\n“Two criteria underpin the retention of properties in the Forest. The First is to provide opportunities for affordable housing with associated back-up land for practising commoners and the second is to provide affordable accommodation for commission employees in key posts when there are operational reasons for staff to be based in the Forest.”\nForestry England now stands accused by the Commoners Defence Association of breaching the policy was clearly stated in Parliament. First, it is accused of advertising the properties to all staff within the region and not just those in key posts requiring them to be based in the Forest.\nSecond, that the rents charged are now well beyond the reach of genuine commoners, with rents representing from 70% to in excess of 100% of commoners’ income.\nThis is clearly a change from the policy adopted arising from the Illingworth report. In 2017 the Minister assured me that any review of the Illingworth policy would be preceded by a consultation with all interested parties, and that any change of policy would require ministerial approval.\nThere hasn’t been a consultation, and there has been no ministerial approval of any policy change.\nSo what’s going on?\nI await an answer from the Forestry Minister, David Rutley.\nOf course, I can understand Forestry England’s desire to maximise the income from its assets. It does however, receive a substantial subsidy from taxpayers to pay for its special obligations to conservation of the New Forest. Equally, it cannot be allowed to unilaterally change policy without proper parliamentary accountability.",

It wouldn’t have happened in a physical division because a Government whip would have been barring the way.\nWhen I was first elected in 1997 there was a huge influx of new MPs, partly because there had been an unusually large retirement cohort, but more so because of the huge Labour landslide wiping out so many previously safe Conservative seats. The result was a great deal of overcrowding in whichever division lobby the Labour Party happened to be voting in -whether it was ‘aye’ or ‘no’ the crush was just the same.\nWith so many new MPs not having experienced this crowded and prolonged voting system previously, there was an immediate demand to move to electronic voting.\nA new committee was set up to examine the possibilities: The Select Committee on Modernisation.\nIt took some 18 months to produce its report, but by then it fell on deaf ears.\nThe new MPs had by then had quite long enough to grow used to voting by filing into separate lobbies and being marked off by the division clerks as they emerged. More importantly, they had had long enough to appreciate the huge advantage of being often able to rub shoulders with colleagues and senior ministers, even the Prime Minister himself.\nThis is the huge advantage of the Westminster way of voting: it provides the opportunity to exchange information and grab the attention of the key decision makers where they cannot get away, and they are unprotected by officials and spin doctors. An enormous amount of important business takes place in the division lobbies.\nWhat we managed to see off for years with the Committee on Modernisation, has been achieved in mere days by Covid19: we now have a fully functioning electronic voting system, and even if you are physically present in the Chamber of the House of Commons when a division is called, you are not now allowed to go into the lobbies to vote: you have to go to a PC, IPAD, or smartphone to record your vote.\nThis system is, of course, only a temporary expedient during the Covid19 pandemic, but these temporary things have a habit of surviving. How convenient to vote from home and not to have to trouble yourself with travel to London at all, and just think of the savings.\nAlready there are rumblings from MPs from more distant constituencies, and those with young families, and with private commercial interests which demand their time and presence.\nMy fear is that some newer MPs have not been in Parliament long enough to have fully appreciated the importance of the lobby voting system to their effective performance as an elected representative. After, all they were only elected in mid-December, then there was Christmas and not a great deal of voting in the weeks thereafter, and hardly time to settle into their role before the ‘virtual Parliament’ was imposed on us.\nThe battle over this ancient, but vitally important Parliamentary procedure is looming",

Our trade with the USA is broadly in balance, whereas with the EU we run a significant trade deficit. The simple lesson of this is that you don’t need a trade agreement to trade successfully in the modern world. In fact, the EU is the USA’s largest trading partner and it doesn’t have a trade agreement. It has been trying to negotiate one for years, this proposal is called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and my constituents have emailed by the hundreds in opposition to it!\nI believe that trade deals are desirable and can make things better, but the success of the world trading regime, which Britain has done so much to shape through the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs –now the World Trade Organisation, has ensured that trade is so much easier across the globe even without individual agreements between trading partner nations. Notwithstanding the fact that the EU now officially negotiates for us at the World Trade Organisation, we continue to exert a great influence on it, sending our officials and ministers to shape to its deliberations.\nPresident Obama’s intervention is just tactic in the overall strategy of ‘project fear’. His hypocrisy is breath-taking: the USA wouldn’t for a moment contemplate subjecting its laws to the scrutiny of an external court as we have to in the EU, nor would it dream of giving up control of its borders in the way that it is expecting us to continue to do. It suits the USA to have its principal ally firmly within the EU to continue to shape it. The USA is seeking to disengage from Europe and wants to leave it in safe hands. Its focus is increasingly in the Pacific with the rise and rise of China. The President needn’t worry. We will continue to co-operate closely with European partners with whom we share an identity of interests, even when we leave the EU, and we will continue to demonstrate leadership through NATO.\nBack to trading however, so, the President’s raspberry, is designed to terrify us with the prospect of having neither the USA nor the EU to trade with. It is rubbish: we will continue to trade with the USA as we do now. As for the EU, given our trade deficit, it’s very much more in their interests to continue to trade amicably. “O, but like Switzerland, we’ll have to pay the EU and accept free movement of people across borders”. Well, Switzerland is a tiny country and I’m confident that we can drive a much better bargain. Incidentally, Switzerland has capped the numbers of EU migrants.

It announces to your negotiating counterparties that you will accept any deal no matter how bad, and they can adjust their demands accordingly.\nIt is a stupid negotiating strategy.\nSo why are clever politicians urging the Government to adopt it?\nThe same clever politicians have put their names to an amendment to the Withdrawal Bill which requires that Parliament be given the power to reject the deal that the Government has negotiated. This would give Parliament the power to ensure that there is no deal.\nSo, they demand that the Government rule out the possibility of no deal, but they demand that Parliament has the power to ensure that there is no deal.\nThis is truly bizarre.\nThere are three possibilities: perhaps they are not nearly so clever as was thought;\nmaybe they are just being awkward for the sake of it;\nor perhaps some of them really want as bad a deal as can possibly be had, in the desperate hope that the British people will lose their nerve and demand to stay in the EU.\nAfter all, senior EU politicians keep reminding us that we can still change our minds.\nThere are all sorts of campaigns running to try and persuade us to do so, including the ‘Grab Your Granny For Europe Campaign’ which seeks to get young voters to persuade their grandparents to change their minds about leaving the EU.\nAdd to this mix the way that broadcast media present every piece of economic news as part of a gathering Brexit catastrophe, and you realise that ‘project fear’ is still very much alive.\nDid I ever expect them just to accept the referendum result and get on with it?\nNo I didn’t.\nEuropean elites have a record of ignoring referendums.

They believe we will be more prosperous if we stay.\nFrankly, a nation that is prepared to give up its right to govern itself, for the sake of its prosperity, deserves to have neither.\nMy argument however, is that, for us in the UK, this is a false choice: we can regain our right to self-government by leaving the EU and at the same time become even more prosperous.\nFar from securing prosperity for us, EU membership does not suit our economy and is making us poorer. Every year we run a substantial trade deficit with the EU. Last year that deficit was a staggering £68 billion. Our trade is predominantly with the rest of the world and it was never in our interests to have joined a club that discourages trade outside ‘Fortress Europe’. The reality is that this fortress has been crumbling for years. When we joined all those years ago, its share of the world economy was almost a third, now, notwithstanding adding 20 more members, that share of the world economy has almost halved to just 17%.\nIn addition, the EU’s single currency experiment has proved an unmitigated disaster. Yet those who warn us of catastrophe if we leave the EU, are the same people that told us that it would be disastrous for us if we didn’t join the single currency.\nIt is time to declare that the Emperor really is wearing no clothes, and to take back control of our country.",

Constituents write to me in frustration demanding action without specifying what action they have in mind. I sometimes ask what it is that they can suggest.\nI never had much faith in the prospect of the French stopping the flow even though we are paying them to do so. They could if they had the will, but they have other priorities. I suppose we should be grateful for the 30% of crossing that we estimate that they are preventing.\nNeither had I any faith in training provided to Border Force to enable them to turn boats back. Despite that training, they have proved most reluctant to do it. I can understand their reluctance, as would the public when the bodies of children start being washed ashore.\nThe crossings, which are uncomfortable, dangerous and very expensive, will only be deterred when the probability of swift deportation makes the endeavour uneconomic. Currently the barriers to deportation make it a near certainty that those who are successful in making the crossing will get to stay.\nThe Immigration and Borders Bill, currently going through Parliament, is designed to address the barriers to deportation and remove the possibility of endless appeals -so recently exploited by our latest suicide bomber.\nIt does still leave however, the problem of to where we can deport our failed asylum cases to. I spent some time as a minister trying to persuade foreign governments to adopt a more helpful attitude to taking back their own citizens, but without much success.\nThe bill will make it an imprisonable offence to enter the UK unlawfully, which will include crossing the channel in a dingy, but I am sceptical that we will fill our prisons with migrants. Even were we to, we would still face the difficulties of deportation once sentences have been served.\nThe real hope that I see in the Bill is its enabling provisions that will empower the Government to set up off-shore processing centres. The prospect of being swiftly removed to an overseas processing facility for an indefinite period will be a powerful disincentive to undertaking the expensive and dangerous crossing.\nThis is the solution that has worked effectively for Australia. We must not imagine however, that implementation will be swift or straightforward. It will certainly be controversial and there will be plenty of voices that will denounce the policy as inhumane. It will also prove expensive: Any country that is prepared to host our off-shore processing will want to be richly rewarded.\nDespite these difficulties, I see no alternative than to persevere. Our current problem is bound to get worse. Potential migrants watching from so many less eligible countries have seen the social media output from those that have successfully made the crossing, which will encourage them to follow.\nThe relative ease with which it turns it turns out that the Channel can be crossed has opened a new migration route. It is vital that we close it off before climate change and instability generates a so much greater flow of migrants.",

We are asked this evening to give retrospective legislative approval to the changes that they made. We are in the absurd position of being asked to vote for the ghost of Christmas past. Sometimes in a democracy, process has an importance.\nI am constantly—daily—confronted by individuals and businesses facing ruin, notwithstanding the huge investment that they made in covid-secure premises and procedures. What we have never had, and what we have always been asking for, is the cost-benefit analysis that the Government made on each of the restrictive measures that make up the menu of their tier system.\nI do not for one moment question the motives of Ministers. I do, however, question their ability, in exactly the way that I question my own ability.\nWhen the House rose, the lobby of Government scientific advisers—a lobby, we should remember, that had already publicly expressed their frustration that their earlier strictures on how Christmas should be celebrated had not been fully taken on board by the Government—announced that they had discovered a new strain of the disease so much more transmissible than the earlier one. They bounced the Government. Whilst I have to accept, of course, the possibility that they may be right, but I know this: were I presented by such a lobby of eminent scientists—eminent people leading in their field—and told that they had discovered this new emergency, and that so many more people were going to die, and unless I did what they said, I would be responsible for their deaths, I would find great difficulty in having the wherewithal to identify and ask the right questions to be sure that they were on the money, or 100 miles from it.\nWhat I would certainly want, and what I believe the Government need, is an alternative source of expertise—a competitive source of expertise—particularly statisticians leading in their fields, who would be able to furnish me, to arm me, to arm Ministers, with the right questions to ask about the validity of the modelling and the data. It can only improve the decision-making process.\nBut what is really galling in all this is then to hear on the airwaves Professor Ferguson being interviewed, giving his wisdom to the nation once again, to all intents and purposes as if he were still a key Government adviser. I do hope that the Minister winding up the debate will be able to assure us that that is most certainly not the case.\nI was always rather jealous of Poole, Christchurch and Bournemouth, because our infection rate in the New Forest was substantially lower than theirs, but they turned out to be in tier 2 and we were in tier 3. Now we are all together in tier 4.\nMy right hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we are now in tier 4, but in statutory instrument No. 1646, which was laid before this House on 29 December, we were in tier 2. Today—one day later—we are in tier 4. Is that not a mockery?\nThe reality is this. These are the questions that my constituents put to me, and I am reduced to saying, “It’s one of life’s great mysteries.” The decision-making process is entirely opaque. That is why I voted against it when I had the chance.",

All on top of the momentous events from mid-June to mid-July.\nFor those former regime loyalists like myself, still struggling to adjust to the new reality, and realigning ourselves to the metaphysical plain, the news of Cameron’s departure came as another jolt (I was his Parliamentary Private Secretary for seven years). Particularly so, given a widespread perception amongst the ‘commentariat’ that his legacy was being expunged, much in the manner of some disgraced former Soviet Politburo member.\nAs if to put all these events into a proper perspective, this week the Gaia telescope, a million miles from the Earth in space, reported its findings over the last 14 months by releasing a map of 1.1 billion stars. So vast is the data that the European Space Agency cannot process it all and has asked for the assistance of amateur astronomers and schools. Yet this mind numbing number of stars represents just 1% of our own Milky Way galaxy. Our best estimate is that there are another 100 billion galaxies out there. All hurtling apart (our own galaxy, taking us with it, is going at 1.3 million miles per hour) since the moment of the Creation some 14 billion years ago. These numbers are just too mind bogglingly large to comprehend. Think of it, Just 1 billion minutes ago Jesus was preaching in Galilee.\nWhat can have been in the mind of God when he conceived the Creation of such vastness? Certainly, the very question puts into perspective our priorities and preoccupations, irrespective of how momentous we imagine events to have been over the last few weeks and months.\nThe data from by Gaia will prompt fascinating studies and speculations. For those of us perplexed by the crowding-in of recent events however, there is I believe only one proper reaction to Gaia’s revelations: it’s that of the Psalmist; “Be still and know that I am God” Ps 46.10",

It dwarfs the ban on hunting which generated the next largest. Whilst I have read them all, I am afraid I have had to resort to “your views are noted” as there simply isn’t time in the day to answer them individually.\nWhen, and if, we get to that vote these are the issues that I have to wrestle with:\nI thoroughly disapprove of the agreement because it dispenses with our strongest cards before we even begin the negotiation on our future trading relationship.\nIn any negotiation the strongest position to be in, is to be able to walk away if you don’t like the terms offered. The withdrawal agreement takes that ability away and leaves us trapped in a deeply disadvantageous limbo if agreement on the trading relationship isn’t reached.\nOur next strongest card is our money. We were constantly told that ‘nothing is agreed until everything is agreed’. Yet the withdrawal agreement would have us commit to the financial settlement before we even begin the trading negotiation.\nSo disagreeable are the terms of the limbo that results from a failure to reach a trade deal, that we will be induced to settle for pretty poor terms in order to avoid it. Already the 27 are lining up with their demands.\nThese are huge risks. In reaching my decision however, I have to balance them against what might follow a Government defeat: Parliament might vote for the ‘Norway’ option leaving us even more wedded to the EU (incidentally, Norway has a very small population and an economy which is a fraction of our own); or it might vote for a second referendum with the huge frustration and disunity that it would provoke; or it might vote to delay the leaving date, prolonging this desperate uncertainty. All of these are potentially worse that the PM’s agreement might turn out to be.\nIn a ‘one to one’ with the PM last week, I pointed out that none of these eventualities can arise without her Government bringing forward the legislation to enact them. Parliament on its own can’t do any of them. I asked if she would stand firm and that we would leave on 29 March 2019. She said yes.\nIn the current climate, and with events moving so fast, can I rely on that answer?\nWell, I’m still wrestling with that one.",

New Forest District Council has the very difficult and unenviable task of allocating the scarce supply of social housing between the pressing needs of families in various states of distress, many of whom have been waiting for years. Often they write to me in the quite mistaken belief that I have some power to ‘intervene’ and get them further ahead in the queue.\nFor years we have not built sufficient houses to afford people born and brought up in the area any prospect of being able to find somewhere to buy or rent. The District Council’s plan for the next couple of decades makes a bold attempt to address this. Given the sensitivity of our rural environment, that plan is bound to be controversial.\nBuilding land is essential, but it is not enough. The problem is that the demand for housing has outstripped the supply, driving the price beyond the reach of much of the market. We need a sufficient increase in supply as to drive prices down again so that they are once more affordable. I am persuaded however, that builders will not deliver that increase to the extent necessary: high prices suit them very well, particularly given their preference for addressing the more profitable higher end of the market. For this reason, despite my long held preference for free enterprise, I am looking for the Housing White Paper, which is to be published this week, to give the green light to much greater involvement by the public sector: councils need to build more.",

The row was over the fact that in each of the two years since, applications for nursing degrees have fallen sharply (down 13% this year).\nI think the anger is largely misplaced. It seemed to me that the real scandal was that so many applicants for nursing were being turned away because there was a shortage of places on courses.\nThe savings from abolishing the bursary are being used to fund 25% more training places.\nSo long as the number of well qualified applicants is still sufficient to fill all the places available, including the extra 25%, (and they remain more than sufficient) then the number of nurses will increase, irrespective of the reduction in total number of applicants.\nThere may also be another benefit: One of the strategic mistakes made by government in the nineteen nineties was to accept the Royal College of Nursing’s agenda for a ‘degree-only’ nursing profession, and to abolish the status of the State Enrolled Nurse. This mistake accentuated the move to ‘high tech’ nursing and denied to the profession nurses whose primary role was just caring for patients rather than curing them. Sometimes anxious and vulnerable patients need not only to be ‘treated’ but to be spent time with, to be fed, or even just to have someone hold their hand.\nThe introduction of an entry to the profession through an apprenticeship -which is part of the new scheme- may, I hope, go some way to getting the balance right",

I assured him that we most certainly had not. To get that impression I suspect he had just allowed himself to be overwhelmed by the vociferous chorus of academic economists, corporate bureaucrats, and politicians all warning of penury if we leave the EU.\nIt is difficult to stand up to this rather than accept the herd instinct and just follow along. It takes courage – or complete innocence – to point out that the Emperor is wearing no clothes. It is reassuring however, to recall that it was the very same people who warned of the desperate consequences we would face if we did not adopt the euro currency. They could not have been more wrong then, and they were wrong too when they said that we would face disaster if we left the exchange rate mechanism. They have form. They have made a habit of being wrong, and they are wrong now.\nI believe that we will prosper outside the EU (the Prime Minister, not so long ago, said that we could thrive) but I don’t want to over sell the prospectus. Whether we are inside, or outside the EU, the single most important determinant of whether we prosper, is our ability to produce goods and services that other people are willing to buy at competitive prices. If we can do this we will be okay, economically at least, irrespective of whether we are in or out of the EU.\nThe reason I believe that we will be better off out than in, is because our ability to trade those competitive goods and services will be greater. Most of our trade has always been outside the EU but it is disadvantaged by the EU rules which encourage trade within the EU and make it more difficult to trade outside, by building a barrier around the EU in the form of a common external tariff. Britain’s particular strength has always been in the export of services but within the EU, despite years of trying, we still do not have a single market in services. When the EU negotiates trade deals with other countries, trade in services is not its priority, in fact a third of its agreements exclude them.\nAs a general rule I am sceptical of the value of trade agreements. You don’t need a trade agreement to trade. We trade successfully with China, the USA and India and we don’t have trade agreements with any of them. Undoubtedly however, some agreements can give added advantages. The problem is that the EU is so monumentally bad at making them. Canada has been knocking at the door trying to make one for 7 years. India tried for so long, and eventually gave up. We would have much greater flexibility to negotiate on our own account and to our particular national interest if we set ourselves free to do so. As for the claim that, were we to leave, existing trade deals negotiated by the EU, would then exclude us, this is just nonsense and contrary to international law.\nThere really is no economic advantage to be had by staying in the EU. You can measure that fact by the £68 Billion trade deficit we had with the EU last year, and every year.",

(I have never doubted the wisdom of that aim, although I have always questioned the government’s lockdown policy as a means of achieving it)\nWe’ve all seen and heard it so often, and can call it to mind instantly: our united purpose is to save lives by protecting the NHS.\nThe logic is simple: if the NHS is overwhelmed by too many hospital admissions then not only will it be unable to provide care to those with suffering with Covid-19 – resulting in many more of their deaths, but equally it will be unable to treat people with many other serious and life-threatening conditions, so they will die in greater numbers too.\nSo, we aim to save lives by limiting the number of hospital admissions.\nThe aim is not just to save lives themselves, but to do so by protecting the NHS.\nThis is an important distinction.\nWere the objective just to save lives, then we would only achieve it by a policy characterised as ‘zero Covid’.\nThis is the very ‘mission creep’ against which I have been warning. Right on cue this week Jeremy Hunt, Chairman of the Commons Health Select Committee, has argued forcefully that the aim should, instead of being expressed in terms of hospital admissions, rather it should be a specific reduced target of daily infections.\nBy failing to maintain the original aim, we lose the proper sense of urgency about achieving it, as if we had the luxury of delay until some other desirable objectives were achieved in addition.\nOf course it would indeed be wonderful, were it possible, if we extended our objective to complete ‘zero Covid’ so nobody had to die of it again, or as far along that path as can be practically achieved.\nHowever fanciful this may sound, there is nevertheless a growing lobby in support of it. Daily it is expressed in cautionary statements about the need to maintain restrictions on our lives and not to lift them too quickly.\nThe danger is that we are losing proper and realistic appreciation of the cost in terms of the long term damage to livelihoods, education, and a terrible toll on mental health. In short, we’ve lost all sense of the cost/ benefit analysis of current lockdown measures, and the sense that we urgently need to lift them as soon as possible, before they inflict even more lasting harm.\nThat moment of ‘possibility’ was defined by a level of hospital admissions with which the NHS could cope. Substituting some other new objective appears to be defined only by the length of a piece of string, keeping us in devastating elements of lockdown almost indefinitely.",

I envy his Influence. Perhaps he can persuade the Prime Minister to secure her own electoral mandate distinct from her predecessor, to capitalise on her ‘honeymoon’ and on Labour’s confusion, but I doubt it. At every leadership hustings she told Tory MPs that there would be no election before 2020.\nThe notion that she needs her own distinct electoral mandate is constitutional nonsense. We have a parliamentary democracy not a presidential system: the Prime Minister’s mandate to govern rests only on her majority support among MPs, who were elected for a full five year term.\nWhilst it might be tempting to cut and run early, given the opportunity afforded by the state of the Opposition and strength in the polls, the suggestion completely ignores the post coalition reality. The discretion of the Prime Minister has been removed. She may no longer, at a moment of her choosing, simply ask the Queen for a dissolution of Parliament. For an early election now to take place, one of three of three things would be required; Losing a vote of confidence and failure to put together a new administration; Or a vote by two thirds of the Commons for a dissolution; Or primary legislation in both houses to restore the status quo ante.\nNone of these strike me as at all likely before May 2020.\nWhilst it may be unlikely, it is of course possible that the Government might lose its majority at some stage over the remaining four years of this parliament. For example, if there were to be a highly divisive spat over what ‘Brexit’ should actually involve. Notwithstanding reports of dissent, we are still a long way from anything like that. An early election however, to cement a large majority, would certainly reduce the possibility of any such eventuality. Nevertheless, whatever the potential advantage, perceived wisdom, or the calculated risks of seeking an election soon, such speculation is time wasted: the Prime Minister simply no longer has it in her power.",

None of us has a right not to be offended by the peaceful protests of those with whom we disagree, however profound that disagreement may be.\nNevertheless, I also believe that a balance has to be struck between the right of some to protest and the rights of others to go about their lawful business unmolested and without great inconvenience.\nIt was for this reason that I voted for measures to constrain the sort of protests that were typical of groups like Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, which deliberately sought to severely disrupt the economic and social life of anyone not themselves involved in the protests.\nI think it is now time to consider some restraints on the repeated weekly disruption caused by pro-Palestinian marches in London and other city centres. I understand that Lord Walney, the Government’s adviser on political violence and disruption, has raised the possibility of charging the organisers with the costs of policing the marches (£17 million in the case of the Metropolitan Police Force between early October and early December alone). Personally, I would be reluctant to introduce such a principle, which could be used to stifle any protest by making it too prohibitively expensive.

Alas, the day after that seminar, the Taliban cancelled the return of girls to secondary schools.\nAnother question on which we might reflect, given our 20 year commitment to Afghanistan in blood and treasure, is this: As we look at the example of Ukrainians fighting to the death for their country, why was it that such a will to resist on the part of the whole of civil society was not so evident in Afghanistan?",

As for the rest, we’ve been debating it for months and years.\nI have sat in the Commons listening to the same members, making the same speeches, again and again, and again.\nThe real objective of those who demand more time to subject the bill to their scrutiny, is actually to amend it, and to amend it in ways that it no longer implements the agreement that has been made with the EU. Principally, they want to amend it so that we remain within a full customs union with the EU. This, of course, will require negotiations to be re-opened to change the agreement so that it reflects the legislation passed by Parliament – and so the whole wretched cycle can start all over again.\nFinally, having made yet another agreement, they want to subject it to a further referendum, prolonging the uncertainty for many more months.\nIt’s all very well the Archbishop asking us to moderate our language, but sometimes it’s best to call a spade exactly that.

Indeed, currently the world’s most successful mutant variant originated in Kent.\nThe fear of a new mutant variant need not be confined to Covid-19, any virus could be mutating anywhere.\nIf we are ever to return to normality and prosperity we have to encounter risks with a proper sense of proportion.",

In the Act with which we did so, we included a clause making it clear that we could change it we needed to. Therefore, the Markets Bill no more breaks the Withdrawal Agreement than the Withdrawal Act itself did.\nThe provisions affecting Northern Ireland in the bill are a response to threat by EU negotiators that they would use the Joint Committee set up under the protocol to effectively exclude UK produce from Northern Ireland if we did not concede vital ground in our negotiations with them on a free trade deal.\nSo, the provisions of the bill are precautionary: they give ministers power to act in certain circumstances. The objective remains to avoid those circumstances and therefore, not to have to implement the provisions of the bill. The bill of itself does not breach any international obligation.\nThe Northern Ireland protocol is predicated on the existence of a free trade deal between the EU and the UK. Without one the provisions become unworkable.\nThe Government made a manifesto commitment to UK voters to ensure that there was unfettered market access between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nLet us assume that the worst case comes about, that there is no EU trade deal and that the Government has to use the provisions set out in this bill to make the arrangements workable.\nIn that circumstance would we have breached our international treaty obligations in respect of the Withdrawal Agreement?\nI think not.\nIn that respect I believe that the minister was wrong in what he said in the Commons when he agreed that it would compromise the obligation even if in a very minor technical way. I say it wouldn’t.\nArticle 184 binds the EU and the UK in good faith and using their best endeavours negotiate expeditiously to implement the future relationship set out in the Political Declaration.\nBoth sides have effectively accused the other of already beaching that binding obligation.\nFailure to agree would be the proof of this. It follows that, the parties having breached the fundamental obligation underpinning the Agreement, then the Agreement is void: the Treaty is abrogated. We would have no further binding international obligation.\nWould this adversely affect our international reputation?\nWould other countries trust us in making future binding agreements?\nOur trading partners are not blind. They can see that is a unique circumstance. They have had their own dealings with EU negotiators, and they know what is going on.\nTo compare the provisions of this bill with China’s abrogation of the Sino-British agreement over Hong Kong, as some parliamentarians have done, is ridiculous and grotesque.

We’ve brought a whole range of experienced business people to help Rwandan entrepreneurs with their business plans. We’ve brought football and cricket coaches out to help train local coaches in a nation obsessed with sport.\nAll are volunteers and pay their own way, whilst the organisational costs have been met by many generous donors. The annual number of volunteers has ranged from under 50 when we first started, to over a hundred. Over the decade over 40 Conservative MPs have volunteered: One might say that this Umubano Party is now the third largest in Parliament.\nThe main effort has been in education: Annually we have run a teacher training course. The education ministry has fed and accommodated teachers at centres during what would otherwise be their summer break, and we have run a professional development course for them.\nThe requirement was initially driven by the decision to promote economic growth by moving Rwanda from the francophone zone into the English speaking world. Consequently, the language of instruction in Schools changed from French to English, so teachers needed to learn to speak it. I recall that ten years ago, our course was very much just basic English. Over the decade however, as English has developed, we have focused more on methods and approaches to teaching as a professional skill.\nThis year we had 700 teachers to train, 300 secondary teachers in Kigali, and 400 primary teachers with me in Rwamagana to the east. The teachers had been selected because they are the ‘mentors’ for the staff in their own schools. I had a class of 45, which I thought would be unmanageable, but actually it worked very well, not least because I was assisted by a Rwandan teacher from the ‘beacon’ Umubano School in Kigali (founded and opened just 5 years ago by Brooks Newmark, then an Essex MP and one of our volunteers). Frankly, I was bowled over by the commitment, enthusiasm and professionalism of our trainees.\nEqually, given that I visit so many UK classrooms with every electronic gizmo, I was relieved to be reminded what can be achieved with only a bit of chalk and a painted black space on a wall.\nWe closed the project with a moving ceremony at the Genocide Memorial, the largest grave in the world, where 250,000 of the one million victims of the 1994 genocide are buried. We were addressed by a survivor of that genocide now in her twenties, together with a survivor of Auschwitz now in her nineties. When I first started coming here the nation was still traumatised, but now Rwanda is transformed and outward looking, it has joined the Commonwealth, and Rwanda’s Army is deployed on more UN peace – keeping missions than any other.\nWe leave a legacy of friendship and goodwill but, as a Member of Parliament, it is still difficult for me to explain to Rwandans, why – as a nation, having stood by and watched as the genocide unfolded, some of those same génocidaires now live comfortably in the UK, protected by our absurd human rights laws.",

Apparently, some people are even hoarding test kits in the same way that they hoarded loo paper back in March 2020.\nGiven that the symptoms of Covid are common to any number of ailments: cough, sore throat, headache, fever; it seems quite reasonable to take a Covid test if you experience any of them just to ensure that you do not go about spreading it to those susceptible to a more serious bout of the illness. The reality is however, that the tests are overwhelmingly being taken by people who have no symptoms at all. Even worse, we are imposing a huge administrative burden on the education system by requiring the mass testing of asymptomatic children.\nThis vast enterprise is costing a fortune, were we all to follow the government advice of testing twice per week, In England there are 56.3 million of us, that’s 104 tests annually, 6 billion for all of us put together. The tests come in at £5 each, which amounts to £30 billion per year.\nIs this a sensible way to spend such a vast sum of money, (instead we might increase England’s NHS budget by fully 40%)?\nIn the USA, where they tend to be very cautious in medical matters, people who have had Covid can return to ordinary life after 5 days if they no longer have symptoms – there is no requirement for further testing. That is an example we could usefully follow.\nLearning to live with Covid, if it means anything at all, must surely include behaving normally if we feel perfectly well and not fearing a bogey man around every corner.",

The fact of the matter is that we have been spending record amounts on flood defence back in the UK too over the last decade. Clearly, we are going to have to spend more, but as the 5th richest country on the planet I am confident that we are quite capable of finding the necessary expenditure without taking it from our international development budget, which is designed to assist the world’s poorest people.\nWe spend 0.7 percent of our national income on international development, which means that we can set our other national priorities with the 99.3 percent that is left.\nNotwithstanding the severity, and misery of the floods we have experienced we do still need to keep a sense of proportion. In the last great devastating floods to hit Pakistan in 2010, 2000 people drowned and 20 million were driven from their homes – fully 12 percent of the population. An area the size of Italy was devastated with hundreds of billions of pounds worth of damage.\nThe purpose of our international development expenditure is to increase our own national security by investing to make the world a safer, more secure, and more prosperous place. One way of promoting this is by spending money to ensure that poor countries are more resilient to climate change, the flooding, and the other hazards that it brings. Were we not to do so, and instead to spend 100 percent of our income on ourselves, then we can only expect even greater flows of population as the world’s desperate people seek a better life here.",

That is why I fully support Dr Liam Fox’s Down Syndrome Private Members’ Bill, and I am delighted the Government does too.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need to improve access to services for people with Down’s syndrome. The Down Syndrome Bill will require the Secretary of State to publish guidance to public bodies to ensure they are clear on how they should meet the needs of people with Down’s syndrome. It will set out best practice across health, education social care and housing, giving practical advice on how the appropriate steps can be taken to meet the needs of those with Down’s syndrome when planning, designing and delivering services.\nIt is especially welcome that the Government will consult widely on the proposed guidance, ensuring the voices of those with Down syndrome, their families and carers are heard, and that the guidance is fit for purpose.

The reality is that when Parliament passed the regulations in December which enforce the policy of sacking unvaccinated NHS and care workers (although I voted against the provisions), we didn’t then know what we now know: Which is that risk the unvaccinated pose to patients declines after a very short period and that we have the alternative of regular lateral flow testing, which will tell, whether healthcare professionals pose a threat to their patients.\nThe vaccination doesn’t stop you catching COVID or passing it on, what it does is reduce your risk of serious illness. So, the rationale for forcing it on NHS and care staff has gone.\nThe Government’s own analysis is that that 73,000 NHS staff and 38,000 domiciliary care workers will leave as a consequence of the policy of enforced vaccination.\nWe have no plan for how to replace them and there is already a critical shortage of domiciliary care workers, so much so that beds are unnecessarily occupied in hospitals because care providers have insufficient staff to care for them if they were allowed to go home.\nThe Government should seek to persuade NHS and domiciliary care workers to be vaccinated, not threaten to sack them.

Our trade with the USA is broadly in balance, whereas with the EU we run a significant trade deficit. The simple lesson of this is that you don’t need a trade agreement to trade successfully in the modern world. In fact, the EU is the USA’s largest trading partner and it doesn’t have a trade agreement. It has been trying to negotiate one for years, this proposal is called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and my constituents have emailed by the hundreds in opposition to it!\nI believe that trade deals are desirable and can make things better, but the success of the world trading regime, which Britain has done so much to shape through the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs –now the World Trade Organisation, has ensured that trade is so much easier across the globe even without individual agreements between trading partner nations. Notwithstanding the fact that the EU now officially negotiates for us at the World Trade Organisation, we continue to exert a great influence on it, sending our officials and ministers to shape to its deliberations.\nPresident Obama’s intervention is just tactic in the overall strategy of ‘project fear’. His hypocrisy is breath-taking: the USA wouldn’t for a moment contemplate subjecting its laws to the scrutiny of an external court as we have to in the EU, nor would it dream of giving up control of its borders in the way that it is expecting us to continue to do. It suits the USA to have its principal ally firmly within the EU to continue to shape it. The USA is seeking to disengage from Europe and wants to leave it in safe hands. Its focus is increasingly in the Pacific with the rise and rise of China. The President needn’t worry. We will continue to co-operate closely with European partners with whom we share an identity of interests, even when we leave the EU, and we will continue to demonstrate leadership through NATO.\nBack to trading however, so, the President’s raspberry, is designed to terrify us with the prospect of having neither the USA nor the EU to trade with. It is rubbish: we will continue to trade with the USA as we do now. As for the EU, given our trade deficit, it’s very much more in their interests to continue to trade amicably. “O, but like Switzerland, we’ll have to pay the EU and accept free movement of people across borders”. Well, Switzerland is a tiny country and I’m confident that we can drive a much better bargain. Incidentally, Switzerland has capped the numbers of EU migrants. It exports 400% more to the EU per capita than we do, and for this privilege it pays only 20% per capita of what we do. If that’s the deal, let’s have one too.",

I remember following the soldier in front of me in the blackest of nights for miles, only to discover that he was actually a smudge on my lens, and that I was completely alone.\nThe only time I expected to use the kit and the drills for real, in Iraq in 2003, I ended up not using them at all.\nThe NHS is getting through 60 million visors per week. I did suggest to Matt Hancock at the start of the Covid19 outbreak that, given there is no immediate danger of a chemical/nuclear/biological attack, he should commandeer all the military S10 respirators and allocate them to NHS staff. These do not need replacement, all you have to do is change the cannister (if I recall the drill correctly, you change it: when damaged, if immersed in water, when ordered to do so, or after 40 hours of continual use – but 20 in a forced-air environment. Amazing how it all sticks in the memory).\nAnyway, Hancock turned down my suggestion. I concede that the appearance of the S10 respirator might well ‘spook’ the patients. So, congratulations to Southampton University and Hospital for designing and manufacturing a much more user-friendly PPE respirator from scratch to full production and use, in a matter of days.\nI get quite a few emails from the ’outraged’ of the New Forest, who from their armchairs tell me how they would have so much better managed the distribution of PPE.\nIn a matter of days the NHS has had to move from supplying PPE to just 233 hospital trusts, to the current 58,000 separate healthcare settings.\nthe term ‘PPE’ covers a large number of different items, several with quite different supply chains.

Spain is an object lesson: where PPE was acquired but turned out to be defective, leading to the quarantining of health workers who used it. There are already plenty of scams operating.\nThere are complaints that we failed to participate in EU procurement initiatives early on, but those initiatives have, thus far, failed to deliver a single item to any of their participants.\nAnd into this fog-of-war a teacher emails me to demand to be issued with PPE to protect himself from the possibility of being infected by pupils.

We have neglected to properly fund our armed forces for far too long. It is a matter of deep regret that much of the worst damage occurred under the stewardship of my own political party.\nI do not believe that the increase announced is sufficient, but it is an important start, and it is a realistic amount – given the current demands on the public finances.\nThe Prime Minister has chosen to fund the increase in defence expenditure by a pound for pound reduction in our overseas aid expenditure. As a minister once responsible for that expenditure, I know that this will be a popular choice. Indeed, this choice has been welcomed by my own party leader.\nA popular choice does not however, make it the right choice. My preference is for the stance that the Prime Minister took when the then Conservative government under Boris Johnson reduced overseas aid expenditure from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%. Starmer said then ”this is wrong because investing 0.7% in international aid is in Britain’s national interest…”\nGoverning is about choices and the Prime Minister has made his choice. I believe it is the wrong choice. My own choice, had I been entitled to make it, would have been to raid the welfare budget. If we could only reduce our addiction to welfare benefits to pre-Covid levels, we would save £40 Billion, dwarfing the current proposals for increased defence. We have an army – particularly of younger people- who believe that their mental health is too fragile to allow them to go out to work. Yet, it is accepted medical wisdom that going out to work is good for your mental health.\nWe are currently awaiting the Government’s proposals on welfare reform. I hope that they turn out to be suitably ambitious, because the current bill is one that we can no longer afford to shoulder.\nThe cut in international development aid is even more dramatic than at first sight, because an additional £4 billion annually of that aid budget is being spent on housing asylum seekers in hotels. I know, as the minister once responsible, that one can support so many more displaced people in distress in their own region, than you can by resettling a lucky few here in the UK.\nWe entered into an agreement with the other rich nations back in the nineteen seventies to spend 0.7% of our national income on overseas development aid. It took us until 2011 to honour that pledge. In doing so, we were almost alone. Since when, we have stepped back again. Had all the nations that made the pledge honoured it -and done so immediately having made it, I believe that there would be far fewer seekers after asylum arriving on our shores from basket-case economies in poorer parts of the world.\nI accept that there was too much wasteful aid expenditure. As the minister responsible it used to drive me into a state of apoplexy. I wanted to exclusively focus our aid on economic development to create jobs. For that is why the world’s poor seek to come here. They come here, not to live on benefits (even though we are ready enough to provide them). They come to seek work.\nIt is our own people who appear to be much more inclined to live on welfare benefits. That’s why we can’t afford to defend ourselves.\nWere we to restore our commitment to spend 0.7% of our income on Aid, it would leave us with 99.3 % of our income for our own priorities. I think that is sufficient, even given our defence needs.",

They want to be able to change any agreement that the government makes. They want the ability to send the Government back to the negotiating table with detailed instructions. In effect, this is a bid by Parliament to enter the negotiating process. This weakens the position because Parliament does its business in public but, to be effective, negotiations have to be conducted in private: you don’t reveal your hand in a game of high stakes poker.\nI consider the action of the Government’s opponents as an attempt to wreck the EU Withdrawal Bill.\nThe bill seeks to incorporate 44 years of EU legislation into UK law so that there is certainty for business, organisations, individuals and government; that we leave the EU in an orderly fashion and that the law will function properly on the day after we leave, as it did the day before.\nThis is a massive task and, accordingly, the bill gives order-making powers to government to get on with this enormous job without delay.\nThe amendment that the Government’s opponents voted for -and on which they triumphed- puts off the moment from which some of these order-making powers may be used, until the agreement with the EU has been made, and the bill to give it legislative effect is before Parliament. This delays elements of what is already a complex and very tight timetable.\nSo where are we now?\nIn her Lancaster House speech the PM defined Brexit as leaving all aspects of the EU including its internal market and customs union, and instead replacing it a negotiated free trade deal.\nAs Wednesday’s defeat proves however, the Parliament elected in June has a majority of members who do not share the PM’s definition of Brexit.\nHer opponents fall into three categories: Those who really just want to use the issue as a means to bring down and replace her government; those who want to hang on to some form of EU participation in the internal market and customs union; and finally those who see this as really a strategy to prevent our leaving the EU at all, and they are using the others as what Lenin used to call the ‘useful idiots’ in delivering this strategy.\nWho will prevail?\nIt’s still too soon to tell, but the contest will run, and run: So, we all need to cultivate strategic patience if we are to retain our sanity",

Hamas must release the hostages who have been held in such cruel captivity for almost a year.\nThe Opposition supports Israel’s right to defend itself in line with international humanitarian law. Indeed, it is important that international humanitarian law be respected and civilians protected, and that as the occupying power in Gaza, Israel makes sure that humanitarian aid including food, water and shelter is available to people in Gaza.\nThe last Government, rightly, did everything it could to get aid in to Gaza as quickly as possible by land, sea and air, including by: trebling the UK’s aid commitment to the Occupied Palestinian Territories in the last financial year, establishing a field hospital in Gaza, participating in numerous airdrops of aid, and providing a package of support to help set up a maritime aid corridor to Gaza. It is vital that the UK continues to provide much-needed humanitarian support to the people of Gaza, and continues to press Israel on its commitment to increase the amount of aid getting to Gaza.\nRegarding the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the Opposition has serious concerns about South Africa’s case, and do not believe it to be helpful in the goal of achieving a sustainable end to this conflict. Although formal determination of genocide should be based upon the final judgment of a competent court, Israel’s actions in Gaza cannot be described as genocide.\nThe Opposition strongly disagrees with the new Government’s suspension of 30 of arms export licences to Israel, announcing this decision on the day that Israel was burying murdered hostages, and within weeks of British military personnel and arms defending Israel from Iranian attack. Decisions like this also have important broader geopolitical implications, and we must be clear that there is no moral equivalence between Hamas and the democratically elected Government of Israel.",

Apparently, his argument was that because he looks like a person of “mixed heritage”, he had undergone the struggles of a black man as a consequence of his physical appearance;\nA college student union published a statement asserting that it had “a long history of enabling its members to self-identify as being black…”\nI’ve used this column in the past to explore the controversy surrounding the issue of self-identifying as a different gender. I can understand how someone might be confused about their gender, but self-identifying as a different colour, is a new one on me.\nFour years ago I apologised to those who took offence when, in rather poor taste and equally poor judgement, I went to a Blues Brothers themed party as James Brown -the musician who invented Funk and grand-fathered Hip-hop. Nevertheless, it was intended merely as a tribute to a hero of mine. There was no pretence that I was a black musician.\nThis new fad however, of actually identifying as Black, has become more than a mere performance where, for some people, it isn’t enough just to have an interest in Black music, art, theatre, or whatever, instead they identify as actually being black.\nWell, does it matter?\nAfter all, it’s still pretty rare, and we are hardly fooled. Yet there is an impertinent presumption that we are required accept the fiction of false self-identification.\nDespite my prejudice in favour of order and discipline, I have a libertarian streak: as long as you aren’t harming anyone else, you can call yourself whatever you like.\nI was mortified when people were offended by my appearance as James Brown. But when two constituents explained to me precisely why they were offended, I understood and apologised.\nI can’t believe people of any colour won’t be offended when a white artist claims an opportunity that was properly made available to address disadvantages experienced by artists who are black.\nBut then, in a free society, we have no right not to be offended.\nUndoubtedly, many will be offended by my prejudice that the whole business is bonkers.",

I hope however, that when more space is delivered by our largest prison building programme since Victorian times, he will consider that part of the answer to the problem of short sentences is to make them longer.\nBecause prison works – do not underestimate the relief to a whole neighbourhood had by removing persistent minor offenders can have.\nThey say fish Rots from the head down, so let’s start with the head – the capital crime: murder. The law shows its contempt for the sanctity of life by the leniency with which it treats those who take life.\nOn three occasions in Parliament I’ve taken the opportunity to vote for the restoration of the death penalty. My demand for justice would have been assuaged however, if the mandatory life sentence meant life -or at least some greater approximation to it- but of over 7000 murderers currently in prison, less than 1% have a whole life tariff. Typically, they only serve between only 11 and 16 years.\nMoving on to Rape, the requirement that rapists serve at least two thirds of their sentences was reduced to only a half in 2003 – needless to say, I voted against the measure. Of the tiny proportion of reported rapes that finally make it through to a conviction, in 2022 twenty rapists received sentences of less than 5 years, some less than 2 years.\nThe scandal is that nearly a fifth of all sex offenders reoffend within one year of their release.\nWe are living through an epidemic of Knife Crime, and despite bill after bill in Parliament giving the courts greater sentencing powers, repeat offenders for possession continue to avoid custodial sentences. Taking violent crime as a whole, in the year to 2021 sentences fell by a quarter – down by 19 months.\nMoving on to burglary, unbelievably the average Burglar will have been convicted for up to 27 offences before being jailed.\nAnd when any custodial sentence actually is handed down, however rare, we go through the charade of the judge specifying a term, and everyone else in court calculating on the back of a fag packet how long it will actually be, because they all know that most prisoners serve less than half their term.\nSo Let’s jump down to the tail, to those crimes that make the lives of neighbours and neighbourhoods a misery: the anti-social louts, the vandals, the shop-lifters, the benefits cheats, the fly-tippers, the fraudsters: none of whom will see the inside of a prison cell, for them it’s ‘community punishments’\nThe Lord Chancellor said that he was going to ensure public confidence with a robust regime for community punishments. Well he would need to, because last year I asked in Parliament\n“It is reported that community punishments can be discharged by working from home. Please tell me that isn’t true. “\nThe policing minister replied that although they would reduce the proportion of sentences that could be worked from home, they would retain them for ‘those unable to manage a brush and shovel’.\nLeniency is measured by the public frustration that justice is not being seen to be done.\nLet’s bring back penal servitude with hard labour!",

Other jurisdictions did not do so and yet have had better Covid19 outcomes.\nBut having closed them, we had to find a substitute for the exams.\nThe statistics show that when it comes to predicting exam outcomes, individual teachers consistently overestimate the performance of their pupils. It is natural for teachers to predict on the basis of what they believe their pupils to be capable of, but exams measure actual performance.\nClearly, to have relied on teacher-predicted grades as a once-off this year would have involved a measure of unfairness: There would have been no consistency across schools and it would have put pupils with teachers inclined to make more realistic assessments, at a disadvantage.\nThe mechanism to moderate predicted results using the historical performance of schools might have seemed reasonable in theory, but has given rise to many anomalies, not least having a quite unfair impact on exceptional pupils at historically less well performing schools.\nReliance on unmoderated teacher predictions, though unfair and imperfect, is preferable to the moderating effect of an algorithm\nThere is no ‘good’ way of addressing the problem but why didn’t we see it coming from a mile off?\nOne way of dealing with it might have been to have done everything somewhat earlier (after all, we didn’t have to wait for the exams to be over and marked because there weren’t any), then schools could have had confidential access to the results well ahead of publication, giving them time to remonstrate effectively in a clearly defined and agreed appeals process (and even as I write, that process in yet to be defined).\nThe surrender by Scotland puts pressure on ministers to do likewise and accept a year of grade inflation. It certainly wouldn’t address the unfairness caused by a lack of consistent assessment across schools and individual teachers, but I think it would be the lesser of two evils.\nOf course. We’ll all blame the Government, but the cock-up is largely the work of professionals and an independent quango. What we can blame the Government for is allowing itself to be persuaded to close the schools and cancel exams in the first place -so we are back where I began: mass hysteria.",

I’ve never understood this attitude. Do they realise that the part of the NHS with which the majority of us are most familiar is almost exclusively provided by private contractors -and they are doing a magnificent job, just like the rest of the NHS.\nThe original plan for setting up the NHS was to nationalise the general practitioners and leave the hospitals in the hands of private and charitable undertakings. In the event however, they did it the other way around, with all the family doctors, not as employees of the NHS, but contracting their services to it. Most people have never noticed the distinction, and I’m certain that nobody was excluding them from their admiration when we were clapping.\nI hope that the Horlicks over testing will be a corrective to those ideologues who want to exclude independent providers from the NHS. At The outset, the authorities decided to centralise all testing within the NHS where they would have exclusive control, notwithstanding the ability and willingness of independent commercial laboratories and universities to assist.\nThe testing regime has not covered itself in Glory, and it’s time to let the independents contribute.",

The pandemic underlined not only the dedication and skill of those in this sector, but also the necessity of a broader, more integrated health and care system. I welcome the intention to develop more joined up, integrated care between the NHS, Local Government and other partners including the voluntary and community sector, which will be vital in tackling the factors that affect the long-term sustainability of patient services.

I think particularly of those demonstrations that blocked-off access to airports, attacked enterprises, and brought London to a standstill, all of which place a massive burden on the police, denuding counties of their own policemen and their proper expectations of law enforcement and protection.\nNevertheless, I do agree with my correspondents that the Bill gives too much latitude to police forces and there is a need for the provisions to be much too tightly defined. It also gives the Government the ability to change the balance subsequently through regulations.\nI’ve learnt the lesson of the danger that arises from regulatory powers in the last year as the most intimate aspects of lives – whom we may meet, where we may meet them, even what we must wear on our faces- have been ordered by regulations under the Public Health Act 1984. So I am loathe to grant sensitive regulatory powers in this Bill.\nNone of this however, is sufficient in my opinion to vote against the Bill in principle at Second Reading.\nThe proper way to proceed is to address these important issues by forceful argument and amending the Bill during its progress in the legislative standing committee and at its report stage.",

This includes continuing to pilot models of Culturally Appropriate Advocacy, providing tailored support to hundreds of people from ethnic minorities to better understand their rights when they are detained under the MHA.\nThe commitment to achieve parity of esteem is also reflected in the historic levels of investment the Government is putting into NHS mental health services. The £2.3 billion of additional funding per year by March 2024 will expand and transform mental health services, enabling two million additional people to benefit from mental health support.\nThe Government has also recognised the need to improve the mental health estate.

Despite the primacy of the Syrian war, Daish’s genesis is principally Iraqi.\nA persistent band of internet trolls bombard me with emails purporting to prove that Daesh’s bestiality stems directly from the teachings of the Koran, and that the only true Muslims are – quite properly – violent jihadists. I have used this column previously to refute this nonsense.

It is difficult to touch the UK taxpayer for more, given the blood and treasure we have already shed there.\nOn the other hand, news of German and European generosity has reached the millions who have fled their homes to other parts of Iraq.

It raises the question of how some of the judges at these tribunals ever came to be appointed.\nBlatant political partiality should certainly disqualify any candidate. We do, after all, aspire to an ‘independent’ judiciary.

He has even said that the Conservative Party should be treated the same way as Nazis and cancer!\nHow on earth was he ever get past the most rudimentary scrutiny process?\nThe Judicial Appointments Commission is the body responsible for selecting judges.

Yet she is still in charge of judicial appointments.\nAs Robert Jenrick complained in the Commons “Her commission has failed to conduct the most basic checks on potential judges, either out of sheer incompetence, or out of sympathy with their hard-left views on open borders. The commission is broken and is bringing the independence of the judiciary into disrepute. How much longer will it take for the Justice Secretary to act and remove the chair of this commission from her position and defend the independence and reputation of the judiciary?”\nStrong Stuff. Nevertheless, it would be remiss of me, not to welcome the sanity of the Supreme Court judgement in their ruling that, in law, ‘woman’ means a biological woman (with the 23rd Pair of XY chromosomes in each and every cell).\nActually, the judgement is very balanced and protective of the rights of those suffering from gender dysphoria.\nIn my experience, those that suffer from the condition, always felt that they were born in the wrong body, and they are not obsessed with participating in competitive female sports or which lavatories they use. They are misrepresented by the activists who seek to tell our children that there are 68 genders, or the grotesque wish of rapists to be incarcerated in female prisons.\nSome constituents have demanded to know why that decision was one for the Court and not Parliament.

To minimise that damage we must maintain the current statutory requirement that foreign aid expenditure has to be for the relief of poverty. Equally, we must abide by the manifesto commitment not to tie aid to trade.

Who believe that individuals are the best judge of what is best for them and their families, not the officials in Whitehall.\nAlas, our times are out of joint: government has taken on more and more responsibility for ordering our lives and, as a consequence, placed us under the highest tax burden we’ve endured in peacetime, in order to pay for all that it is doing on our behalf.\nThe herculean struggle under the coalition delivered the smallest civil service for a generation, but now it has ballooned and is larger than ever.\nGovernment even took on previously unheard of powers to order us into the confinement of our homes; defined in detail the circumstances in which we might leave them; permit whom we may meet; where we may go and even what we must wear. I do not dispute that all this was done with the best possible motive, even though I believed it was quite misguided. Just how misguided we discover almost daily as the long-term damage that it did to economy and society emerges.\nThe Prime Minister tells us that the Government wrapped it’s arms around us to bring us through the greatest health emergency for a generation and that now it is wrapping its arms around us once again to bring us through the current ‘cost of living crisis’.\nWe should be in no doubt however, that the hundreds of billions of pounds spent on confining so many people to their homes and paying them to do nothing, and the further hundreds of billions now being distributed to help us with our bills, will be paid for by us either honestly through higher taxation for years to come, or dishonestly through prolonged inflation by the debasement of our currency.\nGovernment has no money of its own. The more it takes from us to pay for what it does, the less productive we will become – if it carries on, we’re all going to be a lot poorer.",

I understand that, particularly for parents whose children are suffering or in pain, there is continued frustration that it is not easily accessible. Although the scheduling of cannabis-based products changed in 2018, this has not translated into significant clinical use.\nEach case is judged individually, and the decision should remain solely with the clinician. However, many doctors remain cautious in prescribing these treatments, and guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence demonstrate a need for more evidence to justify routine prescribing of unlicensed cannabis-based products. With that in mind, it is encouraging to hear of 13 ongoing trials in the UK, and six other trials already completed. Additionally, two new clinical trials into treating refractory epilepsy are being developed by the National Institute for Health Research and NHS England. I look forward to the results of these trials in due course.\nThe number of patients with NHS prescriptions for medicinal cannabis products is low. Often families have sought private treatment, which is clearly a serious financial burden. While the Government cannot stipulate what companies charge for the products, and these companies may face export or import fees for controlled drugs, I am aware of Ministers’ work within these constraints to reduce costs. Many believe medical cannabis, where clinically appropriate, is critical for patients and families in need, and I am assured that the Government is considering every possibility to ensure greater access.\nOf course, there is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that cannabis itself, can harm mental and physical health and damage communities.\nDS.",

Clearly, there is an argument to be had on this, and I entered into that argument in this column a couple of weeks ago ( http://www.desmondswaynemp.com/ds-blog/the-brexit-bill/ )\nWe need to judge politicians not just by their words however, but by their actions.\nThe purpose of a second reading debate is to explore the general principle of a bill. Examining the detail of a bill follows in a separate series of debates on the committee stage (for which seven eight hours days of debate have now been set aside)\nThe principle of the Brexit bill, accepted on both sides, is that there is a need to provide continuity and certainty after Brexit by incorporating EU law into UK law so that it continues to apply after we leave, as it does now. Otherwise there might be a chaotic departure from the EU.\nIf the Opposition accepted this argument (–and they said they did), but nevertheless were worried that the bill gave too much power to ministers, and too little to Parliament, then the proper parliamentary way to proceed would have been to have supported, or perhaps abstained, at second reading, then to seek to amend the balance of powers in the detail of the bill at the subsequent committee stage. To have voted –as they did- against the second reading is to vote against the principle of the bill and to try to kill it outright.\nWhatever opponents say about their motives, for them to have voted against the second reading is deeply worrying about their commitment to our departure from the EU.\nMPs are not objective observers. We are partisans. Forgive therefore, my suspicions about the motivation of parliamentary opponents who campaigned to remain in the EU, nevertheless now say that –as democrats- they accept the referendum result, but then vote against the principle of the bill that is essential to deliver Brexit.\nThey say that they are defending parliamentary sovereignty against a power grab by ministers (because the bill gives those ministers the exclusive right to draw up regulations that will make the thousands of changes necessary to our law, before presenting the regulations to Parliament to be approved or rejected).\nHumbug\nWhere was their concern for parliamentary sovereignty when these EU laws were made in the first place, with no role at all for Parliament in that Process?\nThe opponents of the Bill say they want Parliament to be involved in the detail of drawing up the regulations: that would take years.\nI have spoken before in this column of the desperation of those who want to hang on in the hope that something will turn up to prevent us leaving the EU. Delay is the essential ingredient to such a strategy of hanging on in that hope. Nothing is more suited to supplying that delay than the current tactics of those who voted against this bill.",

Given that consumer spending drives almost two thirds of our economic activity, denting that confidence can have a severe impact. It is most certainly responsible for the very thin time that our high streets have been experiencing recently, with retail sales actually falling. The same depressing trend is evident in figures for recent mortgage approvals. These figures will be seized upon as vindication by those who predicted the Brexit ‘economic shock’.\nConsumers are taking a hit because prices are rising; and prices are rising because of the devaluation of the pound which will, of course, be presented as a consequence of Brexit. It isn’t. Rather it is a consequence of the huge and growing trade deficit that we have been running over recent years – at almost 10% of our national product. What is more, we desperately needed this devaluation to correct the imbalance in our economy. It will move us back towards a trade equilibrium by making our exports more competitive whilst choking off some of our seemingly insatiable demand for imports.\nWhilst the higher prices hurt consumers in the short term, they are nevertheless a necessary correction for the long term health of our economy.\nThe world economy is in desperate need of the flexibility we have recently achieved, because currency exchange rates have become increasingly sticky – almost fixed. There are countries – not least in parts of Europe – desperate for a devaluation similar to one that we have seen, in order to rescue themselves from becoming more and more uncompetitive. If Brexit could be blamed for Sterling’s devaluation, it would be a boon to the world economy and not a threat.\nWe will become accustomed to every economic development being presented in the worst possible light – and blamed on Brexit.",

I have witnessed parents using their children as weapons in a continuing war with their former spouse, as a consequence of the lasting anger and bitterness of such a divorce process.\nRemoving the need to attribute fault will not remove the pain and bitterness of divorce, but my belief is that it will be less likely to stir it up.\nWhere I do depart from supporting the measures in this bill however, is that it introduces an overall timeframe of 6 months from the application for a divorce, to the granting of it. This is ridiculously short. You might even describe it as ‘drive-thru’ divorce.\nCurrently many more couples explore the possibility of divorce than actually proceed to obtain one. In the intervening period there is an enormous opportunity for guidance, counselling and reconciliation. The proposal to reduce the divorce process to a mere six months removes so many opportunities for reconciliation and suggests that divorce is an easier option and a quick way out.\nActually, divorce is the swiftest route to poverty. Of all the difficulties that constituents bring to me in the hope that I can be of assistance -irrespective of how the problem presents: whether it be debt; housing, insufficient income, schooling, child access, or whatever. When I scratch the surface, I find that divorce and family breakdown are the real root cause.\nThis bill will generate more of it.",

The Government’s plan for adult social care will protect individuals and families from unpredictable and potentially catastrophic care costs.\nFrom October 2023, no eligible person starting adult social care will have to pay more than £86,000 for personal care over their lifetime. The reformed means test, which is the best way to help make care affordable, will increase the threshold above which people must meet the full cost of their care to £100,000. This is more than four times the current limit of £23,250, and the number of people receiving state support in the social care system will increase from around half to two thirds.\nIn designing these reforms, the priority has been the creating a more generous means-testing system, which benefits those with low to moderate wealth. The new social care reforms are clear, fair and reduce complexity. Only the amount that an individual contributes towards their personal care will count towards the cap, and a much more generous means test will better support those with lower levels of assets. Fewer people will be unable to pay for social care without selling their home under the reforms to the social care charging system compared to the existing system. These reforms will complement the existing system which ensures that nobody will have to sell their home to pay for their care in their lifetime. People are able to take out a Deferred Payment Agreement so that payments can be deducted from their estate after they die.

The al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza is an example of this. Before Christmas, the hospital was severely damaged again and a tank demolished its front wall. Most of the hospital staff were taken away by the Israeli Defence Force and the Church of England has asked the Government here to inquire about their wellbeing and whereabouts and to request that they be released.\nSir Desmond Swayne\nIntimidation by hard-line settlers has prompted the Patriarch to say that clergy are fighting for their lives, and that the Armenian quarter faces a ‘violent demise’.\nIs a Christian presence in Jerusalem still viable?\nAndrew Selous\nI am grateful to my right hon. Friend for bringing this issue before the House. He is right: a century ago, a quarter of Jerusalem was Christian; now, just 1% of the population is, and in the Armenian quarter of the old city, the Christian presence has come under intensified threat from intimidation and aggressive property acquisition by settlers. The Church of England is very concerned that the rule of law should prevail in Israel and the status quo be maintained. It is unconscionable that Christians should be driven from the holy land.”\nI quote this exchange that took place in the Commons last Thursday to draw attention to two important issues. First, with respect to Gaza, whilst I support Israel’s right to go to war against Hamas (which was the subject of my last contribution in this column A special place in Hell (desmondswaynemp.com) ). I don’t believe that I have a single constituent who isn’t horrified by the consequent destruction and suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.\nSecond, the long-standing concerns I have had about Israel’s stewardship of the West Bank. On Wednesday I heard a dreadful report (as yet, uncorroborated) of a visit by Israeli defence Force to a charity in Jenin which runs a home for disabled children, I’m told that they ‘trashed’ the place and took away all the Children’s winter clothes. I hope it isn’t true – and one has to be cautious about any partisan reports (as the BBC has learnt -or failed to learn- to its own cost).\nWhat I will say however, as a former minister responsible for our assistance to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, I reached the conclusion that the Government of Israel had abandoned any prospect of a two-state solution and that this was made evident by support for the building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank that would make any future Palestinian state geographically and economically unviable.\nWhenever, I’ve badgered current ministers about this, they always respond by saying that we constantly raise this issues with Israel. Well, I did that too. At least I did so sufficiently robustly that the Deputy Prime-Minister stormed out of the room.

A fair comparison of all the costs would need to be made over the entire lifetime of the usage, or reasonable assumptions about it.\nFurthermore, the NAO has missed the political dimension of the policy.

Aside from being male, and the vulnerability arising from other underlying conditions (co-morbidities as the clinicians describe them), the principal risk-factor in making one susceptible to a particularly dangerous dose of Covid19, is being overweight.\nThe key measurement is ‘body mass index’ (Bmi) which is calculated -in ‘English money’ – by dividing your weight in pounds by your height in inches squared, multiplied by 703 (If that is a bit of a challenge and you’ve forgotten how to use a slide-rule, or not seen your log tables since school, then there are any number of calculators and charts available with a quick internet search).\nIf the result to the calculation is 24 or under, then you aren’t overweight.\nSo, were we to say that anyone with a Bmi over 24 were to continue in lockdown after the rest of us have been released, I imagine that there would an absolute furore. Just think how humiliating and intrusive any kind of enforcement would be: If a copper suspected you of being too fat to be out and about, would he be expected to stop you and demand that you step onto his scales, then stand still as he gets out his measuring tape?\nThe very idea is absurd, utterly disproportionate, and Bmi -as the designated criterion- quite arbitrary.\nIt is, nevertheless, no less arbitrary than a given age as the chosen criterion, be it seventy or any other. Equally, the enforcement of an age threshold would be no less intrusive: people looking too old would be stopped and asked to provide proof that they were younger. The prospect is just horrid.\nI hope that, by very briefly touching on how we might differentiate between at-risk groups -for their own protection of course, when emerging from lock-down, I have also drawn attention to the enormous power that we have already placed in the hands of the state to control every aspect of life.\nMedia reports suggest that the public are untroubled, that my concerns are not widely shared, indeed, that a majority have a preference for stricter conditions and harsher enforcement.\nCertainly, there has been no lack of zeal with which they have sought to report to me breaches of the rules by their neighbours, and I find that deeply worrying.",

We believe that schools are safe; they are not vectors of infection; that school staff are no more exposed to the possibility of infection than other occupations. The Schools are closed only because of the impact on community activity generated by children coming and going, which is at variance with the requirement to ‘stay at home’ (regular readers of this column will know that I have profound difficulties with this aspect of the policy, but I simply state the case as made by the Government).\nGiven all this, it would be quite wrong to fast-track hundreds on thousands of school staff at the expense of the most vulnerable citizens.\nI’ve said it before: this is war!\nThe first principle of war is the selection and maintenance of the aim.\nThe selected aim is to save lives by preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed by hospital admissions. The key must therefore, be to vaccinate first those who -were they to catch the virus- be most likely to end up in hospital.\nOnce the most vulnerable have been vaccinated, by all means then prioritise school staff thereafter.\nMy question to the PM last Wednesday and his answer sum up the matter precisely.\nSir Desmond Swayne To lift lockdown, will my right hon.

The independent production sector has also grown enormously so that it now supplies content to a wide range of broadcasters and streaming services.\nThat is why I believe it is crucial that a future ownership model (whereby Channel 4 keeps its public service remit) is considered to ensure more content, more jobs, and a more sustainable future for the broadcaster. To achieve this, it will require access to capital, and a strengthened ability to invest in its services, which is not available under public ownership.\nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has recently held a public consultation on the future ownership of Channel 4 as part of the Government’s review of public service broadcasting.

Journalists began to call, asking me if I could confirm that I had been sacked. Colleagues sought me out to express their sorrow. Touched though I was by all this sympathy, I found the business of trying to explain it all, and that I still fully expected to be back at my post, very repetitive. In the end I simply had to go and hide at the far end of the library.\nLater that evening the call from Number Ten came, and put the matter beyond doubt. Not for everyone however, a fellow did email me to suggest that this was a social media triumph: that I was indeed to have been sacked, but such was the ‘Twitter storm’ that the Prime Minister had had been forced to reconsider. Some people will believe anything!\nAnyway, now that I have my feet firmly back under the ministerial desk, I make the observation that we did not hear very much about international development during the election campaign notwithstanding events which presented the opportunity to raise its profile: first the deaths of scores of people being ‘trafficked’ across the Mediterranean Sea; and second, the earthquake in Nepal.\nI suppose the reason it did not become an election issue is that there is broad agreement about it among the all the main parties with the exception of UKIP. There clearly was no appetite to give UKIP oxygen by concentrating on an issue where the prejudice of the public was broadly in line with UKIP’s thinking – namely that we spend too much on international development.\nI made my position clear however, at each of the six hustings that took place in my parliamentary division of New Forest West. The purpose of the international development budget is largely the same as that of our defence budget: to secure a safer and more stable world in which we can prosper; International development aid it is not charity, rather it is an investment that we make to secure safety and stability. It is no good us just wringing our hands at the political, social, security, and economic consequences of the tide of humanity desperately seeking to cross the Mediterranean and make a new life in Europe. We have to be prepared to invest in solutions to the problems that are driving them from their own countries. In short, we have to make life better there, and we have to tackle the forces that generate terrorism there.\nMy ambition is that by the end of this parliament we will understand this rather better and that, rather than grumbling about our foreign aid budget, we will be proud of what it is achieving.",

I was at the meeting when the comment was made and I have assured them that he said nothing of the sort. What he did say was that many colleagues with legitimate and quite understandable reservations should beware of entering the voting lobbies with terrorist sympathisers. That is not to say that opponents are terrorist sympathisers, but to accept that there are indeed some terrorist sympathisers, and there really are: Over the years there are a number of apologists who, at every terrorist atrocity, have taken the opportunity to blame our foreign policy rather than taking time to condemn the personal responsibility of the terrorist for choosing to blow innocent people to pieces.\nNothing is ever as reported: and neither were the screaming headlines announcing the ‘countdown to war’, they ignored the fact that we have been flying these missions daily against Daesh for the last 14 months into Iraq. All we have now done is to extend them to attack Daesh’s operations in Syria.\nI sat through the entire 10 hour debate listening carefully. I accept that the conditions for destroying Daesh are not yet in place: there will have to be forces capable of prosecuting a ground campaign against Daesh’s ‘capital’ in Raqqa. I cannot understand however, the logic of those who said that we must destroy Daesh, but should do nothing now because those ground forces don’t exist. Clearly, an air campaign can contain and harry the enemy, severely restricting its offensive capability, even if it cannot alone destroy it.\nWhat really unnerved me were the armchair generals on the green benches giving us the benefit of their expertise and demanding all sorts of undertakings and guarantees before their support would be forthcoming. I really wonder if we could have fought the Second World War in the current parliamentary environment. No doubt Monty would have been summoned before a select committee and asked to guarantee the weather in the Channel before contemplating the Normandy Landings. Lethal military operations involve risk, the important thing is to calculate the risks carefully. It was the French World War One leader Georges Clemenceau who said that war was too important to be left to generals, but I’m not comfortable leaving it to politicians either.",

The initial phase in our strategy to deal with Covid-19 was ‘Confine’: to confine it by identifying it through testing, and then quarantining cases and contacts. It was understood however, that this would be temporary and that inevitably it would get out and start spreading in the community. So, the next phase was ‘Delay’: The purpose of delaying the spread was to ease the strain on the NHS by reducing the infection rate until we got to the summer when there would be fewer other winter pressures like flu for hospitals to deal with. We also hoped Covid-19, a coronavirus like flu, would be equally seasonal in its behaviour and abate in the summer.\nThere was no expectation that we would implement extreme measures, rather the advice was to wash your hands frequently and be sensible about social distancing. We anticipated acquiring a herd immunity through the manageable spread of the disease.\nWe witnessed hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed and other countries bringing in draconian lock-downs. Then, modelling by the team from Imperial College London suggested that, if we carried on as we were, 500,000 would die (they have form in vastly over-estimating deaths from other diseases), the Government was spooked, it changed course and ordered the lock-down with all its devastating consequences.\nFlu kills all year round – In the last weeks of July it killed 1000 of us (where Covid-19 killed only 200)- but it is seasonal: it certainly kills a lot more of us in the winter. Equally, we should stop talking about another wave of Covid-19 and instead, like flu, start expecting its annual season.\nHaving peaked in April Covid-19 abated over the summer. Inevitably it will get worse in winter. It may also be worse this winter than might otherwise have been the case. This is because we carried on with a number of restrictions on normal social life during the summer, reducing our ability to acquire and share herd immunity and wasting the opportunity provided by the weakest period for the virus.\nMy contention remains, as I have said many times over the last months, that our over-reaction to the disease has done much more lasting economic damage, and, counter-intuitively, even more damage to our health than the disease itself.\nThe current strategy merely kicks the can down the road. If the measures work and reduce the spread, the virus will simply reappear later.\nOf course, we could be lucky and get a vaccine or a cure, or even ‘moon-shot’ daily tests to enable us to return to normality, but none of these are certain.\nOne day there may be a virus that threatens our whole way of life – but this isn’t it, even if we are behaving as if it were.",

We must not diminish in any way those who have died. No life is worth less than another. All their lives were shortened and they have friends and families who grieve.\n*\nOne other aspect of my correspondence includes unflattering international comparisons of UK performance in terms both of the number of deaths and the damage sustained to the economy. I suspect that the fatuous conclusions drawn are more the result of ignorance than malice, but the fact is that these comparisons do not compare like with like. There will come a time to focus on comparative performance and the lessons to be drawn, but not yet.\nOf one comparison though, I am absolutely certain: if you are unfortunate enough to be struck down with the virus, then there is no better place to be in the world than in the care of the NHS and its fantastic staff. I’ve heard from so many of them: they’re exhausted and emotionally drained, yet they just carry on regardless. It has been a magnificent effort",

He has made clear however, that Labour is now reconciled to BREXIT and will not seek to reverse it. But this is rather undermined by Labour’s current actions in Parliament. At every opportunity, when a problem occurs, They put it down to our having left the EU. This week, for example, they blamed the shelves emptied of salads in our supermarkets on the decision by the British people to vote to leave the EU. As I pointed out in the Commons in response to this nonsense, perhaps we ought to have been told -before we voted – that a vote to leave was going to result in the frosts in Morocco.\nThe reality is that most of our salads, at this time of year, come from southern Spain and Morocco both of which had an exceptionally warm December followed by an exceptionally cold January. Consequently, the crop has been particularly disappointing. Our own domestic supplies of these commodities won’t arrive until summer because the cost of heating greenhouses is prohibitively uncompetitive.\nSeeking supplies from elsewhere has had the additional complication of striking French ferry workers.\nNone of this, of course, has a blind thing to do with BREXIT\nPerhaps even more indicative of Labour’s continuing hostility to BREXIT is its determination to thwart the Retained EU Law Bill. This Bill completes most of the Brexit agenda. There are some 4,000 pieces of EU legislation which remain on the statute book because we incorporated them into our own law as there simply wasn’t long enough to consider them individually in the time available while we were negotiating our exit. Then there was the Covid-19 pandemic, causing a legislative backlog; then the war in Ukraine seized the political agenda. Only now therefore, are we wrestling with the EU retained Law Bill. Basically, the bill empowers the Government to go through all the EU laws and, those that it does not specifically decide to keep, will automatically lapse according to the timetable set out in the Bill.\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats are now sponsoring amendments in the House of Lords that will require that each of these individual legislative measures be separately debated in Parliament. It is, in effect, a wrecking amendment. It would clog-up all available parliamentary time for years.\nThe motive behind such an agenda seems rather obvious to me: its supporters don’t want us to differ from the EU’s regulatory regime, because to do so, would make it harder for us to re-join -which is their real objective.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_campaigns_elections-bill-email-campaign/content_206.html": "The aim of the Elections Bill is to ensure that our electoral system remains secure, fair and transparent. In order to ensure that legitimate categories of third party that may emerge in the future are not unduly restricted in their ability to campaign, Clause 23 proposes that the Government be able to amend the list of legal entities eligible to register as campaigners under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Any such change would be subject to Parliament scrutiny in the usual way and there would be no unilateral change by the Government.\nIn any election, there needs to be spending limits on candidates, on political parties and on third-party campaigners to ensure a level playing field. That is why additional provisions will be introduced on campaign expenditure which would require third party campaigns to give notice to the Electoral Commission at a lower level of expenditure than is currently required. Such third-party spending limits prevent undue influence by American-style ‘Super-PAC’ pressure groups.\nThird parties would also be required to have a legitimate UK interest to campaign in UK elections. Campaign spending, which is part of a joint plan between a registered party and a third party or parties, would be counted as part of the spending limits of all parties involved. I believe campaign expenditure and joint campaigning should be transparently and fairly regulated.\nWith regard to proposals concerning the Electoral Commission, I believe it is the role of the police and the prosecution services to determine whether there has been a breach of criminal law, and whether such a breach should be prosecuted in a court of law. The Bill intends to clarify this status quo. This is not about interfering with the investigative, operational or enforcement decisions of the Electoral Commission. A strategy and policy statement will be introduced that will set out guidance and principles which the Commission will have to have regard to in the discharge of its functions. It is common for the Government to set a policy framework which independent regulators work toward, and the policy statement will be ratified by Parliament. The reforms would not affect the ability of the Commission to undertake enforcement action but it would ensure greater accountability to Parliament.\nDS.",

I fear that the choice we have is either her Withdrawal Agreement or no Brexit.\nThe PM began well by setting out her stall with her Lancaster House speech, but she decided that a majority of only 15 was insufficient to get her plan for a comprehensive free trade deal through Parliament. She chose to ask the voters for a majority from which she could negotiate from a position of strength. I supported her in that decision.\nUnfortunately the election campaign was dreadful, the worst I’ve ever experienced. We squandered an initial poll lead of 20 points and lost our majority in Parliament altogether.\nThat 2017 election defeat had consequences: it pulled the rug from under our negotiating position with the EU.\nThe key to successful negotiation is to persuade your counterpart that you are prepared to walk away if the terms offered are insufficiently attractive. Without a majority the EU could see from the start that Parliament would never let her do that. Accordingly, they negotiated to protect their £100 billion trade surplus by seeking to keep us in their customs union.\nTheir only offer of a free trade deal was confined to Great Britain alone, with Northern Ireland remaining in the EU, a position they knew we couldn’t possibly accept.\nI am sure that the PM and her ministers –including enthusiastic brexiteers like Gove, Fox and Leadsom- really do believe that the Withdrawal Agreement will enable them to negotiate a favourable trade deal once we depart on 29 March. I however, see only a trap: With its ‘backstop’ it is a trap to keep us in the customs union.\nSo why did I vote for a trap?\nAnd why will I vote for it again on Wednesday?\nIf the choice is between being trapped in the EU, or being trapped only in the customs union, then I’ll take the customs union any day.\nWe are a parliamentary democracy.

They should not be blamed for their desperate search for something better. They have suffered horribly, they invested heavily by paying criminal gangs of traffickers to bring them to Europe’s shores. They have braved perilous journeys, which for too many have proved fatal, including 3 year old Aylan Kurdi, his brother and his mother.\nThey all have however, passed through safe countries where sanctuary was available. Having seen the refugee camps in the region, I do not blame them for seeking a new and better life, but Europe would offer a better life than is currently available to three quarters of humanity. The EU plan for every member state to take a quota of refugees who arrive in Europe would send a powerful message to millions of other migrants to follow.

Overwhelmingly however, they go further and tell me exactly what the British People were voting for.\nHow can they possibly know?\nI campaigned vigorously during those months in 2016 and I came across any number of quite differently nuanced opinions held amongst both Leave and Remain voters, in addition to the habitual caprice of so many voters who vote against something they don’t like rather than having a focussed view about what to replace it with.\nI am always cautious when constituents tell me that everyone else thinks like them.\nMy experience was that although there was a firmly committed minority of voters on either side, most people made a finely balanced decision to vote Leave, but could relatively easily gone the other way, as indeed many Remain voters were not too troubled by the result because they too had made a finely balanced decision and might as easily have changed their mind.\nAs a representative I must exercise my judgement on behalf of my constituents, but in doing so I need to acknowledge that whilst I know how they collectively voted, I cannot possibly know why, or -in detail- what for.\nThat said, I campaigned to Leave: to regain control of our money, our laws and our borders. My principal problem with the Government’s position is that in a crucial respect it fails that test.\nThe Government has chosen to seek to preserve out unrestricted access to EU markets in manufactured goods and solve the Irish border problem, by offering to maintain a ‘common rule book’. The only thing that is ‘common’ about this rule book is that it is the EU rule book that must be adhered to in every EU state.

It is just bizarre, given the importance to us of manufacturing, that we would allow all our laws, regulations and specifications to be determined in another country, with that country’s own interests in mind, and with no regard to our own.\nIt would also scupper our ability to make new independent trading agreements.\nIt is just madness, I cannot see how I could possibly vote for it.\nThat voting decision, in isolation, is the easy bit.

The Government losing a key vote might end up putting the whole enterprise very much more at risk.\nYes, I want to vote to change the Government’s newly defined BREXIT policy, but when it comes to the crunch I would choose the Government’s BREXIT recipe if the alternative is no BREXIT at all -which I now judge to be a real prospect.",

All the Government had to do was to lay the order before Parliament for the requisite number of sitting days and secure an affirmative resolution in both houses. The order was not amendable and did not need to go through the lengthy procedures associated with a bill.\nThe Change in the law to end automatic release on licence halfway through a sentence for terrorists however, is more complicated and will require the full legislative treatment of a parliamentary bill. This is because we are seeking to achieve something much more ambitious with terrorist offences.\nThe order that changed prison sentences for violent and sex offenders, about which I wrote in this column last week, does not apply retrospectively: it only applies to offenders sentenced from now on. Those offenders already in prison before the order was made will, alas, still be released halfway through their sentences.\nWith terrorists, we want the change to apply retrospectively to those already sentenced and in prison now. The halfway automatic release for dangerous terrorists is approaching and we urgently need to keep them inside for longer and make their release subject to a risk assessment by the Parole Board.\nFor this reason the law requires to be changed by primary legislation: an Act of Parliament and not just an order.\nWill this offend against Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights ?\nA heavier penalty may not be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time that the offence was committed.\nWell, the Government will argue that it doesn’t, because it is not changing the penalty, merely the administration arrangements of the penalty. A 10 year sentence will remain a 10 year sentence even if the amount of time spent inside is longer, and the amount spent on licence is shorter.\nThis is bound to be challenged in court under the Human Rights Act 1998 and I rather suspect that the judges will give the Government another poke in the eye.\nWhat happens then?\nWell, actually nothing necessarily: A ruling that an Act of Parliament is incompatible with the Human Rights Act is merely declaratory: it doesn’t change or set aside the Act of Parliament; Parliament remains supreme…for the moment at least.\nOnly when the case finally gets to the European Convention Court in Strasbourg, as it inevitably would, and were the Government to lose there, it would be required to seek to change the law back again in Parliament (the Ministerial Code requires ministers to comply with international law and treaty obligations).\nI should point that the Strasbourg Court has nothing to do with the EU which we’ve just left. It is the creature of a Treaty largely designed by the UK in 1950 with the objective of preventing Europe from slipping back into tyranny from which we had so recently fought to deliver it.\nWere that Convention however, to become an obstacle in the way of our determination to maintain public safety in the face of the terrorist threat, I do hope we would conclude that it had outlived its usefulness, and make different international treaty arrangements.",

Members and staff of the House; and wishes her every success in her forthcoming ministry as Bishop of Dover and Bishop in Canterbury.\nYou are absolutely right, Mr Speaker, to say we are moving on to a really happy discussion. It is a great honour to move the motion and give the House the opportunity to pay tribute to the Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the 79th Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons. I would like to thank her on behalf of the whole House for her service.\n“Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.”\nThese are the beautiful uplifting words that the reverend prebendary reads to us in her strong, resonant, resounding voice every morning when we meet in private to send up our petitions to God. It is when your chaplain, Mr Speaker, creates an atmosphere of prayerfulness that allows right hon. and hon. Members to set their souls at ease with God as they prepare for the business ahead of them. She does so in a way that would move the heart of the most stony-hearted atheist to feel there is a true and a divine presence. To achieve this through the power of speech and the use of language is a great achievement, and one that has daily been the triumph of your chaplain, to the benefit of Members of Parliament.\nIt is not only liturgically that your chaplain, who is now retiring to go on to greater things, has been a major asset to this place, Mr Speaker; it is also in her pastoral work, for the chaplain has been a help to many Members, in counselling, guiding and supporting them through difficulties in their lives and giving them succour as a true shepherd to her flock. She has worked closely in a spirit of ecumenism with Father Pat Browne and has not been in any sense narrowly sectarian. Anybody who has had dealings with your chaplain or who has met her has found it a help and benefit. What more can possibly be asked from someone in clerical orders?\nIt has been 359 years since the first Speaker’s Chaplain, Edward Voyce, was appointed in 1660, and while it is of great significance that the reverend prebendary is the first in the intervening three and a half centuries to be a woman and the first to be from an ethnic minority, I look forward to the day when we no longer have to remark on the race or sex of the Speaker’s Chaplain. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but Lord looks at the heart. She is a person of God—the highest calling of all. Dare I say it, but the calling to God is a higher calling than the calling to political life, and all that matters is that calling?\nFor the chaplain, it has always been very simple. God’s calling has made her who she is, and she has followed her calling with the calm confidence we all admire so much. Her key responsibilities, in addition to pastoral care and daily prayers, have included running a weekly eucharistic service in the chapel and performing weddings, marriage blessings and baptisms for Members and their children. She has also led many services to celebrate the lives of those who have died during their service to Parliament. I think many of us would particularly like to thank her for her part in the commemorative ceremonies and her support following the loss of a dear colleagues, Jo Cox and PC Keith Palmer. We will never forget the bravery and passion of all those who have worked in this place, and we will never forget the chaplain’s dutiful care to her flock.\nThe chaplain has always shown her devotion to those who need her, whether in Montego Bay or on these shores, and I know so many people in the parliamentary estate feel that her remarkably self-possessed view of life has sustained them through difficult times. We will never forget the chaplain’s trust in God’s grace, which has, I think, helped give her the courage of her convictions to speak out during her ministry. We should all seek to live by her words on the importance of improving the culture in Westminster and making this a place where everyone is treated as they should be.\nIt only seems suitable to end with words from the 1662 Prayer Book—that great book of liturgical beauty, that ornament of the Church of England and, speaking as a Catholic, that bit of the Anglican Church of which I am possibly the most jealous; some of our translations are nothing like so beautiful. Leaving that to one side, it seems suitable to end with words from the Prayer Book:\n“Almighty and everlasting God, who alone workest great marvels: Send down upon our Bishops and Curates, and all Congregations committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace; and, that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy blessing.”\nI hope, Mr Speaker, that as your chaplain moves to Dover, the continual dew God’s blessing will rain down upon her.\nValerie Vaz (Walsall South) (Lab)\nI thank the Leader of the House for a really wonderful tribute to Reverend Rose. Before I pay tribute to Reverend Rose, I want to refer to your statement yesterday, Mr Speaker, on the new Speaker’s Chaplain. We welcome Reverend Canon Patricia Hillas, who will be with us shortly. I am sure she will do the same wonderful job as Reverend Rose has done. I was sorry to miss mass yesterday, when Reverend Rose and Father Pat were together. They have made a formidable team in our darkest hours.\nWe wish Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin—I am sorry she is not here in the Chamber, in her usual place—a heartfelt farewell. Reverend Rose arrived in the United Kingdom to join the Church Army as an 18-year-old young woman, displaying the Windrush generation’s adaptability. It did not take long for Reverend Rose to flourish, and in 1994 she was ordained to the priesthood, at the point where women had only recently been allowed to be priests. She continued to splinter the glass ceiling spectacularly given the context of the male-dominated area she was called to—not only for women, but crucially, and seemingly effortlessly, for women of colour.\nIt is no surprise to those of us who know her that, while holding the prestigious position of 79th Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons—as you heard, Mr Speaker, in tributes to you, a well-deserved appointment—and being one of the three chaplains to Her Majesty the Queen, she is much loved by her congregation at Holy Trinity church, Dalston, and at All Saints church, Haggerston, where she has worked for over 16 and a half years.\nIf you ask Reverend Rose, I am sure she will say that her pastoral missions both here and in Hackney share a common thread, and that is to make sure that everyone is well spiritually and everyone feels good enough to do their jobs well. The Leader of the House was right: when she says prayers, which she does every day, I often feel as though I have never heard those prayers before. She has an amazing way of making you feel that that is the first time you have ever heard those important words. Reverend Rose will tell you that prayer is at the heart of what she does.\nReverend Rose has always been a visible presence and is often seen around Parliament, as she says, “loitering with intent”, comfortable in her own skin and “in her hair”. I know that she has sought out hon. Members when they have faced difficulties. We have not had to go to her; she comes to us, and she makes sure that she counsels us in the appropriate way.\nBut what Rose has always been keen to emphasise is that in all she does she feels connected with—rooted to—her past in Jamaica, her grandparents and their grandparents, with sacrifices, ideas and hope passed through stories flowing from one generation to the next. She says that such a foundation will be an integral part of success for the next generation of young black people growing up in the UK, on the basis that “they survived, so we must thrive.” Yes, she has a way with words.\nTrue happiness, Reverend Rose maintains, flows from where you come from, where you are rooted and the depth of spirit that tells you who you are. She poses questions: why should women be seen and not heard? Why not live in this world and not in the past? Why should not women be in leadership? Why should people of colour not be seen in all walks of life? But a good leader, she says, acts with integrity and loves the people whom they serve.\nWe certainly have felt the warmth of the Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin’s spiritual leadership while she has been in Parliament, and at a very exacting period of our history. In an interview with The Observer, she revealed that her secret prayer was that she would like to see a more civil attitude among MPs. She warned that the world was looking in, and she would like to see a change in the way we MPs handled listening and speaking to one another. I think that it is a work in progress. Perhaps, when she is looking back on us from Dover, she will see that we have achieved her aims.\nI have seen Reverend Rose sitting through many debates, particularly the European debates. Rose, we shall miss having you with us, guiding us gently but—in the words of Labi Siffre—with “something inside so strong” so that we learn to deal with our individual experiences through the way in which we respond to them, and, in the case of us women, teaching us to respond to high barriers by becoming taller.\nWe wish you, Ken, your two daughters and son all the very best in your new role. We know that you will continue, as Bishop of Dover, with your own mantra: to achieve, to excel, to overcome obstacles—that no limitations will rule your efforts. As we have already witnessed, we know you will go on to greater things and are proud to have crossed paths with you. A true pilgrim’s progress, from Jamaica to Canterbury. As Aretha Franklin would say—respect! Reverend Rose, we thank you. You were there for us when we needed you most.\nThis content has already been edited and is awaiting review.\nMr Speaker\nI must thank the shadow Leader of the House, and I think I speak for the House in doing so, for the sheer warmth and magnificence of that tribute. I think that there is an electricity in the Chamber as a result of what the right hon. Lady has said and the unadulterated passion with which she has delivered it, and I want to thank her.\nSir Peter Bottomley (Worthing West) (Con)\nAs parliamentary warden of St Margaret’s church, Parliament Square, may I join in supporting the motion of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House? The only thing that surprised me about his speech is that he did not mention—although the motion does—that Rose Hudson-Wilkin will be the Bishop in Canterbury, where my right hon. Friend married his wife, with a number of people presiding, and he managed to incorporate in this presently Anglican cathedral a Roman Catholic mass. I think that it is almost coming home time for him.\nMay I say how much I welcomed the words of the right hon. Member for Walsall South (Valerie Vaz)? Watching Rose Hudson-Wilkin work with John Hall as Dean of Westminster, with Andrew Tremlett and with Jane Sinclair, who have been the rectors at St Margaret’s, and in her sharing of the monthly parliamentary communion and the breakfast in your house, Mr Speaker, we have seen closely in private what she is also well known for in public. I add that it was a delight to meet her grandchildren at the reception in your house, Mr Speaker; they are a tribute to the modern generation in this country, and if some of them were to come here not perhaps as Speaker’s chaplain but as Members of Parliament it would be a delight, especially if I could remain here to welcome and join them.\nI want to end with some words that will be familiar to Rose Hudson-Wilkin:\n“Our vision is for everyone, everywhere to encounter God’s love and be empowered to transform their communities through faith shared in words and action.”\nShe says she comes from Montego Bay; I say she comes from the Church Army, and those words are the Church Army dedication. I thank her for her dedication to us.\nMr Speaker\nBless you; I am deeply obliged to the hon. Gentleman for what he has said.\nPatrick Grady (Glasgow North) (SNP)\nMr Speaker, I hope you will not mind if I start by briefly expressing my thanks to you for your service in the Chair and wishing you all the very best for the future. You have been a source of encouragement and sound advice to many of us in the Scottish National party, and I have been particularly grateful for your support in my role as Chief Whip. Of course, for Scottish National party Members, staying at Westminster is not a long-term ambition, but the role that you have played and the reforms that you have introduced have certainly made our time here more tolerable.\nAs others have said, Mr Speaker, one of your most significant legacies and early decisions is the appointment of Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin as your chaplain. I remember as a younger, keener but casual observer of business in this place reading some of the coverage and criticisms of that appointment at that time, but, as you have previously said, Mr Speaker, those critics were wrong in every single respect.\nFrom the start, SNP Members here have found that Rose brings a presence of welcome, comfort and reassurance. There are some who would question the value or relevance of starting the parliamentary day with Prayers, but of course participation is voluntary and, as the Leader of the House alluded to, I do not think that anyone, believer or non-believer, who has had the privilege of experiencing the prayers led by the Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin could doubt their value. No matter how tense the day may be, no matter how important or portentous the business to come, her tone and eloquence at the start of each day have a levelling effect and remind us all that ultimately we are all equal—for believers, we are equal in the sight of God.\nPrayers, especially in recent times, have provided some memorable moments, even if they have not always been visible to the public. The Rose’s choice of texts often matches with uncanny ability the occasion of the day and hits the right note. At the start of our proceedings on the historic Saturday sitting a couple of weeks ago, she began with St Paul:\n“Do not be anxious”.\nThat was the moment that broke the ice, and chuckling could be heard across the Chamber.\nBy leading those prayers, Rose has ministered to the House collectively. Her presence in the Under Gallery, literally praying for us as we have taken part in some of the biggest and most historic votes of recent years, has not gone unnoticed. She has also ministered to many Members individually as a chaplain, especially at times when tragedy has struck Parliament and the House. She has also built strong ecumenical relations, forging, in particular, a firm bond with Canon Pat Browne He may officially be titled the Roman Catholic duty priest to the Houses of Parliament, but to the Catholic community in Westminster—and, I believe, to many others—he too is undoubtedly a chaplain, and early-day motion 71 congratulates him on his 10 years of service. He invited Rose to address us at mass in the crypt yesterday—it is, after all, the chapel of her chaplaincy—and her reflection was once again on that admonition to not be anxious but to trust in God. We hope that that is what she will do as she takes on the role of Bishop of Dover. Once again she is breaking down barriers and conventions, as she has done here in Westminster, and as you have done, Mr Speaker, in appointing her.\nWe will warmly welcome, in due course, Canon Tricia Hillas. She brings considerable experience of promoting diversity, inclusion and ecumenism, all of which means that we can have every confidence in her as a worthy successor to Rose.\nRose said to us last night that, although she was leaving this place, she would carry us in her heart and in her prayers. She can be assured that we will do the same for her, in ours. This morning, at Prayers, she invoked the priestly blessing from the Book of Numbers:\n” The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make His face shine upon you”.\nPerhaps, in return, we can invoke the old Irish blessing:\n“May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face; the rains fall soft upon your fields and until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hand.”\nMr Speaker\nI thank the hon. Gentleman for what he has said. I hope that observers of our proceedings understand the enormous affection and esteem in which we all hold Rose. I just want to mention that a constituent of mine, and a former constituent, are in the Public Gallery: Julie Kincade, my constituent, and former councillor Sue Polhill, who was one of my constituents until relatively recently. In this session, I hope that they are seeing the House at its best.\nI want also to mention, because I think it is apposite and there is a piquancy about it, that the Church of England’s diversity adviser, Elizabeth Henry, who has helped to deliver real beneficial and progressive change, is with us as well. Elizabeth, you have been the most enormous asset to the Church, but I want to thank you publicly. You have been a great support in relation to Rose—you were an early champion of hers, knowing her quality—and you greatly assisted my colleagues and me only the other day in the recruitment of her successor. I salute the work that you do, the passion that you share, the experience that you bring, and the counsel that you offer. They are very precious.\nSir Roger Gale (North Thanet) (Con)\nI have always thought that the job of the Speaker’s Chaplain is rather like the job of the person known as “the bish” on one of Her Majesty’s warships. That person prowls around the lower decks, surrounded by heathens and heretics, waiting for somebody to call upon him. I guess that this place, particularly in the last few months, has been just a little bit like that. But the wonderful thing about Rose is that she has always been there to be called on when she is needed, and through some very stressful times for everyone on both sides of the House she has been a tower of strength.\nYou guys and girls have come to say goodbye to Rose. I have come to say hello. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley) said, the Bishop of Dover is the Bishop in Canterbury. Let me also say, just as an aside, that earlier today, during questions to the Church Commissioner, it was asked, “How does the Archbishop of Canterbury manage when he has so much to do, not only at home but overseas?” The answer is, of course, that he is not the Bishop in Canterbury. That will be Rose, and I know that she will be a tower of strength to Archbishop Justin, as she has been to this place.\nBut Rose is coming to east Kent, and I have warned the lady who is going to become Bishop Rose that one of her first duties will be to visit the wonderful constituency of North Thanet, and to spend a couple of hours on Margate’s seafront—in January, when the rain and the wind and the snow will almost certainly be horizontal. That is when we in Margate celebrate the Blessing of the Seas. That is the occasion, on the feast of the Epiphany, when we throw a small Greek Cypriot boy into the freezing waters of the North sea and—so far without success—try to drown him. The Bishop of Dover—the Bishop in Canterbury—plays a key role in that event. Rose, we are looking forward enormously to welcoming you to east Kent.\nMr Speaker\nThat speech was typical of the hon. Gentleman. Thank you.\nGavin Robinson (Belfast East) (DUP)\nI am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this tribute, but I regret that I was not in my place to take part in the tributes to you, Mr Speaker. I should say that I was not here for your tributes because I was adhering to your rule that we cannot just beetle into the Chamber after the start of a debate, although I realise that you might not have been adhering to that rule quite so strictly today as on other occasions. Had I been here from the start, or had I had the opportunity to participate, I would have said that one of the things you have done, with which I would like to associate myself in every way, is to give steadfast support to Rose. Not only before I joined this House but subsequently, on a number of occasions, I have heard you stand steadfastly and resolutely against racism associated with her as an individual, and against gender bias and gender discrimination. What you have exuded with your appointment of Rose as Speaker’s Chaplain is what I hope we as a House embody. I have never heard a Member of this House—maybe they did previously— criticise Rose. I think she is wonderful. She exudes a faith that I do not talk about often but that I hold personally and privately.\nThe shadow Leader of the House, who is also a wonderful lady, said that she was sorry that Rose was not here. I think that that embodies Rose’s character. She was here during your tributes as a steadfast support for you, Mr Speaker, but she is much too humble to be here for this. She exudes the Christian strength that we should all embody. I have been here four years. On occasions I have gone to Rose, tapped her on the shoulder and shared with her the difficulties that some of my colleagues have been facing. I know, without asking, that she then went to see them. She provided the strength, the assurance and the love that she exudes on our God’s behalf.\nThe Leader of the House mentioned the comfort that we get from liturgy. There is huge comfort from liturgy, but depending on who gives it, it can often appear repetitive. That has never been the case during Prayers in this House. I remember the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Alex Chalk), who is not in his place, talking about her beautiful intonation. The poetry she injected into scripture brought it alive for us. As somebody from Ulster Protestantism who knows how important Sunday morning is, I did not think I would skip into those Anglican ways of believing that coming into this Chamber for Prayers was important. Not only is it important, but it has provided huge comfort for me. Not every day, but on the days when we are facing difficulties collectively and on days whenever, nationally, we know that politics is in a bad place, just coming here for those three or four minutes and hearing the Word expounded in such a beautiful way is a huge source of strength.\nI have never spoken publicly before, and I probably will not do so again, about the difficulties that my wife faced when my son was born. Those difficulties meant that public baptism at the front of church was not an option. So, two years after he was born, Rose baptised him here, very privately and very personally. As a two-year-old, when the light of life was passed, he blew it out. When solemn prayers were being shared, he was trying to run around. Rose just put her arm around him and held on there during all those precious moments. She has been precious to me and to my wife, and I know she has been precious to many in this House. For my part, Mr Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to speak so early and for giving me the opportunity to participate in this debate and to thank Rose from the bottom of our hearts.\nSir David Lidington (Aylesbury) (Con)\nI am delighted to be able to associate myself with and wholeheartedly support the motion moved by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. I want to say two things about my memories of Rose. First, from those few minutes at the beginning of our parliamentary days when the Speaker’s Chaplain reads a psalm and leads us in a brief session of prayer, I will always remember the sheer musicality of Rose Hudson-Wilkin’s voice, which gave extra resonance and meaning to the texts in which she was leading us. I remember, too, her willingness to vary the normal order of prayers when the occasion made that right. There have been times—I remember this from when I was Leader of the House in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack on Westminster bridge and the Palace of Westminster—when the sense of shock in this Chamber at the beginning of the day has been palpable. Somehow on those occasions, Rose knew which psalm, which passage, which prayer to introduce in place of one of our usual prayers to reflect that mood in the House and to respond to the particular occasion.\nMy second point is about her pastoral care. The hon. Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson) has spoken of his and his family’s experiences. Again from when I was Leader of the House, in the months and, indeed, years that followed the dreadful murder of our colleague Jo Cox, one of the things that is etched in my memory is how Members on all sides—particularly, though not exclusively, women Members—began to open up about the abuse and threats that they had been suffering for quite some time. Whether it was about those things or whether it was dealing with a Member at a time of personal or family crisis or tragedy, Rose was always there: quiet, listening, offering comfort, and offering solidarity when it was most needed.\nIn years when the reputation of this House and of its Members collectively has been under fierce and sometimes vicious attack, Rose was also willing to speak up in public to affirm the value of the political vocation and to assert that, from her experience, she knew that most Members here, regardless of which political tradition they represented, had come into politics with a noble motive of trying to make things better for the people they serve.\nRose is now going on to greater things within the Church, and I am sure that the people of Margate and the rest of north Kent will soon discover that they have a shepherd in Rose Hudson-Wilkin of great talent and unparalleled pastoral commitment. Those of us in this House now, whether we are hoping to stay or intending to leave, will always remember Rose with affection, with pride and with a sense of love, because love was what she brought to this place and what she always sought to embody.\nStephen Pound (Ealing North) (Lab)\nI appreciate that you, Mr Speaker, are occasionally someone who believes in constructive iconoclasm. This is the sort of occasion when I say to myself, “Would it not be wonderful if, just for once, we could not sit as Robespierre demanded we sit in the revolutionary council, on the left and the right, but we all sat together, on one side or the other?” I say that because today we are not divided. We are not divided by politics, theology or religion; we are divided in no way. We are united by an extraordinary admiration for a truly remarkable woman. We have heard some extraordinary contributions. Everyone who has spoken related to Rose Hudson-Wilkin in their own particular and personal way. That is so typical of the henotic qualities of the woman: that she appealed to every one of us, from our different traditions, in so many different ways.\nSome of the tributes that have been paid today have been emotional. Some of them have been stirring. Some of them have been hard to listen to. But in many ways, that was Rose’s ministry here in this place; sometimes she went when the words were difficult to say. When my mother died, Rose was an extraordinary source of comfort to me, and I think every one of us has had a similar story to tell. The hon. Member for Glasgow North (Patrick Grady) was slightly censoring his comments when he gave that famous Irish blessing about the wind always being at your back and the road always rising up to meet you. I mention my late mother, God rest her soul, and I seem to remember that the last two lines of that blessing are:\n“And may you be in heaven\nhalf an hour before the devil knows you’re dead.”\nI cannot imagine why my late mother, Dominica, felt it appropriate for me to learn that couplet, but she certainly did and, in the manner of education back in those days, she made me repeat it on a regular basis.\nSlightly oddly, we have heard Rose described as the “Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin. As she ascends to the Episcopal purple, some of us refer to her as the “about to be bishop”. But whatever we call her, a Rose is just as sweet by any name, and what we have here is our Rose, be she bishop, prebendary, or canon. Be she whatever, she is our Rose Hudson-Wilkin and she is remarkable for that.\nThe horror of the murder of Keith Palmer was mentioned earlier. Many of us were in the House on that occasion, and many of us remember that Rose and Canon Pat Browne organised three different services on that very day, so that everyone could have the opportunity to make their peace with God and to find comfort and succour on that day. It was a truly remarkable occasion, and she rose to that occasion. I think you rose to that occasion too, Mr Speaker, as did the House. It is a tragedy that it took that appalling, cold-blooded murder of such a good man for us to come together, as we did in the memory of Jo Cox. We have had some terrible times in Parliament in the past decade, but we have also had some great, great times, and the terrible times have been mitigated by the love, warmth, illumination and prayer of Rose Hudson-Wilkin.\nLast night, as my friend, the hon. Member for Glasgow North said, Rose concelebrated the holy mass in the Chapel underneath. The reading was from Romans, which has wonderful lines saying, “Don’t worry too much about praying because if you can’t find the words, God will give you the words. God will always find the words for your prayer. You don’t need to worry about getting the words right. You don’t even need to worry about getting them in the right order. You don’t even need to worry about your vocabulary or your enunciation. God will give you the words.” Rose Hudson-Wilkin always had the words; she always knew what to say, be it a short contribution or a long one.\nIt has been mentioned that Rose is not in her usual place in the Under-Gallery, where I have seen her sit many a time, shaking her head, almost imperceptibly, but sending us the message that says, “Oh dear, oh dear, what are you doing now?” and praying for us. I believe she is without at the present time, but close, and I like to think she will always be close to this place.\nThe former Bishop of London the Right Reverend and right hon. Richard Chartres and I were at school together. We have an arrangement whereby he does not say anything about what got up to and I reciprocate. We took different theological paths, but when it came time to appoint the next Bishop of London, I felt it appropriate to write to him to say, “I make no suggestion as to who the next bishop should be, but she should be a woman of colour, she should be a woman, her initials should be R. H. W. and if possible, she should come from Montego Bay. If you can find anyone who fits those criteria, I am sure she would make an excellent Bishop of London.” An excellent choice was made, and I am glad to say that Rose has found her bishopric down on the south coast—although I have to say that when the right hon. Member for North Thanet (Sir Roger Gale) talked about hurling young boys into the foaming brine for some extraordinary marine sacrifice, I thought that perhaps a bit of exorcism might be appropriate in such places. Had Rose been appointed the Bishop of London, she would have broken not only another ceiling but a stained-glass ceiling. That is what Rose has done. She would have achieved so much by doing that.\nI find Rose’s kindness, generosity, warmth and love remarkable—they are characteristics from which I draw strength—but let us not forget her intellect. She has a formidable intellect: she is a great Bible scholar and a great student of theology. From the discussions we had, perhaps from slightly different theological perspectives, I learned such a number of things from Rose. She is one of those people who believes that intelligence is like a fire to be lit and a brain is like a bucket to be filled. She actually wants to draw you out and discuss matters with you. She is a truly remarkable woman. I feel the need to head down to Dover just to keep in contact with her. Whether or not I transport myself corporeally down to Dover, all I know is that her prayers will be enveloping this building and this place, because she is part of our history and part of the culture that we have here, and we are the better for it.\nThis morning, during the tributes that were quite rightly paid to you, Mr Speaker, one thing we could not do was give any credit to your successor, because we do not know who your successor is—bookmakers appear to know, but that is entirely inappropriate to mention—but in the case of Rose we can mention my good friend Tricia Hillas. On behalf of all the community and congregation of St Barnabas Northolt, may I say what an excellent choice you have made, Mr Speaker? Despite an unfortunate predilection for Watford football club—I rather suspect she was attracted to Vicarage Road for theological reasons, rather than the lure of Troy Deeney—I must warn you, Mr Speaker, that when we come to meet Tricia Hillas, there will be dancing, singing and music, because Tricia Hillas can never stand still in one place from one minute to the next. We have talked about our different theological traditions—I tend to be with the late Monsignor Ronnie Knox, who felt that by and large enthusiasm was not a good thing and that we have a bit too much of it—but Trisha Hillas is an enthusiast. She is a marvellous pastor and will bring so much energy, courage, colour and excitement to this place.\nI am, of course, backing away from the stage and the limelight, returning to well-merited obscurity—[Hon. Members: “What a shame!”] No, no; were it put to a vote, I think I would have left years ago. [Hon. Members: “Never!”] Well, I think there is precedent for holding a seated vote, or a standing vote—I forget which one is which—but let us not chance fate. I wish everyone who is standing in the election every success and happiness. I want Members to know two things for when the new House assembles and they meet Tricia Hillas. First, she is absolutely a woman of God to the marrow of her bones. She is a woman who will bring God’s blessing to this place. Secondly, it is almost impossible to imagine anyone following Rose Hudson-Wilkin, but believe you me, Mr Speaker, Tricia Hillas is going to come very, very close.\nWe are here to mention Tricia for the future, but for the present and for the future in Dover, let us remember for a moment how incredibly lucky every one of us has been to be touched by that extraordinary, joyous, joyful Christian woman Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Chaplain to the Speaker, a woman who has taught us all so very much.\nThere was a time when I was the mayor of Ealing, and I revived the old habit of appointing the mayoral chaplain, which had fallen into desuetude. I appointed Father Pat Foley, my parish priest. At the beginning of each council meeting, he would stand, look at all the councillors, look at them again and then cast his eyes up to heaven and pray for the Borough of Ealing.\nI have to say that Rose has never ever stopped praying, not just for us poor parliamentarians, but for what we stand for—for our democracy, for our nation, for our community and, I hope, for a better, fairer and safer world. Rose has been an exemplar. She is going to Dover, but she is going with our prayers. Let us ask her to take with her our thanks, our gratitude, our respect and, if you will allow me, Sir, our love.\nDr Julian Lewis (New Forest East) (Con)\nAs I have listened to the successive tributes, I have been looking at my page of notes of all the things that I wanted to say in order to show appreciation for everything that Rose has brought to this place during her years of service here, and I have been having to cross them off one after another, because the heartfelt speeches so far have really encapsulated everything. But, as we know, Mr Speaker, in politics, everything may already have been said, but the show is not over until everyone has said it.\nI wish to try to say something that has not been said explicitly from a slightly unusual perspective in this context. What I mean is that most of the tributes that have been made so far have clearly come from people blessed with deep religious belief, but, sadly, I am not such a person, having had my religious belief holed below the waterline when I read too much for someone at a young age of some of the things that had happened in British and European history in the first half of the 20th century.\nIf, as some people say, religion is irrational, then also agnosticism can be irrational, too. What do I mean by that? I mean that somebody who does not have a particular religious belief is nevertheless hugely touched and impressed by those people who do, and particularly by those people who do and who put it into practice by praying on one’s behalf. At the risk of slightly embarrassing him, and I suspect that he will be the next to be called, the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) has a habit of sending little notes to colleagues on the eve of elections—[Interruption.]\nMr Speaker\nOrder. I know that the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) would want to hear this. The right hon. Gentleman is referring to him and I am sure that he will want to hear it.\nDr Lewis\nAs I was in mid-sentence saying, the hon. Gentleman has a wonderful habit of sending little notes to colleagues at election time and at other times when he thinks that they may need a little bit of encouragement saying, without any sort of patronising air, but with an air of true Christian love, that he is praying for them and their welfare. As someone who is not blessed with deep religious faith, I know how much I deeply appreciate that, and that is, I am sure, one of the reasons why he, irrespective of politics, is loved and respected in all parts of this Chamber. Rose Hudson-Wilkin falls into, from my perspective, exactly the same character. It must have been very daunting for her to descend into this pit of monstrous egos, but she carried it off tremendously. She has never talked down to us or scolded us. She has gently guided us. As has been said, she has given hints through the choice of appropriate prayers and appropriate language, and through the putting forward of a philosophy of righteousness, encouragement and love from which we all have benefited, whether we are religious, whether we have faith or whether we lack it. For that and for her kindness to all who work in this place, I thank her.\nJim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP)\nIt is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis). He has come through a hard time in relation to health. As I was aware of that, I made it my business to hold him very much in my prayers, as I do many people in this House—not that anyone will know, because our prayers are private. The right hon. Gentleman does know that, however, because I spoke to him about it.\nI am also very pleased to follow the hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound), who made a constructive contribution, as he always does. I will miss him when he leaves, as he is my friend in this House. In fact, he was one of the first Members I met when I was first elected to the House. I wish him well in whatever the future may hold; I know it will be a good one. I have very much enjoyed our fellowship. He has also had a hard time health-wise, and has come out the other side, due—I believe in my heart—to the prayers of God’s people.\nI wish to add my voice to the many who have paid tribute to the Speaker’s Chaplain, Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin. I have met her on many occasions, and I have always been inspired by the gentle, measured and thoughtful manner with which she has approached personal conversations as well as scheduled events. I do not think there is one of us who could say that they did not enjoy and feel uplifted by a conversation with Reverend Rose. I know that I always did; I just always felt so encouraged by what she said.\nScripture says, in Proverbs 31, “Who can find a virtuous woman? Her value is greater than that of rubies.” Well, this House has been blessed and encouraged to have been guided spiritually by Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin. We can easily see the worth of her guidance and the worthwhile things that have been accomplished in this place. Rose by name, rose by nature; I think every one of us has enjoyed her time here. Parliament has seen frustration and tempers rising to unheard levels in this place, with repeated calls for calmness and compassion. Reverend Rose has had a gentle spirit and calming influence, and has been a true ambassador for the Lord Jesus. We are exhorted by the word of God to speak the truth but to do so in love, and she does so all the time. That has been missing all too often in this Chamber, but never, ever in the actions of Reverend Rose.\nI am a member of the Baptist Church. When I first came to this place, I was made aware that there was holy communion in St Margaret’s church across the way. Although I am not an Anglican, I felt that I should—I wanted to—be there. From the very beginning, I was encouraged by that holy communion. As I look around the Chamber today, I see many Members who were also at holy communion. We enjoyed that time of fellowship together.\nWe have daily Prayers in the Chamber. People back home ask me whether we still have Prayers and Scripture in the Chamber, and they are encouraged when I tell them that we do. I am also encouraged every day when I come into this Chamber and hear Scripture and Prayer, which is so important. I can honestly say that that makes me feel encouraged for the day ahead. I said to Reverend Rose once, “I would like to have holy communion at least once a week or maybe every day, if that is possible, instead of once a month, because every day that we have holy communion I feel that we have had a visit from the Lord himself.” Holy communion was an important part of what she did.\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson) referred to the empathy and compassion that Reverend Rose has shown him, his wife and his young child. None of us in this Chamber—especially not me, as his colleague and friend—could fail to be moved and encouraged by that.\nI wish Reverend Rose every success and God’s richest blessing as she continues her ministry as the new Bishop of Dover. I exhort her to keep pressing towards the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. May the words of St Patrick—our patron saint in Northern Ireland—be her battle cry as she moves forward:\n“Christ with me,\nChrist before me,\nChrist behind me,\nChrist in me,\nChrist beneath me,\nChrist above me,\nChrist on my right,\nChrist on my left,\nChrist when I lie down,\nChrist when I sit down,\nChrist when I arise,\nChrist in the heart of every man who thinks of me,\nChrist in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me,\nChrist in every eye that sees me,\nChrist in every ear that hears me.”\nI thank Reverend Rose. God bless her in all that she does and will do in the future. I know that in Dover or wherever it may be, she will serve her Lord and Saviour, who we serve here.\nSir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con)\nIt is a privilege to follow the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon).\nThe hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound) referred to the holy mass. What is the meaning of the word “holy”? Daily, at Prayers, we invoke the fellowship of the Holy Ghost. I know that the hon. Member for Strangford would say “Holy Spirit”, but I prefer to stick with the original words. I have no idea how to define “holy” or “holiness”, and I am satisfied that there is no satisfactory dictionary definition, but I know holiness when I have encountered it, and we have encountered it in the presence of Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin.\nRobert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con)\nI want briefly to add a personal note of thanks and tribute to Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin. Rose married Anne-Louise, my wife, and I about 18 months ago. She did that with great charm, great style and joyfulness, and great Christianity. She showed great care and sensitivity to us in preparing us for that wedding, and also to our families, and, in particular, Anne-Louise’s two children, who had lost their own father tragically. The care that she showed has always stuck with us. Since then, particularly in the past few months, when Anne-Louise, sadly, has been unwell, Rose’s continuing support and prayers, and the kindness that she has shown to our family, mean more to us than words that I can say in this Chamber could ever adequately convey.\nI also want to say a quick word about Rose’s husband, Ken, who has been a great support to her, and who I, as Chair of the Justice Committee, had the pleasure of meeting when he was working as a prison chaplain. He, too, has been a great servant of God and of the broader community, and a great witness to his faith. That enables me also to say how valued the work of the prison chaplaincy service is by many in difficult times of their lives.\nAnne-Louise specifically asked me to come here today and say that she is still in hospital but on the mend, and that Rose’s support has meant more to us than anything. For those of us who do have a Christian faith, she could not be a better pastor and shepherd. For those who do not have such a faith, there could be no better ambassador. Dover will gain immeasurably from her arrival as its suffragan bishop.\nFinally, Mr Speaker, I wish you every success and your family every happiness for the future. It might not be so easy for me to see directly eye to eye with your successor; that might be more of a physical challenge for some of us. I wish you well and hope that all goes happily for you and your family in the future. In the end, we ought to remember that the things that bring us here in our desire to serve our communities are more important than the things that may divide us on political grounds.\nMr Speaker\nThe beauty of the hon. Gentleman’s tribute to Reverend Rose will, I think, remain with colleagues for a long time to come. As to the matter of physical stature, he, I and the right hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Sir Alan Duncan) share in common that characteristic of notable shortness, but I have always argued that we should at least be regarded as environmentally friendly on the grounds that we do not take up excessive space.\nMartin Vickers (Cleethorpes) (Con)\nIt is a pleasure to join these tributes to Reverend Rose. Only a remarkable lady could have come from Montego bay to the position of your chaplain, Mr Speaker, and those of us who have heard something of her journey realise how remarkable it has been.\nI am one of those who has regularly attended her morning communions, followed by breakfast in your apartments, Mr Speaker. One of the great beauties of those occasions is that, as the Leader of the House said, the service is based on the Book of Common Prayer, which is vastly superior to all that has followed. We have heard a wide range of speakers from the community, and Rose has introduced us to many people who have shared with us the challenges of their ministry or work, which has been exceptionally valuable. On those occasions, Rose has also invited individual Members to describe their faith journey, and I have found those sessions to be of particular value.\nI also want to talk about Rose’s wider ministry. Last year she came to my parish church in Grimsby, St Giles with St Matthew, and I learned that she has visited other Members’ constituencies—or, in my case, the neighbouring constituency—to preach at their parish church. It was a wonderful occasion, and I know that the whole congregation greatly appreciated it.\nAs we heard earlier, Rose has varied the Prayers that she says at the beginning of our daily sessions. I am sure that that has caused a few ripples here and there, because the exact prayers that must be said are probably laid down in statute, but it has been extremely helpful and valuable. She is not in the Chamber at the moment, but when I popped out a short while ago, she was providing pastoral care and comfort to a Member. That just shows her devotion to her calling, which I think we would all want to place on record.\nMr Speaker, if you will indulge me for an extra minute or two, I would like to say a few warm words about you. We first met when I was the constituency agent in Gainsborough. I drove you around on various visits, one of which was when I was studying at Lincoln University, and you spoke to the politics group of which I was a member. I can assure you that that went down particularly well. You returned to Lincoln University two or three years ago to give an address. You spotted me in the audience and spoke very warmly about me as a Member. My wife said to me, “He’s going a bit over the top, isn’t he?”, and I said, “John going over the top? No, never!” I greatly appreciated that.\nYou have called me relatively early in the proceedings. One or two of us at this end of the Chamber have, on odd occasions when we have been bobbing up and down, thought that your eyesight may be failing. You have always been particularly courteous to me, and I thank you for that. In particular, this occasion calls for our thanks to Rose. May God go with her.\nMr Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield) (Ind)\nI shall be very brief. Throughout the time that Rose has been the chaplain to the Commons, it has been abundantly clear that her pastoral skills are outstanding. Those of us who have gone to the monthly communion in St Margaret’s have come to value her fellowship and her company. In addition, we have had the benefit of seeing her around the building and enjoying her pastoral support at times when some of us have needed it.\nLike my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers), I have had Rose visit my parish to preach, during a time when we had an interregnum between priests. She was something of a star attraction, which showed just how extensive her reach had become in using her chaplaincy of the Commons to spread the gospel and the word that she wanted to put forward in her own way. I will be very sorry at her departure, but I am delighted that the Bishopric of Dover will be available to her, where I am sure her pastoral skills will be used to full measure. I wish to use this opportunity—on behalf of both myself and my wife, who got to know her—to wish her farewell.\nFinally, I would just say that Rose was of course your choice, Mr Speaker, which I seem to remember attracted some controversy at the time. As we consider the end of your career here in the House and of your period as Speaker, I would just like to repeat my thanks to you. It is abundantly clear that if you have ruffled feathers, but there are some feathers you ruffled for very good reasons. Ten years on, those who look back will conclude that our proceedings and our life in this House were enhanced by many of the things that you did.\nMr Speaker\nI am very grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. That is very kind of him, and I take it in that spirit. As he knows, I wish him extremely well. Quite apart from his contributions in the House, the right hon. and learned Gentleman is the most exemplary county colleague that anyone could want. He has been a brilliant colleague for me in Buckinghamshire over the last 22 years, and I salute him.\n3.45 pm\nMr Laurence Robertson (Tewkesbury) (Con)\nAt the beginning of my short address, perhaps you will allow me, Mr Speaker, to thank you for and congratulate you on your work. I think we have known each other in excess of a quarter of a century. You have visited my constituency, and you were very helpful to me when I was Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. You have championed Back Benchers; I have a long record of being one. I would like to thank you and wish you well for the future.\nMr Speaker, you very kindly allowed me to use your state rooms on the occasion of my wedding reception on 7 February 2015. Mentioning that leads me seamlessly into thanking Rose for her work, because she did me the great honour of marrying my wife Annie and me on that date in the chapel downstairs—St Mary Undercroft. What a wonderful day it was. No one who attended will ever forget it. It still gives us strength and fills us with great affection when we look back at it. I well remember that I had to be interviewed separately, Annie had to be interviewed separately and then we had to be interviewed together before Rose recommended to the Dean of Westminster that we should be allowed to be married, and it was a wonderful occasion. That is my personal recollection.\nIt has also been wonderful to see Rose in action over the past 10 years. I have attended many services. I tend to go to the one at 12.45 pm in the chapel downstairs, which is immediately after Prime Minister’s questions, and it is a welcome contrast from that experience to hear Rose tell us about Christianity, peace, love and how important the way we treat each other is. I hope that one of her many legacies, as she goes, will be for us to remember that how we treat each other is very important. Personally, I will never say anything in this Chamber in a tone or in words that I would not say outside it to the person I am talking about or to, and I hope that we could all try to do that as we move forward. I think the public would really like us to take on the lesson that Rose has taught us.\nIt hardly seems credible that, 25 years ago, there was a terrible split in the Church of England about whether to ordain women. That seems incredible thinking back. I was very much on the side of ordaining women because I believe that the person who should get the job is the one who is best qualified and best able to do that job, regardless of whether they are a man or a woman. I am glad the right side won in that debate, because we would have been deprived of the services of Rose if that debate had gone the wrong way. Many years on, when it came to the question of women bishops, it was hardly a debate at all—quite rightly—and that has enabled Rose to move on to be appointed as the Bishop of Dover.\nI would like to thank Rose for all the enormous work she has done in this place, and the messages she has instilled in us about Christianity, the beliefs and what it means to be Christian. I would like to wish her all the very best as she goes forward.\n3.49 pm\nMr Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con)\nIt is a pleasure to take part in this brief debate, Mr Speaker, and have the opportunity to offer my own tribute. I will start by offering a tribute to you, Mr Speaker, because I was not able to be here earlier. I remember well, as a young man, running into the party conference in 1985 to hear you speak, so we must have known each other for at least 34 or 35 years. You were a remarkable young man, and you have had a remarkable, and in some ways famous and controversial, speakership. Of all the things you have done—someone said earlier that you have undoubtedly ruffled feathers—I think that your best decision was to appoint Rose as your chaplain.\nRose has served this House extraordinarily well, and she always seemed to have a knack of knowing what to say. In one of the most difficult times in my life, I happened to bump into her in New Palace Yard. She looked at me from across the yard, pointed at me, and said, “I need to see you.” Although I had not talked to her at all about the difficulties I was facing, she already knew. She had a way of having her finger on the pulse and of knowing who needed help and counsel. Within an hour and a half or two hours, she had made time in her diary, and I spent probably 80 minutes in her study. Those were the most reassuring and illuminating 80 minutes of all the time that I spent talking to people about the difficulties I was facing, and she gave me an enormous amount of reassurance and relief. Rose has an extraordinary gift for pastoral care, and I shall always be extraordinarily grateful to her. She set me on the course that I am relived I ended up on, and I felt reassured by her that it was an okay course on which to embark.\nI endorse the tributes we have already heard. The Church of England often gets a lot of stick, and people worry about the future of our established Church. I believe that so long as people such as Rose are within it, and rising within it, the future of our Church will also be secure.\n3.51 pm\nLuke Graham (Ochil and South Perthshire) (Con)\nI appreciate the opportunity to pay a tribute to Rose. Like many in this House, I had experiences here that, when the personal combined with the professional, meant that I found myself having what might professionally be called “a bit of a wobble”—I know that many colleagues from my intake have had similar experiences. The one thing I would say about Rose is this: she was there. Her office is one of duty, but everyone would agree that her performance goes far beyond that. She makes time to see people, and gives them the opportunity to speak. She listens, far beyond the level that her office would necessarily require.\nRose has set an incredible example and a fantastic precedent for new Members and the future chaplain to follow. More broadly, the prayers that she leads before each sitting of the House give us the chance to reflect. In a time when we are constantly on social media and looking at emails, iPads and phones, that gives us a moment to step back in silence, listen to the words being said and think about the principles that are laid out here and that make this place and make us who we are. That is one of the greatest contributions that Rose has made to this place. Both personally and professionally, Rose has helped all Members strive to become the better part of ourselves while we are here, and I thank her on behalf of myself, my colleagues and our families.\nQuestion put and agreed to.\nResolved,\nThat this House congratulates the Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin on her twenty-eight years of ordained ministry in the Church of England, nine years of which have been in the service of Mr Speaker and this House as Chaplain to the Speaker, the first woman and the first BAME holder of that post; expresses its appreciation for the generous, ecumenical and compassionate spirit of her work among hon. Members and staff of the House; and wishes her every success in her forthcoming ministry as Bishop of Dover and Bishop in Canterbury.\nDawn Butler (Brent Central) (Lab)\nOn a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you indulge me for a moment? I have a bit of FOMO—fear of missing out—because as a Front Bencher I have not been able to say thank you for everything that you have done in the House. I thank you for all you have done on issues of equality and for not shying away from talking about race. I thank you for all you have done on LGBT+ issues, and for making this House more inclusive. Thank you for opening your state rooms, so that small organisations that thought the Houses of Parliament did not care about them could come to some of the grandest rooms in the Palace and feel valued. Thank you for all you have done.\nI also want to thank you, Mr Speaker, for bringing Reverend Rose into the House. Hearing everybody’s testament on how she has touched all our lives has been very moving. She has touched my life in many ways. My right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall South (Valerie Vaz) spoke about Labi Siffre. Reverend Rose and I talk often about this song and I just wanted to say the first verse:\n“The higher you build your barriers\nThe taller I become\nThe further you take my rights away\nThe faster I will run\nYou can deny me, you can decide\nTo turn your face away\nNo matter ’cause there’s\nSomething inside so strong\nI know that I can make it\nThough you’re doing me wrong, so wrong\nYou thought that my pride was gone, oh no\nThere’s something inside so strong”.\nThank you, Mr Speaker, for being so strong. I thank Reverend Rose for all that she has done for the House, for me and for everybody. Thank you.\nMr Speaker\nWell that was extraordinary and magnificent. I thank the hon. Lady for her excessively generous personal remarks as regards me, but what is much more important is what she said about Rose and I want to underline and reinforce that.\nColleagues, I am extremely grateful to each and every one of you, as we approach the end of this Parliament, for sparing the time and making the commitment to share your experience of and demonstrate your—I was going to say respect for—devotion to the Reverend Rose, who has after all been devoted to us for nine years. In every particular—I say this not so much for colleagues, but for those observing our proceedings—Rose has not just done the job, she has excelled beyond anything that we could reasonably have imagined or contemplated. Her daily commitment is there for all to see, day after day, combining her duties in the Chamber with the responsibility for the conduct of services and the need to attend to St Mary-at-Hill in the City and to interact with large numbers of people on the parliamentary estate.\nOn big occasions, as so many colleagues have eloquently evidenced, Rose has found the words that needed to be expressed. She has expressed them with feeling and with a transparent and undeniable sincerity. It is that authenticity about her that impresses everybody who hears or meets her. We all know, of course, that a very important part of Rose’s role, as has been referred to by many colleagues during these tributes, is the offer of pastoral care. To Members, to Members’ staff, to the staff of the House, to anyone not employed by the House but contracted to work for it, or to anyone who has reason to be on the parliamentary estate who needs help, Rose has been there to provide that help. It has been a singular and unforgettable contribution.\nI certainly do not mind vouchsafing to the House that as well as being aware in many cases of when, how and to what extent Rose helped other colleagues, she has been a terrific source of support, succour and counsel to me. Until my dying day, I will appreciate that support, that succour, that counsel and that camaraderie, which she has been able to provide. Many people have also referred to the circumstances of the terrorist attacks. In those circumstances, we could not have wanted anyone, for the purpose of providing comfort and mitigation of pain, other than Rose.\nSo many people over the past three years have referred to our departed and beloved colleague, Jo Cox, and someone referred earlier to Birstall in Yorkshire, where the then Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition went the day after the appalling murder of Jo. Of course I went as well, but what was really significant was how Rose went, and each of us, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and I, observed the impact of Rose’s presence and persona—her love, kindness, compassion and empathy—on people who were experiencing quite unendurable pain. That pain could not be removed, but it could at least be mitigated, and it could be mitigated by no one better than the Reverend Rose. I have a sense, my friends and colleagues, that we are all agreed in this Chamber that the House of Commons’ loss is Canterbury and Dover’s gain.",

The Government takes the issue of low-welfare and illegal supply of animals very seriously. Significant steps have been taken to improve and update the laws in England to crack down on unscrupulous breeders who breed purely for financial greed at the expense of animal welfare.\nUnder the Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations 2018, anyone in the business of breeding and selling dogs and/or who breeds three or more litters in a twelve-month period needs to have a valid licence from their local authority. Under these regulations, local authorities have powers to grant, refuse or revoke a licence. Licences must achieve and maintain statutory minimum animal welfare standards, linked to the welfare needs of the Animal Welfare Act 2006.\nFurther, under these regulations, licensed breeders are prohibited from breeding dogs if it can be reasonably expected that on the basis of their genotype, phenotype or health, this would lead to welfare problems for the mother or the puppies. This applies in the case of brachycephalic breeds. Both licensed and unlicensed animal breeders are required under the Animal Welfare Act to protect the animals involved in breeding from harm and to provide for their welfare in line with good practice. A breach of these provisions may lead to imprisonment, a fine, or both.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has been reviewing the 2018 Regulations. Defra also meets regularly with numerous animal welfare organisations and is kept abreast of concerns relating to brachycephalic animals.\nFinally, Defra’s campaign Petfished raises awareness of issues associated with low-welfare and illegal supply of pets. The campaign provides a list of red flags for buyers to look out for when searching for a pet online. More information can be found here: https://getyourpetsafely.campaign.gov.uk/\nDS",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_choosing-a-pm/content_684.html": "A number of constituents have put questions to me about the constitutional propriety of the choice of the next prime minister being confined to the membership of one political party. Frankly, it is indeed questionable.\nThe constitutional position is that we are a parliamentary democracy and we do not elect the prime minister. Rather, we elect members of parliament, and the PM holds office because she enjoys the support of a majority of those members of parliament.\nUntil relatively recently political parties confined to their own members of parliament the choice of who would lead them.\nThe advantage of doing so is to ensure that the leader always has the confidence of his or her parliamentary party, and if that confidence is lost, then it can be swiftly remedied by a ballot confined to a small electorate.\nThe moment you extend the electorate beyond the parliamentary party you make the process more complex and lengthy, and more important, you run the risk of having a winner chosen by the wider membership who doesn’t actually enjoy the confidence and support of a majority within the parliamentary party.\nThis is exactly the position that the current Official Opposition is in. Jeremy Corbyn was elected by a very wide definition of Labour Party membership which included registered Labour supporters, all on the basis of reforms implemented under his predecessor Ed Miliband, which further diluted the influence of MPs. The result is that it takes a relatively long time to arrange such a contest, and it has delivered a party led by Mr Corbyn, to the dismay of a majority of the MPs who sit on the Labour benches behind him.\nWhen those MPs voted that they had no confidence in him, it made no difference because they no longer had ownership of the office.\nThe Conservative Party came rather late to the concept of ‘democratising’ the party leadership. It was only under reforms implemented by William Hague that the ballot for leader was extended beyond MPs to the party membership. I opposed the reform for the simple reason that the Leader should have the confidence of the parliamentary party, and therefore should be the choice only of the parliamentary party.\nThe system that Hague designed ensured that parliamentary ballots would narrow the choice to two candidates, and that the final choice between them would be put to the membership in a postal ballot.\nOnly two leadership elections have been conducted under the system: when Ian Duncan-Smith triumphed in 2001; and David Cameron in 2005. In the contests of 2004 and 2016, the parliamentary party engineered the exclusion of the wider party membership by ensuring that only one candidate emerged from, or survived for more than a weekend after, the parliamentary ballot.\nHow a political party selects its leader is only of constitutional significance when it is in government.\nIf it is in opposition, a general election stands between its newly elected leader and political power.\nWhen the party is already the party of government however, the choice of leader is also the choice of prime minister. If that choice is confined to MPs then I believe that the demands of constitutional propriety in a parliamentary democracy are satisfied. The extension of that choice however, to unelected members of just one political party undermines the principle of parliamentary democracy.\nThere is only one precedent for this: when Gordon Brown replaced Tony Blair. The precedent doesn’t make it right.\nWe are now in the strange position where urgent and critical business faces the nation, whilst we take two-and-a half- month ‘breather’ to choose a party leader, who will become Prime Minister\n…but for how long?",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_campaigns_eu-youth-mobility-scheme-email-campaign/content_37.html": "Young people in Britain already have opportunities to live, work and study abroad through existing Youth Mobility Schemes. Agreements are in place with 13 countries including Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea, and new schemes with Andorra and Uruguay took effect in January 2024.\nThe Government remains open to negotiating new arrangements with other countries and territories, including EU Member States.\nHowever, the Government has no plans to introduce an EU-wide youth mobility scheme. The British public voted to leave the EU in 2016. Free movement within the EU therefore ended and there are no plans to re-introduce it. It is right that the Government is open to agreeing schemes with individual EU countries, where it’s in the UK’s interest and supports the skills and opportunities of British young people.\nDS",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_not-another-referendum/content_589.html": "A minority of my many correspondents continue to demand a second referendum.\nI would only countenance that as a last resort to prevent our ‘REMAIN’ Parliament from preventing us leaving the EU altogether.\nThe motive of my correspondents however, is different: they want a new referendum purely to overturn the decision reached in the last one.\nFirst, they say people didn’t know what they were voting for. I have heard the same argument in Parliament from MP’s representing seats with Leave majorities that dwarfed ours here in the New Forest. They say their constituents voted LEAVE because they are poor, their towns lack investment, they’ve been ‘left behind’.\nI think they just wanted their country back.\nThey say people never realised how dreadful it was going to be. Well, I reject that premise: I think it’s going to be fine, but even if you don’t agree, REMAIN painted the bleakest, hardest BREXIT imaginable, so nobody could claim that we weren’t warned of all possibilities.\nThey claim we were misled, specifically they refer to the money that LEAVE said could be redeployed from the EU to the NHS. Well, we haven’t even left yet and the Government has already redeemed that promise in its 10 year NHS plan.\nI do however, have some sympathy with the argument that we were misled: I recall being told that economic Armageddon would dawn on 24 June 2016 if we voted leave on 23 June. We were threatened with an immediate emergency budget to raise taxes. Nothing of the sort happened. On the contrary, employment continued to grow to an all-time record and foreign investment in UK outstripped that in all the other EU countries combined. Now the forecasters are saying UK growth next year will be the highest in the EU… and all despite Brexit.\nWe have certainly been misled, but we’ve been misled for years:\nWe were told, before we joined, that there’d be “no essential loss of National Sovereignty”\nWe were told that Maastricht was the ‘high tide’ of EU Integration\nWe were told that we faced disaster if we didn’t join the exchange rate mechanism, then we were told it’d be a catastrophe if we left it\nWere told we’d suffer grievous economic harm if we didn’t join the Euro\nWe were promised a referendum on the EU Constitutional Treaty\nWe were told that the Treaty of Lisbon was a mere ‘tidying-up’\nYes, from the very start we’ve been misled, as our political class have assured us that the treaties they signed on our behalf didn’t really mean what they said\nThe greatest lie however, would be if it turned out that we were lied to about the 2016 referendum, when we were assured that this was to be the people’s one chance to settle the question for a generation.\nThe one thing that REMAIN and LEAVE agreed on was the importance of that vote in determining the outcome.\nI think people knew exactly what they were voting for in June 2016.\nWhat they didn’t know, was what they were actually voting for in the 2017 election, they can be forgiven because 80% of them voted for parties pledged to deliver the 2016 referendum result, and specifically pledging to leave the EU customs union and single market.\nYet now they discover that Parliament is against the people, that it is seeking to usurp power and stop us leaving.\nCertainly, very few of us thought we were voting for that.",

Our devolution settlement with Northern Ireland devolves decisions relating to marriage to the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont. In short, the decision is one to be made by Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland, and not one to be imposed by Westminster.\nIt struck me a supreme irony that a bill designed to get the Assembly back up and running again, should be amended with provisions that usurped its proper jurisdiction.\nExactly the same principle determined my opposition to other amendments that were similarly tabled and which were designed to extend abortion in Northern Ireland.\nI do not doubt the well-meaning intent of those who supported (and carried) these amendments.\nI sit on the House of Commons Northern Ireland Select Committee however, and I am conscious of the sensitivities of people who want to take decisions democratically for themselves rather than having them imposed from the mainland. There remains a ‘fragility’ within the province of which we need to take proper account.",

However, oil and gas will be required in the transition to net zero; simply turning off the taps would mean we would have to import oil and gas, leaving us susceptible to global circumstances. Supporting the production of domestic oil and gas in the nearer term will be coupled with the accelerated deployment of wind, new nuclear, solar and hydrogen energy.\nWhen it comes to food, the UK is largely self-sufficient in many products. Overall, we produce 61 per cent of all the food we need and 74 per cent of that which we are able to grow in the UK. This has been broadly stable for the past 20 years, and the Government’s Food Strategy commits to keeping it at broadly that level in future, with the potential to increase it in areas such as seafood and horticulture.\nFurther, significant investments are being made across the food system. This includes more than £120 million in the seafood fund; £270 million across the farming innovation programme; and £11 million to support new research to drive improvements in understanding the relationship between food and health. The Food Strategy will set the UK on a path to boosted food production, ensuring that everyone has access to healthy, affordable and sustainably produced food. The Environment Act 2021 is a robust piece of legislation through which Ministers have set targets to tackle some of the biggest pressures facing our environment. They will ensure progress on clean air, clean and plentiful water, less waste and more sustainable use of our resources, a step change in tree planting, a better marine environment, and a more diverse, resilient and healthy natural environment. In addition, the Act includes a new, historic legally binding target to halt the decline in species by 2030, as a core part of the Government’s commitment to leave the environment in a better state than we found it. The final targets were published and then approved by Parliament earlier this year.\nFinally, the transport decarbonisation plan sets out how the UK plans to decarbonise public transport by 2050. The Government is accelerating the rollout of zero-emission buses and trains in order to deliver this; twelve hundred miles of railway have been electrified in England and Wales since 2010, and 4000 zero-emission buses have been funded across the UK.\nDS",

Well, as I’ve conceded in this column previously, I use twitter infrequently to broadcast only: I do not read any of the responses to my tweets. First because I’m sure they would drive me insane and second, because there are only so many hours in a day (the tweet in question having attracted 4,343 replies). So, having not read any of them, I was unaware of the ‘twitter storm’ until the journalist tracked me down. Perhaps he’d taken the trouble to read the comments which I hadn’t. The only measure that I had was that some 47 thousand readers had flagged the tweet indicating that they liked it, which seem a pretty good score to me.\nOn Wednesday I raised the classroom face covering requirement in the Commons with The Secretary of state for Education. I was surprised and delighted that a number of other colleagues did so too (I had previously got the impression that I was a lone voice). I was even more delighted that the Secretary of State responded by acknowledging that the requirement was indeed a dreadful imposition and he wouldn’t let it last a day longer than he believed was absolutely necessary.\nIn support of the measure however, he referred to a study that purported to show a 0.6% lower Covid-related absentee rate in Schools that had required face coverings last November, than in schools that hadn’t.\nActually, having now read the study myself, all I can say is that it is so heavily caveated as to be pretty worthless. I then heard Karl Heneghan, Professor of Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford University, deconstruct it in a radio interview in which he concluded that, in fact it, showed that the very opposite: that schools with face coverings fared worse!\nThe report itself acknowledges that it is not peer-reviewed and that ‘there is a level of statistical uncertainty about the result’.\nThere have been reports in the papers that in some schools whole classes have simply refused to comply. As I have pointed out to many of the parents who have written to me to complain about the requirement, it isn’t actually a requirement at all: It is merely guidance not regulation. Even that guidance acknowledges that face coverings should not be worn where clear sound or facial expressions to communicate are relied upon– as a former teacher, I’d say that in class, that’s ALL OF THE TIME!\nParents and pupils should know that they are not compulsory, but that you may end up having a row with your school.\nAnd now I’m utterly vindicated: the former Children’s Laureate, Julia Donaldson – the author of the Children’s best-seller The Gruffalo has called the requirement ‘dystopian’ , the very word I used to describe face covering from the outset.\nWe really must stop making children do things just to make adults feel safer.\nNext, Boris himself referred to ‘mumbo-jumbo’ -remember where you heard it first: I’m on a roll.",

Certain protesters, who have glued themselves to buildings, blocked bridges and obstructed access to buildings such as the Palace of Westminster and newspaper printing works, have highlighted some gaps in current legislation, which has not been updated since 1986. Recent events have shown us that existing public order legislation is no longer fit for managing the types of protest we experience today.\nThe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will strengthen police powers in England and Wales to tackle non-violent protests that have a significant disruptive effect. These powers will allow the police to safely manage protests where they threaten public order and stop people from getting on with their daily lives. The Government is taking proportionate action to ensure a crucial balance is struck between the fundamental right to peaceful protest and the rights of people to get on with their daily lives unimpeded.\nThe measures in the PCSC Bill are not about stopping or clamping down on right to protest but ensuring the police can better manage highly disruptive protests and maintain the balance I have outlined.\nIt is the case that when using these powers, or existing public order powers, the police must act within the law. Importantly, the police must be able to demonstrate that their use of powers are necessary and proportionate. It is also clear that the police must act compatibly with human rights, in particular Article 10 (freedom of expression) and Article 11 (freedom of association).\nMuch has been said regarding the proposed public nuisance offence. Clause 59 gives effect to recommendations made by the Law Commission in their July 2015 Report on ‘Simplification of the Criminal Law: Public Nuisance and Outraging Public Decency’. The report stated that the common law offence of public nuisance should be replaced by a statutory offence covering any conduct which endangers the life, health, property or comfort of a section of the public or obstructs them in the exercise of their rights.\nImportantly, the new statutory offence of public nuisance will cover the same conduct as the existing common law offence of public nuisance.\nDS.",

Immediately you have to hit the phones to cancel the slips that you have already granted and get ministers overseas back to Westminster on the next flight.\nInvariably I found senior secretaries of state accommodating no matter how disruptive I was being to their plans. The problem would always be with a back-bench colleague, rarely seen at Westminster, whose arrangements in Azerbaijan or wherever, were always more important than the Government’s majority.\nA day or so later, by the time we actually got to the vote, and the whips had done their arm-twisting, their appeals to loyalty, or merely deploying their easy-going charm, and burned-off the bulk of the rebels, we would end up with an embarrassingly large majority to explain to a Foreign Secretary whose meetings in Washington had been abandoned.\nThere are three settings:\nFirst, a one line whip, where your attendance is voluntary (we are not expecting whipped votes).\nSecond, a two line whip, where you are required to attend unless you have a pairing arrangement.\nThe system that underpinned this was a fixed long-term personal relationship between MPs on either side to pair with each other, and for one of them to stand out of the division lobby, by arrangement, when the other needed to be absent. Towards the end of John Major’s Government the pairing agreement was suspended after a breach of trust not entirely dissimilar to last week’s events. The arrangements were not restored after the 1997 election because the Labour majority was so large that they could afford to run a shift system without recourse to personal pairing, resulting in the abandonment of the two line whip.\nThird, the three line whip, where your attendance is vital. Even so, as the Pairing Whip, and knowing that a minister needed to be overseas, I would approach my opposite number in the Labour Whips office and we would agree a pair with one of his own absentees. The arrangement often went wrong because it was our own administrative arrangement and instruction, not a personal undertaking by the individuals involved. One of them would find that their plans had changed and, as they were now present at Westminster anyway, they voted without thinking. I would make them write a grovelling letter of apology to the Labour pairing whip. As he did to me. Luckily, it didn’t happen on a close vote.\nNone of this however, explains what happened last week, for which a convincing explanation has yet to be had.",

Consequently, over the decades we imposed a national curriculum instructing teachers what and how to teach, when to teach it and, in order to ensure that they had done so, we imposed a testing regime and school league tables.\nThere is always the danger that the curriculum becomes a straight-jacket, and that schools ‘teach to the test’ to the detriment of a wider education. Nevertheless, results have improved very significantly. Indeed, primary schools have become one of the great success stories of recent years. This has resulted in pressure on a number of preparatory schools in the private sector which have experienced falling rolls because parents have discovered that a good education can be had at their local primary school -without parting with fees.\nI have a particular concern about the other end of the age range at school and college: sixth form education; we fund post sixteen education significantly less generously per pupil, where arguably we should spend more.\nWhen I was studying for my A levels, I had a full timetable -including classes on Saturday mornings. That was still the case when I taught A levels in the mid nineteen eighties. Currently however, we only fund post sixteen-year-olds to the tune with 15 hours per week of teacher contact time. With three, and sometimes four A levels, is that enough?\nOf course, the pupils are required to spend time reading and working on assignments in addition, but I am not convinced that, without sufficient supervision, they are getting a fair deal.\nI spoke to a head-teacher recently who was very concerned that so little time is available that teachers have to stick rigorously to the syllabus and exclude wider discussions.\nConsider how demotivating it would be -for both the pupil and for the teacher- were the subject matter in class to spark your interest and prompt you to ask a question rather wide of the examined syllabus, only to be told “you don’t need to know about that”.\nMy recollection was that the best and most interesting lessons were when the teacher went off at a tangent and gave us an insight into a subject about which he or she was both knowledgeable and passionate.\nI fear that the current generation are in danger of missing out.",

I hope however, that when more space is delivered by our largest prison building programme since Victorian times, he will consider that part of the answer to the problem of short sentences is to make them longer.\nBecause prison works – do not underestimate the relief to a whole neighbourhood had by removing persistent minor offenders can have.\nThey say fish Rots from the head down, so let’s start with the head – the capital crime: murder. The law shows its contempt for the sanctity of life by the leniency with which it treats those who take life.\nOn three occasions in Parliament I’ve taken the opportunity to vote for the restoration of the death penalty. My demand for justice would have been assuaged however, if the mandatory life sentence meant life -or at least some greater approximation to it- but of over 7000 murderers currently in prison, less than 1% have a whole life tariff. Typically, they only serve between only 11 and 16 years.\nMoving on to Rape, the requirement that rapists serve at least two thirds of their sentences was reduced to only a half in 2003 – needless to say, I voted against the measure. Of the tiny proportion of reported rapes that finally make it through to a conviction, in 2022 twenty rapists received sentences of less than 5 years, some less than 2 years.\nThe scandal is that nearly a fifth of all sex offenders reoffend within one year of their release.\nWe are living through an epidemic of Knife Crime, and despite bill after bill in Parliament giving the courts greater sentencing powers, repeat offenders for possession continue to avoid custodial sentences. Taking violent crime as a whole, in the year to 2021 sentences fell by a quarter – down by 19 months.\nMoving on to burglary, unbelievably the average Burglar will have been convicted for up to 27 offences before being jailed.\nAnd when any custodial sentence actually is handed down, however rare, we go through the charade of the judge specifying a term, and everyone else in court calculating on the back of a fag packet how long it will actually be, because they all know that most prisoners serve less than half their term.\nSo Let’s jump down to the tail, to those crimes that make the lives of neighbours and neighbourhoods a misery: the anti-social louts, the vandals, the shop-lifters, the benefits cheats, the fly-tippers, the fraudsters: none of whom will see the inside of a prison cell, for them it’s ‘community punishments’\nThe Lord Chancellor said that he was going to ensure public confidence with a robust regime for community punishments. Well he would need to, because last year I asked in Parliament\n“It is reported that community punishments can be discharged by working from home. Please tell me that isn’t true. “\nThe policing minister replied that although they would reduce the proportion of sentences that could be worked from home, they would retain them for ‘those unable to manage a brush and shovel’.\nLeniency is measured by the public frustration that justice is not being seen to be done.\nLet’s bring back penal servitude with hard labour!",

Its function -managing the NHS in England- is now simply folded into Whitehall’s Department of Health (from whence it emerged under the Conservative /Lib Dem coalition government).\nIt was created to try and take the party politics out of the NHS. The theory being that this arms-length managerial body would be clinically led, with political responsibility -and controversy- being confined to the provision of funding. Alas, we cannot break our habit of blaming government for everything. Notwithstanding the eye-watering increases in funding, ministers continued to get the flack for the relatively poor performance of the NHS. Their frustration was that they had no levers left to pull with which to do anything about it, power having been handed over to NHS England. The Secretary of State became a bit like a spectator on the touch line at a soccer match, shouting advice to the players and being largely ignored.\nWell, the current Secretary of State, Wes Streeting has had enough. I don’t blame him, but now he has no excuses, now he really is in charge. For all our sakes, I wish him luck.\nDespite getting rid of this super-QANGO, the Government has created eight new ones for every week that has passed since the General election. Decisions that should be made by ministers accountable to Parliament, are continuing to be outsources to unelected officials.\nOne QANGO ripe for abolition is the Sentencing Council which has issued new sentencing guidelines for Judges, the effect of which will make a custodial sentence less likely for those “from an ethnic minority, cultural minority, and/or faith minority community”.\nThis is an outrageous double standard, a two -tier approach to sentencing. It is an inversion of the rule of law to which we should all be equally subject.\nThe Secretary of State for Justice, Shabana Mahmood, is ‘incandescent’ (despite the fact that her Department supported the new two-tier guidance—her representative was at the meeting when it was approved on 24 January. Her officials were even given a walkthrough on 3rd March: a dummy’s guide to two-tier justice).\nShe then wrote the Sentencing Council expressing her dissatisfaction and asking for the guidance to be ditched.\nThe Council, under the chairmanship of Lord Justice William Davis has, in effect, told her to get stuffed (as the council is quite entitled to, Parliament having delegated those independent powers to it. But it is now high time we took them back again)\nThis is yet another example of the impertinence of the judiciary in the face of criticism from elected representatives. We’ll have to see how Shabana Mahmood responds in this latest display of the monstrous regiment judges.",

This is an important change.\nThe problems of the social care sector have had a direct impact on the NHS, adding to the winter pressures. Frail and elderly patients living alone, who -for whatever reason- end up in hospital, are subsequently unable to be safely discharged because there is nobody at home to look after them. This then leads to the clinically unnecessary occupation of a hospital bed.\nWe are in the front rank of nations where grown up children no longer live with, or close to their elderly parents. In other cultures there is much greater reliance on the family for social care.\nIn the absence of family, the burden has fallen on local authorities to make provision on a means-tested basis, and the squeeze on their own finances has led to inadequate service levels, the withdrawal of providers, and the closure of care homes.\nWith the number and the proportion of elderly people growing, this problem has to be addressed by more money, much more.\nEver since I entered Parliament, the key question has been, from where will that money be had ?\nWe can all pay much higher taxes, or we can share the cost more equitably between taxpayers and those who need the care. There has however, always been outrage at the prospect of asset-rich elderly people having to deplete their savings, sell their homes, or have their homes sold after their death, in order to meet the costs of their care.\nA number of schemes have been devised to protect assets by shifting some of the care costs and splitting them between the insurance market and the taxpayer.\nSuch a scheme, based on the Dilnot Commission findings, was adopted by George Osborne for implementation in 2021 (allowing further time for the public finances to recover).\nUnwisely, as it turned out, the Prime Minister changed this policy during the election campaign last summer, and now the issue is to be revisited over the coming months.\nI do not share the horror that many fellow politicians have at the prospect of meeting the costs of care from one’s estate, including the principal asset, the home.\nAs we have made a decision not to expect families to care for their elderly, then families should in turn, not expect to benefit from heritable assets handed on unencumbered.\nPeople should always save for a rainy day (and overwhelmingly the British people have chosen to hold most of their savings in the form of property), well, when you need expensive social care, isn’t that a ‘rainy day’ ?\nWhy is it that we always expect someone else to pay?",

Duty rates on draught beer and cider will be cut by 5 per cent, taking 3p off a pint and further supporting pubs.\nI was glad to see the announcement in the Autumn Budget 2021 that, following a review, the alcohol duty regime is to undergo a major simplification. The old system was outdated system that set rates based on historical anomalies, and a new regime will be fairer to both consumers and producers, and promote product innovation in response to evolving consumer tastes.\nThis radical simplification of the duty system will reduce the number of main rates from 15 to 6, and tax products in proportion to their alcohol content.\nAll tax categories, such as beer and wine, will be moved to a standardised set of bands, with rates for products between 1.2-3.4 per cent alcohol by volume (ABV), 3.5-8.4 per cent ABV, 8.5-22 per cent ABV, and above 22 per cent ABV. Above 8.5 per cent ABV, all products across all categories will pay the same rate of duty if they have the same proportion of alcohol content. Registration and payment will also be simplified, and the practice where individual products have different administrative rules will end.\nThe new progressive manner in which alcohol is taxed will ensure higher strength products incur proportionately more duty, and these rates will be the same across all product categories. This change will address the problem of harmful high-strength products being sold too cheaply, and the new rates for low strength drinks below 3.5 per cent ABV will encourage manufacturers to develop new products at lower ABVs, giving consumers greater choice and greater options to drink responsibly.\nI welcome the introduction of a new small producer relief which will build on the previous success of the Small Brewers Relief, which will benefit cidermakers and other producers of lower ABV drinks. This will allow small producers to diversify their product range to other products below 8.5 per cent ABV while still benefitting from reduced rates.\nDS.",

They were assured that this was proper and above board, typically they paid fees of 18% to the provider. They declared the arrangements in their tax returns, unchallenged by HMRC.\nThen years after the event, for tax years now closed, they started to receive huge tax bills, with eye watering additions for interest stretching back over the years.\nTypically, these are people of modest means including many nurses, computer programmers, some were even contractors working at HMRC.\nMuch of the debate last Thursday was taken up with the detail of HMRC’s shocking treatment of its victims and the terrifying experience it can generate.\nThe worst of it however, is that unlike the Horizon scandal, where the Post office and Fujitsu can be blamed, the powers that HMRC are now using were specifically granted for that purpose by the House of Commons itself in the Finance (Number 2) Act 2017. (Exclusive blame lies with the Commons because Finance bills don’t go to the House of Lords for scrutiny).\nA key question that we touched on was, how was it that, when we approved the measure, we didn’t realise the full implications and consequences of what we were about to inflict?\nThe 2017 Loan Charge measure defies the principles of good legislation because, first, it is retrospective in its effect, and second, it denies anyone affected the right to have their case resolved by a tribunal or court: It makes HMRC their sole judge, jury and executioner.\nI have constituents who came to me for help, insisting that they declared all their affairs properly at the time and believed they had paid the tax that was due. HMRC didn’t challenge them or raise any question about what they had clearly set out in their tax returns. Then, using the power to re-open closed tax years retrospectively, HMRC has presented them with demands that they just cannot comprehend, against which they have no right of appeal.\nTheir lives are in turmoil, and they stand to lose everything\nI wonder if it will take a TV drama to resolve",

I am glad that figure is now at around 90 per cent.\nI was strongly encouraged by the progress and agreements achieved at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. The Glasgow Pact calls on countries to accelerate efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power and phase out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, while providing targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable in line with national circumstances and recognising the need for support towards a just transition.\nFurthermore, the Glasgow Pact will speed up the pace of climate action. All countries agreed to revisit and strengthen their current emissions targets to 2030 in 2022. This will be combined with a yearly political roundtable to consider a global progress report and a Leaders summit in 2023.\nAs included in the plan, the UK will produce enough offshore wind to power every home, quadrupling how much we currently produce to 40GW by 2030, thereby supporting up to 60,000 jobs. The Government will work with industry and aim to generate 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 for industry, transport, power and homes. In addition, the Government aims to develop the first town heated entirely by hydrogen by the end of the decade. The UK will also become a world leader in carbon capture technology to store harmful emissions away from the atmosphere, with a target to remove 10MT of carbon dioxide by 2030, equivalent to all emission of the industrial Humber today, through £200 million investment. Finally, from £525 million investment in nuclear as a clean energy source this will develop the next generation of small and advanced reactors which could support 10,000 jobs.\nOther parts of the plan include a target to install 600,000 heat pumps every year by 2028, £1 billion funding to make our schools, hospitals and homes more energy efficient, planting 30,000 hectares of trees every year, promoting and investing in zero-emission transport and £20 million to develop clean maritime technology. The plan also includes a pledge to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030, while the sale of some hybrid cars and vans will continue until 2035.\nThis plan will mobilise £12 billion of Government investment to create and support 250,000 highly-skilled green jobs across the UK. It is expected to spur over three times as much private sector investment by 2030.\nThe Government’s Net Zero Strategy builds on the Ten Point Plan and sets out a clear path for the changes needed to secure our energy, create jobs and new industries, and end the UK’s contribution to climate change. The UK can rapidly cut carbon emissions, while creating new jobs, new technologies and future-proof industries that will generate economic growth for decades to come.\nDS.",

International law largely does not exist in that same sense. Instead it exists in treaties between consenting parties:\nWe won’t jump a red light only because we agreed that we wouldn’t.\nSome of these agreements have grievance procedures written into them in order to arbitrate when there is a dispute between the parties about an action by one of them which allegedly breaks a provision of the treaty.\nThe European Court of Justice has before it a long list of cases still to be settled involving proceedings against EU members. Whilst you can make it sound awesome by saying that the member states in question are alleged to have ‘broken international law’. The reality is that its an arbitration between signatories to an agreement.\nThe World Trade Organisation maintains a similar arbitration process for trade disputes between its members. It also has a long list of alleged infractions to settle. Call it ‘breaking international law’ if it sounds more exciting.\nThe Markets bill does not break our Withdrawal Agreement with the EU or alter its terms in any way.\nWhat it does is to empower the UK Government, after seeking further authority from Parliament, to alter the arrangements that we agreed in the treaty if we find we need to.\nSo, the Bill doesn’t breach the treaty arrangements of itself. Even if it becomes an act of Parliament it does not do so. The arrangements in the agreement will only be altered if the Government, having sought further authority from Parliament, were then to actually change the arrangements originally agreed.\nOnly then does the question arise: would we be breaking the terms of our agreement, or if you want to put it that way, would we be breaking international law?\nThe Government is taking these powers in response to a direct threat made by EU during the negotiations for a trade deal.\nIn order to persuade the UK to concede our interests they suggested that, if we did not do so and that the outcome was no deal, then they would use the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement to exclude UK mainland produce from Northern Ireland Markets.\nClearly, no UK Government could tolerate such action and it is essential that we arm ourselves with powers which act as a deterrent to prevent it ever happening.\nSuppose it did happen though and that we used the powers, would we have broken the agreement?\nNo, because by interpreting the treaty perversely and excluding UK goods from part of the UK – which was never the intent of the agreement, the EU would itself have broken the treaty, and our action would be self-defence.\nThe Lords, in seeking to remove our deterrent whilst we are still in the middle of negotiations, have shown their irresponsibility.\nBy equating the deterrent power with China’s treatment of Hong Kong and other enormities, they have shown that they have no sense of proportion either.\nShould we abolish them?\nWell, there is a frighteningly long list of priorities on the ‘to do’ list…but one day",

In doing so, we have established an expertise and leadership in the field. It has given us enhanced credibility at the UN and the ability to speak with real authority in the world. Along with our defence and diplomatic effort, it is a key part of the way we project our power and influence.\nPeople think we are spending too much. I once tried asking constituents in Ringwood how much of our income it is. The answers ranged from 10% to 30%, so I was able to tell them we had cut it to less than one percent!\nThink of it the other way around: we are keeping 99.3% of our income for ourselves. Do you know anyone who does that, indeed would you want to know them – would they have any friends?\nThe Daily Mail’s campaign against our overseas aid budget has run for over a year now. In recent months it has been joined by The Times. The stories about our aid being given to corrupt and profligate regimes, wasted on trivial projects like Ethiopian girl pop groups, or lavished on the salaries of consultants drives my correspondents into a state of apoplexy.\nOn detailed examination these stories turn out to be very different from what has been reported.\nOf course, we do spend in the poorest and most unstable places in the world, and it is no co-incidence that these tend to be the most corrupt and misgoverned countries, but we do not ‘give’ money to them. We pay by results for projects in health, education and economic development, and because we do not have an army of civil servants, we pay contractors from professional and experienced organisations to run those projects. The Daily Mail calls them ‘consultants’.\nOur international aid effort is undermined by waste and the perception of waste. I met the new Secretary of State last week to re-enforce the message that she needs to root out those things that might give rise to that perception. Before she got the job of running the International Development department, she was on record as wanting to abolish it and replace it with a trade department.\nWell, she is quite right in her priority: Trade dwarfs aid. If we can only get poor countries better access to the world’s trading system then they will earn vastly more. That is why our international aid programme spends about £1 billion per year facilitating and improving trade.\nAt the last election UKIP proposed we cut the budget from the current £12 billion to £4 billion and concentrate just on humanitarian relief and the inoculation effort to prevent disease. These are important, but we would lose the much more important work in economic development that is so vital to our national interest. Millions are on the move in pursuit of better lives and livelihoods. Over the next decade the world needs 600 million new jobs if we are to avoid a growing army of under-employed, frustrated, desperate and angry young people. It is therefore vital that we invest in economic development and prosperity in their countries. In the end, it is all about jobs. This has to be our main effort, because if we do not, we know where all the consequent problems are going to end up being exported to.\nIn the modern world you cannot – like an ostrich with its head in the sand – isolate yourself from global reality.\nDevelopment aid is not charity. We spend it in our national interest so we can trade and prosper in a stable and safer world.",

I get some pretty frightful emails but they’re rare. Overwhelmingly, my correspondents can disagree politely and sensibly, no matter how outraged they are at the pace and direction of Brexit.\nI know parliamentary colleagues who have been threatened with violence, but I had no such encounters.\nOn the contrary, people tend to sympathetic and understanding, I think they feel sorry for me having to endlessly repeat the same debate.\nI think it was in Joseph Conrad’s novel Victory that he observes that ‘pity’ is the supreme form of contempt!\nWhy the PM Must Leave\nI wonder if Gavin Williamson, sacked by the PM after accusations of leaking confidential discussions, ever reflects on what I told him in July 2016 when he came seeking my support for Mrs May’s leadership bid: that he had taken leave of his senses and that, in my estimate, she’d be a disaster. (I had twice tried to persuade David Cameron to dispense with her services).\nOnce she became leader however, I began to re-appraise her. She was decisive, resolute, and said all the right things about BREXIT. It wasn’t until the general election campaign of 2017, that all my previous misgivings about her judgement and her style resurfaced.\nIt is true that she has been given the most difficult and controversial task of any post-war Prime Minister, and without a parliamentary majority with which to achieve it. She has shown extraordinary determination and resilience in the face of repeated setbacks.\nNevertheless, a complete horlicks has been made of the enterprise. The measure of it rubbed-in by last week’s screening of BBC’s BREXIT Behind Closed Doors.\nThe fact that we can even treat as credible the report that Olly Robbins, the PM’s trusted negotiator, asked Guy Verhofstadt -the BREXIT lead for the EU Parliament- if he could get a Belgian Passport after it’s all over, is a measure of our humiliation and the chaotic way in which the negotiations have been handled.\nThe PM assured Parliament over 100 times that we would leave the EU in March of this year. The failure to deliver that fundamental aim of policy must come with consequences.\nStay with me, this is complicated:\nThe principal difficulty with the PM’s withdrawal agreement is the ‘backstop’ which keeps in the UK in a form of limbo at the end of our transition period after leaving the EU, if a solution to the Irish border question has not been found.\nMuch work was done to identify such a solution in an exercise that came to be known as the ‘Malthouse Compromise’ and subsequently a parliamentary motion was passed known as the ‘Brady amendment’ which required the PM to return to the negotiations, re-open the withdrawal agreement and substitute the arrangements identified by the Malthouse compromise.\nA great deal of effort was also put in to persuade the EU negotiators that the arrangements set out in the Malthouse Compromise were workable using existing procedures and technology. They must have been impressed because, when for a short while, it did appear that the UK might actually leave the EU in March without a deal, Mr Barnier announced that, even were that to happen, there wouldn’t be a hard border in Ireland because the EU would rely on ‘other arrangements’.\nSo what became of the parliamentary instruction that our negotiators re-open the agreement and substitute Malthouse for the backstop?\nWe discover from the EU Commission that the UK negotiators never even asked.\nWhat Next?\nIn June 2016 the British people voted to leave the EU, but in May 2017 they elected a parliament without a majority.\nIt was always going to be a very tall order for a hung parliament to accomplish the most controversial and complicated agenda in a generation. I am not surprised that, thus far, it has failed to do so.\nAfter the drubbing that both the main parties have just taken\nin the local elections, It strikes me that there are three possibilities as to\nwhat happens next with Brexit:\nFirst, nothing changes, and the parties take no notice of the evident\nfrustration of the voters expressed in the results of last Thursdays polls, by\ncontinuing to reject every compromise, save only that they have voted to\nprevent departure from the EU without any agreement (which, perversely, appears\nto be the most popular option among voters -if my correspondence is any guide).\nSecond, that the EU loses patience and just throws us out at\ntheir next opportunity, Halloween.\nI know that to many this is highly desirable, because it achieves the no-agreement\noutcome above, which Parliament has refused to deliver. In my estimate however,\nit is the most unlikely outcome: We are the EU’s second largest financial\ncontributor, and all that money is surely worth the minor irritation of our\ncontinuing indecision.\nThird, the Government, together with sufficient numbers of opposition MPs,\nencouraged by the sobering effect of the local election results, decide to\nunite around a compromise BREXIT.\nThis will involve a measure of re-alignment: some will brand it as ‘BREXIT in\nname only’ (BRINO) and peel off to join Farage’s BREXIT Party, whilst others,\nopposed to any departure without a further referendum, will join the new Change Britain Party.\nThis third, and most likely of the possibilities, will\ninvolve leaving the EU politically whilst hanging on in there in some form\neconomically. It is bound to mean some close accommodation with the EU customs\nunion and internal market.\nThat isn’t what I want, or what I voted for, but in the hung parliament\ndelivered by the voters in May 2017 it’s probably the best I can get.\nThe opportunity to leave the EU only comers round once every 46 years, I cannot allow it to be fumbled, and lost.\nCould the British people live with it?\nSome, like me, I would be disappointed, but I suspect they would shrug and continue with their busy lives and other priorities. After all, for years they used to say to me “we were hoodwinked in 1975, we were sold a ‘common market’ but it turned out to be a super- state”\nDoes that mean that, shorn of involvement in the super-state and its political institutions, they could live with the EU’s economics?\nThe Climate and Super-glue\nI’m not an enthusiast for pupils taking ‘strike action’\nat school, after all, it might become habit- forming.\nEqually, it will have been\nmiserable if you were one of the thousands of drivers that got stuck in traffic\njams caused by Extinction Rebellion.\nNevertheless, the climate change debate\nhas taken centre stage for a few days – despite BREXIT.\nThe UK was first country to introduce legally binding\nlong-term emissions targets under our landmark Climate Change Act in 2008. The\nact requires us to achieve a 57% reduction in emissions by 2032 from the levels\nin 1990. So far, we’ve cut 42% at the same time as the economy grew by over\n70%: So, we’ve decarbonised our economy at a faster rate than any other rich\ncountry. The last time the UKs emissions were this low was in 1890.\nIf we are to meet our latest target of at least 80%\nreduction in emissions by 2050 however, then we are going to have to raise our game still further. In response the\nGovernment has set out a comprehensive plan for the whole economy in the Clean Growth Strategy published in\nOctober 2017.\nThe publication of the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has raised the question as to whether any of this is nearly enough, and consequently the Government is now awaiting advice this week from the Committee on Climate Change on how to move to a ‘Net-Zero’ emissions target.\nLast week Opposition MPs were demanding a guarantee to implement these recommendations -whatever they may be. I think it’s more sensible to wait just a few more days and see what the recommendations actually are, then think how we can implement them effectively.\nI was told that the total of all our emissions going back to 1900 are equivalent to just one year’s emissions from modern China -I haven’t ‘fact-checked’ this, and it may be complete nonsense, but it makes the point that this is a planetary issue requiring an international response. It will be no good for the climate, or for Britain, if we cut our own emissions whilst they are more than made up for by increases from elsewhere.\nWe need to use the UK’s leadership to drive forward the climate agenda at the united Nations.\nWe’ve played an important role in establishing the Paris Agreement of 2015, and in the subsequent detailed work to implement it.\nIn this respect our International Development budget has been a vital component in establishing our leadership: we are the world’s second largest donor, and we are providing developing countries with £6 billion in the current spending round as ‘climate finance’ to help them cut their own emissions and to invest in resilience against the impact of climate changes that are already adversely affecting them.\nAll of this effort, of course, was well underway before pupils abandoned their classrooms to protest, or their parents and teachers glued themselves to Waterloo Bridge, but if it helps…\nAnother referendum?\nNormally anything one says in the House of Commons is a\npretty well-kept secret. Last week however, a remark of mine got into the\npublic domain and has prompted some outraged email correspondence.\nIn response to repeated demands from the Opposition benches for a second\nreferendum in order to reunite the nation, I observed that anyone who thinks\nthat another referendum will bring the nation back together must have been on\nanother planet during the last one.\nOverwhelmingly, the expressed preference of my\ncorrespondents is for us just to leave the EU without further agreement, and the\nsooner the better.\nNevertheless, even if some way behind, the second most popular view expressed\nto me is that there should indeed be a second referendum to settle the matter.\nI have always taken the view that the terms on which the last referendum was offered was that it was to be a ‘once in a generation’ opportunity to settle the question of EU membership.\nTo return to the same question in another referendum before we’ve even implemented the decision of the last one, would fundamentally undermine any residual faith in democracy.\nIf it were clear however, that the British people repented of their decision to leave the EU, even before we’ve left, then any democrat must accept that voters have a right to change their minds.\nOurs is not a democracy that offers one person one vote -but only once! (much in the manner as did so many of our newly independent former colonies which ended up with ‘presidents for life’).\nMy own estimate however, is that opinion remains as divided as it was when we held our referendum in 2016 and therefore, the case for repeating it remains unconvincing.\nA principal demand from opposition MPs is that, if the Government’s EU withdrawal agreement were to be passed by Parliament, then the negotiations with the EU which will then commence to define the terms of our future trading relation with the EU, should themselves be followed by a ‘confirmatory referendum’ on the question of whether to implement the newly negotiated trading relationship, or just to stay in the EU after all.\nApart from the fact that this would just be exasperating. It\nisn’t what we agreed to: we never suggested in the original Referendum Act,\nthat we would have two referendums, one to decide in principle to leave, and\nthen a second when the terms of a future relationship with the EU had been\nfinalised. And the reason that we never decided to go about it that way should be\nblindingly obvious:\nThe starting point is that the EU doesn’t want us to leave. (We are the second\nlargest net financial contributor).\nIf we present the EU with the finality of a decision to leave, then it is in\ntheir interests to negotiate a future relationship in our mutual best\ninterests.\nIf however, the question of our leaving remains an open one whilst we negotiate\nthe future relationship, then the EU strategy must be to get us to change our\nmind by making the future relationship as undesirable as possible.\nA confirmatory referendum completely undermines our negotiating position for the future relationship; in just the same way as taking no-deal off the table undermined our negotiating position for the withdrawal agreement.\nBREXIT Sitrep 4th April\nAs I have previously observed, the essential problem stems from the PM’s defeat at the election of 2017. Without a significant majority, which is what she sought when she called the election, there was little chance of getting the clean BREXIT that she set out in her Lancaster House and Florence speeches and in her election manifesto.\nYet the PM continued to raise our expectations by using the same rhetoric about leaving on 29th March and ‘no deal’ being better than a ‘bad deal’, despite the reality of the parliamentary arithmetic.\nEncouraged by this perceived guarantee the majority of my correspondents continue to demand that we leave without a deal. Parliament demonstrated its unwillingness to allow a no-deal Brexit in three votes earlier this year and now it has changed the law to prevent it.\nAccordingly, the only chance of a no-deal BREXIT now, is if one of the 27 EU member states refuses the application for a further extension of our membership which the law now requires the Government to make.\nWeeks ago, when the Government still had freedom of action, I did urge the PM to consider proroguing this REMAIN Parliament to prevent it stopping her from leaving the EU. It is now too late to close that stable door.\nTo be honest I didn’t expect my advice to be taken. It is very difficult in a parliamentary democracy, to just prorogue parliament and govern without it, it is after all exactly what King Charles the First did, and it didn’t end well.\nUnable to get a majority for her ‘high risk’ agreement (I voted for it despite that risk, because I thought the risk of not leaving the EU at all was even greater), the PM has now reached out to find common ground with the Leader of The Opposition, to my dismay and that of my colleagues.\nLabour brings two demands to the table.\nFirst they want a ‘confirmatory referendum’ which is just a euphemism for overturning the result of the last one. Anyone who believes that another referendum is a way of healing the division within our nation, was clearly on another planet during the last one.\nThe second demand is that we agree a permanent customs union (which is the essential core of the EU) and means that our trade policy will be governed by the EU. Mr Corbyn believes that new inclusive arrangements can be negotiated to give us a say, this is nonsense: the EU treaties specifically exclude any such possibility.\nThe problem with a customs union is that it is all give and no take. We would literally be traded: The EU would be at liberty to make trade agreements with third countries where access to our market was part of the deal, but with no reciprocal access for us to that of the third country. We would subsequently need to try and negotiate that access bilaterally with the third country, but what could we offer, and why would they negotiate? -already having free access to the UK market.\n‘Vassal state’ hardly does justice to such a status. We would have forfeited the principal economic benefit of BREXIT.\nCould I vote for such a shadow of BREXIT?\nOnly, if it is a question of that, or no BREXIT at all.\nIf we remain in the EU the ratchet of ever greater political and economic integration will continue relentlessly as it always has done since we first joined.\nIf we leave however, the ratchet will work in the opposite direction: Political independence and a measure of economic freedom will be intoxicatingly liberating, and will inexorably lead to demands for more.\nEqually, without Mrs Thatcher’s rebate, with a requirement to join the Euro, to handover our waters once again, and re-join the Common Agricultural Policy, there would be no prospect of tempting us back.\nI am deeply distressed that we haven’t left already and that we face another prolonged extension with tortuous and deeply unsatisfactory negotiations.\nBREXIT will be a long haul, a process rather than an event, but the alternative is much, much worse.\nBREXIT Sitrep 29th March -God save Latvia?\nAt eleven o’clock last Friday night we should have been celebrating our departure from the EU. Instead I was fretting over the probability that we will lose the only opportunity in 46 years to return to the status of an independent nation.\nI\nvoted for the PM’s withdrawal agreement for the third time on Friday.\nNotwithstanding the risks that the agreement presents, and which I have\nexplored in this column previously, I believe that the risk of no BREXIT is\nsubstantially greater.\nWhat\nhappens now?\nEither we leave on 12 April without a deal,\nOr we apply for a further extension of Article 50 negotiations.\nThe EU has made it clear that any such extension will have to be a long one,\nprobably another two years, and no doubt other unwelcome -even humiliating-\nconditions may also be attached.\nOf these two alternatives, the bulk of my correspondents demand a no-deal BREXIT. I suppose it might happen by accident but the EU certainly doesn’t want it and Parliament has now voted several times against it. My estimate is that its likelihood is very small.\nSo,\nwe are probably looking at a long delay at best, and ultimately cancelling\nBREXIT altogether at worst.\nA long extension to Article 50 -whilst whatever Parliament now fixes upon is\nnegotiated- will, I believe, very probably lead to our remaining in the EU.\nWith every month that passes status of the decision of the 2016 referendum will\nerode.\nOur political establishment will deliberately seek to present us with\nalternatives that are so dreadful, that we may opt in the end, to stay.\n(Indeed, I suspect that this has been their plan all along).\nIf we opt instead for some variety of ‘soft’ BREXIT, we will face the prospect\nof becoming a vassal state, our laws and trade policy dictated by the EU,\nwithout our voice or vote. (Nevertheless, the very nature of that status might\ninexorably lead to the demand for it to be remedied. The process of escape\ncould conceivably continue).\nIf Parliament had accepted the PM’s deal despite all its shortcomings’, we would on 22nd May no longer have been a member of the EU and there would have been powerful correctives to any prospect of returning. We would have been free of the Common Agricultural Policy, free of the Fisheries Policy, and we would regain control of our borders. Anyone arguing for a return would have had to have persuade us to adopt the Euro, Schengen, and very much higher contributions without Mrs Thatcher’s rebate.\nIf we end up remaining however, the trauma of our failed escape attempt will make it very difficult indeed to persuade Parliament and people to give it another shot in our lifetime.\nThe only positive thing that I have to say, is that this isn’t over yet.\nAnd, hey, Latvia might veto the request to further extend Article 50.\nGod save Latvia!\nBrexit Sitrep 23/3/19\nIt is not clear whether the PM’s withdrawal agreement will be put to the Commons a third time next week. Soundings are still being taken to see if there is enough support to make it worthwhile.\n(what makes no difference to that decision was the Speaker’s ruling earlier this week, that the Government can’t bring back the same questions that have already been defeated.\nYes he’s right about that, but the rules of the Commons are for our convenience, and when they become inconvenient we simply set them aside, and we do that quite frequently.\nThe Government’s problem isn’t the Speaker, it’s the fact that it can’t get a majority for its motion. If it can get enough MPs to vote for its motion, then it will have no difficulty getting enough to set aside the Speaker’s ruling)\nI anticipate that Parliament will on Monday seize the legislative initiative and start putting different soft BREXIT options to the Commons. This has not happened in living memory so we are in completely uncharted territory.\nTaken together with the agreement to prolong our EU membership, I am beginning to get the feeling that dream of BREXIT, this once-in-46 year-opportunity, is slipping through our fingers.\nThe PM told the nation from Downing Street that she was on the side of the people trying to deliver BREXIT and thwarted in that endeavour by Parliament.\nIt is true that all her efforts and negotiations have been undermined by the fact that she has no majority.\nVoters share the PM’s frustration. They write to me all the time telling me so.\nI wonder what they expected when they elected a hung parliament, and a Prime Minister with no majority to deliver the BREXIT that they had voted for?\nThat said, the PM has the power to put herself on the side of the people and thwart her Remainer Parliament.\nParliament has voted to extend our EU membership and it has voted against a no-deal Brexit. These however, are merely expressions of parliamentary opinion, they don’t change the facts.\nAnd the fact remains that the law states that we leave on 29th March whatever.\nOnly the Government can introduce the statutory instrument to change the law and extend our EU membership. So, she has the power to leave the EU on 29th March –which she promised we would 108 times in Parliament- all she has to is withhold that statutory instrument this week.\nWill she?\nIs she really on the side of the people?\nActions speak louder than words.\nOn Cleaning the WC\nSchool budgets were protected from the reductions in government expenditure which were a stark necessity after the financial crisis and, to be fair, they had a pretty good run.\nNow the Schools’ budget is at a record high, but the growth in pupil numbers recently has been rising faster, with the result that the expenditure per pupil has fallen.\nNevertheless, we still spend more per pupil than any other of the G7 leading nations, with the exception of USA, so more than Germany, France and Japan.\nSo clearly, when a headmistress tells the BBC that things are so bad that she is having to clean the school lavatories herself, we have to ask ourselves what is going wrong?\nI asked exactly that question in the Commons when I raised the case with ministers.\nI was surprised later to read that the headmistress in question had received a £10,000 pay rise last year, and that the School cleaning budget had doubled from £30,000 to nearly £60,000.\nI do recall being equally surprised visiting a school, when I was met by the full-time ‘publicity officer’.\nCurrent SitRep 16/3/19\nConstituents keep emailing me to demand that we leave the EU on the 29 March without a deal\nBUT\nA no deal Brexit was rejected by the Commons on Wednesday\nAnd\nA extension beyond 29 March was carried on Thursday\nThe PM’s agreement is not ‘the deal’: that deal is still to be negotiated subsequently during the transition period.\nThe political declaration which accompanies the agreement could be translated into something enthusiastic Brexiteers might quite like, say Canada++, or it might turn out something very disagreeable like ‘Chequers’ or worse.\nWe don’t know: so, it’s a risk\nI have never been risk averse, but what makes me so nervous is that the nature of the agreement, with its up-front financial settlement, and it’s default ‘backstop’, puts UK in the weakest of negotiating positions, maximising the risks. That is why my initial assessment that it was a trap ‘went viral’\nWhat I have had to do is assess the risks inherent in the PM’s deal against the risks of our not leaving the EU at all.\nThere is no prospect of a no deal BREXIT in the current Parliament, the votes have already determined that.\nMy current assessment is that the risk of no BREXIT is greater than the risk of being trapped in a customs union with the EU consequent upon the PM’s agreement.\nOther ERG members and the DUP have, thus far, reached a different conclusion\nI will, of course, continue to listen and reflect.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 44\n- 45\n- 46\n- 47\n- 48\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",

This includes an additional 50,000 nurses added since the last election.\nIn Local terms the statistics are that Hampshire & Isle of Wight Clinical Commissioning board has been allocated £3.43 billion for 2024/25. In the Southampton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which serves most of my parliamentary constituency, there were 124 more full-time-equivalent doctors and 274 more nurses in September 2023 than there were in September 2022.\nI could go on, but all these statistics are all about inputs. What is of concern to patients is the outputs: the number of successful treatments and appointments. In this respect the NHS lags behind the performance of comparable healthcare systems in other wealthy nations where survival rates for many conditions are better and waiting times are shorter.\nWe kid ourselves with the mantra that we have the best healthcare system in the world. Were it so, it is surprising, that nowhere else in the World has anyone copied it.\nOver my time in Parliament, in opposition and in government, numerous clinicians have come to give me their insights about NHS. With few exceptions however, they have been short on remedies to fix the systemic problems that they identify.\nI am certain that politicians, irrespective of party, are amongst those least qualified to run the NHS.\nAccordingly, the whole thrust of Policy from 2010 was to take the politics out of it through the creation of NHS England, a body largely independent of government. Let politicians determine how much the nation can afford to fund the NHS, but let the professionals run it.\nAlas, such is the nature of our politics that whatever goes wrong in the NHS, ministers will get the blame. Increasingly they now find that, despite being blamed, they have few levers to pull -having handed so much of the power over to NHS England.\nSymptomatic of our political focus, in Parliament I find that every week I am inundated with invitations to attend meetings and receptions organised by all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs) campaigning for more NHS resource for their own particular disease (there is such an APPG for every known medical condition, perhaps with the exception of rigor mortis). Badgering politicians is no way to determine clinical priorities.\nAs to my own remedy, I think the NHS is far too big to be manageable – it’s the world’s largest employer, its culture is too bureaucratic and too centralised, it needs to be broken up and made much more locally accountable; it must become much more flexible and nimble in using the private sector.\nWes Streeting, Labour’s Shadow Secretary of state says he won’t let ‘middle class lefties’ interfere with his own plans to make use of the private sector… Well, good luck with that.",

They won the day and we have watched the slaughter from the side lines ever since. As a consequence of the decision to do nothing, hundreds of thousands have died, our allies in the region have been destabilised by the presence of 4 million refugees, and a million refugees have fled to Europe; the dreadful regimes in Iran and Russia are in the ascendant.\nEven before that fateful vote at the end of August 2013, much of the damage had already been done. From the very outset of the rebellion we supported the objectives of Assad’s moderate opponents – the Free Syrian Army, but we refused to arm them. Consequently the opposition to Assad’s murderous regime became increasingly dominated by the better armed Islamist militias.\nNow it is too late. Assad, his Russian and Iranian allies are triumphant. The prospects for Syria and the entire region are frightful. This is a mistake we have made before. After the first Gulf war, when Saddam’s Shia subjects in southern Iraq rose in rebellion, we stood aside while he massacred them, with consequences that lasted a generation, and continue.\nThe consequences of what we have now allowed to happen in Syria will also reverberate for a generation, that’s if we are lucky.",

Well, it must have been a very thin day for news and they do use the term ‘professor’ very much more loosely than we do in the UK. Nevertheless, I was on a lecture tour of US universities, corporations and business organisations and the following morning I addressed a business breakfast at 7 AM, where most of the attendees had come from work, having already started an hour earlier -that’s productivity.\nIt is some now time since I passed myself off as an economist, but the facts of economic life are blindingly obvious. I am a member of the House of Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee and we recently produced a report, the Future of Work. Select Committees are encouraged to reach their conclusions by consensus from the evidence presented to them during an inquiry. I’ve never been persuaded that consensus is a virtue: It is often the lowest common denominator and gives rise to some rather bland conclusions. On this occasion however, we couldn’t reach a consensus and voted on party lines not to include a recommendation on UBI within the report.\nNo matter how slight your acquaintance with the science of economics, UBI -the provision of a universal basic income, has got to be amongst the daftest of ideas. That it has attractions, I have no doubt: I’ve spoken to lots of furloughed employees who, despite having only 80% of their income (compensated somewhat by no longer having commuting costs) have rather enjoyed being paid to stay at home without having to work at all.\nEven Lenin insisted that “He who does not work shall not eat”. Who on earth would work if they were provided with an income that enabled them not to have to?\nThe argument advanced in favour of UBI is that it would not stop us from working but would provide a level of security against the possibility of a reduction in our earned income. But that is exactly what Universal Credit is there for. The difference is that UBI is to be paid to absolutely everyone where Universal Credit is only paid to those in need. It shouldn’t take an economics professor to spot that paying an income to absolutely everyone irrespective of their need, will mean you will have very much less available to concentrate on those who really are in need. Either that, or you tax everyone into to penury. .\nThey’d have understood this at breakfast in Jonesboro, even if they don’t in some parts of the Houser of Commons.",

I thought long and hard about this question before deciding to throw in my lot with Vote Leave. The prospect of de-stabilising Europe further at a time when there is already a currency crisis, a migration crisis, and the Russian bear menacing Ukraine, troubled me deeply.\nFrom this international perspective there may have been a more opportune time to hold our referendum, but the time is now, and it may not come again for a generation, or indeed ever.\nI accept that we have a responsibility and a duty to Europe as a European power. Our history and culture is deeply intertwined with the European mainland, and I would not wish it otherwise. I have concluded however, that our duty to Europe is best served by leaving the EU.\nI believe that the EU is on a disastrous path of increased integration. It is attempting to create a country called Europe with all the trappings of a nation state: a government (the Commission); its own parliament; a supreme court (the ECJ); its own currency; a flag; and a national anthem (Beethoven’s Ode to Joy). Whilst support for the economic benefits of the EU are much more widely perceived on the continent than in the UK, this political process is being driven by the elites and has very little popular support. Far from creating harmony amongst nations, it is actually generating the very opposite. One need only travel to Greece to feel the palpable and deeply distasteful anti- German sentiment. I have sympathy for both the Greeks and the Germans –it is, after all, the institutional processes of the EU that are driving them asunder.\nWhen they have been given the democratic opportunity to do so, Europeans have voted to halt this process. In April 2005 the French voted in a referendum to reject the European Constitutional Treaty by 55% to 45%. A week later the Dutch rejected it by an even greater margin of 62% to 38%. Never the less, the constitution was ratified as the Treaty of Lisbon a without letting the French or Dutch have another chance. When will they understand that ‘No’ really means No?\nThe departure of the UK – one of the largest economies, largest financial contributors, a world power with a seat at the UN Security Council and the world’s 4th largest defence budget – will be, I believe, such a profound shock to the process of European integration as to halt it in its tracks. The best thing we can do to rescue the Europe from its current disastrous course is to vote to leave the EU on 23 June!",

Compulsion or coercion plays into the fears of those people and communities that are suspicious of the state and its motives.\nNevertheless, apparently a Covid passport scheme is working without controversy in Israel.\nThere is a key difference between them and us however, for reasons of national security Israeli’s are used to carrying ID and having it checked regularly. That is not our tradition.\nIn any event, I understand that there isn’t much checking going on because the take-up of the vaccine is proceeding so satisfactorily that there really isn’t a need for checks. -everyone’s having it.\nPerhaps, that is our government’s real motive: a ruse to persuade the reluctant and to achieve almost universal take-up with the mere threat of huge inconvenience otherwise. If successful, this strategy would avoid actually having to implement the scheme, the threat having done the trick.\nOr perhaps, over the last year, ministers have acquired such a taste for control over every aspect of our lives and are reluctant to release their grip, perhaps they really do want a check-point society.\nWe’ll soon see which it is.",

There was no Common Fisheries Policy before we joined; they saw us coming, and created a policy to plunder our waters. It was considered as a price worth paying by the government of Edward Heath.\nSecond, there is something deeply symbolic about regaining control of our territorial waters as a great maritime nation, and to put it off is to put in doubt our will to ‘take back control’.\nWhich brings us to the issue of only a further 21 months.\nGiven past experience, such is our mistrust of our partners that we suspect that 21 month window will offer them the opportunity to alter arrangements with other coastal states like Norway and Iceland, that will bind and constrain us well beyond the 21 months.\nAlso, because in the past access to our waters has been offered up as a bargaining chip to secure greater economic prizes, the concession of a further 21 months is seen as a worrying sign that the habit may persist.\nOnly time will tell.",

The removal of all the restrictions in July was a great liberation, but the potential for a return -set out in the Government’s plan B, with mandatory masking included- is most unwelcome.\nAs an Army officer training for chemical warfare, I was instructed that once I had ordered troops to mask-up, I then had to look for the first opportunity to un-mask, because masking led to physical deterioration in effectiveness and psychological disorientation -a growing sense of isolation. Of course, the military respirator we used was much worse than the Covid face coverings, yet people do tell me that they feel that sense of isolation and anxiety, that they find it sinister seeing so many people masked, as social beings facial expression is one of the subtle ways we communicate.\nIn Parliament there is definitely something political about masks: In a crowded House of Commons at Prime Minister’s Questions there won’t be an unmasked face on the Labour benches, whereas on the Conservative side there will be only be half-a-dozen masked faces at most.\nHad it not actually happened, I would never have believed that a Conservative government would order us to wear masks and introduce fines for those who disobeyed: how very un-British.\nThat extraordinary intrusion into our personal choices took place when the lockdown was over; we had survived the first wave without the NHS being overwhelmed; all the shops were open again; then -out of the blue- came this order to mask-up without any prior parliamentary debate or vote.\nFor years the World Health Organisation assessment was that masks were ineffective at preventing the spread of disease. Then that advice conveniently changed overnight just when governments were looking for new tools to change normal social behaviour, as enforced lockdowns were coming to an end.\nWhen our government announced its new masking rules, that very evening at the daily televised briefing, the Deputy Chief Medical officer gave the game away: She was asked for the scientific evidence to support the new policy on masks; her reply was that it was not a matter of evidence but of providing ‘reassurance’.\nSo, having so successfully terrified us with the dangers of the virus, they then had to find something make us feel safe enough to go back out into the everyday world but at the same time to provide an ‘in-your-face’ reminder not to indulge in too much ordinary social intercourse.\nIt these respects masks do work: There is no doubt many people are reassured by wearing them and by finding others wearing them. Equally, they do provide a highly visible and constant reminder to behave differently to normal: They are a means of social control.\nI doubt however, that masks prevent the spread of disease. This is not question for medical expertise: Just think of it from an engineering point of view; the mesh that makes up the material with which you cover your face contains microscopic holes that are 5000 times larger than the virus which can pass through them. They can only have the most marginal effect. I suppose that ‘every little helps’ , but then consider the habit people have of constantly fiddling with them – completely undermining the original advice we were given to wash our hands and keep them away from our faces. Add to this mix the fact that so many of us wear the same mask again and again.\nIn the end it is a matter of opinion, and everyone is entitled to their own.

Alas, that didn’t work either.\nI could feel my temperature rising as the Incredible Hulk within roused himself: “Don’t make me angry; you really won’t like it when I’m angry”\nNothing else for it, despite it still technically being Lent, I reached for the brandy.\nI voted against these regulations, but I took the trouble to read them first, and I am confident that the police exceeded their powers.\nActs of public worship in church are specifically permitted. There is no limit set upon the numbers attending, clearly that will depend on the size and layout of the church. The regulations place the duty of conducting a risk assessment upon the church authorities, not upon the police.\nPolice say members of the congregation were unmasked, the church authorities say that they were properly wearing face coverings.\nThe police say that they weren’t sufficiently physically distanced from one another, the church authorities say that, on the contrary, they were.\nFor God’s sake this was a sober and indeed very sombre church service, not some illegal rave!\nI disapproved of the regulations, that’s why I voted against them, but we live in a democracy and I was on the losing side, so we have to live by them.\nNevertheless, throughout the last year I’ve seen repeated instances of the regulations being confused with mere government guidance. That guidance is not the law and must not be enforced as such. Whether the confusion of the two is through ignorance or is deliberate policy, is difficult to tell. In any event, I have seen law abiding citizens being ordered to leave public places quite improperly. I’ve seen officers telling citizens that they were only entitled to go out for exercise once, for an hour each day -which is completely untrue: The regulations place no limit on the duration or the frequency of exercise. The officer was seeking to enforce government guidance not the law.\nGovernment guidance is no more than the opinion of ministers, if the police are charged with enforcing it, then we have abandoned the Rule of Law and become no more than a police state.\nMy anger was not so much aroused by the enormity of two rogue police officers interfering with a church service on a most Holy occasion, as with our nation collectively: we have accepted this situation with such little protest, or even interest.\nBenjamin Franklin said: “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.”",

Ministers are committed to building on our strong track record on animal welfare.\nIn the King’s Speech, the Government announced the Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Bill, which will ban the export of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses for slaughter and fattening from Great Britain, stopping unnecessary stress, exhaustion and injury caused by exporting live animals. This Bill will ensure that animals are slaughtered domestically in high welfare slaughterhouses in the UK, reinforcing the UK’s position as a world leader on animal welfare.\nRegarding puppy smuggling, the UK has one of the most rigorous pet travel border checking regimes in the world and every dog travelling into Great Britain on approved routes has its microchip and paperwork checked to make sure they are all properly vaccinated and are old enough to travel. The Government has said that it will ban the imports of young, heavily pregnant or mutilated dogs and it would be supportive of legislating to ban this through a single-issue Bill when parliamentary time allows.\nFurther, mindful of the challenges the sectors are facing, Ministers do not consider the time is right to consult on cage reforms. However, the market is already driving the move away from using cages for laying hen production. In addition, the Government’s animal welfare priorities for its Animal Health and Welfare Pathway include supporting producers to transition away from confinement systems.\nOn food labelling for animal welfare, Ministers want to make it easier for consumers to purchase food that aligns with their values, by improving transparency and providing the industry with a level playing field to promote such products. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) intends to work with the industry to explore how to harness the market to improve food information for consumers and raise animal welfare standards.\nIn 2021, Defra carried out a call for evidence on the fur trade in Great Britain. Defra continues to build an evidence base on the fur sector, which will be used to inform any future action on the fur trade. This includes commissioning the Animal Welfare Committee to explore current responsible sourcing practices in the fur industry.\nFinally, in May, the Prime Minister set out the Government’s six principles to ensure that British farming is at the heart of British trade. One of these principles included seeking to advance international co-operation on animal welfare and to promote high welfare standards. The UK will safeguard its ability to maintain high animal welfare, environmental and food standards in new trade agreements.\nDS",

Mr Corbyn was proposing to spend these sums, to build a socialist economy, when we were already at full employment; they would have resulted in crowding-out private productive investment, enormous inflationary pressures, and a ballooning trade deficit.\nThe Government’s response is at the other end of an economic cycle which has turned dramatically due to the virus: The purpose is to stave off a massive deflation and unemployment. This response is borne of necessity and the focus is on income replacement – what economists used to call the ‘automatic stabilisers’, to prevent the complete collapse of demand within the economy. It’s Pure Keynesian economics.\nIn one sense, I suppose, they are the same. All Government expenditure, however motivated, ends in the same way: The Government’s borrowing will have to be repaid; and we will all be repaying it in our taxes for a very long time.\nJohn Maynard Keynes, when asked about the impact of his prescriptions in the long run, retorted that ‘in the long run we are all dead anyway’.\nBUT the whole purpose of our policy is to survive, beat the virus, and live longer.

The UK is going far beyond other countries in terms of our 2030 decarbonisation target and the transition to clean energy, delivering tangible progress while bringing down energy bills.\nFurther, the Government is going further for both households and investors by embracing new green industries.

The UK played an instrumental role in a new global agreement for nature at the UN nature summit COP15 in December 2022.

Rather, she was seeking to identify where I stood on the question of ‘trans rights’ which has produced so much confusion and obfuscation from front-line politicians when that question has been put to them recently.\nI am relieved that the Prime Minister has now brought some robust common sense to the matter.\nThere is nothing new about transgender issues. It is as old as human experience. As for it becoming a matter of public discussion and interest, I remember reading Jan Morris’s book Conundrum about her own experience, when it was first published way back in 1974.\nPersonally, I don’t have a problem with people, who are uncomfortable with their biological sex, identifying as the opposite gender. It does me no harm to me and it isn’t my business to enquire after the personal choices of others: live and let live.\nThere is a proper distinction to be drawn however, when it comes to a man who identifies a woman, yet retains his male genitals, being admitted to exclusive female facilities such as changing rooms, toilets, hospital wards, and even prisons. I find it difficult to comprehend that some people even question this, let alone mercilessly persecute female academics and authors who have sought to protect these exclusive biologically female spaces.\nNow let’s come to the question of ‘conversion therapies’: There is little disagreement that the more cruel and brutal parts of conversion therapy should be banned, indeed current legislation already outlaws the more egregious aspects. There are important interventions however, that need to be thoroughly explored and which must not be caught by the ‘chilling effect’ of ill-defined and poorly thought through legislation. It is crucial that teenagers with gender dysphoria receive support from medical and psychological professionals before they take irrevocable decisions about a transition, which they might later regret. This is not attempted conversion, but merely investigating the causes of gender dysphoria, which can be numerous and complex.\nThere are particular concerns about the exposure of children to radically progressive ideas concerning sex and gender. We must avoid heading down a road where a generation of young people are taught to think that it is normal to transition to a different gender before becoming an adult.\nFinally, Women have been fighting for decades for their sport to achieve the same status and prize money as men, yet we now find ourselves in a situation where biological males can announce themselves to be female and proceed to blow their biologically female opponents out of the water. This is ridiculous. Biological men should compete with biological men and biological women with biological women. A compromise might be to create transgender events where those who have transitioned are able to compete against each other on a level playing field, rather than denying those who have been training for an event their whole lives a fair shot at glory.",

The wretched Privilege Committee report wasn’t published until yesterday (Thursday) and the debate on its contents isn’t until Monday…Talk about jumping the gun.\nAnyway, this column cannot always lead on the top items on the political agenda because its primary purpose is to provide an article for publication in the Forest Journal. They require the copy on a Monday morning, for publication the following Thursday. Were I always to lead on the headline news events, whatever I wrote would, more often than not, be overtaken as the story moved on.\nIn any event, a few moments use of the search facility on this website will reveal any number of previous posts setting out my views on ‘partygate’.\nI remember well the moment that Boris first told the Commons that there were no parties and that rules were not broken. That instant a shudder went down my spine because of the seriousness with which misleading the Commons is treated. Not that I believed that he was lying. Rather, I had no doubt that what he considered a ‘party’ would differ from most people’s definition, and that he would have a more flexible approach what constitutes obedience to rules.\nI was prepared to vote against the formation of the Privileges Committee Inquiry. I believed that Sue Gray’s report was sufficient and that it largely exonerated the PM (as I said in this column at the time). Indeed, I was required by a three-line whip to vote against the Committee’s formation. Then, halfway through the afternoon we were stood down. I went to the Whips Office to remonstrate with the Deputy Chief Whip, Chris Pincher (remember him?). I asked how he now planned to vote. He said he would either abstain or vote for the Committee. So, I left in disgust. In the event, the motion was unopposed.\nSubsequently, when Boris resigned as PM, I thought the Committee should discontinue its work. I took the view that being slung out of Downing Street was punishment enough.\nNow the Committee has produced its full forensic analysis, I will take the trouble to read it in full and to listen to Monday’s debate before finally deciding.\nNevertheless, I do have concerns about the fairness of the Committees proceedings. And my prejudice is that the whole process is redundant, having already achieved its end, namely the removal of Boris from Parliament. Boris, having been shown the tenor of the report, resigned: he has already gone. So, why take a vote on suspending him for a mere 90 days?\nThe only residual sanction is to deny him a former member’s pass, which seems to me rather ‘petty’.\nA number of constituents have emailed to denounce the ‘Blob’, the ‘Remainers’, ‘the Deep State’ and any number of other suspects for their conspiracy to destroy our unblemished hero, Boris.\nI have no doubt that there are many who are rubbing their hands with glee as they enjoy Boris’s fate.\nBut I am also confident that even if there was a conspiracy, which I very much doubt, it achieved nothing: Boris’s downfall was entirely of his own making.\nGiven his achievements of breaking the deadlock over Brexit, seeing off the pandemic, and marshalling the response to the invasion of Ukraine, it is a great shame but he has only himself to blame",

This makes us third in the EU in terms of the numbers that we have accommodated, accounting for 15% of all claims from unaccompanied children in the EU.\nIn the year ending September 2019, 6,035 family reunion visas were issued to children and partners of those granted humanitarian protection or refugee status in the UK.\nThere is no intention for this to change following the UK’s exit from the EU. The Prime Minister has made it clear that we intend to ensure that unaccompanied children who are seeking international protection in an EU Member State can continue to be reunited with family members who are here, as well as children here in the UK with family in the EU. This is a negotiating objective of the Government for our future relationship with the EU.\nThe purpose of the bill now in Parliament is to give parliamentary approval to the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU which we signed up to in October last year, not to determine the future relationship which is still to be negotiated and agreed.\nThe misery of the last Parliament was that, the absence a Government majority enabled MPs to use any bill as a ‘Christmas tree’ on which to hang any number of obligations that would tie the Government’s hands in future EU negotiations. The current bill reverses that: it simply approves the agreement we’ve already made, and lets the Government get on with negotiating our future relationship unfettered by any imposed parliamentary negotiating mandate.\nIt is for this reason that the amendments supported by my email correspondents were so inappropriate.\nTo say that MP’s voted against refugee children being reunited with relatives living in the UK is just utter nonsense. We didn’t. The UK will continue to be one of most generous and accommodating European nations in our acceptance of refugee children.",

The Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill, which is making its way through Parliament, enshrines the recognition that animals are sentient in domestic law. It also creates a proportionate accountability mechanism to help reassure that central government policymaking takes this into account.\nThe Bill will create an Animal Sentience Committee with experts which will produce reports on how well policy decisions have paid all due regard to the welfare of animals. The relevant minister must then respond to reports via statements to Parliament. From now on, ministers will need to be ready to show that the needs of animals have been considered in relevant policy decisions.\nThese reforms will also underpin the Government’s Action Plan for Animal Welfare, which contains upwards of forty valuable reforms.

They exist both to scrutinise government performance, and to consider wider policy issues and strategy.\nThese chairmanships were, until 2010, essentially a stitch-up by the whips. The division of which party got the chairmanship of which committee was agreed by what is known colloquially as ‘the usual channels’ which means the respective whips offices. Once the chairmanships of the committees were divided up, the whips would simply appoint their own chosen candidate to fill each chairmanship role. This power of patronage was one of the ways in whips exerted party discipline: “keep your nose clean Comrade and follow the party line, and you will be rewarded with the chairmanship of the X select committee”\nThings have changed dramatically. The committees are still divided up by the ‘usual channels’ on the basis of a formula which determines how many each party gets. The convention is that the Public Accounts Committee will always be chaired by an opposition MP and that the Treasury Committee will always be chaired by an MP of the governing party. Beyond these two however, there will be a bit of horse trading to determine which Party gets to chair which committee.\nOnce that division is made, the candidate to chair each committee, is no longer appointed, but has to be elected. So, let’s say that the chairmanship of the Defence Committee has gone to the Conservatives and that the Chairmanship of Home Affairs has gone to Labour. Only Conservatives will be eligible to put themselves forward to chair Defence and only Labour MPs to chair Home Affairs; but every MP has as vote for each committee chairmanship, so the several Conservative MPs seeking to chair the Defence Committee will, in order to win, have to canvass for support among Labour MPs as well as their Conservative colleagues. The winning candidate is the choice of the whole House and not just of a political party.\nThis democratic process significantly enhances the status and independence of the select committee system. In doing so, it has shifted the balance of power between government and Parliament more towards Parliament, diminishing the influence of both government and opposition whips.",

Even if I am ultimately proved wrong in the sceptical stance that I have taken, I believe the questions that I asked, and which have remained largely unanswered, have been the right ones.\nCorrespondents tell me to be silent because that I am unqualified to comment on science. I am sensitive to the criticism because it is true: I never got beyond O levels in 1973, indeed I failed Chemistry (having caused mayhem in the practical by using a 5 molar solution of sulphuric acid rather than a .05 molar solution, or something like that anyway.

One evening, a delegation of students came to my dormitory to see if I had managed to solve the simultaneous equation with which they were all having such difficulty. They found me relaxing with Jane Austen’s Persuasion. I cast my eye over the equations and immediately came up with the solution. They looked at me in awe. I’ve never been able to account for it, perhaps just a complete fluke. In any event, it was to no purpose as I had decided that there had to be an easier way of making a living and was already planning my escape.)\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be led by experts. They need to make their method and their conclusions understandable and persuade us of their validity. We cannot have Doctor Heinz Kiosk ordering us about because he alone understands that it is for our own good. I fear that this is what has in fact happened throughout this pandemic. Ministers, against their natural inclinations, have followed advice to introduce restrictive measures with devastating consequences. I believe that they were ‘bounced’ by science and data-modelling that they did not understand and lacked the ability to establish its validity. That’s why I’ve advocated a competitive set of advisors to, at the very least, arm ministers with the right questions to ask.\nOf Course, I acknowledge the possibility that the authors of the latest dire warnings and lock-downs may turn out be right, but it is prudent to be sceptical. Acceptance and reluctance to challenge are the worst responses for a politician.\nThe temptation is to remain silent for fear of revealing ignorance. I remember attending a presentation by a think-tank recommended by David Cameron’s strategy guru, Steve Hilton. I went with Greg Clark, now Chairman of the Commons Science & Technology Select Committee, who has a brain the size of a planet. It was complete gobbledygook to me.

The critics need to consider carefully what the Prime Minister actually said, because their critiques so often attack something that he didn’t say. Mr Cameron made no general criticism of Muslims or their communities. On the contrary, his remarks were directed specifically and forensically. So, if the cap fits….\nWhat I have found very encouraging over the last year or so, is the growing strength of the reaction within Islam in opposition to the extremists. A fortnight ago UK parliamentarians were privileged to hear the Grand Mufti of Alhazar, the most prestigious seat of Sunni Islamic scholarship, lecture on the how the Ideology of the violent extremists is incompatible with the proper interpretation of Islam. There is now a determined, even evangelical, effort underway within our Muslim communities to challenge and reverse the influence of extremism.\nMinhaj-ul-Quran has just launched the first Islamic curriculum on peace and counter-terrorism and young Muslim activists are being trained to take on the extremist ideologies in their communities.\nWhat the Prime Minister was rightly drawing attention to, are those within Islam who, whilst not preaching violence themselves, never the less foster an environment where it can develop. I believe that this falls largely into two categories. First, those who place the blame for radicalisation squarely on the perceived injustice of our own foreign policy and its effects in Palestine, Iraq, and Afghanistan. By blaming Western interventions in the Middle East – however, fair, or unfairly – they take their eye off the growing cancer that is preaching another bout of hatred and death as the solution to all the region’s problems.\nSecond, those elements within Islam, whilst not themselves advocating violence as a remedy, never the less regard western values, including democracy, as inherently un-Islamic and therefore seek to seal off their communities from all the cultural influences to which our life-style exposes them. This gives rise to confusion about identity especially amongst the young, and creates the environment in which distrust and suspicion develops into hatred and violent intent.\nThe Prime Minister was entirely correct in pointing out that this conflict is within Islam, and a very small minority at that, even if its consequences are disproportionate and disastrous.\nThere is a very different analysis: I continue to receive internet inspired hate email which paints the rise of violent extremism as a war of all Muslims against Christianity, the so called clash of civilisations. This really is such utter nonsense and contrary all our experience. Whilst it is true that the consequences of the war in Syria, and its spill-over into Iraq, has been catastrophic for Christian minorities, its principal victims are fellow Muslims. This is a war within Islam. It is precisely for this reason that voices within Islam must be at the forefront of the effort to vanquish the ideology that promotes war and death as the vehicle for propagating religion. The Prime Minister was right to point out that those Muslims who are refusing to engage in this vital effort, are themselves complicit in the consequences that arise from their failure to do so.",

What has become clear, is that the necessary goodwill is absent and a dogmatic approach is being taken either to cut Northern Ireland off from UK exports or to tie us indefinitely to EU regulations.\nThe alternatives now are that we accept the isolation of the Province, or we accept indefinite continued observance of EU rules, or that we revoke the protocol and face down the EU fury and sanctions.\nOf course, there is always the remote possibility that peace and love may break out, seeing the Protocol sensibly and proportionately implemented.",

In effect, the Government has thrown down a challenge to its opponents.\nIn terms of the planned siting days that will now be lost, the three days in question are hardly worth the fuss that is being made of them. With our ‘activist’ Speaker, there will be no shortage of time for the Government’s opponents to rise to this challenge.\nIn my estimate the Government’s action further reduces the possibility of leaving the EU without an agreement, because it sends an even stronger signal of the Government’s determination to leave on 31st October whatever the circumstance.\nThe EU, never hitherto believing that we would do it (a belief re-enforced by the parliamentary ‘5th column’ insisting that they would prevent it), now has to -for the first time- contemplate this real possibility and negotiate to avert it.\nAs I have always said, taking no-deal off the table, increased the possibility of a no-deal BREXIT because it reduced the strength of our negotiating hand to secure a deal that could get through Parliament.\nIt is ironic that most of those who are most vehement in their opposition to no-deal, were overwhelmingly the ones who voted against the current Withdrawal Agreement. For so many of them, what they really oppose is our leaving the EU at all.\nGood luck to the Mysterons, it’s time they had a win.",

Nevertheless, I often found myself in disagreement with him.\nMy principal concern was that the success of his political party was dependent upon the destruction of my own Conservative Party.\nI have always regarded it as a strength of our voting system that it requires broad coalitions to come together as a political party to have any chance of success at the ballot box in a general election. Narrow, ‘single issue’ political parties have never succeeded in building the necessary breadth of support to triumph in our elections. My fear was always that significant support for Farage’s political party would be at the expense of the Conservative Party and that, whilst it would deny the Conservative Party the opportunity of winning and forming the Government, far from delivering success for his own party, on the contrary, it would deliver victory to parties with agendas that could not be more opposed to his own.\nNevertheless, though his political party was never in danger of winning, Nigel Farage has had a key role in our politics. Were it not for the threat that he posed to the success of the Conservative Party; I have no doubt that David Cameron would not have included a commitment to an in/out referendum on EU membership in his 2015 election manifesto. That commitment was designed explicitly to prevent Eurosceptic voters peeling off from the Conservatives to Nigel Farage.\nI believed that the commitment to a referendum was an absolute necessity if we were to have a chance of winning, but we wouldn’t have offered it were it not for the danger posed by Farage.\nI think it is safe to say that we would not have regained our national sovereignty had it not been for his intervention in our politics.\nNow, by being denied continued banking services by Coutts and Nat West Farage has, by the tenacity of his campaigning, exposed a growing threat to our liberty. It is an absolute outrage to discover that large public companies are acting as Orwellian thought police and withholding commercial services on the basis of their investigations.\nWhat I might believe is no business whatsoever of my bank. Its only proper concern is that my account is in credit, or if it isn’t, that they are being paid handsomely in recompense.\nIt is astonishing that the board Nat West Bank, so ready to trumpet its standards and values, should express its full confidence in its chief executive, after she has divulged client confidential (and false) information to a BBC Journalist to undermine Nigel Farage’s campaign. The board, by backing their chief executive, have made themselves culpable and should also resign.\nI doubt that shareholders in Nat West had any idea that the bank which they own had taken upon itself to censor the politics of its customers.\nIf my memory serves me correctly, it was in 2007 that we passed regulations that prevented any commercial undertaking from discriminating against customers on the basis of their sexual orientation. Clearly, we now need to go further and prevent enterprises from discriminating on the basis of a customer’s lawful political activity: My politics is no more the business of my bank, than what I do in bed.\nWell Done, Nigel Farage",

They have also committed to continuing to focus on maintaining world-leading farm animal welfare standards through both regulatory requirements and statutory codes.\nI am encouraged that this Government has set itself a challenging agenda to tackle animal welfare issues and is taking action on many fronts to improve the health and wellbeing of farm animals. A major example is the commitment to end excessively long journeys for live animals going for slaughter and for fattening, which will be realised through the Kept Animals Bill now making its way through Parliament. Now we have left the EU, Ministers are also able to reward farmers for providing higher standards of animal welfare and environmental protection measures. I am pleased that Ministers have committed to co-designing an Animal Health and Welfare Pathway under this plan, which aims to promote the production of healthier, higher-welfare farm animals at a level beyond compliance with current regulations.\nMinisters have also been clear that it is their ambition for farrowing crates to no longer be used for sows. Indeed, the new pig welfare code clearly states that “the aim is for farrowing crates to no longer be necessary and for any new system to protect the welfare of the sow, as well as her piglets.” It is important that we make progress towards a system that both works commercially and safeguards the welfare of the sow and her piglets, and that we do so as quickly as possible. I am pleased to confirm the UK is already ahead of most pig producing countries in terms of non-confinement farrowing, with around 40 per cent of our pigs housed outside and not farrowed with crates.\nOf course, if you do have specific concerns about the welfare of an animal, I would recommend reporting it to the police or to the RSPCA who can investigate and take action where necessary.\nDS.",

The important thing is that it is significantly below the rate of inflation. Hopefully, this will give a lead in pay negotiations: it is essential not to build inflationary expectations if we are to bring inflation under control.\nAs an aside, given the column inches given to the MP pay award in the newspapers, when David Cameron’s Coalition Government came to power in 2010, with very stretched public finances, it immediately cut all ministerial pay by 5% and then froze it for 5 years. This received no press coverage at all -funny that.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_author_dswayne_page_38/content_830.html": "Scientists on SAGE will answer the question that they have been asked. The key therefore is to choose the question carefully.\nSo far as I can gather the question that the Government is asking is ‘how best can we supress the spread of the virus until a vaccine becomes available?’\nGiven that the virus spreads through social contact, we can hardly be surprised when the scientists come back with a recommendation to halt social contact by imposing lock-downs, preferably as restrictive and fierce as can be enforced.\nIt is a bit rich however, when you hear some of those scientists who break cover to complain that they recommended a full lock-down a fortnight ago, but that they were ignored.\nThey were not ignored, on the contrary, their advice was considered but rejected, which is very different indeed from being ignored.\nIn any event, when the advice is presented it comes with a caveat -boldly articulated up-front, namely that the measures proposed are designed to curb the spread of the virus, and that they all come with associated costs and impacts that may be damaging to the economy, to our health, and to our mental health.\nIt is not for the scientists to weigh-up those costs, their expertise is confined to the question that they were asked -how to stop the spread.\nRather, it is for the Government to make the assessment as to whether the cost and damage is worth the candle.\nSo, those politicians who are now insisting that we should just do what the scientists are telling us, including the Leader of the Opposition, have fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the advice and their own proper role in weighing it up.\nFurthermore, they equally fail to appreciate that there is a growing body of scientists and clinicians who believe that the strategy is the wrong one. The great Barrington Declaration, which gives voice to this growing dissent, has -as I write- been signed by 26,000 clinicians and 10,000 medical and public health scientists.\nThe resistance is growing in Parliament too: 88 MPs voted against the 10 o’clock hospitality curfew this week.\nMost dissent comes however, from within the governing party itself. This is because the coronavirus strategy has been particularly difficult for Conservatives like myself, for whom the belief that individuals make better decisions for themselves, their families and their communities than the state can make for them, is a core value.\nAs Winston Churchill summed it up ‘trust the people’.\nA Costly Mistake\nTo-day, scientists from Edinburgh University, having re-worked the notorious Imperial College modelling of the pandemic, discover that the lock-down measures were a terrible mistake and will lead to more Covid-19 deaths than would have occurred if we had allowed ourselves to acquire herd immunity.\nYet when reservations are expressed about the Government’s Coronavirus strategy ministers respond by stating that there is no alternative other than ‘letting the virus rip’.\nThe growing chorus of scientists and clinicians are however, advocating just such an alternative strategy.\nIt is not fair for Government to refuse to engage and insist that there is no alternative. Plainly, there is, and we should evaluate it before we write it off as being less effective than the existing strategy which, after all, does not appear to be working well at all.\nThe Government restated its strategy this week with absolute clarity: to suppress the disease through local and national restrictions on liberty and the economy until such time as a vaccine is developed.\nHere is the difficulty: first, there are areas of the country that have now been in restrictive local lock-down for many weeks and infection rates, far from decreasing as a result of the measures have, on the contrary, increased sharply -in some areas as much as tenfold.\nSecond, vaccines may take a very long time to develop, there is no guarantee that one will prove effective, or it may prove only partially effective and take a further prolonged period to be sufficiently available to have an impact. After all, We possess anti-flu vaccines but it still kills 20,000 of us annually ( and incidentally it is currently killing a lot more of us than Covid-19).\nThe Government’s strategy requires that lock-down restrictions with increasing severity, with all their disastrous economic, social and health consequences be repeatedly imposed and re-imposed with every local outbreak indefinitely until an effective vaccine developed.\nThe unease with this prospect of indefinite misery is growing. Very significantly family doctors are now demanding to be represented on the body of scientists advising the Government. They point out that currently the scientists are too focussed on the disease and the measures to combat it, without weighing up the damage that those measures are doing to the health and mental health of the nation and which the family doctors are seeing daily.\nThe alternative strategy can be summarised thus: Concentrate resources on isolating the infected, and on protecting people who are particularly vulnerable. The rest of us should be allowed to get back to normal social and economic life, judging and managing for ourselves the risk we are prepared to take, and through social interaction over time, acquire a measure of ‘herd immunity’.\nThis must include the NHS getting back to normal too, where Covid-19 measures have vastly reduced its capacity to treat other conditions.\nThe basis of this strategy is that we may have to live with Covid-19 for a long time, even forever, so we need to adapt to living normally with it; best we get on with it without wasting more time, as we it appears now that we wasted the summer, and consequently have made the coming winter worse.\nCounting to Six\nOn Tuesday evening 6th Oct we debated the rule of six.\nThe minister at the despatch box conceded, when asked for the scientific basis for choosing six, that the number was chosen for its simplicity rather than science.\nI couldn’t resist pointing out that if simplicity was the yardstick, then ten would be preferable as we could count them up on our fingers.\nFurthermore, without sacrificing simplicity, was not possible to exclude children from the six, as they have done in Scotland, or is that too complicated for the English to grapple with?\nThe limit of six applies both indoors and out of doors (save only for households and bubbles of more than six). Thankfully however, it emerged during the debate that the police have no power of entry to a dwelling to enforce the measure. So they will have to wait outside to count you as you emerge -assuming sufficient fingers are available.\nQuestion 92665: A shortage of loos\nI tabled the following written question\nQuestion: Desmond Swayne\nTo ask the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, if he will secure additional facilities to enable Nightingale hospitals to accommodate patients that are not intubated. (92665)\nTabled on: 21 September 2020\nAnswer:\nEdward Argar\nThe Nightingale hospitals are available to support the National Health Service when needed. Local clinical leaders are working to determine how this is done whilst considering the needs of all patients requiring NHS care.\nThe answer was submitted on 07 Oct 2020 at 13:41.\nNow the answer was due several days earlier, so the department clearly needed longer to think about it. Nevertheless, the discerning reader will observe that the answer is pretty opaque, It might mean nothing at all.\nMy purpose in asking the question was this: I want to see the NHS getting back to normal by treating all the other routine and life-threating conditions that are killing us off other than Covid-19 (which, after all, is only killing less than 2% of those of who are dying).\nOne way to achieve this would be to resume normal service in those wards, operating theatres, and hospitals that were converted for exclusive Covid-19 use and to put the Covid-19 patients, as far as possible, in separate units, with the Nightingale hospitals being obvious candidates.\nNow, one of the reasons why the Nightingales were so underused is that they could only accommodate ‘intubated patients’ i.e. patients who are sufficiently unwell to have to have had a tube inserted down their airway and sedated. They would also, as a consequence, be catheterised.\nThe hospitals couldn’t take patients that were not entirely bed-bound because they didn’t have enough lavatories.\nGiven that we’ve had all summer to address the issue I thought I’d ask if we’d taken the opportunity to remedy the matter. With all those events companies unable to do normal business, surely we could have rustled-up deluxe facilities supervised with military precision.\nAlas, the answer suggests not.\nMaintaining the Aim\nThe effort to overcome Covid-19 has often been characterised by ministers as a ‘war’.\nThe first principle of war is the selection and maintenance of the aim. You have to know exactly what it is that you are seeking to achieve and design all your policy towards obtaining that aim.\nBack in March the aim was defined as ‘flattening the curve to protect the NHS’\nLast week I asked the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, if this had remained the same.\nHe replied “our aim is to flatten the curve, to protect the NHS and to save lives” and significantly he added “protect the economy”\nNeither the aim expressed in March, nor the restatement by Mr Gove last week gives us much by which we can judge the direction or effectiveness of policy. We do not know what the end state is supposed to be. We do not know for sure if the aim is to contain, delay the spread, suppress, or eradicate the disease. ‘Flattening the curve’ seems to suggest merely delaying the spread which was certainly understandable back in March: by delaying we would reach the warmer summer weather; The NHS would have less flu, norovirus, and other winter pressures to deal with; and the virulence of coronaviruses tend to abate in summer months.\n‘Flattening the curve’ is much less understandable as a statement of the aim in the autumn.\nI am often at a loss as to what the Government’s policies are supposed to achieve.\nA typical example is the nationwide 10pm curfew on the hospitality industry, particularly given Mr Gove’s additional stated aim to ‘protect the economy’.\nThe virus certainly can’t tell the time, and the impact on the industry is devastating: To comply with regulations premises have reduced their capacity and introduced expensive new staff-intensive procedures. Consequently, sufficient opening ours are vital to secure sufficient revenues, especially where restaurants need to secure a second dinner sitting.\nThis policy, applied across the country despite widely different infection rates, makes nonsense of the stated aim.\nIt would have been better to devolve powers to the local levels where any curfew could have been applied to individual establishments, giving proprietors a powerful incentive to influence the social-distancing behaviour of their patrons.\nBlame the Neanderthals\nThe frontiers of knowledge are ever expanding. Professor Hugo Zeberg and his team at the Max Plank Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology have discovered the genes that make some individuals particularly susceptible to severe symptoms if they catch Covid-19.\nFurthermore, those unfortunate enough to carry the gene do so because our ancestors acquired them by breeding with the Neanderthals some sixty thousand years ago. So, we can safely blame the Neanderthals because they died out forty thousand years ago.\nOf course, a slightly different slant to put on it, would be to blame those over-sexed ancestors of ours for their congress with the Neanderthals.\nWhich reminds me of my schoolmaster’s advice: “boys, it is a lot safer to take up a musical instrument than either to join the Christian Union or to spend your time daydreaming about sexual exploits”\nI’ve recently taken up the Piano\nOne day there may be a virus that threatens our whole way of life – but this isn’t it, even if we are behaving as if it were.\nAs Covid-19 cases in New Forest District continue to decline (5 per 100,000) I am dismayed by to-day’s announcement of new and economically damaging restrictions on our liberties.\nThink back to February. The initial phase in our strategy to deal with Covid-19 was ‘Confine’: to confine it by identifying it through testing, and then quarantining cases and contacts. It was understood however, that this would be temporary and that inevitably it would get out and start spreading in the community. So, the next phase was ‘Delay’: The purpose of delaying the spread was to ease the strain on the NHS by reducing the infection rate until we got to the summer when there would be fewer other winter pressures like flu for hospitals to deal with. We also hoped Covid-19, a coronavirus like flu, would be equally seasonal in its behaviour and abate in the summer.\nThere was no expectation that we would implement extreme measures, rather the advice was to wash your hands frequently and be sensible about social distancing. We anticipated acquiring a herd immunity through the manageable spread of the disease.\nWe witnessed hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed and other countries bringing in draconian lock-downs. Then, modelling by the team from Imperial College London suggested that, if we carried on as we were, 500,000 would die (they have form in vastly over-estimating deaths from other diseases), the Government was spooked, it changed course and ordered the lock-down with all its devastating consequences.\nFlu kills all year round – In the last weeks of July it killed 1000 of us (where Covid-19 killed only 200)- but it is seasonal: it certainly kills a lot more of us in the winter. Equally, we should stop talking about another wave of Covid-19 and instead, like flu, start expecting its annual season.\nHaving peaked in April Covid-19 abated over the summer. Inevitably it will get worse in winter. It may also be worse this winter than might otherwise have been the case. This is because we carried on with a number of restrictions on normal social life during the summer, reducing our ability to acquire and share herd immunity and wasting the opportunity provided by the weakest period for the virus.\nMy contention remains, as I have said many times over the last months, that our over-reaction to the disease has done much more lasting economic damage, and, counter-intuitively, even more damage to our health than the disease itself.\nThe current strategy merely kicks the can down the road. If the measures work and reduce the spread, the virus will simply reappear later.\nOf course, we could be lucky and get a vaccine or a cure, or even ‘moon-shot’ daily tests to enable us to return to normality, but none of these are certain.\nOne day there may be a virus that threatens our whole way of life – but this isn’t it, even if we are behaving as if it were.\nFalse Positives?\n16/09/2020 By Desmond Swayne\nOn Tuesday the following exchange took place in the Commons:\nSir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con) To what extent is there a possibility that it is the exponential increase in testing itself, in identifying genuine new cases, and the very significant possibility of false positives, that is giving a distorted impression of the trajectory of the disease?\nThe Secretary of State for Health and Social Care (Matt Hancock) I like my right hon. Friend very much and wish that that were true. The reason why the Office for National Statistics does the surveillance testing is to ensure that we are constantly looking, on a national representative sample, at what the case rate is, as well as, of course, using the tests, and as we increase the testing numbers, we will inevitably find more of the cases that are there. The ONS survey published on Friday shows a rise in the numbers commensurate with the rise in the numbers of tests that have come back positive, and that does take into account the point about false positives, which is an important one.\nThe reason I put the question is that I have received a number of representations from clinicians across the country (presumably prompted by the stand that I’ve taken) who believe that Covid-19 testing is giving a misleading impression about a second wave. They argue that of course we will detect more genuine cases of the disease as we do more testing. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the disease is increasing: we may simply finding more of it because we are looking for more of it.\nMore worrying is the belief that the a false impression is being created by the test which is unable to distinguish between active cases of the disease, and those who may have recovered from it some time ago but have remaining non-infective traces of it.\nI’m not sure that the Secretary Of State’s answer provides sufficient reassurance. He is stating that the Office of National Statistics conducts a survey by testing a representative population sample and then applying a statistical calculation to estimate the number of cases in the whole population.\nIf the ONS test suffers from the same inability to distinguish false positives it doesn’t escape the possibility of exaggerating the incidence of the disease.\nThe ONS does publish the following caveats:\n“we do not know the true sensitivity and specificity of the test, as COVID-19 is a new virus….\nThe estimates presented in this bulletin contain uncertainty. There are many sources of uncertainty, including uncertainty in the test”\nThe Government website -when I last looked- stated the daily number of tests processed in the UK was 227,075. https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/testing and the daily number of people tested positive is 3,105. https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/cases\nWhich means that 1.37% of those tested had a positive result. Clearly it doesn’t take a mathematician to tell you that a relatively small percentage of false positives will have a significant impact on our estimate of how many people are infected. In fact a report by the ONS in June put false positives at 2.4%: which even higher than the actual proportion of positives!\nWe are threatened with more restrictions to our liberty which will lay waste to even more of our employment opportunities, and will be more damaging to the health of anyone suffering from a medical condition other than Covid-19, all driven by policy reliant on what may be very misleading data\nAt some stage we will have to have a reality check and remind ourselves that whilst Covid-19 is a horrid and dangerous disease, it is only 24th in the league of UK killers at only 1.4% of deaths (the top scorer being dementia at 11%).\nIf we want to live normally we will have conquer our fear\nThe Markets Bill\nA number of constituents have written to demand that I vote against the provisions of the UK internal Markets bill because it breaks International law -even the minister admitted that in the Commons.\nThe bill is about a great deal more than our treaty obligations in respect of the Northern Ireland protocol under the EU withdrawal agreement, with which only a few of its clauses are concerned.\nThe bill cannot break UK law because Parliament makes the law!\nFurthermore, the Withdrawal Agreement only has the force of law because Parliament passed it into law. In the Act with which we did so, we included a clause making it clear that we could change it we needed to. Therefore, the Markets Bill no more breaks the Withdrawal Agreement than the Withdrawal Act itself did.\nThe provisions affecting Northern Ireland in the bill are a response to threat by EU negotiators that they would use the Joint Committee set up under the protocol to effectively exclude UK produce from Northern Ireland if we did not concede vital ground in our negotiations with them on a free trade deal.\nSo, the provisions of the bill are precautionary: they give ministers power to act in certain circumstances. The objective remains to avoid those circumstances and therefore, not to have to implement the provisions of the bill. The bill of itself does not breach any international obligation.\nThe Northern Ireland protocol is predicated on the existence of a free trade deal between the EU and the UK. Without one the provisions become unworkable.\nThe Government made a manifesto commitment to UK voters to ensure that there was unfettered market access between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nLet us assume that the worst case comes about, that there is no EU trade deal and that the Government has to use the provisions set out in this bill to make the arrangements workable.\nIn that circumstance would we have breached our international treaty obligations in respect of the Withdrawal Agreement?\nI think not.\nIn that respect I believe that the minister was wrong in what he said in the Commons when he agreed that it would compromise the obligation even if in a very minor technical way. I say it wouldn’t.\nArticle 184 binds the EU and the UK in good faith and using their best endeavours negotiate expeditiously to implement the future relationship set out in the Political Declaration.\nBoth sides have effectively accused the other of already beaching that binding obligation.\nFailure to agree would be the proof of this. It follows that, the parties having breached the fundamental obligation underpinning the Agreement, then the Agreement is void: the Treaty is abrogated. We would have no further binding international obligation.\nWould this adversely affect our international reputation?\nWould other countries trust us in making future binding agreements?\nOur trading partners are not blind. They can see that is a unique circumstance. They have had their own dealings with EU negotiators, and they know what is going on.\nTo compare the provisions of this bill with China’s abrogation of the Sino-British agreement over Hong Kong, as some parliamentarians have done, is ridiculous and grotesque. It reveals the bankruptcy of their argument.\nNever be careless with our liberty and freedom of expression\nI have opposed intrusion into our civil liberties by Coronavirus regulations whereby we are told whom we may meet, where we may meet them, and now even what we must wear. So, I was tempted to join the protest march last weekend in London against the Coronavirus regulations and for which I had received a couple of email invitations.\nI certainly wasn’t put off by the prospect fine because it struck me as entirely possible to attend such events and yet abide by the required social distance set out in guidelines. Furthermore, so many other protest marches have been allowed to proceed largely unmolested by the authorities including the Black Lives Matter protests, and just in the last week Extinction Rebellion.\nAs for the liability of an on-the-spot fine of a whopping £1000 for the organisers, I certainly wasn’t one of them, and anyway, even if one were, the organisers of the other protest marches were not pursued.\nIn the event I didn’t go simply because I have so many other demands on my time on a Saturday.\nPiers Corbyn, Jeremy’s elder brother, has always struck me as a rather odd fellow, with some pretty wacky views. Nevertheless, I was pretty horrified that he was fingered for the £1000 on-the-spot fine for the march that I had at least contemplated attending. This is very unfair given that the other more fashionable marches did not receive this heavy-handed approach. I am glad that there is a campaign to fight his corner and challenge the fine, to which I’ve made a very modest contribution.\nThe regulations under which our right to lawful protest has been removed -undebated and without a vote in Parliament- gives the power to any police officer, including police support officers, to levy the on-the spot-fine on you for being involved in a gathering of more that 30 people. Well, in that case I’m very glad I didn’t go. The original official description of the regulations was that the £1000 was just for the organisers, actually the wording of the regulations however, state that it’s anyone involved.\nWhen I received the emails advertising the March, I did contemplate forwarding them to those constituents who have been most vociferous in their criticism of Coronavirus regulations. I didn’t, but had I done so, would I have ‘involved’ myself, and might I be liable to be fined?\nI am informed that this is indeed the case. In fact, anyone present, carrying banners, shouting slogans, is ‘involved’ and could be liable.\nAnother chilling aspect of all this is how police photographers take long lens photographs of entirely peaceful participants: they can come for you later.\nAs the barrister Matthew Scott has put it\n“One should shudder at a law that gives such vast powers to the most junior officials; that was introduced by an emergency procedure, and after the publication of grossly misleading official guidance as to its intended effect”\nWe should never be careless with our liberty and freedom of expression\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 36\n- 37\n- 38\n- 39\n- 40\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",

These expanding illegal settlements make a viable Palestinian state impossible.\nWhich means a large population will be condemned to continue to live without equal rights, and with restricted movement. We used to have a name for that, so let’s call a spade a bloody shovel: we used to call it Apartheid, and Israel will have effectively confined the Palestinians to bantustans.\nClearly the world is looking the other way for the present, but how long could such a situation endure, anymore that it endured in South Africa?",

On April 16, 2025, Babak Alipour, Vahid Baniamerian, Pouya Ghobadi, Mohammad Taghavi, and Ali Akbar Daneshvarkar—who are all on death row—were moved under heavy security. According to sources, the prison ward was placed on lockdown to prevent protests against the transfer. In many previous cases, such transfers have preceded executions.\nRelatives of the prisoners report that they have endured prolonged solitary confinement, torture, and consistent denial of legal representation. Some have been subjected to repeated mock executions and threatened with execution in the field—tactics known to inflict severe psychological trauma.\nThe Islamic Republic has a long history of executing political prisoners around international holidays, fueling concern that these men may be executed during the upcoming Easter holidays. Iran Human Rights has warned of the grave and immediate danger facing the prisoners and has called on the international community, particularly governments with diplomatic ties to Iran, to intervene urgently.\n“We call on the people of Iran, civil society organizations, and the international community to pay close attention to the situation of political prisoners sentenced to death,” a relative stated. “The Islamic Republic has repeatedly used silence and media blackout to carry out executions.”\nExecutions in Iran have sharply increased following the end of Nowrouz and Ramadan.\nThe five men, along with Abolhassan Montazer—whose current status remains unknown—were sentenced to death on November 25, 2024, by Branch 26 of the Tehran Revolutionary Court, presided over by Judge Iman Afshari. They were convicted of “baghy” (armed rebellion) for alleged membership in the Mojahedin Khalgh Organization. Additionally, they received sentences of imprisonment and internal exile for charges including “assembly and collusion to disrupt national security” and “forming an illegal group.”\nAll six have long histories of political persecution and previous arrests spanning decades. They were detained between December 22, 2023, and February 23, 2024, and formally indicted on May 14, 2024.

The Government’s plan for adult social care will protect individuals and families from unpredictable and potentially catastrophic care costs.\nFrom October 2023, no eligible person starting adult social care will have to pay more than £86,000 for personal care over their lifetime. The reformed means test, which is the best way to help make care affordable, will increase the threshold above which people must meet the full cost of their care to £100,000. This is more than four times the current limit of £23,250, and the number of people receiving state support in the social care system will increase from around half to two thirds.\nIn designing these reforms, the priority has been the creating a more generous means-testing system, which benefits those with low to moderate wealth. The new social care reforms are clear, fair and reduce complexity. Only the amount that an individual contributes towards their personal care will count towards the cap, and a much more generous means test will better support those with lower levels of assets. Fewer people will be unable to pay for social care without selling their home under the reforms to the social care charging system compared to the existing system. These reforms will complement the existing system which ensures that nobody will have to sell their home to pay for their care in their lifetime. People are able to take out a Deferred Payment Agreement so that payments can be deducted from their estate after they die. And if someone or their spouse lives in their home, they will not be forced to sell it to pay for care.\nDS.",

This morning, a constituent of mine experiencing a miscarriage was denied the company of her husband in hospital. I have sent the details to the Secretary of State.\nTyranny is a habit, and the motions on the Order Paper this evening show that we have not quite kicked it. The powers that touched our personal choices and came at such a huge cost remain. We were told that they were there purely temporarily to deal with the emergency. Well, by any measure the emergency is over and the hugely successful vaccination campaign is the guarantee against its return. Yet on the Order Paper tonight the Government seek to retain those powers to control aspects of our lives, together with the punishment regime for those who disobey.\nNow, those of us who can spot the trajectory will have seen yesterday that, after months of denial, people will now indeed have to provide their vaccination bona fides when they go to the pub. Those who are teetotal and imagine that they might be spared such intrusion and inconvenience can dream on: this will undoubtedly be extended to restaurants, theatres, sporting venues, and so proceed to total social control. Did it ever occur to Ministers that they might actually incentivise vaccination—carrot, not stick? Undoubtedly it did not, because they cannot kick the habit. They are wedded to the stick.\nLet there be no wringing of hands by Members of Parliament who vote for oppressive legislation and then wail with indignation when the police actually enforce it.

He embraced so many campaigns -supporting families; poverty; animal cruelty- with enormous enthusiasm and lasting stamina.\nAbove all, he was most generous with that most precious of commodities -his time: he was always prepared to give you his time and help you out if you had a problem. His brutal murder came as a great shock.\nIn responding to such shocking events there is always a danger of over-reacting. In the commentaries that have followed Sir David’s murder there have been, in my estimate, a number of such over-reactions.\nIn several analyses the deaths of Sir David, Jo Cox, Ian Gow and Sir Anthony Berry have been classified together. I think this is quite mistaken: Ian Gow and Sir Anthony were murdered by the IRA as part of an organised territorial campaign to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom. Sir David and Jo Cox were murdered by ‘lone wolves’ with quite different, though equally despicable motives.\nA number of commentaries have drawn attention to the way that our public and political discourse has become so charged with unpleasantness and abuse, some on which is attributed to social media.\nWhilst, this observable fact and horrid, I doubt that it accounts in any way for the ideological derangement that leads someone to kill Members of Parliament.\nI am very fortunate in never having been threatened, or having felt threatened in the 23 years since I was elected. I have every sympathy with those colleagues who are constantly being threatened. Clearly, appropriate precautions need to be taken to protect them. Demands for police protection for all MPs are however, quite misplaced. There are many calls on police time. After all, many more ordinary members of the public have been killed by terrorist outrages in recent years. It would be a denial of democracy if politicians were to be protected from the public who elect them.\n*\nSir David Amess was renowned in public life for his Christian faith, but I was rather taken by surprise by Katie Martin on Radio Solent when she asked me where God was when Sir David was murdered. I didn’t answer very well. The proper answer is that God was there. The Christian truth is that in the life of Christ God shared our suffering. We do not understand God’s purposes but it’s no good complaining that the Universe is imperfect, full of suffering and not the one that we would made. It is the Universe in which we have to live and either we have faith in its ultimate purpose even though we have no understanding, or we accept that ultimately there is no purpose, that there is no justice and that in the end suffering is un-remedied.\nProfessor Richard Dawkins would argue that faith in God’s purpose is based on our wish for it to be true and that we just cannot face the reality that we are in a purposeless universe (in essence Karl Marx made the same critique). Dawkins may well be right in that we do want it to be true, but since when did the desire for something constitute a disproof of its existence?\nAfter a sleepless night of anxiety and pain you wish for the dawn; that you desire the dawn, doesn’t mean that it won’t come.",

France sees its role as safely shepherding the migrants into UK waters where we will intercept them. A senior member of the Commons Home Affairs Committee has announced that France’s interpretation of maritime law is perverse and they must change it -so, we are back to King Canute: we hold no power over France to make them change (unless, of course, we can think of a sanction to make the French miserable, whose effects won’t rebound equally upon us).\nNow that crossing the Channel in small boats has been established as a successful means of illegal entry to UK, the numbers attempting a crossing are bound to increase until migrants assess that it is not worth undertaking the expense or encountering the danger because the probability is that they will be expelled, or that they will be held in conditions less eligible than their current circumstances.\nWe’ve already encountered the difficulty of finding somewhere to expel them to, so we are left with the ‘ Australian’ approach of deterring them on the principle of less eligibility. The Australians send them to detention centres in Papua New Guinea. This is controversial even in Australia and I rather suspect that the British public would not have the stomach for it.\nNevertheless, the Borders Bill currently going through Parliament specifies a 4 year prison term for illegal entry and empowers ministers to implement detention centres for the processing of asylum claims overseas.\nI seriously doubt that we will fill our -already bursting- prisons with tens of thousands of migrants, including the prospect of separating families.\nEqually, it is not clear what sort of inducement would be required to persuade another country to house our ‘processing centres’ and whether they would turn out to be as grizzly and embarrassing as Australia’s.\nThat we need to identify a workable solution, I do not doubt. Clearly, our generous resettlement schemes are being overtaken by unlawful migrants who, no matter what they may have endured and from what horrors they have fled, have had sufficient sums to purchase the services of criminal gangs to deliver them to our shores.\nOf course, we could reduce the attraction of the crossings, just making them so much more dangerous by withdrawing our cutters and patrols altogether. I’m confident that this would not be the answer. I wonder how many constituents would be emailing me then, when the bodies of children start washing up on the beach.",

Clearly, there is an argument to be had on this, and I entered into that argument in this column a couple of weeks ago ( http://www.desmondswaynemp.com/ds-blog/the-brexit-bill/ )\nWe need to judge politicians not just by their words however, but by their actions.\nThe purpose of a second reading debate is to explore the general principle of a bill. Examining the detail of a bill follows in a separate series of debates on the committee stage (for which seven eight hours days of debate have now been set aside)\nThe principle of the Brexit bill, accepted on both sides, is that there is a need to provide continuity and certainty after Brexit by incorporating EU law into UK law so that it continues to apply after we leave, as it does now. Otherwise there might be a chaotic departure from the EU.\nIf the Opposition accepted this argument (–and they said they did), but nevertheless were worried that the bill gave too much power to ministers, and too little to Parliament, then the proper parliamentary way to proceed would have been to have supported, or perhaps abstained, at second reading, then to seek to amend the balance of powers in the detail of the bill at the subsequent committee stage. To have voted –as they did- against the second reading is to vote against the principle of the bill and to try to kill it outright.\nWhatever opponents say about their motives, for them to have voted against the second reading is deeply worrying about their commitment to our departure from the EU.\nMPs are not objective observers. We are partisans. Forgive therefore, my suspicions about the motivation of parliamentary opponents who campaigned to remain in the EU, nevertheless now say that –as democrats- they accept the referendum result, but then vote against the principle of the bill that is essential to deliver Brexit.\nThey say that they are defending parliamentary sovereignty against a power grab by ministers (because the bill gives those ministers the exclusive right to draw up regulations that will make the thousands of changes necessary to our law, before presenting the regulations to Parliament to be approved or rejected).\nHumbug\nWhere was their concern for parliamentary sovereignty when these EU laws were made in the first place, with no role at all for Parliament in that Process?\nThe opponents of the Bill say they want Parliament to be involved in the detail of drawing up the regulations: that would take years.\nI have spoken before in this column of the desperation of those who want to hang on in the hope that something will turn up to prevent us leaving the EU. Delay is the essential ingredient to such a strategy of hanging on in that hope. Nothing is more suited to supplying that delay than the current tactics of those who voted against this bill.",

In addition, pensioners do not pay National Insurance.\nTo exempt well off pensioners from paying tax on their basic state pension would be deeply unfair to the pensioners who are struggling, and to everyone else still at work and paying taxes to pay the pensioners.\nMany of my correspondents forget that the pension is a state benefit, albeit not a universal benefit, but qualified for by national insurance contributions, a state benefit nevertheless.\nWe are often indignant when reminded about this. We insist that we are entitled to our pension because we have earned it by paying our contributions. Not so, we qualify for it by paying our national insurance contributions, we do not earn it. when we fully qualify we all end up with exactly the same pension notwithstanding that some will have paid many thousands of pounds more in contributions than others.\nIf our contributions were going into a fund and our pension was dependent upon the investment returns on the amounts we paid into that fund, then we could legitimately claim we had earned it, and not merely qualified for it.\nAlas, there is no such fund. Our national insurance contributions are a tax like any other.\nThe reality is that current taxpayers are paying the pensions of current pensioners in the hope and expectation that this arrangement between the generations will continue.\nSo, perhaps pensioners might moderate the demands that will be placed on future generations as the numbers of the retired increase, and the working population shrinks.\nThe baby boomers enjoyed the ability to earn defined benefit private pensions which are no longer available, they had free higher education, and much easier access to house purchase.\nMy children have none of these things, and no prospect of being able to spend as much as a third of their lives in retirement.\nThe suggestion that the state pension should be untaxed is quite out of place.",

As for the media coverage, there is nothing less edifying than the public demonstrations of the self-righteous.)\nAnyone who has followed my blogs and my speech in Parliament will have realised by now that I was deeply opposed to the lockdown in the first place. I believe that it will have significantly added to the economic damage that the virus has inflicted, and I believe that it is an affront to our liberty.\nSo much of the correspondence that I have received reinforces the lockdown’s cruelty in preventing people visiting loved ones, when -in my estimate- sensible precautions would have enabled them to do so with very low risk.\nFrom the outset people have sought my advice. Now, generally, whilst I’m happy to give an opinion, I don’t give advice: I point out that I’m not qualified to give advice, and that I don’t have professional indemnity insurance for when it turns out that I’ve given bad advice.\nDuring the lockdown however, I have abandoned that caution.

Nevertheless, I believe it is an important question: do we believe that our liberty, democracy and values are worth fighting and dying for?\nWe enjoy these freedoms because so many of our forebears fought and died for them. It is a difficult question for us to face with a measure of humility as we watch events unfold from our comfort and security. Yet in our own generation and in Afghanistan 457 of our men and women fought and died for those very values and many more suffered horrific injuries.\nAlso, as we consider the reasons behind complete collapse of the trained and well-armed Afghan forces in the face of a numerically much inferior enemy, we must also remember that over the last few years no less than 70,000 members of the Afghan security forces bravely fought and died for these values too.\nThe resistance continues in the Panjshir Valley where elements of the Afghan Army, together with the Vice President have pledged to fight on under the leadership of the Sandhurst-trained Ahmad Masoud, the son of the mujahedeen leader ‘The Lion of Panjshir’ who was assassinated on the orders on Bin-Laden in 2001.\nAre we going to leave them to it, or will we assist in the way that we supported Ahmad’s father in his resistance to the Taliban?\nRealpolitik demands answers to certain questions. First, what are their realistic prospects?\nThe Taliban are already claiming victory in the Panjshir but this is fiercely denied by the resistance. I hope we have much better military intelligence as to what exactly is happening than we had earlier this summer.\nSecond, what would the consequences of western support for resistance in the Panjshir be?\nCurrently the Taliban have ‘hostages’ in the form of all those that we failed to evacuate in the last weeks. We want them granted safe passage out of Afghanistan. Notwithstanding announcements of amnesty, there are many reports of summary reprisals against Afghans who assisted NATO and the Government of Afghanistan. I do not doubt that western assistance to the resistance in the Panjshir will make the predicament of those Afghans now in fear and hiding very much worse.\nOn the other hand, I doubt that the Taliban have much appetite for our good opinion so the only leverage we really have is financial. To put it bluntly we will need to ‘incentivise’ the provision of safe passage out of Afghanistan. So, in the end it comes down to danegeld, but as the English discovered with the Vikings, payment doesn’t always lead to compliance with the obligations for which the payment was made.\nIf the prospects of resistance are realistic then an assessment needs to be made on the basis of risk to those Afghans who are -in effect- now hostages, as against the potential benefits to Afghanistan as a whole of an effective and successful resistance.\nI do not know the answers to these questions, but I believe it is important to ask them. Just as it is important for us to examine ourselves and ask, what would we have done had it happened to us.",

(much in the manner as did so many of our newly independent former colonies which ended up with ‘presidents for life’).\nMy own estimate however, is that opinion remains as divided as it was when we held our referendum in 2016 and therefore, the case for repeating it remains unconvincing.\nA principal demand from opposition MPs is that, if the Government’s EU withdrawal agreement were to be passed by Parliament, then the negotiations with the EU which will then commence to define the terms of our future trading relation with the EU, should themselves be followed by a ‘confirmatory referendum’ on the question of whether to implement the newly negotiated trading relationship, or just to stay in the EU after all.\nApart from the fact that this would just be exasperating. It\nisn’t what we agreed to: we never suggested in the original Referendum Act,\nthat we would have two referendums, one to decide in principle to leave, and\nthen a second when the terms of a future relationship with the EU had been\nfinalised. And the reason that we never decided to go about it that way should be\nblindingly obvious:\nThe starting point is that the EU doesn’t want us to leave. (We are the second\nlargest net financial contributor).\nIf we present the EU with the finality of a decision to leave, then it is in\ntheir interests to negotiate a future relationship in our mutual best\ninterests.\nIf however, the question of our leaving remains an open one whilst we negotiate\nthe future relationship, then the EU strategy must be to get us to change our\nmind by making the future relationship as undesirable as possible.\nA confirmatory referendum completely undermines our negotiating position for the future relationship; in just the same way as taking no-deal off the table undermined our negotiating position for the withdrawal agreement.",

Though, the desired ‘behaviours’ may appear uncontroversial, the highly charged debate over sex and gender reveals that what constitutes openness to ‘inclusion and diversity’ is, on the contrary, still highly controversial.\nIn Parliament last week my colleague Mark Francois MP badgered the Defence Secretary over cost overruns and delays to Type 26 frigate programme. He ended with this question “…why does it take BAE Systems 11 years to build a ship the Japs can build in four?”\nThe Following day Sarah Owen, the MP for Luton North, made a complaint to the speaker regarding what Mr Francois had said the day before. She was clearly angry and demanded to know how “we can discourage all Members of the House from using ethnic slurs”.\nWould Mr Francois have been in breach of the proposed code for failing under the new Respect requirement?\nI rather think that Sarah Owen would have thought so.\nPersonally, I would have exonerated Mr Francois. He was not denigrating the Japanese, on the contrary, he was complimenting their comparatively greater efficiency. He was, after all, showing them a measure of ‘respect’. In the end these things are a question of taste and I certainly wouldn’t want the language police to be able to censor that.\nAs it happens, we managed to see off the proposed new addition to the Code of Conduct. I kicked-up a fuss and so did others. The Committee on Standards withdrew, albeit with rather bad grace -saying that the criticism had been exaggerated and that the proposed addition had been purely aspirational and would not have been enforced.\nAlas, some of the other proposals in the same document survived, including that the Commissioner for Standards should police the use that MPs make of social media to ensure that our criticisms are proportionate and not too personal. So, no new -Elon Musk inspired- freedom of expression on Twitter for MPs.\nThe Committee may have shelved its proposals for now, but I doubt that the agenda and ambitions have gone away for good. Vigilance is the price of Liberty. Policing what we say and how we say it is but a short step from policing our thoughts and how we think.",

With the increase in stabbings we need urgently to reassess where our priorities lie, and to consider how racial sensitivities can be addressed without sacrificing public safety.\nThese two address the issue of raising the probability of being caught, but\nwhat about the consequences of being caught?\nOn Monday I asked the Home Secretary if sentences were long enough. He replied\n“as\nrecently as 2015, changes were made to sentencing for serious violence crimes,\nincluding with bladed weapons. While it is right that the courts make decisions\non sentencing based on the evidence and the facts in each case, we have seen a\nrise in custodial sentences. That is important, too, to make sure the right\nmessage and right deterrent are set out for these horrible crimes.”\nNevertheless, later in the week there were press reports of a drug dealer convicted\nof carrying a knife for second time, who received only a suspended sentence. So,\non Thursday I challenged another Home Office minister with that information.\nShe told me\n“I must, and will, defend the independence of the judiciary, but my colleagues\nin the Ministry of Justice and I do emphasise the point to the judiciary about\nthe public messaging of sentences. We impose mandatory minimum sentences for\nthose who are found in possession of knives precisely to get the message out\nthere that this is simply not on.”\nWell, self-evidently it isn’t working!\nThe independent judiciary are going to have to raise their game, or their\nindependence will have to be constrained by taking away their discretion.\nSo much for addressing the symptoms by catching and punishing perpetrators.\nWhat about the causes?\nInstruction can be had from the successful experience of Glasgow, which over a decade adopted the approach of treating violence as a disease, treating the causes with initiatives coordinated across the public authorities.\nIn the last week the finger of blame has also been pointed at school exclusions, because a high proportion of offenders have been expelled. This is a false trail.\nSuch pupils have a long history of disorder before they are expelled. The issue is one of our failure to properly make arrangements for them after expulsion.

Like most forecasts, they are rarely accurate. The IMF has consistently underestimated UK economic performance. Sometimes they have been spectacularly wrong, not least when they warned George Osborne that his policy would deliver mass unemployment, when on the contrary, we delivered record levels of employment.\nWhen it comes to dealing with a forecast like the IMF, it is always worth reading all of it, rather than relying on a few nuggets that headline writers have extracted to suit their own purposes.\nOn the morning of the forecast’s publication, the newscasts made it sound like the UK was facing oblivion. But what the report actually reveals, together with its accompanying commentary, is that the IMF thinks that the UK is “on the right track’”; that we had done well in the last year, with growth revised upwards to 4.1%, which is one of the highest growth rates in Europe for 2022.\nAs for the depression about the Brexit anniversary, since the European Union referendum, the UK economy has grown at about the same rate as Germany, and our cumulative growth over the 2022 to 2024 period is predicted to be higher than that of both Germany and Japan, at a similar rate to that of the United States of America.\nWe are not immune to the inflationary and supply-side consequences of the war in Ukraine but the Governor of the Bank of England has said that any UK recession this year is likely to be shallower than previously predicted: Comparatively, we are weathering the storm pretty well.\nThe Economic benefits of Brexit were all bound to have their impact in the long run. They are the consequence of regulatory freedom that allows us to suit ourselves and play to our comparative advantages, rather than be bound to the collective interests of the EU. But making use of the regulatory freedom to change our way of doing things requires the dedication and courage of the Government to implement that change, only then, and after time to bed them in, will we see the results. Alas, we lost two years to the overwhelming agenda of addressing Covid-19. Now however, when the Government does have the will to proceed and has introduced its Regulatory Freedoms Bill, I find that I’m inundated with an email campaign not to proceed with the Bill.\nYou can’t have it both ways. Complaining on the one hand, that we haven’t seen the economic benefits of Brexit. Whilst, on the other hand, demanding that we desist from implementing the changes that will deliver those benefits.\nThe reality is that they don’t want us to move out of the EU’s regulatory orbit, because ultimately, they want us to re-join it.\nWe already have the best benefit of Brexit is: we are no longer told what to do by people that we did not elect, and whom are unable to remove.",

I thought long and hard about this question before deciding to throw in my lot with Vote Leave. The prospect of de-stabilising Europe further at a time when there is already a currency crisis, a migration crisis, and the Russian bear menacing Ukraine, troubled me deeply.\nFrom this international perspective there may have been a more opportune time to hold our referendum, but the time is now, and it may not come again for a generation, or indeed ever.\nI accept that we have a responsibility and a duty to Europe as a European power. Our history and culture is deeply intertwined with the European mainland, and I would not wish it otherwise. I have concluded however, that our duty to Europe is best served by leaving the EU.\nI believe that the EU is on a disastrous path of increased integration. It is attempting to create a country called Europe with all the trappings of a nation state: a government (the Commission); its own parliament; a supreme court (the ECJ); its own currency; a flag; and a national anthem (Beethoven’s Ode to Joy). Whilst support for the economic benefits of the EU are much more widely perceived on the continent than in the UK, this political process is being driven by the elites and has very little popular support. Far from creating harmony amongst nations, it is actually generating the very opposite. One need only travel to Greece to feel the palpable and deeply distasteful anti- German sentiment. I have sympathy for both the Greeks and the Germans –it is, after all, the institutional processes of the EU that are driving them asunder.\nWhen they have been given the democratic opportunity to do so, Europeans have voted to halt this process. In April 2005 the French voted in a referendum to reject the European Constitutional Treaty by 55% to 45%. A week later the Dutch rejected it by an even greater margin of 62% to 38%. Never the less, the constitution was ratified as the Treaty of Lisbon a without letting the French or Dutch have another chance. When will they understand that ‘No’ really means No?\nThe departure of the UK – one of the largest economies, largest financial contributors, a world power with a seat at the UN Security Council and the world’s 4th largest defence budget – will be, I believe, such a profound shock to the process of European integration as to halt it in its tracks. The best thing we can do to rescue the Europe from its current disastrous course is to vote to leave the EU on 23 June!",

That however, doesn’t make it a ‘rich’ country. Despite a growing middle class, the nation’s income is spread between 1.41 billion souls. India has the highest proportion of the world’s poorest people. So, if the objective is to relieve extreme poverty, then not having an impact on it in India, means that the objective will not be reached at all.\nNevertheless, politicians are not tin-eared. The chorus of criticism of continuing aid to India has been long-standing. As a consequence, in 2011 we completed a review which concluded that we would run-down our existing projects and discontinue grant aid from 2015.\nWe determined that we would continue with commercial loans and with the provision of expertise to a couple of the poorest state governments, enabling them to make best use of revenues they received from the Government in Delhi.\n(Inevitably however, given that the UK stumps up its proper share to fund UN Agencies, if one of them, say, UNICEF for example, has an education project in a poor Indian state, some of that expenditure could be traced back to the UK.)\nSo that’s the position: We aren’t giving grant aid to India or funding their space programme.\nI was surprised that some commentators said that I was “disobliging” to the PM by “challenging” him on this in the Commons last Monday, when he returned from The G20 Summit in India. On the contrary, I was giving him the opportunity to knock the myth about aid to India on the head, which, I am glad to say, he took. Judge the exchange for yourself\nHansard Vol 737.

Yesterday (15th Oct) we debated the second reading of very short five clause Government bill to remove the ninety-two remaining hereditary peers from the House of Lords.\nThey had remained there on the basis of an agreement that was made by the previous Labour government to secure the passage of the 1999 Act which removed six hundred and sixty-six hereditary peers. The then Lord Chancellor, Lord Derry Irvine of Lairg , gave a solemn and binding undertaking that ninety-two would remain (having been elected to do so by the whole hereditary peerage) until a comprehensive measure to reform the whole of the House of Lords membership had been accomplished. The current bill, therefore, is in clear breach of that solemn and binding undertaking.\nThroughout the debate, the principal argument advanced by Labour was that there had been fourteen wasted years in which there had been no attempt at a comprehensive Lord’s reform, and consequently, the current government is somehow absolved of its obligation to abide by its Labour predecessor’s undertaking.\nThey seem to have forgotten that the previous Labour government had a further eleven years of power after the passing of 1999 Act, in which it could have itself enacted the awaited comprehensive reform.\nNevertheless, their charge about the last fourteen years of alleged inaction is entirely mistaken.\nThe problem that has bedevilled Lord’s Reform for over a century is that, notwithstanding an appetite for reform, there has been little agreement on what it should actually be.\nIn 2011 the Conservative-led coalition went to considerable trouble, involving series of iterative votes to try and identify a consensus for reform around which the Commons could unite. On that basis it then introduced a bill that passed at second reading, and which, had it proceeded, would have put democratically elected peers into the Lords.\nThat bill failed, not because it was opposed by a minority, which included me, and who thought that it was dreadful. Rather, it failed because, in an act of party-political cynicism, Labour – having voted for it- then subsequently withdrew support for its accompanying and very generous timetable motion. This would have scuppered the whole legislative programme, so there was no alternative but to drop the measure in entirety.\nLabour ministers were not lying when they insisted that they were absolved of the Lord Chancellor’s binding promise because of ‘fourteen wasted years’. Instead, they were just plain ignorant of their own complicity.",

The shortest direct to slaughter export journey from Great Britain to continental Europe in 2018 was a journey time of 18 hours. Most domestic journeys to slaughter in the UK are significantly shorter. In 2020, the Government carried out a consultation on ending live animal exports, and 87 per cent of respondents agreed that livestock and horses should not be exported for slaughter and fattening.\nNow that the UK is no longer in the European Union, the Government can end live animal exports, further strengthening animal welfare protections. The Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Bill delivers the Government’s manifesto commitment by banning the live export of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses for slaughter and fattening. It will prevent unnecessary long export journeys, instead using shorter and less stressful domestic journeys. The Bill will ensure that animals are slaughtered domestically, in high welfare UK slaughterhouses and preventing the export to unknown and likely lower welfare slaughterhouse conditions. These new rules will still allow live animal exports in other circumstances, for example for breeding and competitions, provided they are transported in line with legal requirements aimed at protecting their welfare.\nWhile no animals have been exported for slaughter from Great Britain since the Government announced its intention to bring forward a ban in 2021, this Bill makes this permanent. This legislation reinforces the UK’s position as a world leader on animal welfare, boosting the value of British meat and helping to grow the economy.\nIt is positive that the Bill had its Second Reading in the House of Commons in December, and the Bill continues to progress through Parliament.",

On the contrary, I voted through six pages of measures to stop raw sewage going into our watercourses.\nAs a regular swimmer throughout the year in rivers and off our beaches, I have every incentive to end the pollution of our waters.\nThe Government has already made the water companies spend £3 billion to reduce their discharges. Now, with the Environment Bill and the Government’s strategic policy statement which, for the very first time by any Government, directs the regulator to ensure that water companies tackle sewage discharges.\nI will consider any new amendment to the Environment Bill that will expedite the removal of sewage from our waters and I await with interest whatever the Lords are now about to send back to the Commons.\nNevertheless, I stand by what I said after last week’s debate:\nI believe that the Environment Bill demonstrates an absolute commitment by the Government to tackling sewage discharges. It introduces an entire new chapter to the Water Industry Act 1991, which places a statutory requirement on the Government to produce a plan to reduce the discharges from storm overflows before 1 September 2022, and commits it to taking action and reporting on progress to Parliament. The Government will also be required to produce a report on the actions that would be needed to eliminate discharges from storm overflows completely in England, and their costs and benefits, before 1 September 2022.\nThe difficulty with the previous Lord’s amendment, which I voted against in the Commons, is that it put the cart before the horse: we don’t yet have a clear idea of the costs, or a plan yet for ending discharges, but the amendment wanted to outlaw the discharges before we know how to do it.\nWe rely on Victorian designed sewers that combine, in one system, all the water from our lavatories together with the water that runs off out streets when it rains. As the population has grown exponentially we’ve had to invest in expanding the capacity to treat the waste from so many more lavatories. Equally, we’ve paved over so much more of our land surfaces so that more rain enters the sewers rather than being absorbed by the ground. More importantly however, whilst we get pretty well the same amount of rain as before, the changing climate is delivering it in much more intensive bursts with which the system has not the capacity to cope, resulting in the untreated emergency discharges into our rivers\nCurrently the Storm Overflows Task Force is charged with finding out the extent of what needs to be done. Estimates of the costs vary widely by £ hundreds of billions. Before we fix a date and outlaw the discharges we need to know the scope of the work, the amount that will need to be invested and the impact it will have on our bills (the polluter pays!).\nWere we to outlaw storm discharges before can realistically be delivered, we’ll have rain water and sewage backing up in the system to flood our lavatories, streets and gardens.",

I was very tempted by Powell’s advice. In the end however, I didn’t take it, but when Labour won, I was consoled by the prospect that we would -as a consequence, have a referendum.\nWhen the referendum came in 1975 I vigorously supported the ‘No’ campaign. Alas, I was on the losing side, but that’s democracy.\nFor years previously the UK had been trying to join the Common Market in order to benefit from the free trade advantages that would accrue to the significant proportion of our trade with it’s members. Our government’s enthusiasm was based on economic gain, and our politicians persuaded themselves that the Treaty of Rome, to which we would have to accede, did not really mean what it said about evolving towards a political ‘ever closer union’.\nOur earlier attempts to join were thwarted by General de Gaulle, who did not want the UK to enjoy the same competitive advantage in the Market as France. The Irony is that whilst de Gaulle was the brake on our joining, he was also the brake on the reality of ‘ever closer union’. The end of his presidential tern in 1969 opened the way to a successful prospect for serious negotiations on UK accession, but it also gave renewed impetus towards the creation of the European Union.\nThis trajectory was already obvious to those MPs who voted against the European Communities Act 1972 and rejected Prime Minister Edward Heath’s assertion that membership entailed “no essential loss of national sovereignty”.\nThe Common Market, then the EEC, then the EU evolved in exactly the way we had foreseen and warned in the 1975 referendum campaign. I joined the Campaign for an Independent Britain and I was never reconciled to our membership, notwithstanding its economic benefits. I was not however, an enthusiast for a second referendum, having been on the losing side in 1975 and I feared that the experience would be repeated. Nevertheless, when the second referendum came in 2016, I campaigned even more vigorously than in 1975, addressing 15 public meeting across the South East of England. I was surprised and delighted by the result, even though it ended my ministerial career.\nSo, how will I vote on our newly negotiated trade deal with the EU?\nWell, before deciding I will want to have the chance to thoroughly digest it which, as I write, I have not yet had the opportunity to do, but here are the principles on which I will decide: First, I have to acknowledge the advantage for free trade arrangements with our closest and largest market, it was this that drew us into joining in the first place and reverting to tariffs and quotas will be significantly to our disadvantage.\nSecond, trading advantage however, must not be secured at the price of our sovereignty, we cannot allow ourselves any longer to be governed by people whom we did not elect and cannot remove.\nNevertheless, any trade deal comes at a price, there are trade-offs that have to be made and we have to make an assessment of the balance of advantage to be had.\nIf the price of this new trade deal is to be paid principally in fish, then that is a price I am, at least, certainly prepared to consider.",

My former colleague Claire Perry campaigned tirelessly against it and I remember being summoned to a meeting at Poulner Baptist Church to be cross-examined about what we were going to do about it. Not much yet, is the answer to that one, although we expect the Online Harms Bill to be in the Queens Speech on 10th May (though there are many legitimate reservations about the bill).\nWe can sometimes be understanding of addictive behaviour such as gambling or alcoholism.\nWatching Porn in the Commons reveals a lamentable want of judgement. Perhaps some of the coverage has revealed a want of charity too.\nIt’s Time to give Rwanda our best shot\nThis year, with estimates ranging from 60,000 to 80,000 for the number of people who will arrive on our shores in small boats, it is clear that we need policies that both reduce incentives and act as a deterrents.\nFirst, incentives – why do so many people fleeing the war zones and economic basket cases travel all the way across continents to get to Britain?\nFrom some constituents I still hear the prejudiced nonsense that they come to take advantage of easy access to our state benefits system. Actually, the benefits available in some other European jurisdictions that they pass through are significantly more generous. On the contrary, they choose to come to Britain because it is here that it is so much easier to find work.\nNotwithstanding record numbers of vacancies, we forbid asylum applicants from working. Instead, we pay them modest allowances insisting that they remain idle. Many of my parliamentary colleagues believe that this is absurd and that we should allow them to work in all those enterprises keen to employ them.\nIn my estimate this would be a mistake: it would increase the very incentive to travel all the way to Britain eschewing the opportunities to settle elsewhere along the route.\nWhat we need to address is the ease with which illegal work can be had here.\nSecond, deterrence: If you make it to Britain, even if your application for asylum is rejected, there is little prospect of you being deported, So, If we are to reduce the numbers arriving across the Channel we need the deterrent effect of that danger and expense ending up with the probability of deportation elsewhere. Some of the measures in the Borders Bill currently going through Parliament (if we can get them through the House of Lords) will address aspects of this by doing away with endless appeals and other abuses.\nThe plan to deliver arrivals to Rwanda however, has the potential to completely undermine the people-smuggler’s market: why risk thousands of pounds only to end up in Rwanda?\nI do not underestimate the difficulties of implementing this plan. I drew attention to those problems in this column on 19th November 2021 Channel Crossings 2 (desmondswaynemp.com)\nIt will be expensive, controversial and beset with snags that we will need to overcome (and I drew attention to one of them in the Commons this week), but it might just work, as it has done for Australia.\nThose who describe it as scandalous and contrary to God’s law need to come up with an alternative to the current scandal of the squalid camps around Calais, vulnerable people being fleeced by gangsters, and the dangers of the Channel. So far, all they have offered us is the hope of better co-operation with the French authorities – ignoring the fact we’ve already been paying them handsomely. And ‘opening up more safe routes to UK’.

Well, if the full force of the law is £100 fine, then so be it.\nIt is true that we require MPs to quit when guilty of serious crimes for which imprisonment is the penalty, but not for a fixed penalty notice. In the end, it comes down to how seriously you consider the PM’s breach to be.\nI am not persuaded that my expectations should be altered by the fact that the rules that the PM breached, were his very own rules. Though, more fool him for having made them.\nI opposed those rules. I thought the Government had no place to make them. By the month, as more evidence emerges of the damage that those ruled have done, I am reassured that my stance was the right one.\nI spent the first few weeks of lockdown explaining the distinction between guidance and regulation to constituents in order to reassure them that they were entitled to do things that they often thought they were forbidden to do. This was particularly the case for many sole traders who feared that they were no longer entitled to carry on their businesses. There was a clear distinction between a dwelling and a workplace.\nIn this column on 12th February Another party…and a riot ? (desmondswaynemp.com) I acknowledged that when the PM told the Commons rules were not broken and that there were no parties at number 10, a shudder went down my spine. As I said then, not because I didn’t believe him to be telling the truth, I did believe him and still do, but because I had no doubt that his honest belief of what amounted to a ‘work event’ would be considered to be a party by a great many people. Now the Police have reached that judgement too.\nI wasn’t there. I haven’t seen the evidence, but I have my doubts.\n(What was clearly a party, and a disgraceful and egregious breach if the accounts are true, was the gathering on the eve of Prince Phillip’s funeral, but on that occasion the PM was in Buckinghamshire.)\nThe deaths of so many people from Covid-19 were made so much worse by the inhumanity of regulations that prevented friends and relatives comforting the dying and comforting one another at funerals and wakes. My heart goes out to those who have written to me to express their anguish and anger about the way their loved ones died. That anger is justified by the want of judgement at No.10. I accept that, as has the Prime Minister.\nMy focus remains the much greater folly of what I still consider the disproportionate regulations themselves. I am entitled to blame the PM for them, but I must acknowledge that his Government’s efforts first to relax and then to revoke the regulations, were opposed by the opposition parties now demanding the PM’s head, but they wanted even stricter and prolonged restrictions.\nCan a Woman have a Penis?\nA Constituent emailed me to ask if I believed that a woman could have a penis.\nClearly, she wasn’t contacting me for an insight into my biological understanding and expertise.

It is as old as human experience. As for it becoming a matter of public discussion and interest, I remember reading Jan Morris’s book Conundrum about her own experience, when it was first published way back in 1974.\nPersonally, I don’t have a problem with people, who are uncomfortable with their biological sex, identifying as the opposite gender. It does me no harm to me and it isn’t my business to enquire after the personal choices of others: live and let live.\nThere is a proper distinction to be drawn however, when it comes to a man who identifies a woman, yet retains his male genitals, being admitted to exclusive female facilities such as changing rooms, toilets, hospital wards, and even prisons. I find it difficult to comprehend that some people even question this, let alone mercilessly persecute female academics and authors who have sought to protect these exclusive biologically female spaces.\nNow let’s come to the question of ‘conversion therapies’: There is little disagreement that the more cruel and brutal parts of conversion therapy should be banned, indeed current legislation already outlaws the more egregious aspects. There are important interventions however, that need to be thoroughly explored and which must not be caught by the ‘chilling effect’ of ill-defined and poorly thought through legislation. It is crucial that teenagers with gender dysphoria receive support from medical and psychological professionals before they take irrevocable decisions about a transition, which they might later regret. This is not attempted conversion, but merely investigating the causes of gender dysphoria, which can be numerous and complex.\nThere are particular concerns about the exposure of children to radically progressive ideas concerning sex and gender. We must avoid heading down a road where a generation of young people are taught to think that it is normal to transition to a different gender before becoming an adult.\nFinally, Women have been fighting for decades for their sport to achieve the same status and prize money as men, yet we now find ourselves in a situation where biological males can announce themselves to be female and proceed to blow their biologically female opponents out of the water. This is ridiculous. Biological men should compete with biological men and biological women with biological women. A compromise might be to create transgender events where those who have transitioned are able to compete against each other on a level playing field, rather than denying those who have been training for an event their whole lives a fair shot at glory.\nEnergy Bills\nI have received a large number of emails about the rise in energy bills.\nSome have asked for a windfall tax on the oil companies to generate revenue that can then be used to reduce consumer bills. I addressed what I consider to be the folly of a windfall tax in this column last week.\nThe Chancellor announced a £9 billion package in February to provide some relief through council tax rebates and a scheme for spreading costs over the next two years. This will help but it represents only a fraction of the increased bills that we all face.\nEnergy prices are determined by supply and demand in international markets and are beyond the control of any government. Growth in international demand relative to the supplies available was already driving prices up as economies recovered from the Covid pandemic. The impact of war in Ukraine and the sanctions that we imposed on Russia sent the prices of oil and gas through the roof. As I said in the Commons, when we impose sanctions on Russia, we are also imposing them on ourselves. The only consolation is the privations that we will endure are as nothing, compared to the suffering of the people of Ukraine. There are a number of sources of assistance for people worried about their energy bills or falling into debt. Smart Energy GB has worked with the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action to provide simple and helpful advice which can be found on their websites. Many other organisations also provide advice and support, such as Age UK and the British Gas Energy Trust.\nPeople who prepay for their energy might benefit from upgrading to a smart prepayment meter which provide new ways to top up online, over the phone, by text, or by smart phone apps. The accurate and near real-time data allows energy suppliers support prepay customers more easily, by offering tailored support assistance as emergency payment applied directly to the meter, or advice on managing energy costs.\nIn the end there is no way of getting over the fact that we have to pay for the energy that we use to heat our homes, and we need to reconcile ourselves to using less of it.\nThese days may come again\nAfghanistan 6\nIn anticipation of the forthcoming Afghanistan Pledging Conference, I attended a seminar in which the desperate plight of the situation in Afghanistan was brought home to us: the economy has collapsed and people are starving. The obscenity is that food is available but there is no cash to buy it. The plea, which was made by western charities, was for more Aid and for a solution to the liquidity problem by unfreezing assets held by the Afghan Central Bank overseas and committed to Afghanistan before Taliban takeover.\nThe presenters insisted that there is now an opportunity to influence the Taliban by the generosity of our response, and that were we not to do so, that influence would instead be acquired by China and Russia with their rather less delicate sensitivities.\nI ventured that it was my prejudice that the response of the West would be conditioned by the willingness of the Taliban to demonstrate their commitment to the undertakings they have given on Women’s Rights and to no reprisals against servants of the former regime. Alas, the day after that seminar, the Taliban cancelled the return of girls to secondary schools.\nAnother question on which we might reflect, given our 20 year commitment to Afghanistan in blood and treasure, is this: As we look at the example of Ukrainians fighting to the death for their country, why was it that such a will to resist on the part of the whole of civil society was not so evident in Afghanistan?\nUkraine 4\nA number of arm-chair experts have sent me their criticisms of the Homes for Ukraine scheme that the Government has launched. This scheme hasn’t just been plucked out of the air, rather it is modelled on a successful scheme that was developed and implemented in Canada for Syrian refugees. We hope it will be equally successful here but there is an element of ‘suck it and see’.\nHosts have to commit to 6 months, some won’t manage to stick it out, some will extend their hospitality well beyond and some won’t. Undoubtedly other hosts will come forward to take up the slack, but in the event of there not being sufficient, then the burden will fall on local authorities to find accommodation. In that eventuality it is worth remembering that there are still 12,000 Afghans accommodated in hotels since last August to find homes for.\nWindfall\nA windfall tax on oil companies, demanded by the opposition parties, would deliver a short-term gain for the exchequer – which could be passed on to hard pressed tax-payers and consumers.\nIt would however, be an irresponsible expedient at the expense of the long-term interests of the very same tax-payers and consumers.\nWe live and work in an international economy where we compete for investment to generate jobs, productivity and -so proceeding- greater prosperity. The key to this competitive process is to present ourselves as a stable, predictable and business-friendly jurisdiction. Few things could be more damaging to that reputation than arbitrary taxes imposed on enterprises because the markets have delivered them unexpectedly high profits.\nThe proper course for a country that wants to become and to remain prosperous, is to design a tax system that incentivises the reinvestment of profits in to more productive enterprises.\nAdvocates of a windfall, often pray in aid the windfall tax imposed on the Banks in the early years of Lady Thatcher’s government. Though I’ve worshipped at her shrine too, she wasn’t perfect and that tax was one of her mistakes.\nNazanin\nThe welcome for the return of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was universal. Nothing should dampen the joy of seeing her family reunited. I visited her husband Richard twice during his hunger vigils -once outside the Iranian Embassy and, more recently outside the Foreign Office. He has proved a magnificent and brave campaigner, matching his wife’s courage and endurance at Evin prison in Iran.\nThe reality we cannot escape from however, is that Iran took Nazanin as a hostage and we have paid a ransom for her return.\nThe historical £400 million debt that we owed to Iran was indeed legitimate: In the nineteen seventies the Shah of Iran ordered and paid for UK tanks for his army. They were never delivered because the Iranian Revolution brought to power a regime that we could not possibly of have justified arming. That regime, in breach of all international standards and law, took 52 US diplomats hostage. Since when, international financial sanctions, in one form or another, have prevented the settlement of the debt we owed to Iran.\nThe secret terms of the treaty we signed, we are assured, prevent the £400 million being spent on any of Iran’s current military adventures in Syria, support for the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon or any of its other sponsorship of terrorism. On the contrary, it must be spent on humanitarian objectives. This fig leaf, the exact terms of which we are prevented from knowing, is our comfort blanket, reassuring us that we really didn’t pay a ransom after all; No, we just settled an historic debt that we genuinely owed and that we’ve done the just and honourable thing.\nNotwithstanding my joy for the return of Nazanin, I cannot be alone in believing that Iran has secured what it set out to achieve when it took her hostage in the first place.\nA precedent has been set and the world is a more dangerous place as a consequence.\nAnyone who travels to jurisdictions beyond the ‘rule-of-law’ -as we understand that term in western liberal democracy, places themselves at huge risk.\nUkraine 3\nFrom the very start the UK has been out in front of the pack on Ukraine: We trained 22,000 of their troops over the last few years and armed them with anti-tank weapons: We made public the classified intelligence spelling out exactly what Russia was planning. Some of our allies were sceptical, but our ministers travelled relentlessly to European capitals to repeat the warnings.\nWhen it came to the crunch we froze more Russian Assets than the USA and very much more than the EU.\nOur humanitarian assistance to countries bordering Ukraine taking the refugee crisis, has been\nfaultless.\nI have been inundated however, with complaints about our dilatory response on the issue of Ukrainian refugees.\nSecurity is important: bona fides do need checking; there will be Russian agents and migrants from other countries masquerading as Ukrainians: we cannot just open the door without checking.\nI have no difficulty with the two schemes that have been announced which strike me as fair and proportionate. I anticipate that family sponsored refugees will mostly dwell with their families that sponsored them. Equally individual and community sponsored refugees will reside in the housing that their sponsors have identified. This is an important consideration. Shortage of housing is easily the biggest headache in my inbox; and we still have 12,000 Afghan refugees in hotels to find homes for.\nWhat has driven me, my correspondents and my parliamentary colleagues into a state of rage is the lamentable implementation of these schemes.\nWhen many thought we were ‘crying wolf’, ministers really believed our own intelligence sources that an invasion was coming with all its predictable consequences – so we had weeks to plan and deploy forward processing centres in countries bordering Ukraine, well in advance of the arrival of refugees. It is deeply regrettable that this week we were still acquiring premises and defining the details on the schemes.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 16\n- 17\n- 18\n- 19\n- 20\n- …\n- 59\n- Next Page »",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_tolerating-sharia-evidence-contempt/content_293.html": "The report by Sir Eric Pickles on electoral fraud , with his criticism of the police for failure to pursue investigations with sufficient vigour, fits into a pattern of establishment cowardice when dealing with issues that have a minority ethnic or religious dimension. The initial dilatory response to the child sex scandals in Huddersfield, Dewsbury, Rochdale and Rotherham would be another example, as would the slow response to the early warnings of the ‘Trojan horse’ Islamic takeover of schools in Birmingham.\nActually, cowardice on the part of the establishment is the wrong diagnosis. A more accurate description of the condition is ‘contempt’ on its part. It is evidence of a wider culture of low expectations. We might sum this despicable attitude up thus: It is because these minorities are not considered our equals and certainly not up to our own exacting standards, that we have to tolerate their dodgy electoral arrangements. They are not really like us, so we won’t interfere with their systematic grooming and exploitation of young and vulnerable women (whom we consider as even more worthy of our contempt). And so on, as different and lower standards are expected.\nIt is rarely explicit, more often subliminal, but never the less evidence of a deep seated racism.\nLet me hazard another such example of this profoundly unhealthy attitude: our tolerance of Sharia tribunals; which substantially disadvantage the rights of women in cases of divorce and inheritance.\nWe no longer stand for such treatment for our own daughters, but we turn a blind eye on such treatment for less fortunate daughters. We hide behind the excuse –the fiction even – that these are entirely voluntary arrangements and that justice can always be had on application to our courts.\nWhat could be considered ‘voluntary’ in the arrangements of a young woman, sometimes even unable to speak our native language, cowed by family and community, and whose only spokesman might be an entirely unelected ‘community leader’?\nEarlier this year the Home Secretary, now our Prime Minister, appointed Professor Mona Siddiqui to look into the application of Sharia. I hope her report won’t be a whitewash, because tolerating different standards of justice for separate communities is a potent example of our contempt for them.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_visit-republic-china-taiwan/content_281.html": "(First published in the Forest Journal 6/10/16)\nI spent last week travelling with a parliamentary delegation to the Republic of China (Taiwan: the Island of Formosa; and distinct from the People’s Republic of China –the world’s most populous -and communist- state, occupying the Chinese mainland).\nWith a population of only 21 million, nevertheless Taiwan retains its position as one of the Asian ‘tiger economies’ and a major exporter of IT equipment including laptop computers. We benefit from extensive trade and investment with Taiwan and it is just the sort of country with which we need to encourage even closer political, trade and investment relationships as we leave the EU.\nAs it happens, our parliamentary delegation coincided with the visit by our own UK trade minister, with whom we met whilst there in order to share our insights and common objectives.\nDespite our tour being disrupted by a devastating Typhoon we still managed to conduct the greater part of our planned programme of discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Vice-President, The Speaker, our fellow legislators, and the Chairman of the Defence and Security Council. In addition, we spent half a day in a University Hospital because one of my parliamentary colleagues has a particular interest as a member of the Commons Health Select Committee. The Taiwan universal healthcare system is based on insurance and affordable co-payments (people with serious and chronic conditions have their co-payments waived). Remarkably there are no waiting lists for treatment at all.\nI have hitherto been rather sceptical of the value these sorts of visits and It’s the first I’ve been on in 19 years. Equally, one has to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch: the entire cost of the visit, and the invitation also included my wife, was met by the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Clearly, they have their own agenda of building goodwill and alliances in an increasingly strategically important, and contested region. The militarisation of the South China Sea by China, and its strident claims to sovereignty over the islands, including Taiwan itself, threaten the stability of the whole region. Taiwan needs friends and Allies. We too, also need to build friendships and alliances. This is a region where we have a colonial history and where both we and the USA retain vital national interests. We do need to be clear and realistic however, in balancing our proper support for democracy and shared values in Taiwan, along with our desire for greater trade, with the implications this will have for the growing importance of our relationship with China.\nI last went on such a trip back in 1996. It was to Germany together with Theresa May, courtesy of the Conrad Adenauer Stiftung. My abiding memory is that she tuned up at the airport with no more than a large handbag. Yet everyday she appeared immaculately turned out in a different outfit. I imagined that the outfits must have been freeze dried and flown out overnight.",

As you will be aware, the Bill contains a large number of measures with the central aim of cutting crime and building safe communities.\nAt the last election, I was elected on a manifesto to restore confidence in the criminal justice system and this Bill delivers that pledge made to my constituents.\nThis Bill seeks to equip the police with the powers and tools they need to protect themselves and the public, while overhauling sentencing laws to keep serious sexual and violent offenders behind bars for longer, and placing greater emphasis on rehabilitation to better help offenders to turn their lives around and prevent further crimes.\nI welcome the fact that this legislation builds on the work already underway across Government to deliver a smarter, fairer justice system as the UK builds back safer from the Coronavirus pandemic. I am particularly encouraged by the hundreds of millions being invested in our court system to deliver speedier justice and reduce delays. It is also vital that victims receive the support they need and deserve, and ministers are investing unprecedented funding for victims support services. The funding package for the police and the recruitment of 20,000 police officers alongside the £4 billion investment in extra prison places will ensure these reforms are successful.\nI am confident that the measures in this Bill are necessary and proportionate. It is important to remember that the Bill is about tougher sentences for the most serious offenders, better protection for the police and a greater focus on ensuring offenders can turn their lives around and rehabilitate back into society.\nI appreciate you may not agree with my views on this; however, I hope this response has outlined why I believe this is a fair and balanced approach to the criminal justice system.\nDS.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_cutting-aid/content_825.html": "I was the Minister for International Development who shepherded the Act, which placed a statutory duty on government to pay 0.7% of GDP in Official Development Assistance, through all its Commons stages.\nIt is now to be replaced which is particularly worrying because, if the full payment is not made in any year, the Act only requires a statement from the Secretary of State in both Houses explaining why.\nTo amend or repeal the Act would appear to indicate a much longer-term intention to set aside the commitment.\nI do not doubt that this measure is popular, I have had any number of complaints about overseas aid, even before we met the 0.7% commitment and protected it in statute.\nMost people consider such aid to be charity and, accordingly, believe that it should ‘begin at home’ (thereby completely misinterpreting the meaning of the phrase, which was coined as a challenge to people who flaunted their philanthropy in public whilst treating their family and employees with meanness).\nCharity is something you give away freely without any expectation of return.\nInternational aid is not charity, rather it is an investment we make in the expectation that we may prosper and trade in a more stable and secure world, less prone to insecurity and waves of migration.\nIt is also a ‘soft power’ by which we project our influence abroad. In this respect it is much more versatile and deployable than our investment in our military capability to project power.\nI do not doubt that our retention of a seat at the UN security council owes more nowadays to the fact that we are the World’s second largest donor, rather than that we remain a nuclear power.\nThere are many things I would wish to see reformed about our aid effort. Jus for starters, it needs to be even more focussed on economic development and ability to trade: when I was the minister I would constantly remind people that ‘aid is all about jobs’.\nBut we are in queer street: the Chancellor has told us that our Economic crisis is only just beginning. We are at greater risk of further economic shocks because we are borrowing so much. George Osborne used to constantly remind us of the need to ‘fix the roof while the Sun is shining’, well now the roof’s been blown away.\nSo, protecting any item of public expenditure comes down to a question of priorities. I know most of my constituents will disagree, but I believe that as we re-establish ourselves as an independent power outside the EU and seek to increase our influence in the counsels of the World, then cutting our International Development Aid is a wrong priority.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_apocalypse/content_670.html": "At this time of year I’ve often used this column to reflect on doom-laden prophesies about what to expect in the year ahead. After all, It’s that magnificent time when we can wallow in the short dark days and add to the gloom with blood-curdling predictions of disasters.\nA couple of weeks ago, notwithstanding that we are still wrestling with our current pandemic, Dr Jenny Harries, the head of our UK Health Security Agency -what Stalinist mind thought up that nomenclature? – warned us that the next pandemic could be much worse.\nWell, she could be right, but equally she could be spectacularly wrong: There is no scientific basis for her supposition. Whether her speculations were designed to be helpful, or simply to terrify us, is a matter for conjecture, but a number of people have been suggesting -from the outset- that our fears of the current pandemic were overblown. Personally, I was well ahead of Dr Harries: right at the start, I warned in the Commons that one day there may be a disease that will threaten our very survival; but that Covid certainly isn’t it – and that future generations will wonder at our collective acts of self-harm in our response to it.\nFor those of us who wallow in predictions of the dreadful prospects that the future holds, I recommend my favourite book of all time: The Coffee Table Book of Doom, which was published a few years ago by Art Lester and Steven Appleby. Here is a flavour from the advertising blurb:\n“…with the apocalypse at hand, don’t fret about dying uninformed. The Coffee Table Book of Doom is a revelatory, brilliantly funny, superbly illustrated and erudite compendium of all the 27 doom-laden horsemen we need to worry about – personal doom, gender erosion, asteroid impact, pandemics, super storms, sexual ruin – and much more besides.”\nI can’t speak for all 27 doom laden horsemen but surely we’ve had enough of pandemics and aren’t tired of the continued interference in our enterprises, personal choices, and our way of life from politicians who believe that they are best placed to make decisions on our behalf, rather that treating us as adults capable of assessing risks and acting sensibly?\nAnyway, there is still plenty to worry about: there is a volcano under a lake near Naples rumbling away and if it blows it will make Vesuvius look like a camp fire. The lava lake under Yellowstone Park could go at any moment, taking most of the USA with it…but then the volcanic cloud it might darken the skies, cool the planet and save us from climate change. Alternatively, it might reduce harvests to the extent that we all starve….\nEvery generation since we were expelled from the Garden of Eden has speculated that it might be the last, but we’re still here.",

Yet the main effort of the first weeks after the election was clearly something quite different: The new administration was determined to frame a narrative in the public mind that it had been bequeathed a disastrous legacy by the wicked Tories who had pursued a ‘scorched earth policy’ leaving behind a wasteland, everything broken and a massive financial black hole; And that, as a consequence, things would have to get worse before they could get better, and the Government was going to have to do some very painful stuff by withdrawing Winter Fuel Allowance from some nine million pensioners, with much worse to follow in the Budget on October 30th.\nThis political strategy has a long lineage: You get into Government and announce that you never realised things were really this bad. The Coalition Government did exactly that in 2010 when it inherited from Labour a financial deficit of fully 10% of the national income, which dwarfs the mere 4% (and already in steep decline) that the new Labour Government inherited this July.\nNevertheless, Labour’s pursuit of this same strategy was clearly at odds with their stated priority of securing growth through investment, which requires confidence and optimism, not the misery spouting from government commentary. Little wonder that business confidence, which had been soaring, plummeted.\nThe Government’s stated priority would have been much better served by rehearsing the positives that it had inherited Viz. the fastest growth and the second lowest debt in the G7, inflation firmly under control and interest rates falling, record low unemployment. All of which is now at risk as a consequence of the bucket of cold water that the Government has poured over them.\nAdd into this mix ‘wardrobe-gate’ and the mayhem in 10 Downing Street with the defenestration of the PM’s Chief of Staff, Sue Gray, and it makes nonsense the corporate stooges who wrote to The Times last week praising political stability.",

So, long may he continue to ‘tweet unrestrained’.\nOn the policy itself, I entirely support it. But we fool ourselves if we think we can stop the boats without the enthusiastic co-operation of France. Currently, French intervention stops about a third of crossings. If, by increasing our financial contribution, we can get them to significantly raise their game, then we will have got ourselves a bargain compared to the ever-increasing costs of dealing with those who make it to our shores.\nWe need to keep in mind that this is an international problem to which international solutions have to be found. France is having as much difficulty at its own border with Italy as we are having with the Channel. Already this year 20,000 migrants have arrived in boats on the Italian mainland.\nOf course, Europe has to find ways of protecting its borders and I am confident that they will increasingly start to embrace the policies that the UK is now adopting. Ultimately however, we must tackle the problem at source: the conditions that are driving mass migrations in the first place.\nWhen I was the Minister for International Development, I recall visiting the largest refugee camp in the world. The UNHCR had provided housing well above the standard available in so many settlements in developing middle-income countries. The world Food Programme provided clean water and enough to eat. UNICEF was educating the Children. The host country’s police and army ensured a level of order and security uncommon elsewhere.\nOn balance, the refugees were getting a level of support that would be difficult to match in much of the world.\nNevertheless, there was a significant flow of refugees leaving and risking all that they had to pay gangsters to traffic them elsewhere, in pursuit of the one thing that that refugee camp could not provide: a livelihood.\nIf we are to have a prospect of solving migration we need to invest in providing the opportunity of earning a living in those parts of the world where that prospect is remote. As I kept saying to anyone who would listen, “it’s all about jobs”.\n50 years ago, the rich nations pledged to invest 0.7 % of their national incomes in the poorer developing world. Most have never honoured that pledge at all. It took us the UK until 2011 to reach that pledge, but it only lasted until 2019. If all the wealthy nations had honoured their pledge when they made it, then perhaps we would not be having to cope with the current levels of migration that are overwhelming us.",

Several send me a daily email.

Not because I didn’t believe him, but because I was sure that, what he honestly considered to be ‘work events’, others would judge to be parties.\nThe extent of the gulf between these two very different perceptions will only be revealed when we have the facts. That is why I insist on reserving judgement until we get the full account of what took place: when the police investigation concludes and Sue Gray can reveal all the detail that she knows.\nThis week several correspondents have emailed me the latest photograph of the PM at a party; “banged to rights”; “guilty as charged”. How can I any longer hide behind the excuse of awaiting the outcome of the inquiry when the evidence is before my eyes and in full colour…”of course the photo proves he is a liar -there he is actually at the party!”\nAs I look at the photo all I see is the PM standing in an office together with two colleagues, one of whom is seated in front of a screen (apparently he was hosting a workplace Christmas quiz over zoom). It is true that the fellow seated is sporting a string of tinsel and there is an open bottle of Champagne on the table. Nevertheless, if this ‘shock new revelation’ is the best they’ve got, then the PM would appear to be off the hook: it was no party.\nNo doubt, there is plenty more evidence for the police to sift through and which Sue Gray has yet to reveal to us. I will be patient and await the outcome.\nPublic commentary on broadcast media is even more vitriolic than some of my emails. Take, for example, the furore over Sir Keir Starmer escaping from a howling mob, outraged by his alleged failure to prosecute Jimmy Saville and -by implication in the commentary- they were clearly orchestrated by the PM’s remarks.\nHaving examined the footage for myself, they were only a handful of anti-vaxers led by Piers Corbyn; I heard them shouting, demanding to know why Sir Keir hadn’t backed Julian Assange; why he has abandoned the working class; why he has embraced the ‘new world order’ -whatever that may be.\nYes, there was a shout about Saville, but the notion that the activities of this bunch had been motivated by ill-chosen remarks from the PM is a measure of just how hysterical our broadcast news reporting has become.",

The difficulty is that it will not be treated as a sexual offence and offenders cannot be placed on the register. A new statutory offence is therefore desirable.\nEssentially, up-skirting is the reverse of ‘flashing’: it is another way in which a perverted individual attempts to exert sexual power over another.\nThe sooner the new bill becomes an act, the better",

But what will the Navy be able to do that Border Force cutters are not already doing: Which is rescuing the illegal migrants in accordance with the International Law of the Sea; bringing them ashore; processing their claims; providing them with accommodation and the rest…\nWhat else do we expect them to do -ask them nicely to turn around, or threaten to sink them?\nNigel Farage alleges that notwithstanding the substantial payments that the UK makes to France to maintain the security of our border and the treaty obligations placed upon the French authorities, they are nevertheless escorting the boats into UK waters whilst showing insufficient zeal in tackling the people trafficking networks operating from French shores.\nIt is not clear to what extent this is an accurate picture, but the opinion columns of our daily newspapers demand a new and more robust treaty with France. Calling for a new treaty is the easy bit, but it begs the question of what is in it for the French.\nWe have returned a tiny proportion of those who have illegally managed to get here. Simply condemning the Government’s miserable performance on this score ignores the difficulty in securing the agreement of countries to which we might seek to return them, and our own courts which interpret human rights legislation to frustrate deportations.\nSo long as migrants can secure entry to the UK illegally in the expectation that they will be able to remain, the queue of those trying will continue to grow.\nThe real question is one of political will: Are we prepared to withdraw from treaty obligations; repeal human rights legislation; and take punitive measures against migrants for breaking the law by entering the country illegally.\nHave we the appetite for this?\nIs there really an the political consensus that would be necessary to drive such an agenda forward?",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_inflation-4/content_472.html": "In this column on 21st June Inflation -3 (desmondswaynemp.com) I expressed my concerns that that the Bank of England was in danger of causing a recession by driving interest rates too high.\nI have always believed that the real source of inflation was disproportionate growth in the quantity of money relative to the goods and services available for it to buy. Money, like any commodity, has a value inversely proportional to the quantity available of it. It was for precisely for this reason that primitive societies quickly abandoned experiments using seashells as a form of money.\nSince the banking crisis of 2008 we have increased the quantity of money by 50%, with half of that increase taking place in response to the Covid pandemic since 2020.\nIt is quite technical, but the increase was almost exclusively engineered by the Bank of England’s policy of quantitative easing, euphemistically referred to as ‘printing money’ but, in reality, buying up debt in the form of corporate bonds to make credit readily available.\nIt was almost as if we had become addicted to it: it went on for years\nThe purpose of the policy was to prevent the economy going into recession following the banking crisis and then the pandemic, but it just kept being extended.\nMany companies which, in ordinary circumstances, would have folded when their business models no longer responded effectively to changing consumer demand, remained afloat and were kept alive on cheap credit. In a properly functioning market they would have been liquidated and their resources would have gone into more productive enterprise.\nThough, I quite understand the Bank of England’s motive in seeking to avoid recession, the task that it was primarily charged with was the control of inflation. My belief is that, on the contrary, its monetary expansion was the principal driver of inflation.\nNow however, after putting the policy into reverse with a bout of ‘quantitative tightening’ -selling so many of the bonds it had earlier purchased – the money supply growth is firmly back under control. This should, after a time lag, bring inflation down. After all, it took a considerable time for inflation to result from the earlier monetary expansion.\nThe danger now is that, by continuing to raise interest rates, the Bank of England, is making mortgage holders and debtors so much poorer, which will drive the economy into recession quite unnecessarily, instead of waiting for the monetary contraction that it has lately engineered, to take effect.\nIt is very frustrating to watch, but politicians gave up control of monetary policy to the Bank of England with Gordon Brown’s reforms in 1997. Perhaps it’s time to take back control",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_southport-levelling-with-the-public/content_167.html": "There are two issues that arise from the grotesque murder of children at a dance class in Southport. The first is how Axel Rudakubana, being well known to the authorities and thrice referred to the anti- terrorist ‘Prevent’ programme, avoided surveillance. The Home Secretary has made it clear that this is properly to be subject to an inquiry.\nThe second concerns whether the riots, which followed the murders, might have been prevented had the authorities been more candid with the public. The Home secretary avoided answering whether this too would be subject to the inquiry.\nThe riots were inexcusable and should not be blamed on anyone but the rioters. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to ask if they might have been prevented.\nThe Home Secretary’s statement on Tuesday was immediately preceded by that of the Parliamentary Under- Secretary for Communities entitled ‘a statement on community engagement principles and extremism’. I put it to him that “when a crime has the attributes of a terrorist outrage, but the police, in their engagement with the community, proactively announce that it is not initially being treated as such, is that not bound to give rise to public suspicion that the truth is being covered up?”\nThe Minister replied “I do not know what in particular the right hon. Gentleman is referring to”, which is absurd given that his statement had been prompted by the Prime Minister’s words in Downing Street that morning on the Southport murders. The minister’s response is exactly the sort of obfuscation that may have been a contributory factor in the rioting that followed the murders.\nThe authorities were aware that Rudakubana had been referred to the Prevent programme. That he possessed an al-Qaeda manual and the poison Ricin (themselves offences under the Terrorism Act 2006).\nThese facts were not disclosed to the public in case a fair trial was subsequently prejudiced. But was it necessary for the public to have been told, as they were, that there was no evidence that the carnage was motivated by terrorism and that it was not being investigated as such?\nIt was into this void that suspicion of a cover-up and misinformation spilled online, some of it, apparently, originating from hostile states, and fuelling the riots.\nWould being more open with the public have prevented riots?\nI don’t know, but it is a fair question to ask.\nWould being more open really have prejudiced Rudakubana’s trial?\nI doubt it. After all, the authorities released this information in October before the trial began. If it wasn’t prejudicial in October, why would it have been prejudicial last August?\nJonathan Hall KC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said this “The Government has to be aware…that if there is an information gap…then there are other voices, particularly in social media, who will try and fill it….If there is any information you can give, put it in the public domain, and be really careful that you don’t fall into the trap of saying ‘we can only say zilch, because there are criminal proceedings….Quite often, there’s a fair amount…that can be put into the public domain…. just saying ‘there’s a charge, we can’t say any more’, is not going to cut it these days.”\nI think he’s right and the authorities got it wrong last August. The Inquiry should examine it.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_author_dswayne_page_37/content_829.html": "In the second election campaign of 1974, the Labour party’s manifesto offered the prospect of a referendum on our continued membership of the Common Market, which we had joined without a plebiscite and only on the strength of Parliament passing The European Communities Act 1972.\nEnoch Powell, a former Conservative minister, urged Conservatives to vote Labour in that election in order to be able to take advantage of its referendum offer. I was very tempted by Powell’s advice. In the end however, I didn’t take it, but when Labour won, I was consoled by the prospect that we would -as a consequence, have a referendum.\nWhen the referendum came in 1975 I vigorously supported the ‘No’ campaign. Alas, I was on the losing side, but that’s democracy.\nFor years previously the UK had been trying to join the Common Market in order to benefit from the free trade advantages that would accrue to the significant proportion of our trade with it’s members. Our government’s enthusiasm was based on economic gain, and our politicians persuaded themselves that the Treaty of Rome, to which we would have to accede, did not really mean what it said about evolving towards a political ‘ever closer union’.\nOur earlier attempts to join were thwarted by General de Gaulle, who did not want the UK to enjoy the same competitive advantage in the Market as France. The Irony is that whilst de Gaulle was the brake on our joining, he was also the brake on the reality of ‘ever closer union’. The end of his presidential tern in 1969 opened the way to a successful prospect for serious negotiations on UK accession, but it also gave renewed impetus towards the creation of the European Union.\nThis trajectory was already obvious to those MPs who voted against the European Communities Act 1972 and rejected Prime Minister Edward Heath’s assertion that membership entailed “no essential loss of national sovereignty”.\nThe Common Market, then the EEC, then the EU evolved in exactly the way we had foreseen and warned in the 1975 referendum campaign. I joined the Campaign for an Independent Britain and I was never reconciled to our membership, notwithstanding its economic benefits. I was not however, an enthusiast for a second referendum, having been on the losing side in 1975 and I feared that the experience would be repeated. Nevertheless, when the second referendum came in 2016, I campaigned even more vigorously than in 1975, addressing 15 public meeting across the South East of England. I was surprised and delighted by the result, even though it ended my ministerial career.\nSo, how will I vote on our newly negotiated trade deal with the EU?\nWell, before deciding I will want to have the chance to thoroughly digest it which, as I write, I have not yet had the opportunity to do, but here are the principles on which I will decide: First, I have to acknowledge the advantage for free trade arrangements with our closest and largest market, it was this that drew us into joining in the first place and reverting to tariffs and quotas will be significantly to our disadvantage.\nSecond, trading advantage however, must not be secured at the price of our sovereignty, we cannot allow ourselves any longer to be governed by people whom we did not elect and cannot remove.\nNevertheless, any trade deal comes at a price, there are trade-offs that have to be made and we have to make an assessment of the balance of advantage to be had.\nIf the price of this new trade deal is to be paid principally in fish, then that is a price I am, at least, certainly prepared to consider.\nPro-Vax\nI was interviewed for a documentary about movements opposed to Coronavirus regulations and any kind of coercion in the vaccination programme, to be broadcast in January.\nI have voted against coronavirus regulations, and am opposed any suggestion of coercion in the vaccination programme, as will have been clear by my earlier contributions to this column.\nThe Programme’s producer showed me a video by an organisation which raised questions about vaccination which included extracts from a speech I made in the Commons. She asked me if I had previously known about the video or if my permission had been sought. Well, I didn’t know, but I couldn’t object: proceedings in parliament are everyone’s property. Overall, the video was, despite a rather sinister voice-over, not on the loopier end of the Anti-Vax spectrum.\nNow, I don’t want to be offensive, but clearly, whilst most are sane enough, some of the anti-vax emails that I get are from constituents who are clearly deranged, some others are just a bit odd.\nThere is a spectrum: belief that the vaccination is an excuse to inject us with microchips to control our subsequent behaviour, is obviously at the nuttier end. Where expressions of concern about the speed at which vaccines have been tested and approved, come at the other end.\nTo be fair the ‘normal to nutty’ proportions do not differ significantly between anti-vax emailers and those who email me on any other subject, or indeed those who take the trouble to write to me.\nI am not ‘anti-vax’. As a child, my father’s occupation took me to all sorts of remote places, as a soldier I served where there were issues with biological weapons, as a minister I visited some of the world’s poorest and most conflicted places. Consequently, I have been vaccinated against almost every medical condition, perhaps with the exception of rigor mortis.\nOn the contrary, I see vaccination as the escape clause from our current enforced confinement with all its devastating economic consequences: The more people who are vaccinated the better, and the sooner the better.\nThe thrust of the interview however, was to explore whether anti-vax opinions, being injurious to our public health policy, ought to be censored on social media and any other platform.\nI am deeply nervous about extent to which we allow the ‘tech giants’, or any other agency, to censor views of which they ( and we) disapprove.\nI believe in freedom of expression, and that there is no right of ‘not to being offended’. Equally, we are under no obligation to respect opinions with which we disagree, we have every right to argue robustly against them.\nAnd that is the proper course with the anti-vax movement: not to silence them, but to defeat them by exposing the falsehood of their claims.\nCurrently most of my emails are from people wanting to be vaccinated immediately, and who believe I can pull strings to get them to the front of the queue. Alas, I can’t, but I understand their enthusiasm.\nMore on Vaccines\nlast week, in this column, I explored a number of questions surrounding explicit and implicit coercive pressure to receive Covid-19 Vaccinations.\nI can understand the enthusiasm from some industries to open up again -in particular hospitality (but by no means exclusively) – so much so that they might advertise service provision exclusively to vaccinated patrons.\nIt would make no scientific sense however: None of the vaccines that are available, or are about to become available have been tested with respect to their ability to reduce transmission. They have only been tested on their ability to reduce the severity of the recipient’s reaction to a dose of the virus. So, the rationale for having the vaccination is to protect yourself, we do not know if it will protect others from you.\nNotwithstanding the irrationality of excluding non-vaccinated patrons from premises, does our respect for the property rights of proprietors nevertheless extend to allowing them to exercise their right to exclude any customers, however irrational: I don’t think so. As a society we have moved beyond such an elevated view of the rights of property. For years now, equality legislation has constrained the rights of commercial undertaking from discriminating against categories of customers of whom they may disapprove. The unvaccinated should not be so excluded either.\nThe vaccination process is going to be a long haul until a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated to afford us ‘herd immunity’. I suspect it may well take until the summer or longer. So, I do nor depart from the position that I originally took, and still urge on the Government: Namely, that the virus is not particularly dangerous to anyone outside the groups with specific vulnerabilities, so it would have been much more proportionate to have designed measures to protect them, rather than to have imposed measures on everyone with truly devastating economic and other consequences.\nThe statistical basis upon which the most damaging restrictions were made have always, in my opinion, been highly suspect. Now government itself has had to recognise that decisions were made on an insecure foundation. On 30 October the Office for National Statistics reported that infection had doubled between 2nd October, and 17 October -from 4.89 infected people per 10,000 to 9.52 infected people per 10,000. It was on this alarming basis that a second national lockdown was imposed upon us. Well, they have now revised that estimate of 17 Oct right back down, and that the rate never went above 6.62 people per 10,000 and that wasn’t until well into the lockdown on 12 November.\nVaccination Passports\nLast month it was reported that the Secretary of State for Health, whilst being interviewed, refused to rule out the possibility of compulsory vaccination for Coronavirus. This week the newly appointed minister with special responsibility for the vaccine programme suggested instead, that having the vaccine would be a ‘passport’ to being able to do things that might otherwise be denied -such as visiting a pub, cinema, or using public transport.\nFor months worried constituents have been contacting me to voice their fears that vaccination would be compulsory. I have responded by saying that they should not worry because it is unthinkable.\nUnder existing law it would constitute an assault: So primary legislation in Parliament would be required to enable it, and that in my estimate a majority would not be found for such a radical departure. It would set a worrying precedent for other vaccines, medicines and medical procedures.\nI expect however, that the concept of a vaccination certificate being used as a passport to freedoms and opportunities which would otherwise be denied, might be more palatable -superficially at least.\nIt might be done by statute setting out what may or may not be done without having had the vaccination. Or it might be left to the discretion of operators and proprietors whether to admit non-vaccinated patrons to their venues and services.\nIt raises an interesting philosophical question which is by no means new: Are our rights fundamental and absolute, or are they to be balanced by our responsibilities to society at large through some legislative process, democratic or otherwise?\nIf you take the latter view you might conclude that a citizen has a responsibility be vaccinated to protect the community as a whole, and if that responsibility is not accepted, then it would be reasonable to withhold rights and freedoms.\nI have often had to produce my Yellow Fever vaccination certificate to enter those countries where it is a legal requirement.\nThere does seem to me however, to be something repugnant about being coerced into having a medical procedure, it would certainly be a departure from long established limits.\nThere is however, a practical solution without troubling the philosophers. The herd immunity that vaccination promotes can be achieved with vaccination rates that fall well short of everyone having had the jab. We should be able to make the vaccine effective whilst tolerating the non-cooperation of conscientious objectors.\nOverwhelmingly, most of us will have the jab because we recognise that it is in our own self-interest, as well as the interests of everyone else.\nAs I said in the Commons, there are ways of promoting the vaccine without any need to coerce: line up the PM, ministers and all their loved ones to take it first, demonstrating the confidence of our rulers in its safety. Second, mount a public information campaign, fronted by our most popular celebrities and personalities.\nThe last thing you should contemplate is coercion of any kind. Nothing could be more calculated to play into the hands of the conspiracy theorists. It would end horribly with public disorder on a scale with which we have hitherto been relatively unfamiliar.\nHappily, it appears that the minister who suggested vaccination as ‘passport’ appears to have been slapped down, but I’ll remain vigilant.\nCutting Aid\nI was the Minister for International Development who shepherded the Act, which placed a statutory duty on government to pay 0.7% of GDP in Official Development Assistance, through all its Commons stages.\nIt is now to be replaced which is particularly worrying because, if the full payment is not made in any year, the Act only requires a statement from the Secretary of State in both Houses explaining why.\nTo amend or repeal the Act would appear to indicate a much longer-term intention to set aside the commitment.\nI do not doubt that this measure is popular, I have had any number of complaints about overseas aid, even before we met the 0.7% commitment and protected it in statute.\nMost people consider such aid to be charity and, accordingly, believe that it should ‘begin at home’ (thereby completely misinterpreting the meaning of the phrase, which was coined as a challenge to people who flaunted their philanthropy in public whilst treating their family and employees with meanness).\nCharity is something you give away freely without any expectation of return.\nInternational aid is not charity, rather it is an investment we make in the expectation that we may prosper and trade in a more stable and secure world, less prone to insecurity and waves of migration.\nIt is also a ‘soft power’ by which we project our influence abroad. In this respect it is much more versatile and deployable than our investment in our military capability to project power.\nI do not doubt that our retention of a seat at the UN security council owes more nowadays to the fact that we are the World’s second largest donor, rather than that we remain a nuclear power.\nThere are many things I would wish to see reformed about our aid effort. Jus for starters, it needs to be even more focussed on economic development and ability to trade: when I was the minister I would constantly remind people that ‘aid is all about jobs’.\nBut we are in queer street: the Chancellor has told us that our Economic crisis is only just beginning. We are at greater risk of further economic shocks because we are borrowing so much. George Osborne used to constantly remind us of the need to ‘fix the roof while the Sun is shining’, well now the roof’s been blown away.\nSo, protecting any item of public expenditure comes down to a question of priorities. I know most of my constituents will disagree, but I believe that as we re-establish ourselves as an independent power outside the EU and seek to increase our influence in the counsels of the World, then cutting our International Development Aid is a wrong priority.\nWas Churchill racist?\nI’ve had a spurt of anti-Islamism vitriol by email demanding to know why the Government hasn’t been voluble in support of President Macron’s campaign to protect the French secular state from terrorism, and from the growth of an increasingly separated Islamic culture and practice.\nFrankly, the Government has quite enough on its plate at present than to provide a running commentary on what is happening in France. I take the point however, and I share their President’s concerns.\nTypically, my correspondents go on to elaborate, claiming the expertise and knowledge to pronounce that Islam is, of necessity, an inherently violent creed. Here I think they are quite mistaken. Of course, its history is quite as violent as the history of any other religion, but overwhelmingly it has been characterised by contemplative sufism.\nMy correspondents quote blood-curdling passages claiming authentic interpretation from the Koran. Well, as a Bible-believing Christian I’m quite able to quote any number of much more blood-curdling passages from the Bible -so, straight off the top of my head, what about the savagery meted out to Achan (Joshua 7 & 8): Stoned to death with his whole clan, including women, children and livestock when it was discovered he had hidden some booty from the destruction of Jericho, sufficiently annoying God so that he denied victory to the Israelites in their first attempt to capture the City of Ai. Having sorted Achan, the Israelites had a second shot at Ai, resulting in complete destruction -including every living thing within the city.\nOn the face of it we are supposed to approve of these actions, after all, surely Achan, his family, their animals, and subsequently the all inhabitants of Ai ‘had it coming’. I rather think however, that there is a subtly in the account, and ‘between the lines’ the narrator is asking us “…and do you really believe that this was the will of God?”.\nI am not qualified to imagine what subtleties there may be in the Koran, I leave that to real Islamic scholars, rather than trust my correspondents.\nAs to the violent history of Islam. I wonder if it measures up to the blood- lust of Christendom: Crusades, pogroms, our wars of religion including the Inquisition, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, the Defenestration of Prague, the burnings during the reign of Bloody Mary, and on and on.\nSecular religions, Fascism and Communism, have taken an even greater toll.\nWhen my correspondents go on to claim that we are harbouring an alien and increasingly dangerous religious community in our midst I like to draw their attention to the contribution of Indian soldiers made to the defence of the Empire and to point to their WWI memorial in Barton on Sea in my constituency. Then, last week, I came across this magnificent passage whilst re-reading Churchill’s history of WWII\n“…the glorious heroism and martial qualities of the Indian troops who fought in the Middle East, who defended Egypt, who liberated Abyssinia, who played a grand part in Italy, and who, side by side with their British Comrades, expelled the Japanese from Burma, stand forth in brilliant light.\nThe loyalty of the Indian Army to the King-Emperor, the proud fidelity to their treaties of the Indian Princes, the unsurpassed bravery of Indian Soldiers and officers, both Moslem and Hindu, shine forever in the annals of war.”\nThat is something to be proud of, and to continue to build upon. The irony is that some are now denouncing Churchill as a racist.\nRevisiting the Markets Bill\nThe amendments by the House of Lords to the Government’s Markets Bill have sparked an email surge from both protagonists and antagonists.\nThe latter are outraged and demand the abolition of the Lords, but the former applaud the action by the Lords and demand that I vote against any attempt in the Commons to restore the deleted clauses.\nThe bill is designed to ensure that any good or service produced in one part of the UK enjoys ready access to any other part of the UK.\nThe controversial clauses involve a potential conflict with the Northern Ireland Protocol in our Withdrawal Agreement from the EU.\nThe accusation is that the bill ‘breaks international law’.\nThe concept of international law is clearly misunderstood by my correspondents.\nIn the UK you may not ‘jump’ a red traffic light because there is a law against it. International law largely does not exist in that same sense. Instead it exists in treaties between consenting parties:\nWe won’t jump a red light only because we agreed that we wouldn’t.\nSome of these agreements have grievance procedures written into them in order to arbitrate when there is a dispute between the parties about an action by one of them which allegedly breaks a provision of the treaty.\nThe European Court of Justice has before it a long list of cases still to be settled involving proceedings against EU members. Whilst you can make it sound awesome by saying that the member states in question are alleged to have ‘broken international law’. The reality is that its an arbitration between signatories to an agreement.\nThe World Trade Organisation maintains a similar arbitration process for trade disputes between its members. It also has a long list of alleged infractions to settle. Call it ‘breaking international law’ if it sounds more exciting.\nThe Markets bill does not break our Withdrawal Agreement with the EU or alter its terms in any way.\nWhat it does is to empower the UK Government, after seeking further authority from Parliament, to alter the arrangements that we agreed in the treaty if we find we need to.\nSo, the Bill doesn’t breach the treaty arrangements of itself. Even if it becomes an act of Parliament it does not do so. The arrangements in the agreement will only be altered if the Government, having sought further authority from Parliament, were then to actually change the arrangements originally agreed.\nOnly then does the question arise: would we be breaking the terms of our agreement, or if you want to put it that way, would we be breaking international law?\nThe Government is taking these powers in response to a direct threat made by EU during the negotiations for a trade deal.\nIn order to persuade the UK to concede our interests they suggested that, if we did not do so and that the outcome was no deal, then they would use the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement to exclude UK mainland produce from Northern Ireland Markets.\nClearly, no UK Government could tolerate such action and it is essential that we arm ourselves with powers which act as a deterrent to prevent it ever happening.\nSuppose it did happen though and that we used the powers, would we have broken the agreement?\nNo, because by interpreting the treaty perversely and excluding UK goods from part of the UK – which was never the intent of the agreement, the EU would itself have broken the treaty, and our action would be self-defence.\nThe Lords, in seeking to remove our deterrent whilst we are still in the middle of negotiations, have shown their irresponsibility.\nBy equating the deterrent power with China’s treatment of Hong Kong and other enormities, they have shown that they have no sense of proportion either.\nShould we abolish them?\nWell, there is a frighteningly long list of priorities on the ‘to do’ list…but one day\nDemocracy ?\nThe choice presented to Parliament by the demands of the scientists for a lockdown (given the circumstances ‘demands’ seems a more appropriate term than ‘advice’) was between the lesser of two evils: the possibility of the NHS being temporarily overwhelmed; as against the certainty of ruined businesses, lost livelihoods, enormous borrowings to be repaid, and shorter lives resulting from the economic damage.\nGiven the debunking of the ‘project fear’ graphs produced by the chiefs last weekend, it seemed to me that the risk of the NHS being overwhelmed was overstated.\nI do not underestimate the unpleasantness of the NHS being overwhelmed. We have seen that happen before from flu and Norovirus, with scenes of ambulances queuing at A&E and patients being treated on trollies. Clearly, measures need to be taken to avoid it. Not locking-down would have been a risk, in my judgement a risk worth taking given the huge damage that the lock-down will cause. Nevertheless, I was on the losing side when it came to the vote, and that’s democracy.\nModern liberal democracy however, has come to mean much more that rule by majority. It includes the rule of law, due process, fundamental liberties such as freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of worship.\nIt is with regard to these values that I find the response to Coronavirus so shocking and worrying. The British people appear to have quietly shrugged it off as these liberties have been swept aside. The state has taken all the coercive powers of the law to tell us where we may go, whom we may meet, what we must wear, and to outlaw protests.\nOn that last count, even more sinister, is the way that the organs of the totalitarian state reach out to go beyond even what has been proscribed: I have received representations from intensive care doctors who have been warned that their employment is in jeopardy because they have expressed doubts about the lock-down policy.\nInstead of a rising chorus of protest against these enormities we are informed by pollsters, on the contrary, that the appetite of the people is for even more draconian measures. I am appalled.\nOur liberties did not come cheaply, they were bought by the struggles of our forebears, many of whom died in the pursuit of freedom.\nI am informed by my critics that I have failed to appreciate that the preservation of life itself is more important than liberty: ‘life at all costs’. I wonder to what extent such an overriding imperative is the product of the decline of religious belief.\nHappily a large number of elderly and vulnerable people have written to me with a quite different perspective. They tell me that they would, given the choice, rather lead a full life and encounter the risk of catching the virus, than be protected at the cost of their liberty.\nOf course, disproportionately they come from a generation that made many sacrifices to defend liberty.\nQui Bono ?\nOn Tuesday 20th October the following brief exchange took place in the Commons\nSir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con)\nWhat estimate has the Secretary of State made of the number of excess deaths above the long-term average in each of the last few weeks?\nSecretary of State for Health & Social Care\nWe have, thankfully, seen that the number of excess deaths is around the level of the long-term average. I want to keep it that way and that is why we are taking the action that we are, so that this does not get out of hand like we saw in the first peak.\nNow, I didn’t just ask the question at random. I had already looked at the statistics that are publicly available and which show that the number of daily deaths at 1600 or so daily, is normal -and has been at the normal expected level since June.\nThe Secretary of State’s reply reveals his good intention, to avoid calamity.\nThe action that he is taking however, brings on another set of calamities in terms of ruined businesses, unemployment, consequent mental health problems, and yes, even deaths. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: the proven result of lock-downs, is that they make poor people poorer.\nMy intention in asking that question was attempt to expose the fundamental contradiction between fact and what ministers, guided by the scientists who advise them, are telling us.\nThey claim that a deadly pandemic is stalking the land. Yet the fact is that the number of deaths is consistent with the long-term average. Both these statements cannot be true, they are mutually exclusive. If a deadly pandemic is in progress then the number of excess deaths above the long term average would bear witness to it. They don’t.\nI conclude that the pandemic ended in the summer and that the increase in cases arises from the testing of healthy people on an industrial scale, using a methodology that throws-up false positives. I will not be persuaded that a deadly pandemic is again in progress until it reveals itself in excess deaths (and that those excess deaths genuinely arise from the virus and not from other untreated conditions).\nA very small number of correspondents have written to me to say that I have no right to make such a judgement because I am not a doctor or a scientist.\nOn the contrary, a huge number of scientists and doctors have contacted me to say that they agree with me.\nI am a rational person trying to reconcile what we are being told about the virus, as against the plain facts revealed in the statistics.\nAccordingly, it is proper to demand an explanation as to why measures are being inflicted upon us which intrude into our personal liberty and are deeply damaging to us economically.\nIn the Commons I pointed out that it is precisely because the Government’s actions defy rational explanation, that constituents write to me with increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories of their own.\nHere I draw a blank. However irrational their policy, I am at a loss to explain what motive ministers might have for pursuing it, other than that they genuinely believe it to be right.\nQui bono?\nWhat other motive could they possibly have?\nFree Meals -but at School\nA number of constituents have written to ask me why I voted against extending free school meals over half-term.\nFirst, no meals are being taken from those who had them: free school meals are as described; meals provided to children who qualify, whilst they are at school.\nIt has never been any government’s policy -irrespective of the political party in power- to take from parents the responsibility for feeding their children, and handing that responsibility instead, to the state.\nExceptionally, provision was maintained over the summer because schools had been closed, placing an additional burden on straightened parents that they would not normally have had to bear. In total, eligible families collectively received £380 million in meal vouchers while schools were partially closed, but I do not believe that this is an effective way of dealing with the problem.\nThe proper way to address poverty is not to provide free lunches to poor children, but to empower their parents, by tackling their poverty at source, by increasing their income.\nAccordingly, Universal Credit has, in response to Coronavirus, been increased by £1,040 this year.\nIn addition, between 2015-16 and 2019-20 1.7 people million were taken out of paying income tax altogether as a consequence of raising the personal tax-free allowance to £12,500 for all 32 million income tax payers.\nFurthermore, the adult national minimum wage was raised to £8.72 per hour.\nIn total £53 billion has been spent on income protection schemes and £9.3 billion on additional welfare payments.\nThese are the proper ways to treat those on low incomes with dignity. It allows them to budget according to their family circumstance rather than being issued with vouchers for lunches, almost as a badge of poverty, much in the way that claimants are demeaned in the USA by being issued with food stamps.\nPoor people still have their dignity, and it should not be compromised.\nEmployment is by far the best route to escape poverty, which is why it is so important that we stop generating further unemployment through our response to Covid-19.\nI do not belittle the suffering of families who have lost loved ones, nor the suffering of those who recover only to be blighted with a post-viral syndrome, but that suffering is no excuse for tipping our economy into recession.\nThe proven effect of lock-downs is that they make poor people poorer.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 35\n- 36\n- 37\n- 38\n- 39\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",

They are also both increasingly interlinked. AI is already being used across the creative industries, including in music and film production, publishing, architecture and design. As of September 2024, more than 38 per cent of creative industries businesses said they have used AI technologies.\nWhile AI has the potential to transform the creative sector, many artists, writers, and designers have sincere fears that AI could detrimentally affect their earnings and, ultimately, their way-of-life. Current laws make it difficult for creators to control or seek payment for the use of their work. It is also true that present ambiguities in the law create legal risks for AI firms, and could deter developers from investing and developing their products in the UK.\nTherefore, the Opposition welcomes that the Government has launched a consultation into the legal relationship between the creative industries and AI developers. The Government is seeking to simultaneously ensure protection and payment for rights holders and support AI developers to innovate responsibly. Key areas of the consultation include boosting trust and transparency between the sectors, so right holders have a better understanding of how AI developers are using their material and how it has been obtained. The consultation will run until the 25 February 2025.\nThe consultation also explores how creators can license and be remunerated for the use of their material. The Government proposes allowing rights holders to reserve their rights, so they can control the use of their content, while also introducing an exception to copyright law for AI training for commercial purposes. This is an effective opt-out which means that creators would have to reaffirm their desire to protect their work. Worryingly, this position appears to place the major technology companies at a considerable advantage, and my colleague Dame Caroline Dinenage MP has raised this directly with the Prime Minister in Parliament.",

These have been accompanied children because the UN advice is that unaccompanied children are much better off staying in the region where there remains the possibility of being reunited with their extended families. Notwithstanding, we have also made commitments to take such children where it is judged to be in their best interests and, in addition, we have committed to take unaccompanied children who have already made it to the European mainland.\nThere is however, a preponderance of young men, and men not so young, some of which claim to be children, and many of which claim to be refugees, when many are actually migrants.\n(I blame no migrant for seeking a better life, but our proper response to the problem of mass migration is to invest in the economic development of the places from which they are migrating. The UK is one of the very few developed nations meeting its commitment to spend 0.7% of our national income on this important international development aid. If all the developed nations did so, and if we had all done so 40 years ago when that commitment was made, perhaps we would not be faced with mass migration on the scale that we are now dealing with.)\nWhen I visited the President of Afghanistan earlier this year I raised with him the issue of our difficulty in returning Afghans whose claims to asylum in Europe had been rejected. In the end, he agreed to take personal charge of the issue and to resolve the matter, but before we got to that satisfactory conclusion, he delivered a lecture to me. This is the gist of it: He told me that his main effort had to be delivering progress for all the people of Afghanistan who, despite their difficulties, had stuck with it; that his priority was the needs of the young men and women who were taking the fight to the Taliban. Only after these priorities were met, could he address the issue of receiving back those of his countrymen who gave up on his country and went away.\nWhen we think of the blood and treasure that the United Kingdom has expended in Afghanistan, we might reflect on the President’s lecture.",

I know the feeling. You should see the room I’ve been allocated.\nI really don’t believe however, that that there is anything vindictive in any of this. I know the deal, I was once the accommodation whip, and the current holder of that distinguished office could not be a nicer guy.\nPersonally I should never complain. For three years I enjoyed the best office in Westminster – on the third floor of Number one Parliament Street, with a balcony overlooking Parliament Square, and Big Ben as my wall clock. It was the perfect venue for a party during William and Kate’s wedding. Andrew Mitchell has it now.\nWhen you become a minister you give up your room in the Commons and instead you get allocated something more like a ‘booth’ in one of the dark and dingy ministerial corridors. Ministers have their real offices in their department of state elsewhere in Whitehall. I had the most magnificent room in the Old Admiralty building that Winston Churchill occupied from 1911-1915 when he was First Sea Lord. It’s only a week since I was purged and I miss it terribly.\nThe problem facing the accommodation whip is this: there is no stock of empty rooms. So, ministers that are being dismissed have to swap with those being promoted. As a general rule the ministers being dismissed are relatively senior and have correspondingly high expectations. Those being promoted to ministerial rank however, tend to be relatively junior and consequently have less desirable accommodation to give up. The only way to handle this mismatch is to allocate the choice of rooms strictly according to a rule, and that rule is in order of seniority determined by year of first election.\nEx ministers whose pride is already hurt, can be even more discombobulated when they see the quality of the accommodation that the whip has to offer, but as I used to say when I had that unenviable job: “you weren’t elected to sit in a room, but to sit in the chamber of the Commons”. I’m not sure that it cheered them up though.",

There was a time when members would have sat fully hatted and cloaked, which would inappropriate nowadays, and ties, after all, are a relatively recent invention.\nAs members are elected, and speak as representatives of their constituents, I suppose they must have that right to speak, irrespective of how they have dressed for the occasion.\nI do wonder however, how many of these iconoclasts dressed in ‘scruff order’ when they were campaigning for the votes of their constituents.\nAre they showing due respect to their constituents by seeking to represent them whilst dressed in a fashion that lowers the tone in our institutions, and the respect in which they are held?\nI think that dress codes remain important. Maintaining standards says something important about us. The impression that is created does still count.\nIt was whilst reflecting on my anger at the Speaker’s ruling that I suddenly recognised my own offence: I have been going to church on Sunday casually dressed, relaxed at not wearing the suit and stiff collars I have had on all the rest of the week. I may have even, on occasion, been in short sleeves. Now, that might be fine in evangelical churches where the liturgy is itself informal, but I am C of E, or -to use the appropriate cricketing metaphor- ‘middle and leg Christianity’. The Chairman of the Parish Council attends and is very properly turned out as one would expect of an English country gentleman. The Choir and Clergy make a tremendous effort, swathed as they are in quantities of haberdashery.\nI wonder how much offence have my slack standards given over recent years?\nI am resolved to reform, and dress smartly in future, but perhaps not the stiff collar.",

Ministers support the considerate use of fireworks, as well as any action taken to reduce the risks and disturbances to individuals, animals and property.\nThere is a noise level limit of 120 decibels on fireworks for home use, which helps to reduce disturbance to both animals and people. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to animals through the misuse of fireworks. Fireworks should not be set off near livestock or close to buildings that house livestock, or near to horses in fields. Anyone planning a firework display in rural areas should warn neighbouring farmers.\nFurther, retailers are restricted to only selling consumer fireworks during a limited period around specific seasonal celebrations, and retailers may only supply fireworks outside these periods if they obtain a licence from their local licensing authority. Fireworks used for professionally organised displays are only available for sale to people who have undertaken an accredited course of training in pyrotechnics. Enforcement powers exist for local authorities to take action when fireworks are unsafe, sold illegally or misused. Local authorities and the police also have powers to tackle anti-social behaviour caused by the misuse of fireworks.\nFinally, the Government published a statutory Code of Practice for the Welfare of Dogs, which advises dog owners to avoid exercising with dogs during times when fireworks could be let off.

I have studied documents supplied to the House of Commons Procedure Committee and evidence given to the Constitution and Public Administration Committee by the Clerks. It’s complicated!\nWhen and if the Government makes a withdrawal agreement it will present it for approval to the Commons, where the Government’s motion can be carried, rejected, or amended.\nThe Government needs clearly expressed approval to proceed to ratify the agreement with the EU, so any amendment framed in terms which clouds that issue will have the effect of preventing that ratification, which means leaving with no deal.\nIf amendments seek to change parts of the agreement, they will be merely expressions of opinion, because they will not themselves change the agreement that has been made.\nEqually, were the amendment to order the Government to, say, go back to the EU and seek an extension to the Article 50 negotiations, or to introduce legislation to give effect to that, or to arrange a further referendum, then again, these would merely be expressions of opinion: because in terms of law and procedure the Commons does not have the power to force the Government to do any of these things.\nOf course, in the past the success of such amendments against the expressed wish of the PM would have amounted to a vote of no confidence in the Government and would have meant a general election. The Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011 has however, changed all that: defeating the Government on an EU withdrawal agreement motion would not now amount to a vote of no confidence.\nThe Withdrawal Act 2018 is already law, and that law says that we leave the EU on 29 March 2019.\nSo the much trumpeted ‘meaningful vote’ on the agreement does in the end come down to this:\nEither the Commons accepts the deal negotiated, or we leave with no deal.\nInevitably there will be a temptation for BREXIT true-believers to reject the compromises that any negotiation involves, and save the £39 Billion, by voting down the Government’s withdrawal agreement- if it gets one, safe the knowledge that BREXIT is secure because we are leaving on 29th March whatever.\nAll this is based on law and procedure, but it doesn’t take into account the politics, and politics is entirely unpredictable. What would really happen if the Commons threw out the PM’s negotiated agreement?\nCould she really survive?\nWould the Government really simply plough on to a no-agreement exit on 29 March in the face of Parliamentary and public opposition?\nI recall David Cameron insisting that his administration would continue irrespective of the referendum result in 2016, but look how that ended.\nNotwithstanding the law and parliamentary procedure, voting down a withdrawal agreement could still set in train a set of uncontrollable and unpredictable events, and that is something I and my BREXIT-supporting colleagues will have to consider very carefully when we scrutinise whatever deal it is that the PM has been able to make. In the end it will be down to our assessment of all the risks.\n…but hey, there is still the possibility of an all-singing, all-dancing deal",

First, the absurdity and confusion of different lock-down policies pursued by the governments in England, Wales and Scotland during the pandemic. We now know from the leaked Hancock WhatsApp messages that restrictions were imposed on England, not based on any evidential effectiveness, but purely to keep up with zealous officialdom in Scotland.\nSecond, we’ve recently seen the UK Government intervene to veto absurd legislation in Scotland, which allowed people to redesignate their gender, because they could not be restricted, in the rest of our islands, to facilities consistent with their actual sex.\nEven worse still, as the UK Government of the has wrestled with the hideous complications of halting the traffic of migrants in small boats across the Channel, the Welsh government sought, on the contrary, to increase the ‘pull factor’ by paying the asylum claimants £1,600 per month and funding legal costs to resist deportation.\nIt is our good fortune that the UK Government still had the powers to thwart these daft intentions:\nWe need to ensure that devolution proceeds no further to rob us of them.\nIt Never Did Us Any Harm\nI was alarmed by a survey of nearly 8,500 teachers which revealed that 13% of them had been assaulted by pupils in the last year and that more than a quarter had been subjected to verbal abuse by a parent.\nI spent a seven happy years teaching in the nineteen eighties and was fortunate enough never to have felt threatened by a pupil, nor was I aware of any colleague experiencing that either.

But even in those days there were excellent and well run schools that did not allow corporal punishment – but I suspect it was a lot harder work.\nAnyway, when I was at school, it never did us any harm.\nPunishment\nEvery time there are reports of a brutal child murder, I receive a dozen or so demands for restoration of the death penalty. And so it was last week after the trial of Kyle Bevan for the murder of his girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter, Lola James.\nI have voted for the return of the death penalty on three occasions in Parliament but alas, the majorities against restoration were overwhelming.\nI recall an election meeting in a church where I was challenged on the ground’s that as a Christian I ought to oppose the death penalty. I responded by quoting from article 37 of the 39 Articles which form the doctrinal foundation of the Church of England:\n“The laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and grievous offences”.\nI suspect that there would be majority support for restoration, but that a significant minority would remain viscerally opposed. Every death sentence would be the focus of public protests. It might also be more difficult to secure convictions for capital offences as jurors contemplate the finality of a guilty verdict. In any event, whatever the pros and cons, there just is no parliamentary majority to be had for it.\nThe public demand for justice might be assuaged however, were a life sentence to mean what is says. There is nothing more frustrating than to see people who have been imprisoned for the most horrible offences being released to present a danger to the public once again.\nThis undermines our whole concept of justice, and it extends from wicked and violent crimes down to more minor offences.\nWhen a judge hands down a sentence in court it bears little relation to the time that will actually be served in prison. Indeed, it requires multiple convictions of burglary before the offender sees the inside of a prison at all.\nThere was a time when a politician (in those days the Home Secretary) was able to determine the ‘tariff’ -the actual minimum time of any sentence that a convict would serve. But this was considered to breach the constitutional principle of the ‘separation of powers’ between government and judiciary. So, that power was removed from the hands of elected politicians.\nNow the only lever that ministers can pull is the right of appeal that the Attorney General has, where it is considered that a sentence has been unduly lenient.\nWhich brings me to Labour’s recent advertisement insisting that the Prime Minister doesn’t want child sex offenders imprisoned. On the contrary, I rather suspect that the PM shares my prejudice that they should be locked-up and the key thrown away. I don’t know if he would go as far as I would and make it a capital offence, were in in my power to do so.\nIt is very frustrating but the reality is -and Labour knows it, neither the PM nor any other politician, can determine the penalty that the trial judge imposes.\nWhat we can do however, is increase the penalties available to the courts. When we’ve introduced measures to do exactly that, Labour has voted against them.\nDaft Laws\nGiven a few moments to think about it, I’m sure we could all come up with a daft law to add to some that are already on the statute book.\nI’ve always been of the view that the fewer laws we have, the better governed we shall be; that, within reason, you should be able to do pretty well whatever you want so long as it doesn’t adversely affect the enjoyment of others. This has broadly been the status of our legal framework: we are permitted to do anything that isn’t against the law. There are many jurisdictions where the reverse is the case: you may only do what the law specifically permits you to do.\nMany of my constituents have an appetite for much greater regulation of our lives. They write to me proposing new laws to address any number of real or imagined problems. They have ‘happy thoughts’ about “how much better organised life would be in only we had a law to make us do…” whatever the bee in their bonnet may be.\nPutting their happy thought in an email to me does no harm. Alas, parliamentary colleagues have the opportunity, afforded the annual private members’ bill ballot, to put their happy thoughts into law.\nThere are 13 sitting Fridays per year on which the Commons deals with the private members’ bills that were successful in the ballot. It is a minority taste: Most MPs clear off to their constituencies where they have more pressing demands on their time like visiting schools, councils, enterprises, police, NHS and many more.\nWhen, constituents write to me to ask me to be in Westminster on a Friday to support a particular bill, I reply telling them that, even were I in favour of the bill, the best thing I can do to support it is to stay away. The greatest enemy of any private members’ bill is the limited time available to it. Opponents need not trouble to muster numbers to vote against it. All they need do is speak at length about it. If you did support it, then it would be foolish to come along and help the opponents by taking up some of that time yourself.\nSuch is the potential damage and cost of the proposals in so many private members’ bills, sensible and public-spirited MPs will organise small teams of colleagues dedicated to ‘talking-out’ the offending bills. It is essential too that the Government Whips have some oversight of this process. It is also vital that the whip on duty at close of business shouts “object” at the right moment to prevent any undebated bill going through ‘on the nod’.\nGiven all this, the message gets through to most colleagues that, if they want their bill to proceed, then it must be of narrow scope and almost wholly uncontroversial.\nAlas, every now and again the system malfunctions. Perhaps the dedicated team didn’t show on a particular Friday, or the whips were asleep at the wheel, or even -extraordinarily- the minister at the despatch box indicated support for the intentions of the bill. Whatever it was, the result can be a disastrous piece of legislation. Here is one such: we now have the prospect of employees being entitled to sue their employer for damages if a customer upsets them.\nWe all know how difficult it is to keep a small business going, why would we throw another burden on them by making them responsible for the speech and opinions of their customers?\nHow daft is that?\nThe Budget\nI always find that it is best to reserve one’s thoughts on the budget until the Commons has finished debating it, and that was only on Tuesday evening – although there will be another thrash when the Finance Bill begins its parliamentary proceedings.\nNormally votes on the budget resolutions keep us till late into the night. This time however, there were only two divisions: Labour voted against the reductions in pension taxation and the Scottish Nationalists voted against the freeze in alcohol duty (what were they thinking!).\nPersonally, I much preferred the short-lived proposals in Kwasi’s Autumn statement. His mistake was to announce his intention to implement them all at once, and at the same time as a very generous scheme to subsidise all our gas and electricity bills.\nBy contrast, the tax increases in this budget will hurt, particularly the increase in corporation tax for businesses and the freezing of personal allowances for the rest of us. Nevertheless, our addiction to public expenditure and the expectation that the state will take ever greater responsibility for ‘looking after us’ has to be paid for somehow.\nAnd we must kick the habit of borrowing: I am alarmed that the government debt that our pension funds and other institutions have acquired may now be crowding-out productive investment opportunities.\nThere were two ‘give-aways’. First the abolition of the lifetime-limit on pension savings. This is a very sensible measure to remove the incentive to retire early for so many professionals, especially highly skilled doctors.\nLabour, by opposing the measure, because they say it is only of benefit to ‘the rich’ have, first got their sums wrong, and second, they’ve lost all sense of proportion. 27% of those who will benefit are doctors, 5% are teachers, 13% will other public sector employees such as senior police officers and many will be skilled technicians, scientists and entrepreneurs. It is in all our interests to encourage them to continue working and earning.\nIn any event, for all labour’s confected rage, I recall that, as Treasury Lord Commissioner, I signed into law ‘The Pensions Increase (Pension Scheme for Kier Starmer QC) Regulations 2013’. I believe the advantages extended to Sir Keir should also be available -for all our sakes- to keep skilled operators in the workforce when we are so desperately short of them.\nThe second big announcement was the extension of free childcare provision. I understand the rationale – clearly the affordability of childcare is one of the major restrictions that prevent parents from working. However, I do have reservations. First, there is a structural problem: The providers are in the private sector but the price is determined, not by the market, but by government. The problem hitherto has been that the price government has set is insufficient for the providers and, consequently, supply has diminished; It’s no good having a right to hours of free childcare if you can’t find people who will provide it.\nWhether the extended childcare that the Government is offering can be delivered, will depend entirely upon the price that it sets.\nAs we have the highest childcare costs in Europe we should attach a higher priority to reducing some of the bureaucratic impositions that bind the providers.\nAlso, there has to be a amelioration of the very substantial tax disadvantages experienced by single-income families when one parent looks after the children full-time. It just isn’t fair.\nAnd finally, nothing is free. The Government’s hands will be in our pockets to pay for it one way or another.\nLineker\nI rather regret having written to the BBC asking them to properly enforce their own rules when dealing with their highest paid presenter, Gary Lineker.\nMy inbox so quickly filled with emails denouncing his ‘tweets’ and supporting the policy that he had criticised, that I soon realised how effective he was at marshalling support for the Government’s policy. So, long may he continue to ‘tweet unrestrained’.\nOn the policy itself, I entirely support it. But we fool ourselves if we think we can stop the boats without the enthusiastic co-operation of France. Currently, French intervention stops about a third of crossings. If, by increasing our financial contribution, we can get them to significantly raise their game, then we will have got ourselves a bargain compared to the ever-increasing costs of dealing with those who make it to our shores.\nWe need to keep in mind that this is an international problem to which international solutions have to be found. France is having as much difficulty at its own border with Italy as we are having with the Channel. Already this year 20,000 migrants have arrived in boats on the Italian mainland.\nOf course, Europe has to find ways of protecting its borders and I am confident that they will increasingly start to embrace the policies that the UK is now adopting. Ultimately however, we must tackle the problem at source: the conditions that are driving mass migrations in the first place.\nWhen I was the Minister for International Development, I recall visiting the largest refugee camp in the world. The UNHCR had provided housing well above the standard available in so many settlements in developing middle-income countries. The world Food Programme provided clean water and enough to eat. UNICEF was educating the Children. The host country’s police and army ensured a level of order and security uncommon elsewhere.\nOn balance, the refugees were getting a level of support that would be difficult to match in much of the world.\nNevertheless, there was a significant flow of refugees leaving and risking all that they had to pay gangsters to traffic them elsewhere, in pursuit of the one thing that that refugee camp could not provide: a livelihood.\nIf we are to have a prospect of solving migration we need to invest in providing the opportunity of earning a living in those parts of the world where that prospect is remote. As I kept saying to anyone who would listen, “it’s all about jobs”.\n50 years ago, the rich nations pledged to invest 0.7 % of their national incomes in the poorer developing world. Most have never honoured that pledge at all. It took us the UK until 2011 to reach that pledge, but it only lasted until 2019. If all the wealthy nations had honoured their pledge when they made it, then perhaps we would not be having to cope with the current levels of migration that are overwhelming us.\nAbolishing Childhood\nI recall my headmaster taking the opportunity of the last scripture lesson of the year to teach the ‘facts of life’ to those of us who were 13 and would be leaving. It was all over in half an hour. And that was it, until a couple of years later, we got a slightly more detail in the Biology O Level syllabus.\nIt may seem surprising, but we managed to marry and raise families.\nOf Course, in those days, we didn’t have easy access to pornography: there were no mobile phones, laptops or internet; hence no internet pornography. Even video was some years off. The best one could manage -if you had the courage – was to reach up to the top shelf for the latest edition of Health and Efficiency, and then avoid the shopkeeper’s disapproving stare as he placed it in a paper bag. Life was a great deal simpler.\nLast week I wrote to the Prime Minister together with Miriam Cates MP and other like-minded colleagues, to remind him of a pledge that he made during his leadership campaign: to end inappropriate sex education in our schools.\nWe enclosed a evidence that many children are being subjected to sex education that is wholly inappropriate. Children are being taught about extreme and dangerous sex acts, encouraged to share intimate details about sexual desires with classmates and teachers, and even primary school children are being indoctrinated with radical ideologies about sex and gender. Many of the resources used would make adults deeply uncomfortable, especially if they were expected to view them in their place of work. It is unconscionable that our children are being forced to engage with such disturbing materials in school.\nMany of the resources are produced by external agencies, some of which take extreme and political positions on these issues, including campaigning to end the rights of parents to withdraw their children from sex education. Surprisingly, a number of schools refuse to allow parents to view lesson materials in advance.\nIt is, of course, important that children are taught about tolerance and discrimination and are expected to treat others with dignity and respect. But exposing children to explicit materials and radical ideologies amounts to the abolition of childhood.\nAt Prime Minister’s Questions this week, Miriam followed up our letter with this:\n“Graphic lessons on oral sex, how to choke your partner safely, 72 genders—this is what passes for relationships and sex education in British schools. Across the country, children are being subjected to lessons that are age-inappropriate, extreme, sexualising and inaccurate, often using resources from unregulated organisations that are actively campaigning to undermine parents. This is not a victory for equality; it is a catastrophe for childhood. Will my right hon. Friend honour his commitment to end inappropriate sex education by commissioning an independent inquiry into the nature and extent of this safeguarding scandal”\nThe PM replied saying that he shared our concern and that he had tasked the Department for Education to ensure that schools are not teaching inappropriate or contested content in relationships, sex and health education. He said “our priority should always be the safety and wellbeing of children. Schools should also make curriculum content and materials available to parents. As a result of all this, we are bringing forward a review of RSHE statutory guidance and will start our consultation as soon as possible.”\nGood, but not before time!\nThat we have reached this current pass raises the question, have some of teachers entirely taken leave of their senses?\nNeither do I condemn Thee\nKate Forbes is, in my estimate, the best candidate to be leader of the Scottish National Party -and by a country mile. The difficulty for a member of a rival political party, like myself, is that you don’t necessarily want the best and most effective candidate to win. The interests of my own party and, I sincerely believe, of the nation too, are best served if they instead choose a complete dud.\nNevertheless, Kate Forbes has been treated most shamefully by the public media whose focus has been almost exclusively on her Christian beliefs which are, more often than not, at odds with current fashionable social mores. What she would actually do in the Edinburgh government, and the direction in which she would take her party, has been almost entirely crowded-out by discussion of her Christian beliefs -including that marriage is exclusively between one man and one woman.\nI remember when Tim Farron became leader of the Liberal Democrats and was treated in a similar fashion for exactly the same reason.\nWhat is rather odd, even somewhat sinister, is that politicians who adherents of other religions which, nevertheless share the same traditional approach to marriage and sexuality, are never exposed to similar criticism. The treatment of Hamza Yusef, another rival for the SNP leadership, would be an obvious case in point.\nIt is as if our liberal intelligentsia has decided that Christianity, uniquely among religions, must be hounded from the public sphere and confined to ‘safe spaces’ out of sight in churches.\nAs the Government Whip who was responsible for shepherding the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 through all its Commons stages, I have some ‘skin in the game’.\nI was clear in my own mind that the legislation properly distinguished between marriage as a legal status which the state has every right to define, and Holy Matrimony which is a religious matter instituted for quite different purposes.\nNotwithstanding that distinction, Christian MPs divided almost equally in support and opposition to the measure (as indeed they have on almost every ‘conscience’ vote in my experience since I’ve been in the Commons). The implications of biblical accounts of what Jesus actually taught are not always straightforward -especially if you’ve read the New Testament in its original Greek.\nEnoch Powell ( himself a former professor of Greek) in his discussion of John ch8: the woman taken in adultery, leaves me struggling with what Jesus could possibly have meant when he told her ‘neither do I condemn thee’ before issuing what he knew to be the impossible command ‘go and sin no more’.\nAs a Christian, I don’t share the positions taken by Kate Forbes or some of her beliefs, but she has every right to a hearing in the front line of our national politics.\nFrost in Morocco\nSir Keir Starmer made every effort throughout the 2017-19 in Parliament to prevent UK leaving the EU. He has made clear however, that Labour is now reconciled to BREXIT and will not seek to reverse it. But this is rather undermined by Labour’s current actions in Parliament. At every opportunity, when a problem occurs, They put it down to our having left the EU. This week, for example, they blamed the shelves emptied of salads in our supermarkets on the decision by the British people to vote to leave the EU. As I pointed out in the Commons in response to this nonsense, perhaps we ought to have been told -before we voted – that a vote to leave was going to result in the frosts in Morocco.\nThe reality is that most of our salads, at this time of year, come from southern Spain and Morocco both of which had an exceptionally warm December followed by an exceptionally cold January. Consequently, the crop has been particularly disappointing. Our own domestic supplies of these commodities won’t arrive until summer because the cost of heating greenhouses is prohibitively uncompetitive.\nSeeking supplies from elsewhere has had the additional complication of striking French ferry workers.\nNone of this, of course, has a blind thing to do with BREXIT\nPerhaps even more indicative of Labour’s continuing hostility to BREXIT is its determination to thwart the Retained EU Law Bill. This Bill completes most of the Brexit agenda. There are some 4,000 pieces of EU legislation which remain on the statute book because we incorporated them into our own law as there simply wasn’t long enough to consider them individually in the time available while we were negotiating our exit. Then there was the Covid-19 pandemic, causing a legislative backlog; then the war in Ukraine seized the political agenda. Only now therefore, are we wrestling with the EU retained Law Bill. Basically, the bill empowers the Government to go through all the EU laws and, those that it does not specifically decide to keep, will automatically lapse according to the timetable set out in the Bill.\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats are now sponsoring amendments in the House of Lords that will require that each of these individual legislative measures be separately debated in Parliament. It is, in effect, a wrecking amendment. It would clog-up all available parliamentary time for years.\nThe motive behind such an agenda seems rather obvious to me: its supporters don’t want us to differ from the EU’s regulatory regime, because to do so, would make it harder for us to re-join -which is their real objective.\nVoter ID\nWhen the Elections Bill was in Parliament, which included the requirement that voters produce photo ID at polling stations for the first time on the mainland, I received few letters of objection, and I still do.\nVoter fraud in the form of ‘personation’ has not been a problem in The New Forest but there are districts in some of our cities where the there has been real concern about the integrity of the ballot.\nIn any event, it is no use reheating the arguments that were rehearsed in Parliament during the Bill’s passage. It is now The Elections Act 2022. So, as from May this year individuals who wish to vote in person, including those acting as a proxy on behalf of another individual, will be required to produce an accepted form of photographic ID at the polling station in order to vote. They have had to do so for years in Northern Ireland, and it was also successfully piloted in a number of districts on the mainland too: We know that it works.\nWe have District and Parish Council elections in the New Forest on 4th May, so get ready: When you go to your polling station you will need to take with you one of the following documents. It doesn’t matter if they have expired so long as the photo is still a good likeness.\nA Passport issued by UK, any of the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, British Overseas Territories\nOr\n- A Passport issued by an EEA State\n- A Passport issued by a Commonwealth Country\n- Photographic driver’s licence (full or provisional) issued by the UK, Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, or an EEA state\n- EEA photographic ID card\n- UK Biometric Residence Permit\n- An identity card bearing the Proof of Age Standards Scheme hologram (PASS card)\n- A blue badge\n- Oyster 60+ card\n- A concessionary travel pass funded by HM Government or local authority, such as a Hampshire County Council Bus pass, disabled persons bus pass or Welsh or Northern Ireland travel card.\nYou must take the original document with you to the polling station: A scanned, electronic version or a copy will not be accepted.\n(Beware, University and College Student Union cards are NOT included).\nIf you do not have any of these then you can apply to New Forest District Council to get a free Voter Authority Certificate. This is a document containing the voter’s name and photograph, specifically for the purposes of voting and will be accepted at the polling station. The deadline to apply for a Voter Authority Certificate will be 5pm on Tuesday 25 April. But don’t wait, do it while it is in your mind, like the right now!\nThe application form can be downloaded from https://newforest.gov.uk/VoterID and emailed to electoralservices@nfdc.gov.uk\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 16\n- 17\n- 18\n- 19\n- 20\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",

Frankly, some of the regulations are unenforceable, and others require enormous sensitivity. Not all forces have covered themselves with glory. From the start of the first lockdown Derbyshire Police showed their crass stupidity by poisoning an azure lake, in order to deter visitors.\nThere have been plenty of other instances where officers have overstepped the mark, well beyond what is acceptable in a democratic society under the rule of law.\nI have previously expressed my concern about the way in which government guidance has been confused with regulation when police officers have issued instructions to citizens. Guidance is no more than the opinion of ministers and it is not enforceable. Only the law are police officers charged with enforcing. I make no bones about it: a ‘police state’ is where officers enforce the opinions of ministers, It is the very opposite of the rule of law.\nI have been worried by the lack of media coverage afforded to the way that a number of protesters have been unnecessarily roughly treated on a number of occasions. Saturday’s policing of the vigil on Clapham Common however, has achieved the notoriety and opprobrium that it deserves. The scenes were quite shocking and the result of a woeful want of judgement by those in command.\nThe attempt to clear the vigil was made because some of the women were about to make speeches.\nGood grief! Not that! Surely, it had to be prevented at all costs?\nI have, since the very beginning of the first lockdown been staggered by the lack of protest at the abrogation of our civil liberties including right of assembly and freedom of expression. Perhaps the disgraceful scenes in Clapham will be the spark to ignite a rather more robust response in defence of our liberties.\nWe have a common law right to protest and in addition there are legislative provisions that enhance that right which the police are under a duty to facilitate.\nIt is far from clear as to the extent that the Health Protection Restrictions made last year using powers enabled by Public Health Act 1984, have lawfully removed our right to public protest. It certainly hasn’t yet been tested in the courts. So, I do hope that crowd funding will prompt and enable those facing £10,000 fixed penalty notices to challenge them there.\nThere are even signs that politicians in our hitherto supine Parliament, are waking up to the monster that we have created.",

This was the Act of Parliament upon which our accession to what was then the European Economic Community, better known as the Common Market, was based. It gave primacy to law made by the European Community over any law made in our own Parliament: It was the original ‘surrender Act’.\nIt was, of course, given democratic sanction and legitimacy by a referendum in 1975 in which voters were asked if they wished to remain within the Common Market. I campaigned and voted in that referendum for a ‘no’ vote: a vote to leave. We were heavily defeated: the people voted to remain by a margin of almost two to one.\nThose voters however, were assured throughout the campaign that this was a purely economic arrangement from which we would benefit from freer trade and that there would be ‘no essential loss of national sovereignty’. Nevertheless we were warned by a vigorous No campaign which demonstrated that we had handed over control of our fisheries, abandoned our economic partnership with friends in the Commonwealth like Australia and New Zealand; and we would discover that, in time, the Treaty of Rome, to which we had acceded, really did mean what it said about ‘ever closer union’. We heard both sides of the argument and we made our choice with our eyes open.\nThe pressure for another referendum grew over the decades entirely as a consequence of the way that the European Economic Community developed into the European Union on a trajectory to become a super state with its own constitution, government, parliament, supreme court, currency, flag and national anthem. It became ever clearer that with each successive European Treaty (The Single European Act, Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice, Lisbon) that we were losing control of our laws, our money, and our borders; that increasingly we were being governed by people who we had not elected and whom we were unable to remove.\nTo be fair, European advocates of this endeavour never made any secret of their intent, they were open and honest about what they were seeking to achieve. It was our own UK politicians who kept on insisting that the treaties they were signing-up to really didn’t mean what they said.\nIn my estimate, David Cameron’s greatest legacy (-however he campaigned and voted in the 2016 referendum), is that he committed to having a referendum in his 2015 election manifesto and he implemented the promise when he won it. I was at the very centre of his regime and I well recall the evolution in his thinking: notwithstanding his support for remaining in the EU (though he certainly wanted fundamental reform of it), he recognised that remaining required renewed consent from the British people and he had reached this conclusion well before the electoral pressure from UKIP made it an imperative.\nAll that is history and we are leaving\nWe have good friends in the EU with whom we share many interests and objectives. We will continue to pursue those shared goals and to co-operate closely. We will however, no longer be joining them as they evolve into a United Stares of Europe. We will once again be governed by people whom we elect, and whom we can remove.",

Thankfully however, it emerged during the debate that the police have no power of entry to a dwelling to enforce the measure.

In contrast I usually agree with, Sammy Wilson, the Democratic Unionist MP for East Antrim. Strangely, I found the position completely reversed on Tuesday at Energy and Climate Change questions in the Commons.\nSammy questioned Ed regarding an issue on which I’d had a score of emails from constituents. I don’t know where they got the story from but I’ve been confidently replying that it is utter nonsense. Here is Tuesday’s exchange between Sammy & Ed:\nSammy Wilson\nIn the 1970s, global warmists wanted to put black dust on the Arctic to block the sun. Now the Minister wants to put black dust on clouds to block the sun again. Is his plan not bonkers? £50 million of taxpayer’s money has been spent, which will only put up energy prices even further.\nEd Milliband\nSecretary of State, Energy & Climate Change\nThis is like conspiracy theories gone mad. I feel like we have entered a whacky world. Let us keep our eyes on the prize. As a country, we are vulnerable because of our exposure to fossil fuels. This Government has one mission alone: to get clean, home-grown power, so that we take back control.\nI share Tony Blair’s doubts about the Government’s timetable for achieving net zero carbon emissions. We are in danger of crippling industry with uncompetitive energy costs in an expensive race to net zero.\nThat said, I do support the objective, if not the timetable. Achieving the objective will, in the long run, reduce our energy costs and rescue our planet.\nThe important thing about net zero however, is understanding the meaning and importance of ‘net’.\nNo matter how hard we try, and how difficult we make life for ourselves in the medium term, we are still going to be reliant on hydrocarbons to generate power in a substantial number of processes and applications for many years yet. This will continue to generate carbon dioxide emissions that warm the climate. The requirement is to remove sufficient carbon from the atmosphere so that what we take out, balances what we continue to generate.\nCarbon capture and storage can be achieved by enlightened agricultural policy but, in my estimate, technology will prove much more important.\nThe capability to sequester carbon dioxide from the air is a technology developed over a century ago. It does not involve diming the sun, or any other such nonsense. It is however, an energy hungry process which we need to improve before implementing on an industrial scale.\nTechnology ‘to the rescue’ will be politically much more tolerable than persuading people to give up meat, dairy products, private transport , and overseas holidays, or -for the conspiracy theorists- forgoing sunshine.",

Frankly, I doubt it, but it really is far too soon to tell.\nMost exciting, or alarming – depending on your point of view, is the eleventh hour review of the EDF nuclear development at Hinkley Point. I am no expert, but if the Chinese are financing it, and French taxpayers are bearing the development risks, then why look a gift horse in the mouth?\nThe key question is – are we getting a good price for the electricity. The way the issue has been handled however, sends all the wrong signals to potential investors just at a critical moment when we need to be sending out a very clear message that Britain is open for business.\nOur new kremlinologists detect the hand of one Nick Timothy, the Prime Minister’s former special advisor and now her joint chief of staff. Apparently, he wrote something in the past raising questions about the national security aspects of Chinese investments in our strategic industries. Well, we will all want to know a great deal more about Mr Timothy as the PM’s new consigliere, indeed we will want to know everything that there is to know. Some will never have heard of him, others – like me, will know little more that that he sports a beard like Ivan the Terrible.\nActually, it’s complete nonsense: Nick Timothy will have no more decision making power than Larry the Downing Street cat, or any other of the PM’s familiars. Hitherto she has been renowned for running a very tight ship and all decisions will be very much her own.

The further amendment went another step by requiring that if the Government couldn’t meet that reporting obligation because of a prorogation, then a Royal Proclamation would require Parliament to meet the next day and for five subsequent days.\nThis perceived “Remainer triumph” is based on one quite false assumption, namely that there ever was a serious plan to prorogue Parliament in the first place. There wasn’t. It just isn’t serious politics. Regular readers of this column may recall that I addressed the issue several weeks ago and reminded them that when King Charles I prorogued the Long Parliament, it didn’t end well for him.\nOf course, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson refused to rule out the possibility of a prorogation, but refusing to rule something out is very different from having a plan to do it. The first rule of any serious negotiator is to keep all possibilities open.\nThe damage that the defeat has done, is not that it has removed a serious option, but that it sends a further signal to the EU -as if one were needed- indicating that Parliament will oppose a no-deal BREXIT, and therefore that the threat is a paper-tiger and that they need not engage seriously in negotiations to avoid it.\nOnce again Parliament has had the effect of acting like a fifth column in undermining the Government’s BREXIT negotiations.\nHow reliable is the signal that Parliament has sent?\nThe Government defeat was large, but does it really indicate that a majority in Parliament would vote to block a no-deal BREXIT?\nI doubt it.\nThe actual vote was on the question of potentially side-lining Parliament at a key moment in our history, not something to be taken lightly in a modern parliamentary democracy that takes itself seriously.\nFrankly, in such a circumstance it isn’t difficult to persuade democrats of any persuasion to resist the Government whip on such a question.\nIt is a quite different question however, to ask democrats representing constituencies that voted by 70% and upwards in favour of leaving the EU, instead to vote to change the law and prevent the UK leaving on All Souls Day.\nThe last time the Commons voted on the possibility of availing itself of such a power, it demurred and the proposal was defeated by 11 votes.\nI conclude that no-deal remains on the table, and the EU better believe it.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_families/content_515.html": "Family life is the bedrock of Society\nThe proportion of children born outside marriage has doubled over the last couple of decades to 40%. This matters because children born inside a marriage stand a significantly better chance of not having to live through the experience of their parent’s relationship breaking up: By the time they turn five years of age, over half the children of cohabiting parents will have seen their parents split up, but only 15% of the same age cohort among children of married parents will have to live through that experience.One of the worst things one experiences as a Member of Parliament is the petitions from parents seeking assistance in what has become a war with their former partners in which access to children has become one of the weapons.\nRecent law reform delivering ‘no fault divorce’ is designed to remove the adversarial aspects of splitting up, together with the anger and blame that goes with it. If it is successful in doing so, it will be at the very margin. Yet, the impacts are much wider: Irrespective of whether couples are married or just cohabiting, splitting -up is the swiftest route to poverty. Of the problems that are regularly brought to my ‘surgery’, whether they be debt, housing, schooling or whatever, once you scratch the surface, in nine out of ten cases, the underlying cause is family breakdown. A quarter of our families are now headed by a lone parent, nearly all of them women (90%). Half of all the children in England now have to live across more than one household. These sobering statistics compare very poorly with our neighbours – for children in single parent households they are twice as bad as the European average. I’ve often said in this column that there are few levers that governments can pull to solve our problems and that we need to take greater responsibility for our own lives. Nevertheless, the economic and social costs of this disaster in family life should prompt the new PM to ask, ‘to what extent government policy in the design of the tax and benefit system has placed the traditional two parent household under financial strains that are much greater than in similar jurisdictions?’In essence the answer is that we place a much greater tax burden on them.",

I had anticipated that I would do so. After all, I had only been in the job for 9 months. The Prime Minister knew I was enthusiastic, because I had told him that it was what I wanted. Given that the consensus was that I was making a reasonable fist of it, my working assumption was that I would return.\nOn Monday last week, as the reshuffle was in progress, I went to the department in Whitehall only to find that my security pass would no longer operate the entry barrier. Having secured the assistance of the staff, I went upstairs to my office. I discovered that my belongings had been packed into boxes. I joked with my private office staff asking if they knew something that I didn’t. They explained that this was just standard procedure because, were a minister to be moved and replaced, the office had to be ready immediately for occupation by the new minister. I think they were a little embarrassed by the circumstances but we had a good laugh about it. In that spirit I logged on to my Twitter account and tweeted that my pass didn’t work, my stuff was in packing cases: was this ‘the end?’\nIt was not intended to be taken seriously. Unfortunately hundreds of my followers on Twitter reacted rather differently. Some began to express their sorrow, and others their fury at my shabby treatment. Journalists began to call, asking me if I could confirm that I had been sacked. Colleagues sought me out to express their sorrow. Touched though I was by all this sympathy, I found the business of trying to explain it all, and that I still fully expected to be back at my post, very repetitive. In the end I simply had to go and hide at the far end of the library.\nLater that evening the call from Number Ten came, and put the matter beyond doubt. Not for everyone however, a fellow did email me to suggest that this was a social media triumph: that I was indeed to have been sacked, but such was the ‘Twitter storm’ that the Prime Minister had had been forced to reconsider. Some people will believe anything!\nAnyway, now that I have my feet firmly back under the ministerial desk, I make the observation that we did not hear very much about international development during the election campaign notwithstanding events which presented the opportunity to raise its profile: first the deaths of scores of people being ‘trafficked’ across the Mediterranean Sea; and second, the earthquake in Nepal.\nI suppose the reason it did not become an election issue is that there is broad agreement about it among the all the main parties with the exception of UKIP. There clearly was no appetite to give UKIP oxygen by concentrating on an issue where the prejudice of the public was broadly in line with UKIP’s thinking – namely that we spend too much on international development.\nI made my position clear however, at each of the six hustings that took place in my parliamentary division of New Forest West. The purpose of the international development budget is largely the same as that of our defence budget: to secure a safer and more stable world in which we can prosper; International development aid it is not charity, rather it is an investment that we make to secure safety and stability. It is no good us just wringing our hands at the political, social, security, and economic consequences of the tide of humanity desperately seeking to cross the Mediterranean and make a new life in Europe. We have to be prepared to invest in solutions to the problems that are driving them from their own countries. In short, we have to make life better there, and we have to tackle the forces that generate terrorism there.\nMy ambition is that by the end of this parliament we will understand this rather better and that, rather than grumbling about our foreign aid budget, we will be proud of what it is achieving.",

I was encouraged nevertheless, because it indicated that at least some government advisers are thinking radically. In that respect it was a mild corrective to the very depressing impression that there is a loss of any sense of urgency on the part of government about the need to find ways of expediting the lifting of lockdown restrictions. It is just incredible to hear government scientists musing in public about keeping businesses closed until June: There would be no such businesses left.\nThe cost of lockdown to the Government alone is £9 billion per week, never mind the cost to the Economy as a whole; the future of young adults; and of our children’s education.\nSo profound are these costs that we should consider spending any amount of money on initiatives that could contribute to ending them. Whether paying for positive tests to encourage testing is an idea with such merit, is something on which we might reflect further.\nBut here is an idea from the Adam Smith Institute on we should spend vast amounts straight away.\nExpediting the vaccination program is the principal means by which we can reduce hospital admissions and so prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed and therefore, justify ending the lockdown.\nThe restraint on our vaccination effort is limited supplies of vaccine.\nThe Pfizer vaccine costs £16 per dose, but the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine -because it was seed-funded by the Government on the basis of a not-for-profit distribution – costs a mere £2 per dose.\nWe should offer AstraZeneca a commercial rate for each dose in order to subsidise an exponential growth in its productive capacity, allowing us to proceed much faster with vaccinations and ending lockdown.\nThat greater productive capacity would also be a further contribution on our part to enable developing countries to acquire the vaccine inexpensively, leading to fewer new strains and greater freedom to travel.\nIt would be worth every penny, and seems vastly more promising that paying someone for testing positive.",

It’s a bit late! We’ve had the election and during the campaign I made explicit my determination to vote to repeal it. Indeed, the approach to the Act was a defining difference between the political parties. For my own part, I voted against the Act back in 1998 in the first place.\nSome people seem to be under the extraordinary illusion that human rights began with the act in 1998, and that prior to that we lived in a dark age without any rights. What the 1998 Act did was to make the European Convention on Human Rights enforceable in our own courts, making our own judges follow the lead given by the judges in Strasbourg.\nI am wholly opposed to this sort of rights legislation which I believe gives creative opportunities to judges to place some people above the law.\nYou may recall a spat back in 2011 when, in a speech at the Conservative Party Conference, Theresa May – the Home Secretary – condemned a judgement allowing a foreign criminal to avoid deportation on the grounds of his ‘ human right to a family life’ – because he owned a cat!\nNow, it doesn’t matter if the fellow was spared deportation because of the cat, or some other circumstance, be it a lover or whatever. The fact is that he was placed above the law and spared the proper penalty for his crime. Had another individual done as he did, but without possessing a cat or having a lover, he would not have been spared. This is fundamentally unjust. It is, however, not only offensive to some abstract concept of justice, rather it is a significant practical problem: scores other offenders are walking our streets because judges have put their rights above the law, the will of Parliament, and the elected representatives of all our people.\nI have a much more fundamental view of our human rights: I believe that we have the right to live as we please and do as we wish, so long as we do not break the law – which we are all equal before, and none of us – however mighty, is above. The real battle for those of us who value liberty is to constrain the ever-present legislative urge. Do not underestimate this struggle: the state, armed with all its coercive power, already extends into private aspects of our lives and homes which free Englishmen would never have tolerated in the past. This desire for ever more laws is almost universal: sometimes I wonder if am totally at odds with my constituents in opposing it; daily they write to me suggesting new laws to govern our lives as a remedy to some real or imagined problem: banning this or that, enforcing this or that. Heavens! Some even write demanding that it be compulsory to vote. The incessant demand for more law and regulation is the real threat to our liberty.\nSo called rights which place some people above the law, be they cat owning thieves, illegal immigrants or terrorists, undermines the fundamental principle of equality before the law, and ends up making a mockery of justice. The Human Rights Act 1998 should be consigned to the dustbin.",

Applying strengthened penalties will send a clear message that animal cruelty will not be tolerated and will enable our courts to take a firmer approach to cases where pets are illegally imported. The Government would be supportive of legislation to ban this through a single-issue Bill when parliamentary time allows.\nThe UK has one of the most rigorous pet travel border checking regimes in the world and every dog travelling into Great Britain on approved routes has its microchip and paperwork checked to make sure they are properly vaccinated and are old enough to travel. In addition, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulted on proposed changes to the commercial and non-commercial movements of pets into Great Britain. Defra has been carefully reviewing feedback from this consultation, and a summary will follow in due course.\nFurther, Ministers have taken action to tackle the practice of puppy farming. Following the introduction of Lucy’s Law in 2020, everyone must now buy directly from breeders or consider adopting from rescue centres, which is a major step in stopping the illegal pet trade.

That much is generally agreed. The key question on which a consensus has yet to be reached is how are we going to pay for the much greater sums that we will need to spend.\nI sat on the legislative standing committee which introduced the distinction between healthcare, provided free at the point of use by the NHS, and social care which is means-tested. This distinction is not always sustainable, especially where patients with dementia together with a number of complex medical conditions are concerned. The assessment procedures to deal with these cases and to provide ‘Continuing NHS Care’ -where all the cost are met by the NHS- leave much to be desired, they are applied differently giving rise to a postcode lottery and to a perception of unfairness.\nThat sense of unfairness however, is much wider: People who have been lucky, wise, hard-working and successful in building up their savings will find that have to pay the full cost of their care. Whilst, those who have been impecunious or just much less fortunate, will have their social care paid for at the expense of taxpayers.\nThat perception of unfairness is an inevitable consequence of any system reliant on means-testing. We just live with it across other aspects of our welfare state; Where, for example, access to Universal Credit is denied to those who have significant savings, even though they have lost their income.\nThe only way to avoid this perception of unfairness is to remove any individual responsibly entirely by making free provision universal.\nUniversal benefits, irrespective of income and assets, come at an enormous cost to taxpayers, with all the consequences that higher taxation has for reduced incentives, investment and productivity.\nIt comes down to this simple question in the end: do we want to nationalise another aspect of our collective life by simply expecting the state to provide it?\nPoliticians often refer to the ‘scandal’ of elderly patients having to sell their homes to meet the costs of residential care. Of course, we’d all much prefer to leave our assets to the next generation, but equally, I was always taught to save up for a ‘rainy day’. Well, when you need social care, isn’t that the rainy day?\nI do not believe that we need to commission another great review of the options. The last such review developed a workable solution (and which Parliament legislated to implement): Sir Andrew Dilnot proposed a cap on the amount that anyone would be required to spend on social care if they had the means to do so. Beyond that cap the taxpayer would meet the costs. He suggested a cap of £75,000. Clearly, the lower the cap the greater the burden that will be borne by taxpayers.\nThe advantage of a cap however, is that it gives the insurance industry the certainty of a maximum liability which will enable the development of affordable financial products to protect those customers who want to safeguard their assets and savings for the next generation.\nThe Dilnot proposal is a means of getting more funding into social care on the basis of a ‘mixed economy’, whilst going some way to addressing the unfairness of a means tested system. But we must not hide from the reality that it comes at a greater cost to the public purse which inevitably will require either higher taxes or less expenditure on other aspects of government provision, and we need to be open and honest about recognising that.",

Actually, I was pleasantly surprised by the number of officers that were on duty. Clearly, more would be welcome, and there is no slack: changing shift and leave patterns can lead to reductions in the number of officers on duty.\nCertainly, the Prime Minister’s decision to begin recruiting a further 20,000 officers is going to help.\nJust how many police officers are deployed in Hampshire is not a parliamentary matter, it is for the elected Police Commissioner to negotiate with the Chief Constable, and to consider how much extra to charge us all on our council tax policing precept.\nI do not doubt that greater police numbers are necessary to address the complexity of modern crime, particularly crime facilitated by the internet. In addition, we need more officers to examine the growing volume of evidence that is presented by mobile phones and other electronic media.\nGreater police presence on the streets is a welcome reassurance, but the coincidence of a the police being present when gangs have a go at one another, or a burglary takes place will remain remote.\nThe problem is not a new one. Oliver Cromwell, confronted with growing criminal disorder during the Commonwealth, asked “if I arm one in ten, will that suffice?”\nA rather greater source of complaint in my postbag concerns the judiciary.\nWe know that a upsurge in crime in any local area can often be the responsibility of one or two individuals. Therefore, nothing is more frustrating than when one of them is caught and prosecuted only to be given a suspended sentence.\nThe Courts have been given ever greater sentencing powers in recent years to deal with repeat offenders. I can understand the anger when they are not used. We were told that knife crime would incur a mandatory jail sentence, only to read earlier this year of a miscreant getting a suspended sentence for his second offence.\nPerhaps we should consider electing judges as they do in the USA. That would keep them more in touch with the public perception and prejudice of what justice should look like.\nHitherto, our judicial model has been quite different and separated from the people: When you become a judge you abandon prejudice and become utterly impartial. You cease to be yourself, symbolised by adopting the name ‘Justice’, and by wearing a uniform and wig.\nThis has however, now been thoroughly undermined by our novel Supreme Court where they have abandoned these conventions and instead, courted celebrity. As did the Court’s president, Lady Hale, by displaying her spider broach, and then by appearing before a presentation entitled ‘Spider Woman Takes Down The Hulk’ and praising the “girly swats“. If we have to endure this sort of political posturing, we should have the choice of electing them, or to elect others in their place.",

Boris has acknowledged this and apologised for it. Many believe that those at the helm of such a dysfunctional ship should have taken responsibility and resigned. I have some sympathy with that view. Nevertheless, this was not the issue that was before the Committee of Privilege and the Commons.\nI do not impugn the integrity of the Committee, though I believe it was unwise to have allowed itself to be chaired by someone who had been so critical of Boris. Nevertheless, I do not question her integrity.\nThe procedure adopted by the committee and the Commons was the right one: only elected members of Parliament should determine whether another elected member be suspended or expelled.\nI simply disagree with the Committee’s conclusions, as I am entitled to do.\nParliament is the highest court in the land and when it exercises its judicial functions this should be reflected in its proceedings. Unlike the measured and forensic method of the Committee, the debate in the Commons was highly charged and deeply political.\nI have not served on a Jury but I have been a member of the board on half a dozen courts marshall where the procedure is, in essence, the same.\nI was among sternest critics of the Government during the period in question when Boris was Prime Minister.\nHad Boris come before my court I might have found him guilty of a number of offences had he been charged with them. Nevertheless, on the basis of the evidence for the crime with which he was charged, I would have had no alternative but to acquit.\nI believe that, notwithstanding the weight of evidence cited by the Committee, it failed to identify and sustain the mens rea – the guilty intent.\nThe essence of the case was that the rules required that workplace gatherings, to be lawful, had to be essential. The PM authorised such gatherings for the purpose of thanking staff for their contribution and to sustain their morale. These purposes were not essential, and therefore the gatherings were unlawful. So, by repeatedly stating that rules were not broken Boris was Lying.\nI disagree. However flawed the PM’s judgement may have been in reaching his decision about the essential nature of gatherings, it was his decision to make. Having made that judgement, he was entitled to believe that they fell within the rules. He may have wrong in his judgement but that is no basis on which to assert that he was lying.\nIn addition to the binary choice, guilty or not guilty, there is an additional verdict that is available to courts in Scotland which might have been appropriate in this case: ‘not proven’.",

Whilst Ukraine must put up with death and destruction and economic hardship, we have only to put up with the economic hardship.\nAs energy prices rise exponentially, of course, the Government will have to come forward with more schemes to assist the most vulnerable. The war however, demands a sacrifice from us in terms of significantly reducing our energy consumption. It will be painful, but the notion that we can carry on consuming and expect the Government to borrow the money to pay our bills is the economics of the madhouse.\nRecently constituents have emailed make their own suggestions to me. Here are three:\n“The Government should ‘freeze’ energy prices”. This is a bit like King Canute trying to stop the tide coming in. If we froze prices consumers would be paying £30 billion in total for energy, but the energy suppliers would be buying it on international markets at twice that amount. They wouldn’t last very long. We’ve already had to pick up the bill for all those that went bust because they were paying more for it than the capped price consumers were paying last year.\nAnother suggestion is that we nationalise the supply companies. Nationalisation changes the ownership from shareholders to taxpayers. It does nothing to alter the price they will be charged for the energy and the price at which they sell it. The economics won’t have altered even if the ownership has. All we would have done is saddled ourselves with the cost of nationalisation and the ownership of the companies as they become bankrupt.\nWhilst the costs of extracting oil and gas have risen with general inflationary pressures, the price at which they sell these commodities has risen very much faster. The suggestion is that it is only fair to have a windfall tax on their profits where they operate within our jurisdiction. I’ve already set out my objections to this policy in my blog of 24 March Windfall (desmondswaynemp.com) and 4 April Energy Bills (desmondswaynemp.com). It is a short-sighted policy that jeopardises vital investment in internationally competitive markets.\nThird, The Government could reduce its own contributions to our energy bills – VAT and green levies. It could indeed, but this reduction in tax revenue will increase government borrowing, so we will only be deferring the bill at a time when out debt is already alarmingly high and interest rates are rising.\nSo, in the end it comes back to this: Hard times.

In all probability, many more families may be less fortunate in only having one parent, be it a father or a mother.\nI cannot imagine how someone with a widow for a mother would be offended by any mention that I visited my father over a weekend. No more so, can I imagine that a fellow with two mothers at home would be upset by such a reference to my father.\nIt is, of course, complete nonsense. Irrespective of our sex and sexual preferences, we are all quite capable and broad-minded enough to chat about what we did at the weekend without our colleagues being upset by references to our mothers and fathers, whether they possess such parents themselves or not.\nWhat this is really about is given away by the earlier part of the instruction namely, to avoid mentioning anyone’s gender. What they seek is the abolition of the concept of fatherhood and motherhood in entirety, replacing it instead with a gender-free concept of parenthood.\nNow, I’ve previously made clear in this column that I consider this concept of separating sex and gender as pretty nutty. Nevertheless, given my preference for freedom of expression, if people want to espouse this nonsense, that is entirely a matter for them. In my opinion they are entitled to believe that there are any number of genders.

Effectively it is telling us that polite and decent people don’t use those offensive words.\nI’m not normally a conspiracy theorist, but I’ve begun to wonder if there is one.\nWhy is it that this new gender ideology is trying to purge us of everything that we have considered familiar, even normal?\nI don’t know, but I’m working on it.",

The Commons is supreme.\nConstitutional theorists fret about this largely unchecked concentration of legislative power in one body. It does have the virtue however, of being elected, so that it is periodically held to account by voters for its stewardship.\nI have always been in receipt of letters demanding constitutional reform, to be fair it’s always been a minority taste amongst my correspondents, but it has been growing steadily albeit from a low base. Their principal demand is for the certainty of a written constitution.\nThis is the very opposite of what we currently enjoy, where there is no superior body of constitutional law that cannot be altered by statute (a new act of Parliament).

Parliament is supreme and no court can strike out its statutes.\n(Under the Human Rights Act 1998 a court can declare any Act of Parliament as being incompatible with the Human Rights Act, but that will be just a declaration: the offending Act remains in force; the court cannot strike it out.

I remember him once rising after a particularly long and vapid ministerial answer and simply saying “why?” leaving the minister floundering. Tam was one of the few Scottish members opposed to devolving powers to a Scottish parliament. It was he who framed what became known as the “West Lothian Question” (he was the Member for West Lothian when he framed it though he was subsequently the Member of Linlithgow).\nBasically, at issue in the question was, if having once devolved Scottish educational matters to a parliament in Edinburgh, the fairness of the Member for Linlithgow voting in Westminster on educational matters in England which would have no effect in his own constituency.\nThe matter came to a head in the election campaign of 2015 because of the collapse of Labour support in its former Scottish Heartlands: Labour’s only prospect of getting into Government was believed to be, on the basis of polling, by relying on the support the Scottish nationalist MPs. Under such a scenario, England representing 80 of UK would have been governed at the will of Scottish MPs voting on matters whose own laws were devolved to an exclusively Scottish Parliament.\nTo the surprise of many it didn’t happen: a majority Conservative government was elected. One of its manifesto pledges however, was to address the issue with ‘English Votes for English Laws’ (EVAL). So, we changed the Standing Orders of the House of Commons (the nearest thing to a written constitution that we have) to exclude Scottish MPs from detailed stages of legislation not affecting Scotland and for the House to sit as an English Grand Committee in which Scottish MPs would not vote. The procedure was clumsy but effective.\nOut of the blue last week the Government introduced a motion to remove the procedure and to return to the status quo ante. I am at a loss as to its motive. The Covid-secure Westminster was empty and utterly ineffective. There were a handful of us there to vote against the measure, but to divide the House you need to supply two tellers, one for the ‘Aye’ Lobby and one for the ‘No’ lobby. Alas, so many of us have been persuaded not to act as ‘supper-spreaders’ by crowding the lobbies and instead to accept the innovation of voting by proxy.

With our ‘activist’ Speaker, there will be no shortage of time for the Government’s opponents to rise to this challenge.\nIn my estimate the Government’s action further reduces the possibility of leaving the EU without an agreement, because it sends an even stronger signal of the Government’s determination to leave on 31st October whatever the circumstance.\nThe EU, never hitherto believing that we would do it (a belief re-enforced by the parliamentary ‘5th column’ insisting that they would prevent it), now has to -for the first time- contemplate this real possibility and negotiate to avert it.\nAs I have always said, taking no-deal off the table, increased the possibility of a no-deal BREXIT because it reduced the strength of our negotiating hand to secure a deal that could get through Parliament.\nIt is ironic that most of those who are most vehement in their opposition to no-deal, were overwhelmingly the ones who voted against the current Withdrawal Agreement. For so many of them, what they really oppose is our leaving the EU at all.\nGood luck to the Mysterons, it’s time they had a win.",

He embraced so many campaigns -supporting families; poverty; animal cruelty- with enormous enthusiasm and lasting stamina.\nAbove all, he was most generous with that most precious of commodities -his time: he was always prepared to give you his time and help you out if you had a problem. His brutal murder came as a great shock.\nIn responding to such shocking events there is always a danger of over-reacting. In the commentaries that have followed Sir David’s murder there have been, in my estimate, a number of such over-reactions.\nIn several analyses the deaths of Sir David, Jo Cox, Ian Gow and Sir Anthony Berry have been classified together. I think this is quite mistaken: Ian Gow and Sir Anthony were murdered by the IRA as part of an organised territorial campaign to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom. Sir David and Jo Cox were murdered by ‘lone wolves’ with quite different, though equally despicable motives.\nA number of commentaries have drawn attention to the way that our public and political discourse has become so charged with unpleasantness and abuse, some on which is attributed to social media.\nWhilst, this observable fact and horrid, I doubt that it accounts in any way for the ideological derangement that leads someone to kill Members of Parliament.\nI am very fortunate in never having been threatened, or having felt threatened in the 23 years since I was elected. I have every sympathy with those colleagues who are constantly being threatened. Clearly, appropriate precautions need to be taken to protect them. Demands for police protection for all MPs are however, quite misplaced. There are many calls on police time. After all, many more ordinary members of the public have been killed by terrorist outrages in recent years. It would be a denial of democracy if politicians were to be protected from the public who elect them.\n*\nSir David Amess was renowned in public life for his Christian faith, but I was rather taken by surprise by Katie Martin on Radio Solent when she asked me where God was when Sir David was murdered. I didn’t answer very well. The proper answer is that God was there. The Christian truth is that in the life of Christ God shared our suffering. We do not understand God’s purposes but it’s no good complaining that the Universe is imperfect, full of suffering and not the one that we would made. It is the Universe in which we have to live and either we have faith in its ultimate purpose even though we have no understanding, or we accept that ultimately there is no purpose, that there is no justice and that in the end suffering is un-remedied.\nProfessor Richard Dawkins would argue that faith in God’s purpose is based on our wish for it to be true and that we just cannot face the reality that we are in a purposeless universe (in essence Karl Marx made the same critique). Dawkins may well be right in that we do want it to be true, but since when did the desire for something constitute a disproof of its existence?\nAfter a sleepless night of anxiety and pain you wish for the dawn; that you desire the dawn, doesn’t mean that it won’t come.",

I think it quite disingenuous to describe the ending what was always a temporary increase in Universal Credit as a ‘cut’.\nAt the outset of the first lock-down in March last year, the temporary increase was made in order to address the needs of a surge in the number of newly unemployed people who had no previous experience of having to navigate living on benefits: It was an emergency measure.\nIf however, you had the odd £6 billion to spare and you wanted to address the needs of our most vulnerable people, you would not spend it by giving every recipient of Universal Credit an extra £20 per week, irrespective of their particular circumstances, including whether they had any children or not. There are much better targeted ways of relieving want amongst the most needy. The action that was taken in that particular way was purely because it was an emergency and that it was a temporary.\nThe circumstances in which the increase was made have now changed profoundly: Currently we have one million vacancies; Every employer that I meet vents his or her frustration that they just cannot recruit the staff that they need. It would be irresponsible to prolong the increase in Universal Credit when we need to raise the sights of claimants to take the opportunity to work longer hours or get a more demanding and better paid job.\nNevertheless, as a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Work and Pensions, I am not tin-eared to the evidence that we have taken over recent weeks. I accept that we need to address the aspects of benefits that prevent people from taking a job or increasing their hours. First, childcare costs – the cap on the amount claimable has not been increased for 18 years. Second, the ‘taper’ (the amount of benefit you lose for every additional £1 that you gain from working) was always originally designed to be more generous in order to always ‘make work pay’.

The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the publication of the Government response to this consultation and accompanying call for evidence. However, Ministers are continuing to work on this important area and will publish a response as soon as they are able to do so. The approach on hunting trophies will be comprehensive, robust and effective and will deliver the change promised to help protect thousands of species worldwide.\nIn the 25 Year Environment Plan, the UK Government committed to providing international leadership in protecting and improving international biodiversity and undertaking international action to protect endangered species. This international leadership is underpinned by a strong commitment to ensuring that the UK’s domestic policy does not threaten the conservation of species abroad. While some conservationists believe trophy hunting can be an effective conservation tool, it is also important to acknowledge concerns around the practice of trophy hunting. I welcome that the Government has proposed a new Animals Abroad Bill to tackle animal cruelty and include bans on the trade in hunting trophies.

Actually, the benefits available in some other European jurisdictions that they pass through are significantly more generous. On the contrary, they choose to come to Britain because it is here that it is so much easier to find work.\nNotwithstanding record numbers of vacancies, we forbid asylum applicants from working. Instead, we pay them modest allowances insisting that they remain idle. Many of my parliamentary colleagues believe that this is absurd and that we should allow them to work in all those enterprises keen to employ them.\nIn my estimate this would be a mistake: it would increase the very incentive to travel all the way to Britain eschewing the opportunities to settle elsewhere along the route.\nWhat we need to address is the ease with which illegal work can be had here.\nSecond, deterrence: If you make it to Britain, even if your application for asylum is rejected, there is little prospect of you being deported, So, If we are to reduce the numbers arriving across the Channel we need the deterrent effect of that danger and expense ending up with the probability of deportation elsewhere. Some of the measures in the Borders Bill currently going through Parliament (if we can get them through the House of Lords) will address aspects of this by doing away with endless appeals and other abuses.\nThe plan to deliver arrivals to Rwanda however, has the potential to completely undermine the people-smuggler’s market: why risk thousands of pounds only to end up in Rwanda?\nI do not underestimate the difficulties of implementing this plan.

So far, all they have offered us is the hope of better co-operation with the French authorities – ignoring the fact we’ve already been paying them handsomely. And ‘opening up more safe routes to UK’.

The proper response to a price rise is to reduce consumption. The purpose of the proposed tax cut, or cash rebate, is to maintain consumption at the higher price level. Given that both of them will have to be funded by borrowing, the consequence will be to put even further pressure on prices, prolonging inflation.\nThe increase in energy and food prices is driven by the war in Ukraine. At the outset, I warned that sanctioning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine also meant sanctioning ourselves and that the public needed to understand the consequences that would follow.\nWinston Churchill said in his history The second World War, that the British people were resilient and could endure enormous hardship if they understood why it was necessary. What they would not forgive however, was being taken for fools, being given false hope, promises that could not be delivered.\nI hope that this fortitude and resilience has not deserted us in the intervening years. We need to understand that we have, with our allies, declared economic war on Russia because of its unprovoked attack on an independent democracy. This was the right course of action to secure peace and our future security. We have learnt from the mistakes of the policy of appeasing dictators that preceded the Second World War. But the consequence is our current economic hardship, which is bound to intensify over the coming winter. We need to resolve to steel ourselves for it and rise to the challenge.\nAs to false hope and promises that cannot be delivered, surely the notion that the Government can and ought to pay our energy bills for us has to be among the more ludicrous of them. Where on earth do we imagine the money is to come from?\nIt has to come from cutting expenditure elsewhere, or from borrowing which will have to be repaid -with ever increasing rates of interest- by higher taxes later which will stifle hopes for economic growth.\nPerhaps the only even more ludicrous notion is that we should just refuse to pay our bills and carry on consuming. Nothing would be more damning for our reputation as a country in which to invest, let alone the longer-term consequences for our energy security. It would be a national disaster, an act of sheer madness.\nWhilst we are not ourselves being bombarded and subjected to a brutal assault, we have chosen to stand by Ukraine.

They are a conspiracy by producers and politicians against the interests of ordinary customers.\nNevertheless, tariffs have a long history even in our own great free-trading nation. Indeed, my own Tory Party split -and consequently was out of power for a generation- when Sir Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington succeeded in repealing the Corn Laws in in 1846. Thereafter, the burnt and bandaged hand wandered back towards the flame in the guise of a policy of ‘imperial preference’ before a policy of full-blown tariffs were once more disastrously imposed in the 1930ies.\nOur post-war prosperity is largely a consequence of enlightened abandonment of tariffs, superintended by the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs signed initially by 23 nations in 1947, and which later became the World Trade Organisation.\nThe greatest US President of my political lifetime was Ronald Reagan. I recently came across his 1987 speech on tariffs. Here is an extract\n“First, when someone says let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports it looks like they are doing the patriotic thing by protecting by American products and jobs, and sometimes, for a while, it works. But only for a short time. What eventually occurs is, first, home-grown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs: they stop competing and stop making technological and management changes necessary to succeed in world markets.\nAnd then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs: High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers and less and less competition. So, because of prices made artificially high by the tariffs that subsidise inefficiency poor management, people stop buying. Then the worst happens: markets shrink and collapse; industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.\nThe memories of all this back in the 1930s made me determined that, when I came to Washington, I would spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity”\nRegan was right and Trump is wrong. US businesses will quickly learn that their profits are increasingly dependent, not on innovation and efficiency, but on political favours in the form protectionist tariff barriers. Accordingly, their main effort will become lobbying the politicians for such favours rather than winning new markets.

The short-term relief is bought at the expense of a prolonged nightmare.

It is composed only of hydrogen, helium and traces of lithium: The heavier elements didn’t appear until later –their manufacture required the enormous pressures created in the lives and deaths of generations of massive stars.\nAt the beginning of this month we discovered that the Milky Way had consumed another Galaxy some 10 billion years ago, so millions of stars are in our galaxy that weren’t even born here.\n…and another thing, a year ago we discovered thin strings of gas between galaxies, doubling at a stroke the ordinary matter in the Universe. From our observations and calculations we always knew that it was there, but now we’ve found it.

Part of the sustainable farming incentive is the hedgerow standard, under which ministers will pay farmers to plant more hedgerows, leave them uncut or raise the cutting height. To provide habitat for wildlife, farmers and land managers will be incentivised to maintain and plant more hedgerow trees. I know that simple actions like planting trees within the footprint of existing hedges can make a big difference.\nHedgerows are legally protected by the Hedgerows Regulations 1997 which prohibit their removal without first seeking approval from the local planning authority. The authority is required to decide whether a hedgerow is ‘important’ according to the Regulations and should not be removed. Research has indicated that over 70 per cent of hedgerows in England and Wales are ‘important’. The Regulations therefore play a valuable role in providing statutory protection for a large proportion of hedgerows in the countryside.

Mr Corbyn was proposing to spend these sums, to build a socialist economy, when we were already at full employment; they would have resulted in crowding-out private productive investment, enormous inflationary pressures, and a ballooning trade deficit.\nThe Government’s response is at the other end of an economic cycle which has turned dramatically due to the virus: The purpose is to stave off a massive deflation and unemployment. This response is borne of necessity and the focus is on income replacement – what economists used to call the ‘automatic stabilisers’, to prevent the complete collapse of demand within the economy. It’s Pure Keynesian economics.\nIn one sense, I suppose, they are the same. All Government expenditure, however motivated, ends in the same way: The Government’s borrowing will have to be repaid; and we will all be repaying it in our taxes for a very long time.\nJohn Maynard Keynes, when asked about the impact of his prescriptions in the long run, retorted that ‘in the long run we are all dead anyway’.\nBUT the whole purpose of our policy is to survive, beat the virus, and live longer. As I said last week, it will certainly seem longer.\nLots of Useful Advice\nI’ve been receiving a great deal of unsolicited advice, both face to face and by email.\nOn exiting the Parliament I was accosted by a fellow wearing a sandwich- board who advised me to repent because resisting Covid19 was useless, it being God’s judgement upon us.\nA few paces later, an elderly lady told me that closing down the economy to try and beat the pandemic was folly, on the grounds that it was a natural phenomenon designed to strengthen humanity by culling the weak and infirm!\nThey say that a crisis brings out the best in us -and clearly it does: just look at the number of people volunteering and checking-up on vulnerable neighbours. On the other hand those two cheery souls might find a more useful outlet for their energy. It also brings out behaviour of the worst sort as evidenced by the hoarders who have cleared supermarket shelves.\nMuch of the advice that constituents offer me, is given in the expectation that I will pass it on to ministers, and I have done so, but forgive me for choosing not always to do so. For example, I thought that rather too much information was offered by the fellow who emailed me instructions on how to get-by without loo paper, and I’ve kept that one to myself.\nQuite a few have emailed me to say that the entire strategy is misguided: that only the elderly, weak and vulnerable should have been asked to isolate themselves, the rest of us should have carried on as normal and accepted a ‘tolerable’ death-rate in exactly the same way that we do with flu, which kills thousands every year. Instead, we have chosen to bring the economy to a full stop. These views are not a million miles from those that I expressed myself just a fortnight ago.\nWhat changed perceptions so dramatically was the statistical analysis by Imperial College London of what is happening in Italy, where an advanced modern healthcare system has been completely overwhelmed. The study predicted that a laissez faire approach here,would result in half a million deaths and even with the imposition of much more stringent social controls, the NHS will still be overwhelmed with demands for intensive care and ventilation well beyond its capability.\nThat scenario begs the question of whether there ever really was a sustainable choice available that could have sought to place a higher priority on keeping the economy thriving, above minimising the impact of the virus. Frankly, as admissions spiralled, scenes of mayhem at hospitals were reported on TV (and they will be) and the death toll mounted, then people would have started to isolate themselves entirely voluntarily and the economy would have closed itself down anyway -but in a much more disorderly and damaging fashion.\n*\nThe prospect of being cooped-up for an indeterminate period is not an inviting one. No doubt, we will all live longer as a consequence -it’ll certainly seem longer.\nWe all have our preferences. I have invested in a bottle of brandy rather than joining the crowds apparently determined hoard industrial quantities of loo paper\nThe Budget, and addendum\nWas the budget really this week?\nUsually the Sunday paters would be full of commentary unpacking it.\nIt has been crowded-out by Covid19, but when the pandemic is over, the budget’s implications may be profound.\nBudget day is misery for the Opposition. I know- I spent 13 years of it. The Government has the initiative, all the popular announcements, and the ability to disguise any bad news.\nLast week the Opposition’s misery was compounded by their belief that it was their own manifesto’s large expenditure proposals that the Chancellor was stealing.\nTo be fair, there was a little nervousness on the Government side as some of us felt that people had not necessarily voted Conservative in December in the expectation that the Tories would bring in a Labour budget.\nIn reality, the budget wasn’t quite like that. Whilst there was more money for the NHS, it was by no means John McDonnell’s drive for increased day to day expenditure across the board, paid for by taxing business and the better off.\nThe Budget’s emphasis -aside from vital help to deal with Covid19, was on investment to address Britain’s low productivity and to ‘level-up’ those areas that have been in long-term relative decline.\nThis incentive to borrow in order to invest is hard to resist: currently the Government can take a ten-year loan in the markets with a zero, and even negative rate of interest.\nNevertheless, I do have reservations.\nI believe in a smaller state and lower taxes, and that in our mixed economy we need more of the private sector and less of the government sector in the mix. This budget took as a step in the other direction.\nLarge scale investments will be undertaken by the Government, in the past government investment performance has been patchy. I have never had confidence in government’s ability to ‘pick winners’.\nThe distinction between what is ‘investment’ -generating future returns, and what is day to day current expenditure has often been an elastic one. Fiscal rules are not immune to bending.\nThat is why it is always prudent to keep the total government borrowing requirement in check and to see that the stock of government debt is on a downward trend as a proportion of national income (it still is -just).\nI recall a Conservative election poster in 2010 with the image of a new-born baby and the slogan ‘ she has her mother’s eyes, her father’s hair…and Gordon Brown’s debt’.\nTories must continue to heed their own advice about borrowing: never to borrow now in the expectation that future generations will repay.\nAddendum\nWhat a difference a couple of days make:\nWhat I wrote on Sunday for this column was completely overtaken by events on Tuesday.\nHaving expressed some concern about an expansionary budget of £30 billion, how do I react to the announcement this week of a further £330 billion.\nCounterintuitively, I approve wholeheartedly.\nWe are now in an economic existential crisis pf a greater order than 2008. We responded then with an even larger package to prevent the collapse of the financial sector. It was tough but it paid off.\nIt is essential that we respond to the new circumstance to prevent economic oblivion.\nHoarding Loo Paper\nI have had the benefit many emails offering a great deal of advice on how to deal with the latest conovirus Covid19, in the expectation that I will pass it on to ministers. The one thing that government ministers are not short of at the moment, is advice. Indeed, they have access to the best medical and crisis management advice that can be had.\nOne email correspondent, responding to the false news -published in Times last week- that Parliament was to go into recess for 5 months, told me that he was glad that I was being sent home to my constituency to get ill along with everyone else.\nI responded by pointing out that the danger from the covid19 is not so much to our health as to our wealth (as demonstrated by the collapse of Flybe and the consequences for Southampton Airport that will follow from it).\nSome 17,000 of our fellow citizens die of flu in our country every year but we don’t hide ourselves indoors to try and avoid it. Covid19 is unlikely to kill many more than flu does and most sufferers will experience only mild symptoms, some won’t even realise that they’ve had it.\nThe difficulty is that Covid19 is much more ‘catching’ than flu, with the prospect that one in five of us may be off-work at when it peaks, and for those who do get severe reactions, hospitals will be overwhelmed.\nIt is for this reason that we need to delay the progress of the contagion, pushing its peak as far into the summer as we can. First, this will relieve the NHS of other winter pressures, including flu, so that it is better able to cope with the numbers that will have to be hospitalised. Second, there may be a seasonal decline with covid19, just as there is with flu.\nThe key issue is what to do to slow the progress without wrecking the economy. Clearly, we want to take measures that are effective in retarding the spread but don’t have a downside. That’s why washing your hands frequently is so helpful: it is very effective and has no economic downside whatsoever. Once you start banning large gatherings like sporting events, or even closing schools you will cause major economic dislocation for what might be only a marginal impact on the spread of the disease.\nIf you already have a damaged immune system or are weakened by other health or age-related conditions, I can understand the need to take precautions and to isolate yourself from the risk of exposure to Covid19 as far as you can. The rest of us however, should take advantage of the opportunities to be had, carry on going shopping, going out, and eating out. There are bargains now to be had from the holiday industry, I see no reason why they should be passed-up.\nDon’t waste your money on expensive gels and masks when soap and water will do well enough.\nAnd why people would imagine that they need to hoard loo paper -God only knows.\nSixth Formers missing out?\nI recall that, when standards in education were falling so precipitously in the second half of the nineteen seventies, the Prime Minister- Jim Callaghan- launched a ‘great national debate’ to try and get to the bottom of it.\nMany blamed large class sizes, but rather perversely the statistics didn’t bear them out: with the results for children in larger classes tending to outperform the rest.\nClearly, politicians couldn’t just stand by as literacy and numeracy declined. Consequently, over the decades we imposed a national curriculum instructing teachers what and how to teach, when to teach it and, in order to ensure that they had done so, we imposed a testing regime and school league tables.\nThere is always the danger that the curriculum becomes a straight-jacket, and that schools ‘teach to the test’ to the detriment of a wider education. Nevertheless, results have improved very significantly. Indeed, primary schools have become one of the great success stories of recent years. This has resulted in pressure on a number of preparatory schools in the private sector which have experienced falling rolls because parents have discovered that a good education can be had at their local primary school -without parting with fees.\nI have a particular concern about the other end of the age range at school and college: sixth form education; we fund post sixteen education significantly less generously per pupil, where arguably we should spend more.\nWhen I was studying for my A levels, I had a full timetable -including classes on Saturday mornings. That was still the case when I taught A levels in the mid nineteen eighties. Currently however, we only fund post sixteen-year-olds to the tune with 15 hours per week of teacher contact time. With three, and sometimes four A levels, is that enough?\nOf course, the pupils are required to spend time reading and working on assignments in addition, but I am not convinced that, without sufficient supervision, they are getting a fair deal.\nI spoke to a head-teacher recently who was very concerned that so little time is available that teachers have to stick rigorously to the syllabus and exclude wider discussions.\nConsider how demotivating it would be -for both the pupil and for the teacher- were the subject matter in class to spark your interest and prompt you to ask a question rather wide of the examined syllabus, only to be told “you don’t need to know about that”.\nMy recollection was that the best and most interesting lessons were when the teacher went off at a tangent and gave us an insight into a subject about which he or she was both knowledgeable and passionate.\nI fear that the current generation are in danger of missing out.\nBurning Wood\nFor those of us who love to sit by a log fire in a pub or at home, the announcement of a ban on sales of ‘wet wood’ (moisture content higher than 20%) from February next year, appears to have been most unwelcome and I have been inundated with complaints from constituents denouncing this latest surrender to climate activism.\nI think they are wrong on two counts.\nFirst, anyone who has wasted their time trying to burn wet wood will know what a miserable source of heat that it is. Anyway, on my reading of the proposal, enjoyment of my the log fire will not diminish: Moderately sized deliveries of logs (not less than 2 cubic meters) for storage and seasoning at home before burning will be permitted, as will the sale of kiln-dried wood.\nSecond, the measure is not driven by climate change activism so much as clean air / health activism. The PM25 particles that are targeted by the ban are among the most damaging because they are the smallest and therefore, penetrate further into our lungs. The presence of these micro particles has been in very steep decline for 40 years but there has been a slight rise since 2017, perhaps reflecting the growing popularity of wood-burning stoves.\nHaving raised the issue of climate activism however, there are other privations which will no doubt be demanded of us.\nThere has been Citizen’s Assembly taking place over 4 weekends , where a random selection of our fellow citizens have been deliberating, with the help of ‘experts’ , to consider what changes in lifestyle we will be prepared to tolerate in order to reduce our carbon footprint.\nMy own view is that the only legitimate and accountable citizen’s assembly is Parliament.\nThe legitimacy of this climate assembly rests on the fact that it was commissioned by the select committees on The House of Commons -before the election.\nWell, we will see what they come up with…but no Parliament can bind its successor.\nAs we scramble to cut our emissions by all sorts of sacrifices however, aren’t we missing something rather obvious?\nLast week BP announced plans to eliminate its carbon footprint by 2050. Shell, which made a $15 billion profit last year, responded by saying that it will examine BP’s proposals to understand exactly how they are calculated and set up, but the chief executive added “once we understand them we’ll think about them but, at the moment, I don’t think we need to get into an arms race of CO2 targets”.\nOn the contrary, a CO2 reduction arms race is exactly what we need to get the oil companies into: they represent 10% of the world economy and their product is by far the greatest source of emissions worldwide. If we require them to become carbon neutral our problem will be largely solved.\nNot All Judges are Barking\nI am delighted that Suella Braverman MP has been appointed Attorney-General. She is a first-class lawyer and a fierce opponent of judicial activism.\nThere used to be an understanding that our constitution had a lock that required 3 keys to be operated simultaneously: only when the Crown, the House of Peers and the Commons all agreed on a measure would it become law.\nOver the last century or so the power of two of those keys has diminished dramatically: in effect the Crown has withdrawn entirely from decision-making in the legislative process and the Parliament acts of 1911 and 1949 have reduced the Peers to a revising chamber with limited delaying powers. The Commons is supreme.\nConstitutional theorists fret about this largely unchecked concentration of legislative power in one body. It does have the virtue however, of being elected, so that it is periodically held to account by voters for its stewardship.\nI have always been in receipt of letters demanding constitutional reform, to be fair it’s always been a minority taste amongst my correspondents, but it has been growing steadily albeit from a low base. Their principal demand is for the certainty of a written constitution.\nThis is the very opposite of what we currently enjoy, where there is no superior body of constitutional law that cannot be altered by statute (a new act of Parliament). Parliament can make new law and alter or repeal any previous laws unrestrained. Parliament is supreme and no court can strike out its statutes.\n(Under the Human Rights Act 1998 a court can declare any Act of Parliament as being incompatible with the Human Rights Act, but that will be just a declaration: the offending Act remains in force; the court cannot strike it out. In any event, Parliament itself can repeal the Human Rights Act should it choose to.)\nThe reason we should shrink from a written constitution is that it would establish a superior body of law as supreme, and which Parliament could not alter, and by which it would have to abide.\nThe will of the people, expressed through their elected representatives would be constrained by this new body of law.\nNow here’s the real rub: any decision with respect to whether a law infringed the constitution would be made by judges, who would indeed have gained the power to strike out laws democratically made by elected representatives.\nWe would have replaced the supremacy of an elected Parliament with the supremacy of unelected judges.\nGiven the rage with which so many constituents have written to me over the years to vent their frustration at judicial decisions that fly in the face of common sense (most recently, for example, the decision to halt the deportation of a foreign rapist and a murderer), such a constitutional settlement would be very much for the worse.\n(…but not all the judges are barking: Well done to Mr Justice Knowles for condemning the Orwellian actions by Humberside police who presumed to “check the thinking” of Harry Miller for expressing perfectly legitimate opinions about ‘transgender’ issues)\nTerrorist Prison Terms\nNo sooner had I despatched last week’s column than it was overtaken by events at Streatham.\nI had concentrated on the on provisions to end automatic early release of violent and sex offenders and merely hinted that further similar legislation was expected shortly with respect to terrorists.\nNow the terrorist legislation is of much greater urgency.\nThe provisions for violent and sex offenders were made under an order making power granted to ministers in an earlier Act of Parliament. All the Government had to do was to lay the order before Parliament for the requisite number of sitting days and secure an affirmative resolution in both houses. The order was not amendable and did not need to go through the lengthy procedures associated with a bill.\nThe Change in the law to end automatic release on licence halfway through a sentence for terrorists however, is more complicated and will require the full legislative treatment of a parliamentary bill. This is because we are seeking to achieve something much more ambitious with terrorist offences.\nThe order that changed prison sentences for violent and sex offenders, about which I wrote in this column last week, does not apply retrospectively: it only applies to offenders sentenced from now on. Those offenders already in prison before the order was made will, alas, still be released halfway through their sentences.\nWith terrorists, we want the change to apply retrospectively to those already sentenced and in prison now. The halfway automatic release for dangerous terrorists is approaching and we urgently need to keep them inside for longer and make their release subject to a risk assessment by the Parole Board.\nFor this reason the law requires to be changed by primary legislation: an Act of Parliament and not just an order.\nWill this offend against Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights ?\nA heavier penalty may not be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time that the offence was committed.\nWell, the Government will argue that it doesn’t, because it is not changing the penalty, merely the administration arrangements of the penalty. A 10 year sentence will remain a 10 year sentence even if the amount of time spent inside is longer, and the amount spent on licence is shorter.\nThis is bound to be challenged in court under the Human Rights Act 1998 and I rather suspect that the judges will give the Government another poke in the eye.\nWhat happens then?\nWell, actually nothing necessarily: A ruling that an Act of Parliament is incompatible with the Human Rights Act is merely declaratory: it doesn’t change or set aside the Act of Parliament; Parliament remains supreme…for the moment at least.\nOnly when the case finally gets to the European Convention Court in Strasbourg, as it inevitably would, and were the Government to lose there, it would be required to seek to change the law back again in Parliament (the Ministerial Code requires ministers to comply with international law and treaty obligations).\nI should point that the Strasbourg Court has nothing to do with the EU which we’ve just left. It is the creature of a Treaty largely designed by the UK in 1950 with the objective of preventing Europe from slipping back into tyranny from which we had so recently fought to deliver it.\nWere that Convention however, to become an obstacle in the way of our determination to maintain public safety in the face of the terrorist threat, I do hope we would conclude that it had outlived its usefulness, and make different international treaty arrangements.\nPrison Works\nI was a prison visitor for over a decade, first at The Scrubs, then at HMP Wandsworth\nOn Tuesday last week the Commons approved the Release of Prisoners (Alteration of Relevant Proportion of Sentence) Order 2019, which is a very welcome measure: it ends the present early release regime for violent and sexual offences. Currently those offenders are released on licence once they have served only half their sentence. Furthermore, that halfway release is automatic, it is not dependent on good behaviour or on any other assessment.\nThe order that we passed last week changes this in two very important respects: first, it extends the release point until they have served two thirds of their sentence. Second, that release will no longer be automatic, on the contrary, it will require a full evaluation of risk and readiness by the parole Board.\nThis is a step in the right direction, but I do not believe it goes far enough. I believe we should be honest in our sentencing: the sentence that the judge gives in court should be the one that the prisoner should serve. What happens in court at present is a fiction: the judge might announce that the prisoner will go down for five years, but only the ‘man in the street’ is fooled. Those who understand the system will quickly work out on the back of their fag packet that he’s only going down for 2 years and six months. We should be grateful that now it means he’ll be inside for at least three years and four months, maybe longer. It would be more honest, I suggest, if the judge said at the outset “I’m sending you down for three years and four months, after which you may -dependent upon your behaviour in prison- be either released on licence, or remain in prison for a further year and eight months.\nThere is a whole lot more to do. Further legislation is on the way shortly to extend similarly the prison sentences of terrorists. I’ve always thought it absurd that an enormous amount of our counter-terrorism resources are taken up with monitoring terrorists who have been released from prison. Clearly, if they are still a danger requiring monitoring, then it was madness to have released them.\nWe also need to extend these provisions to less serious crimes, such as burglary. A Police officer recently told me that he had a graph indicating ‘spikes’ in local break-ins, which he could map directly to the release dates of a known repeat offender.\nWhen Michael Howard was Home Secretary he used to say “prison works”, what he meant was that communities are spared significant levels of crime so long as the habitual criminals are ‘inside’.\nIt follows that if we want lower levels of crime, then we need to keep criminals inside for longer. Frankly, we ought to keep them inside until they demonstrate that they are reformed.\nFarewell to the EU\nFinally, after 48 years the 1972 European Communities Act will cease to have effect on Friday night. This was the Act of Parliament upon which our accession to what was then the European Economic Community, better known as the Common Market, was based. It gave primacy to law made by the European Community over any law made in our own Parliament: It was the original ‘surrender Act’.\nIt was, of course, given democratic sanction and legitimacy by a referendum in 1975 in which voters were asked if they wished to remain within the Common Market. I campaigned and voted in that referendum for a ‘no’ vote: a vote to leave. We were heavily defeated: the people voted to remain by a margin of almost two to one.\nThose voters however, were assured throughout the campaign that this was a purely economic arrangement from which we would benefit from freer trade and that there would be ‘no essential loss of national sovereignty’. Nevertheless we were warned by a vigorous No campaign which demonstrated that we had handed over control of our fisheries, abandoned our economic partnership with friends in the Commonwealth like Australia and New Zealand; and we would discover that, in time, the Treaty of Rome, to which we had acceded, really did mean what it said about ‘ever closer union’. We heard both sides of the argument and we made our choice with our eyes open.\nThe pressure for another referendum grew over the decades entirely as a consequence of the way that the European Economic Community developed into the European Union on a trajectory to become a super state with its own constitution, government, parliament, supreme court, currency, flag and national anthem. It became ever clearer that with each successive European Treaty (The Single European Act, Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice, Lisbon) that we were losing control of our laws, our money, and our borders; that increasingly we were being governed by people who we had not elected and whom we were unable to remove.\nTo be fair, European advocates of this endeavour never made any secret of their intent, they were open and honest about what they were seeking to achieve. It was our own UK politicians who kept on insisting that the treaties they were signing-up to really didn’t mean what they said.\nIn my estimate, David Cameron’s greatest legacy (-however he campaigned and voted in the 2016 referendum), is that he committed to having a referendum in his 2015 election manifesto and he implemented the promise when he won it. I was at the very centre of his regime and I well recall the evolution in his thinking: notwithstanding his support for remaining in the EU (though he certainly wanted fundamental reform of it), he recognised that remaining required renewed consent from the British people and he had reached this conclusion well before the electoral pressure from UKIP made it an imperative.\nAll that is history and we are leaving\nWe have good friends in the EU with whom we share many interests and objectives. We will continue to pursue those shared goals and to co-operate closely. We will however, no longer be joining them as they evolve into a United Stares of Europe. We will once again be governed by people whom we elect, and whom we can remove.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 40\n- 41\n- 42\n- 43\n- 44\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",

I disagree. Gordon Brown designed a system where one office the in Treasury taxed working families, whilst another used a highly complex system to pay the money back again to 9 out of 10 of those families. It’s like Charles Dickens’ ‘Circumlocution Office’.\nWouldn’t it be cheaper and more effective not to have taxed them in the first place?\nWe inherited this system in 2010. We’ve cut the 9 out of 10 families eligible to 6 out of 10. The current modest reform is now designed to cut it to 5 in 10. From the furore you would have thought that we were proposing a massacre of the innocents. A woman even broke down on BBC Question Time, but it turns out, on examination, that she will be unaffected.\nWe have to ensure that it always pays to work. This system however, simply doesn’t do that: in its first year of operation it cost £4 billion, this year it will cost £30 billion yet the number of ‘working poor’ has risen by 20%. Instead, what it has done, is to subsidise low wages. Employers have been able to get away with paying less, in the knowledge that taxpayers will make up the difference.\nIt is a horribly complicated system that has clogged my mailbag for years with cases of thousands of pounds being demanded in repayments. The tax credit payable in the current year is calculated on the basis income received in the preceding tax year, with a requirement for recipients to notify the Tax Credit Office immediately of changes in their circumstances that will alter their current entitlement. Of course, they neglect or forget to do this, or don’t even realise that they were supposed to.\nAlternatively, the tax credit office fails to make the necessary alteration to payments when properly notified – not untypical of the Circumlocution Office. Either way, the bill for repayment comes as a disaster for the families concerned.\nIf we are to prosper we have to end our addiction to welfare. The UK has 1% of the world’s population, 4% of its income, but pays out 7% of its welfare. The reforms will help us move from high tax, high welfare, and low wages to an economy based on lower taxes, lower welfare, and higher wages. It’s a clear choice.",

I was his parliamentary private secretary when he was leader of the Opposition, then when David Cameron took over I became his parliamentary private secretary for the next seven years. There is a growing spat over the question of a second referendum arising from a better EU ‘offer’ prompted by a ‘No’ vote in the initial referendum. Personally, I only want one vote in one referendum: Out! I am confident that we can amicably agree the details subsequently without another vote.\nThere are risks that will arise from leaving the EU, including a possible economic shock, but there are risks too from staying. I hope that leaving will prove quite as shocking and as economically liberating as Konrad Adenauer’s withdrawal from the stifling regulatory regime imposed on post war Germany, and the abandonment of which gave rise to the ‘Wirtschaftswunder’ – their economic miracle.\nJust think of the shock of not paying £billions to the EU; the shock of being released from £billions worth of regulatory burdens; I could go on, -and what is truly shocking is that we’ve put up with it for so long.",

Were a majority of voters in Scotland to demonstrate their preference to leave the Union, it would be an affront to democracy and the principle of ‘self-determination’ if they were to be held captive by an overall majority voters in the other parts of the Union.\nOthers have written to state that the future of nations should not be determined by slender majorities and that such profound constitutional changes need to be based on an overwhelming majority, perhaps with as many as two thirds voting for change.\nThe horse has already bolted on that one: first, the last Scottish referendum was settled on the basis of simple majority; Second we had a referendum in 2016 which profoundly changed the constitutional future of the UK on the basis of a simple and slender majority. It would be very difficult to justify moving the goal posts now.\nIt is true that the First Scottish referendum to set up an assembly in Edinburgh, held in 1979, was based on a requirement not only to secure a majority in favour, but also to secure the support of not less than 50% of registered voters (in effect apathy and indifference counting against the proposition). In the event ‘yes’ did secure a majority but with a turn-out of only 64% ‘Yes’ only accounted for 33% of registered voters, so the proposition fell.\nThe political reality is that such ‘gerrymandering’ just doesn’t settle the question. On the contrary, it gives rise to the belief that ‘we was robbed’.\nImagine how ‘Leave’ voters would have felt in 2016 if, having won against the odds, they were denied victory by some questionable threshold.\nThe most significant correspondence that I have received however, has come from Scottish people who now live in the New Forest and who are outraged that the future of their nation should be considered without including them in the franchise, (whilst English voters residing in Scotland will get a vote on it).\nThe 2014 Scottish referendum was held on a local government franchise which included EU nationals and was expanded to include over sixteen-year-olds. I recall the anger of so many elderly Scots who were born in Scotland and spent so much of their lives there, at being excluded from the decision, because they were now living in the New Forest.\nGiven that we allow UK voters who move overseas to continue to vote by post in the constituencies in which they last resided for 15 years after leaving UK -and indeed, there are proposals to allow them to continue to do so for life- the demand for Scottish ‘exiles’ to have a say seems a not unreasonable one.\nAs we do not have any legal concept with which to distinguish Scottish citizens from the rest of us, other than purely on where one currently resides, establishing a Scottish franchise beyond Scotland’s borders will be a significant administrative overhead.\nBut, hey, as the 2014 referendum was to settle the question “for a generation”, we have plenty of time to sort out the franchise for the next one.",

Alas, the court is not accountable to me, and the French must sort out their own affairs.\nIn any event, I am confident that no burkinis have been seen in Barton-on-Sea, or on any other beach in the New Forest parliamentary division.\nAm I disappointed?\nI have always taken the view that people should feel free to show off as little or as much as they like, when it comes to beachwear. Like any hot blooded male however, I appreciate beauty, which can sometimes enhanced by a bikini. Equally, often there can be something quite attractive, alluring, even sensual, about concealment.

I recall the introduction of compulsory seat belts. The requirement was preceded by a public debate, a publicity campaign fronted by Jimmy Saville (remember “clunk, Click, every trip”), and -most important of all- debates and votes in Parliament with the full scrutiny of primary legislation going through its three stages in both houses.\nThere were opponents who felt that this was a step too far, with the state telling us what was good for us and them making us do it. The counter argument being, if it really is good for us, let us choose to do it for ourselves.\nThe opponents of compulsory seat belts accepted their defeat pretty gracefully and those who end up getting fined for not wearing one, are overwhelmingly not acting in defiance, they simply forget.\nThe acceptance rests on consent. Those who lost the Parliamentary battle against compulsory seat belts were given every opportunity to put their case in a democratic process.\nThe same is true of government generally, after a general election those of us who voted for losing parties consent to be governed by our opponents because it was a democratic process in which we participated.\nBeing required to wear a face covering -however, good it might be for us and others, and that is arguable- is nevertheless, a pretty fundamental intrusion into our personal liberty. What makes it so utterly different from seat belts, is that there was no debate in Parliament, the arguments were never heard, we were given no opportunity to put our case: there was no vote\nThe government simply issued the order using powers granted to it back in 1984.\nGoverning by directive is very convenient for ministers and will become a habit if not checked.",

Communication by Royal Mail had almost dried up completely, until this week -that is, when the Boris Burka effect caught up and a batch of letters arrived on the subject; perhaps it just takes longer to get round to writing to your MP, finding a stamp and making it to the post box.\nIt is well covered ground. I wrote about it, in this column almost exactly two years ago (the article can still be found at http://www.desmondswaynemp.com/ds-blog/bhurkinis-barton-sea/\nor simply use the search tool top right and enter ‘Burkinis’\nI also recall Jack Straw, when he was a minister under Tony Blair, sounding-off about how uncomfortable he felt when a woman attended his surgery in a niqab with only a slit for her eyes.\n(I digress, but as for the Islamic demand for ‘modesty’, having travelled extensively in the Middle- East, when a woman can only show off her eyes, it is amazing what she can make of them).\nMy view is unchanged: although, with the exception of a very few lucky individuals, most of us look at our best with all of our clothes on, I believe that people should be allowed to wear as little or as much as they please. So, I’m with Boris, in that I would not join calls to ban the burka, any more than I’d seek to ban naturism. I also agree with him however, in that I do not like them: I believe that they isolate their wearers from healthy social interaction, and that they are a symbol of male power over women.\nBoris clearly gave offence, but holding a disciplinary enquiry in my political party is just absurd.\nWithin the range of terms that might give offence, I thought his use of language at the lower end of the scale.\nThe enjoyment of our right to freedom of speech, does from time to time incur the possibility of giving offence. Some have a lower threshold for taking such offence than others.\nIn the scale of things, I am much more concerned about our proper right to freedom of expression being eroded than I am to people taking offence.",

Some of its agenda is just so daft that it becomes funny, or infuriating, dependent entirely on one’s natural disposition. Other aspects of it strike me as just politeness and gentleness. I shudder to recall some of the terrible things that we called one another at school, which now would be considered beyond the pale.\nI doubt that Donald Trump and Sarah Champion would welcome being linked in any way. For my own part I do not see the link between the news stories about them that my correspondents think they have identified.\nMy email correspondents insist that President Trump was right to condemn the violent behaviour of anti-fascists at the same time as he deplored the violence of neo-Nazi demonstrators in Charlottesville.\nI hold no brief for agitators who hijack every issue from the Grenfell Tower, to trade union disputes, to anti-racism, or whatever. On 9th July, in this column, I pointed out the similarity they bear to the ‘sans culottes’ of the French Revolution. In my estimate the fascism of so many anti-fascists differs little from UK to USA.\nThe fact is however, that a known neo-Nazi committed an act of terrorism by using his car as a weapon to kill a woman. Any attempt to add a ‘but’ in those circumstances creates the impression of some sort of excuse, be it ‘they started it’ or ‘the other side are just as bad’. That, in my opinion was the President’s error of judgement.\nAs for the notion that there were ‘good people’ demonstrating with the neo-Nazis, surely the sacrifice made across Europe and USA in defeating Nazism should warrant that anyone parading with swastikas should attract the universal condemnation.\nThat there is a wider agenda at stake involving the survival of US heritage and monuments commemorating the Civil War is an irrelevance when it comes to condemning a terrorist murder.\nI have sympathy with some critics of the iconoclasts. We have seen campaigns here to judge the past by the standards of the present and to remove statues and change names. Are we to demand that statues of Roman emperors be removed from public view on the grounds that they too supported slavery?\nThe prophet Muhammad condoned the sale of captives into slavery too, crikey! now we really are getting into politically correct hot water.\nAs for Sarah Champion, her analysis was correct and she should have stuck to her guns. It is nonsense to speak of a problem with ‘Asian men’ grooming white underage girls in Rotherham and other northern towns. How many Chinese are involved, how many Indonesians, how many Tamils? Why should all Asian men be so branded when the reality is that the problem is with a tiny proportion of men from Pakistani backgrounds?\nWe need to say so, and recruit their own communities in condemning their behaviour.

Of course, a yard is much easier to cope with than 2 meters but many drinkers will bridle at having to give their name and contact details to order a pint of beer.\nMasking-up and standing in line is not what I consider to be retail therapy.

So, if we are to save our high streets, shopping will have to return to being a superior social experience, otherwise why would we bother making the effort.\nIn any event we are we are still a very long way from restoring normal economic activity.

Suggestions to explain this range from a shortage of precision weapons (after a prolonged campaign in Syria), to lack of training in the complex field of mounting a large-scale operation co-ordinated with ground forces. In this respect operations in Syria have been confined to single aircraft or pairs of them, which is how they are being deployed in Ukraine. They have yet to mount operations to take and maintain control of the skies.\nSimilarly, the use of their superior numbers in tanks and other ‘state-of-the- art’ armoured vehicles has also been unimpressive. They have been snarled-up in huge traffic jams on roads, bogged down in mud when off-road, breaking down and running out of fuel. It is tempting to conclude that they just aren’t particularly good.\nIn the nineteen seventies our intelligence was that we faced the USSR’s highly trained and motivated military machine and that we had no hope of halting their advance -that’s why NATO would not subscribe to the undertaking of ‘no first use’ of nuclear weapons: We believed that our only chance of holding the advance was to use our battlefield nuclear capability.\nWhen the USSR disintegrated internally, the shortcomings of our intelligence was exposed: their military was nothing like as formidable as we had been led to believe.\nPerhaps that is still true of the Russian Bear.",

There seems to me something wanting in the outlook of my correspondents, who appear to take the view that we are incapable of making our own arrangements – to protect our environment, or whatever else – and that we need to rely on the EU to do it for us. This is a poverty of ambition that I do not share. I have every expectation that our regulation can be superior to anything that the EU has come up with (and that we can protect our environment rather better – the record of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy has much to answer for in terms of environmental degradation).\nThe whole point of ‘taking back control’ by leaving the EU is so that we can develop policy more suited to our own needs and that our own standards can be higher.\nThe mark on manufactures ‘CE’ (“Conformité Européene”) means only that a product meets the essential regulatory requirements, it is not a badge of quality as is the ‘British Standard’.

This duty is currently discharged in the commitment we make to spend 0.7% of our income on aid to the poorest countries, leaving us all of 99.7% of our income for ourselves.\nThe second pillar is our own national self-interest: The objective of our aid budget is the same as that of our Defence budget and our Foreign Office budget, namely to project our power and influence internationally, in order to deliver stability and security in which we will prosper.\nI am always keen to argue about how this budget could be spent more effectively to achieve this end, but I do not question that it continues to be in our interest to spend it. Indeed, at this point in our history, when we are leaving the EU and seeking to re-establish our place in the international order, I think it would be folly to reduce the ‘soft power’ that our UK Aid represents and the influence internationally that it affords us.\n‘Sex-gate’ has raced through Hollywood, Parliament, the media, and sport. Now it has reached international humanitarian and development aid. It raises questions about the way we go about doing things but it does not fundamentally undermine the purpose of doing them.\nNevertheless it does underline the importance of taking control of your supply chain if you are to avoid severe reputational damage. If our Department of International Development subcontracts a project to Oxfam to deliver, then it has to be exacting in the standards that it demands.\nThis is by no means straightforward. for example, let’s say we decide to fund a reputable international organisation like The World Bank, to build a hospital in a very poor country like Nepal.\nThe World Bank, then sub-contracts to civil engineering companies and builders to carry out the work. One of the builders orders locally made bricks –which is a good thing because it helps the local economy and creates jobs.\nThen investigative journalists discover that the brick-maker is employing child labour in frightful conditions. The reputational damage will go right back up the chain to the World Bank and our own Government for not investigating carefully enough exactly what they were paying for.\nThe same discipline applies to entirely commercial undertakings: when Rana Plaza collapsed in Bangladesh in 2013, killing over a thousand garment workers, the reputational damage rebounded on our own high street chains for not taking more care over the conditions in which their imported stock was being manufactured.\nWe all have a duty to ask searching questions about what we buy and about charities that we support.\nIf things turn look too good to be true, usually it’s because they just aren’t true",

(How on earth is one supposed to know if you are unwanted, until you’ve called?)\nIf there is an epidemic, it is an epidemic of these little notices. Some are more specific, such as ‘no canvassers’ or ‘no religious callers’. The best one I spotted this year was “no purveyors of religious wisdom of any kind”.

Sometimes they have been spectacularly wrong, not least when they warned George Osborne that his policy would deliver mass unemployment, when on the contrary, we delivered record levels of employment.\nWhen it comes to dealing with a forecast like the IMF, it is always worth reading all of it, rather than relying on a few nuggets that headline writers have extracted to suit their own purposes.\nOn the morning of the forecast’s publication, the newscasts made it sound like the UK was facing oblivion. But what the report actually reveals, together with its accompanying commentary, is that the IMF thinks that the UK is “on the right track’”; that we had done well in the last year, with growth revised upwards to 4.1%, which is one of the highest growth rates in Europe for 2022.\nAs for the depression about the Brexit anniversary, since the European Union referendum, the UK economy has grown at about the same rate as Germany, and our cumulative growth over the 2022 to 2024 period is predicted to be higher than that of both Germany and Japan, at a similar rate to that of the United States of America.\nWe are not immune to the inflationary and supply-side consequences of the war in Ukraine but the Governor of the Bank of England has said that any UK recession this year is likely to be shallower than previously predicted: Comparatively, we are weathering the storm pretty well.\nThe Economic benefits of Brexit were all bound to have their impact in the long run. They are the consequence of regulatory freedom that allows us to suit ourselves and play to our comparative advantages, rather than be bound to the collective interests of the EU.

Now however, when the Government does have the will to proceed and has introduced its Regulatory Freedoms Bill, I find that I’m inundated with an email campaign not to proceed with the Bill.\nYou can’t have it both ways. Complaining on the one hand, that we haven’t seen the economic benefits of Brexit.

Through the Plan for Jobs, Ministers are investing over £33bn in measures to create, support and protect jobs. This includes over £2bn investment in the Kickstart programme and an additional 13,500 Work Coaches in our Jobcentres, as well as other measures focused on boosting work search, skills and apprenticeships.\nDS.",

I was able to reply by saying that I had beaten them to it because last Thursday evening I had spoken at just such an event, and indeed had followed Jamie Oliver (albeit his contribution had been on video).\nThe event, at the Brazilian Embassy, was part of the ‘Road to Rio’ – passing leadership from the London Olympics in 2012 to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016. A critical initiative launched in London, which needs to be refreshed and re-energised at Rio, is about healthy nutrition.\nLast month the world signed-up to the Global Goals at the UN General Assembly, including the commitment to eradicate hunger and under-nutrition by 2030. Notwithstanding the fact that this has halved since 1990, eradicating it remains a very challenging ambition.\nWe have delivered ourselves into an extra-ordinary situation. Whilst the entire planet is being slowly cooked, a significant minority of its population appears to be determined on eating themselves into oblivion – almost as if they were characters in that seventies cult film La Grande Bouffe.\nAt the same time the developing world seeks to emulate our ‘sophistication’ by abandoning breastfeeding and increasingly accessing cheap sugar sources. The obscenity is the most under-nourished babies turn out later to be most prone to obesity, with all the morbidity and mortality that follows.\nThe bright spot is that the focus and finance to deal with this problem has been transformed since 2010. UK has played a major role in this: our aid spending on improving nutrition is $840 million annually. We will need to do more to meet the goal that we have set: In particular, we will need to do more for women and adolescent girls; we will need to do more to collect and analyse data in order to drive improved policy; we will do more to achieve better nutrition from agriculture.\nI was able to announce 2 new research projects in partnership with the Gates Foundation. We will provide $41.5 million to fund research into improved agriculture and food choice in the most under-nourished places.\nWe need more donors, more innovation, and more global thinking. It is vital that we use the Rio Olympics to increase momentum. It would be an abomination if we continue to get ever fatter whilst others go under-nourished.",

Whilst most of us will shrug and simply get along as best we can, I have a suspicion that some people are rather relishing it.\nI am in receipt of emails from constituents keen to report that their neighbours have driven somewhere to walk, or to walk their dog, rather than confining themselves to their immediate vicinity. Others have complained to me that the supermarkets haven’t closed-off the aisles to non-essential goods, enabling customers to purchase not just food, but stationery, clothing… and even liquor.\nGadzooks! What sort of mind-set is that?\nThese correspondents remind me of Mr Hodges, the Air-Raid Warden in Dad’s Army, he had an important and responsible role and a measure of authority to go with it, but wasn’t he just so enjoying it.\nMr Yeatman, the Verger, was another like-minded soul, but with just a little less weight to throw around.\nIt is important to resist the totalitarian mindset, there is always the danger that it will become habit- forming. This is particularly the case nowadays when technology has given the sate such additional powers to scrutinise our every move. We must remember that the basis of our law has not changed: we are not confined to what is specifically permitted, as is the case in so many jurisdictions.

Of course, this doesn’t mean that there aren’t severe problems facing the NHS, there definitely are. Nothing however, is ever as bad as reported.\nFrom my own experience, a close relative required treatment and an emergency ambulance over Christmas and the service could not have been bettered.\nOver the last 20 years I have measured progress in the NHS by the temperature in my postbag (now replaced by my email inbox). It was once at boiling point, but in recent years has come down to room temperature. That measure is corroborated by patient satisfaction ratings, and the fact that independent think tanks and international organisations rate the NHS the best, safest and most affordable healthcare system in the world.\nYet, there are enormous challenges that the NHS has to deal with more effectively.\nFirst, people are far too fat. This obesity epidemic places an enormous chronic burden on the NHS as patients present with any number of conditions that ultimately arise from eating unwisely and doing too little exercise.\nSecond, the success of advances in medicine over the last half-century brings its own challenges: new treatments have added eye-watering expense to the system; and the beneficiaries of those treatments over the last few decades, who previously would not have survived, now present in their eighties with multiple and complex nursing needs.\nDespite these challenges, the NHS treats millions more patients every year and performs millions more operations. This should not surprise anyone because there are thousands more doctors and nurses in the NHS, more than ever before in fact.\n(Statistics often mislead: when figures are published showing that the percentage of patients being treated within the target time has fallen at the margin, they conceal the fact that the absolute number of patients treated within the target continues to rise.)\nThe NHS winter ‘crisis’ however, has become an annual fixture when flu and respiratory conditions, particularly among the elderly are at a peak. Taken together with all the other pressures facing our healthcare system, the organisation is at full stretch and routine treatments have to be delayed in order to manage. This has become part of the annual planning cycle, but given that none of these pressures are going to diminish in future years –on the contrary they are bound to get worse, clearly the organisation needs to change in order to cope more effectively.\nAll this is true of every other healthcare system in the developed world. The difference is that because ours is a ‘nationalised’ healthcare system, we tend to blame government and complain to politicians.\nI don’t believe that money is essentially the heart of our problem. NHS funding is at a record high, and our adversarial political culture will ensure that the parties always competitively bid up the amounts that we are prepared to spend.\nThe real problem arises when the NHS needs and wants to change and modernise the way that it delivers treatments in order to be more effective and efficient. Invariably vested interests are affected and local concerns may be at variance with larger regional needs. The appeal is then to the politicians, with the NHS becoming a political football. Alas, politicians are not best placed to decide what ought to be clinical led decisions.",

One the contrary, and as anyone can see on every coin, the Monarch reigns by the Grace of God (D.G) and is ‘Defender of the Faith’ (F.D).\nThe coronation oath requires the Monarch, as ‘Supreme Governor’ of the Church of England to defend the ‘Protestant Reformed Religion, by law established’.\nOnly in the Last hundred years has Parliament delegated powers to the Church of England to alter its liturgy and doctrine. Even that delegation isn’t absolute: any proposed changes to Church canon law have first to be ratified by Parliament’s Ecclesiastical Committee.\nAn MP is appointed as a Church Commissioner and answers questions every month in the Commons on behalf of the Church.\nRecently tensions have arisen between the Church and Parliament over the issue of Gay Marriage.\nParliament passed the Equal Marriage Act in 2013, but it specifically excluded the Church of England from its provisions. Were same-sex marriages to take place in the Church of England, Parliament would need first to amend the 2013 Act. Recently, some parliamentarians have threatened the Archbishop of Canterbury with exactly that prospect, given their frustration at what they consider to be the slow progress of the Church on this question. After all, it was only last week the Synod considered merely providing prayers for same-sex couples in church. These prayers will ask for God’s blessing on the individuals, not their union. The Church’s doctrine of marriage will remain unaltered, namely that it can only take place between one man and one woman.\nThe problem for the Church is that in its legislating Synod there are two irreconcilable blocks, neither of which has a majority. About 45% are traditionalist and resist change to doctrine and practice, whilst another 45% are liberal progressives that promote the very changes that the traditionalists resist.\nThe Progressives want same-sex marriage, whilst the traditionalists want no change. Blessings for same-sex couples is a compromise or ‘fudge’ that satisfies neither side.\nIt is difficult to see how this can end well. The Bishops will now go away and come back with proposals for the prayers to be used in these blessings, but they will need to be accepted by a two-thirds majority in the Synod. Currently, that majority just does not appear to exist, or anything like it.\nMy personal prejudice is that Christianity has always spent too much time worrying about sex and sexuality, and there are much more important issues to address.\nNevertheless, a way out needs to be found in order to prevent collateral damage to the international Anglican Communion and to the integrity of the relationship between the Established Church and the State.\nThe Church of England is comprised of two provinces: Canterbury and York. That division is purely one of Geography. Perhaps we could instead make the division doctrinal: traditional parishes could opt for, say, Canterbury, and liberal progressive parishes for York. Schism and disestablishment could be avoided.\nIt might just work.",

As well as this, the Environment Bill has now been amended to require a historic, new legally binding target on species abundance for 2030 with the aim of halting the decline of nature in England.\nAs you may know, the UK is moving to a new agricultural system which will reward farmers and land managers for the work that they do to enhance the environment. The environmental land management schemes being introduced will pay for sustainable farming practices, the creation and restoration of habitats, natural flood management, species management, and making landscape-scale environmental changes, among other things. I know that the uplands provide rich opportunities for the provision of environmental public goods and will be well placed to participate in these schemes.\nPeatlands are our biggest terrestrial carbon store and it is welcome that ministers have published an England Peat Plan which provides an ambitious framework to improve the management of these areas. Alongside this, a Trees Action Plan sets out the long-term vision for the planting and management of woodlands and trees. These plans are underpinned by the £640 million Nature for Climate Fund which will support a trebling of tree planting across England by the end of this Parliament and help to restore 35,000ha of peatland by the end of this Parliament.\nFinally, I would like to assure you that raptor persecution is one of six national wildlife crime priorities. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group considers what action should be taken to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against.

Our own -relatively new- Supreme Court has the quite different purpose of being the final court of appeal in determining the intent and purpose of our own common law and statute law as it applies in different situations.\nEach and every act of Parliament has the same status, we have no special constitutional laws that have a higher value. No parliament can bind its successors: Parliament can amend or repeal any law that it made previously. The Courts cannot strike down laws made in Parliament, all they can do is point to any contradiction between our laws and statutory rights. It is up to Parliament choose when and if to remedy any supposed conflict.\nThe law on abortion in the UK makes it clear that there is no general right to abortion services. On the contrary, the default position is that abortion is a criminal matter unless two doctors sign a document about the necessity of the procedure for the sake of the health and safety of the mother to be. Even then, these provisions are circumscribed by the length of the pregnancy, with abortion being permitted in only exceptional circumstances after 24 weeks.\nThese conditions were debated and decided in Parliament with the intention of balancing the needs of an expectant mother with those of a child growing in her womb. They remain controversial. The 24 week limit was last reset in 1990, since when medical science has progressed, so much so, that the life of a child prematurely outside the womb is now viable at fewer than 24 weeks. Accordingly, many will argue that the law should change to reduce the time in which abortion can take place. Equally, clinicians have presented studies indicating that the child in the womb can experience pain much earlier than was previously thought, perhaps this should be a factor in changing the law.\nThese are matters over which people argue passionately and about which there is rarely a consensus. They need to be settled in a democratic and accountable forum, which means in Parliament. We should not contemplate handing such decisions to judges.",

It is unsurprising given that my parliamentary seat has one of the more elderly populations compared with other constituencies.\nMy correspondents protest that they are fit and well, and indeed many of them fitter than their younger neighbours. They are outraged that the lockdown could be lifted for the rest of us but not them.\nI believe they are they are quite right. Aside from being male, and the vulnerability arising from other underlying conditions (co-morbidities as the clinicians describe them), the principal risk-factor in making one susceptible to a particularly dangerous dose of Covid19, is being overweight.\nThe key measurement is ‘body mass index’ (Bmi) which is calculated -in ‘English money’ – by dividing your weight in pounds by your height in inches squared, multiplied by 703 (If that is a bit of a challenge and you’ve forgotten how to use a slide-rule, or not seen your log tables since school, then there are any number of calculators and charts available with a quick internet search).\nIf the result to the calculation is 24 or under, then you aren’t overweight.\nSo, were we to say that anyone with a Bmi over 24 were to continue in lockdown after the rest of us have been released, I imagine that there would an absolute furore. Just think how humiliating and intrusive any kind of enforcement would be: If a copper suspected you of being too fat to be out and about, would he be expected to stop you and demand that you step onto his scales, then stand still as he gets out his measuring tape?\nThe very idea is absurd, utterly disproportionate, and Bmi -as the designated criterion- quite arbitrary.\nIt is, nevertheless, no less arbitrary than a given age as the chosen criterion, be it seventy or any other. Equally, the enforcement of an age threshold would be no less intrusive: people looking too old would be stopped and asked to provide proof that they were younger. The prospect is just horrid.\nI hope that, by very briefly touching on how we might differentiate between at-risk groups -for their own protection of course, when emerging from lock-down, I have also drawn attention to the enormous power that we have already placed in the hands of the state to control every aspect of life.\nMedia reports suggest that the public are untroubled, that my concerns are not widely shared, indeed, that a majority have a preference for stricter conditions and harsher enforcement.\nCertainly, there has been no lack of zeal with which they have sought to report to me breaches of the rules by their neighbours, and I find that deeply worrying.",

I’ve twice used this column to set out my opposition to Covid passports and to the decision to make Covid vaccination compulsory for anyone working in residential care homes.\nI do not want to live in a society where we would routinely have to produce our bona fides in order to secure access to venues and enjoy our full civil rights. I’m confident that were such a system introduced -and we are not there yet, with the parliamentary battle still ahead of us – it would be very difficult to subsequently dismantle it and it could be the fore-runner of a system of identity cards.\nI understand the Government’s preoccupation that, whilst we have had enormous success with the vaccination programme, progress with the youngest age cohorts has been less impressive. From the outset I believed that the vaccination roll-out for younger people should have been incentivised on the basis of ‘carrots and not sticks’.\nFrankly we have made a poor job of trumpeting the effectiveness of the vaccines: We have thoroughly undermined them by maintaining restrictions even after the vulnerable groups had been vaccinated and by insisting on isolation and quarantine conditions notwithstanding fully vaccinated status. This sends completely the wrong message to younger and less vulnerable people. Which is possibly why the Government is now having to raise the prospect of making their lives less convenient and agreeable should they choose not to bother.\nAs for those who write to me about the Government’s malign and hidden agenda to deprive us of liberty. I reject it utterly. Though I disagree with their policy, I know these ministers personally, they are among my friends, they have the best of motives, even if they are mistaken. But I do accept that the threat to our personal freedoms are growing in intensity and we have to decide whether we insist on holding on to them, or we are going to allow the growing power of the state to take them from us whenever it chooses.",

The Government is committed to banning ‘conversion therapies’. This commitment was initially to apply to therapies that purport to convert homosexuals into heterosexuals. The commitment has however, been extended to prevent any therapy that seeks to dissuade a person who wants to change their sex.\nThere are some pretty weird and undesirable practices involving beatings and exorcisms (usually associated with minority cults) which have been used to try and change sexual inclination or dysphoria, but they are already unlawful. Even were a person to give their consent to undergo such ‘therapy’ it would still be unlawful: one cannot consent to actual bodily harm, so the perpetrator still commits an offence.\nSo, I do not believe that the determination to ban conversion therapy is motivated by a desire to spare potential ‘converts’ egregious interventions.\nRather, I believe that the motive is ideological: It is no longer tolerable to believe that there is anything ‘disordered’ about either homosexuality or an intention to change one’s sex. To seek to intervene therefore, and try to ‘cure’ anyone is counted as a shocking form of thought crime.\nNevertheless. Some people do believe that these things are disordered and in a free society they have the right to say so, even if we disagree.\nFurthermore, the difficulty any legislation banning conversion therapy will have, is that it is likely to severely constrain freedom of speech. There may be conversations that young people ought properly to have with their parents, teachers, their friends, clinicians and clergy in order to explore what is really right for them. How can these conversations, or -dread the thought, even prayers – avoid coming within the compass of any kind of conversion therapy. At the very least there will be a severe chilling effect on sensible input from professionals.\nEven before there is legislation, I understand that the Church of England has already taken a lead in abandoning common sense: it has issued guidance to its schools that any child identifying in a different sex, should not be questioned, but simply affirmed in their chosen identity. We can always rely on the CofE -of which I remain a member – to be completely daft.",

Whether we like it or not, that question is now settled.\nWhen Parliament passed the Referendum Act last year by an overwhelming margin, MPs handed over the decision about our future in the EU to the voters. The voters made their decision on 23 June and the Government has announced that it will implement that decision by beginning the process of leaving the EU not later than the end of March next year. Now however, some MPs are demanding a parliamentary vote on this beforehand. This is a demand for the opportunity to vote against initiating the process of leaving the EU. This explicitly runs counter to the Referendum Act 2015, which handed that decision to voters.\nDuring last week’s debate on the negotiating process prior to leaving the EU, MP after MP got up and announced that, notwithstanding having campaigned to remain, they now accepted the will of their constituents, and acquiesced to the decision to leave. Then the mask slipped: one member stated that she would not give up on those who voted to remain, that those who voted to leave were beginning to regret doing so, and that -so proceeding- there would be a majority opinion for remaining. She is, of course entitled to that honest opinion. What was instructive however, was that she was cheered by those who insisted that they had now accepted the will of the people and would implement the decision made by them on 23 June.\nCan they be trusted?\nThe demands made by MPs, that the Government first set out its negotiating strategy and submit it for their approval, needs to be seen in the light of their thinly veiled opposition to the whole enterprise. This demand is essentially an attempt to secure a means to delay, and ultimately to thwart the process.\nOf course, even if the demand were made in good faith, it is manifestly absurd. If the Government sets out its negotiating strategy and objectives, then by doing so, it signals to the other EU members the price that they can extract. We would be sending our ministers bound and naked into the negotiation chamber.\nOf course, Parliament can influence the Government through questions and debates and the two new select committees that are being set up. So long as the Government enjoys majority support in the Commons however, it must be allowed to get on and negotiate unfettered and unhindered, particularly by those still unreconciled to the referendum result.",

In the time available it is rare for more than two bills to have been debated. At the end of the sitting however, those bills listed, but not reached on that day can be given a second reading (the first stage in the legislative process before they proceed to detailed scrutiny by a parliamentary committee) ‘on the nod’ unless an MP shouts “object”.\nWhen I was a member of the Government whips office it was the responsibility of the whip on duty to make that objection to every bill listed, on the basic principle that, whatever the merits of any particular bill, no bill should proceed without having been debated.\nI am not privy to why the whips have discontinued this function, leaving it instead to Sir Christopher.\nSir Christopher turned out have done us all a favour on up-skirting last year: Such was the furore surrounding his cry of ‘object’, that the Government adopted the provisions of the bill as an amendment to one of its own bills. With the result that up-skirting became a criminal sexual offence much sooner that it would have done had it remained a private member’s bill.\nThe lesson here is simple: important measures should form part of the Government’s legislative programme, benefiting from the Government’s whip and its parliamentary time, rather than being left to the vagaries of private members legislation on a very few thinly attended Fridays.\nIt will be interesting to see if the Government now similarly adopts and expedites the provisions of the FGM bill.\nAs to any question of a shortage of parliamentary time: there is no such thing; rather, there is a shortage of the will to make that time available.\nWhen I was first elected, Parliament had a 5 day week: we sat most Fridays, on some there would be government business and on others private members bills.\nNow, in effect, we have a three day week: overwhelmingly Thursdays are given over to worthy but thinly attended back-bench debates, and there are only 13 sitting Fridays per year.\nMany members return to their constituencies on a Wednesday evening.\nOne thing that can certainly be said of Sir Christopher is that he attends assiduously, including Fridays",

It is the principle, after all, that underlies the EU’s customs union: a tariff wall to exclude or disadvantage trade with the outside world whilst promoting free trade amongst its own members. One might even go so far as to say that the EU provoked retaliatory tariffs from Trump, given the way that it penalised US manufactures and agricultural produce through its own tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\nWorse still, for many years the EU subsidised its own agricultural produce through the Common Agricultural Policy, generating large surpluses, that were then dumped on world markets with devastating consequences for the earnings of less developed countries, whose only access to capital was dependent upon revenues from their own agricultural exports.\nThe ’exports=good and imports=bad’ approach to trade policy by ‘nationalist’ politicians’ is an ignorant throw-back to the Mercantilism of former centuries, which treated trade as almost a substitute for warfare, rather than a system of trade to mutual advantage.\nA great economic power is not undermined by its reliance on imports. Even when Great Britain was the ‘workshop of the World’ following the Industrial Revolution, we ran a balance of trade deficit. The Cotton Industry, which was the engine of our economy, was reliant on a wholly imported raw product. This was compensated for, not just manufacturing, but by ‘invisibles’ in the form of shipping and the export of capital -such as financing the US railroad expansion.\nBoth Trump and his Vice-President are exercised over what they consider as the export of manufacturing jobs by US reliance on imports from overseas. But any calculation must recognise that it isn’t just about the jobs.\nObviously, if my climate doesn’t lend itself to growing desirable tropical fruit, I’m not sacrificing any domestic jobs by importing those fruits. However, Ricardo’s law of Comparative Advantage is rather more subtle: suppose I’m a highly skilled engineer and I employ a cleaner. Nevertheless, I reckon that I can clean more effectively and efficiently than my cleaner can. Should I stop exporting that jog to the cleaner and do my own cleaning?\nOf course not, because, in the time that I give up to cleaning, I will have forgone the much higher earnings I could have earned using my engineering skills. The reality is that I don’t want the cleaner’s job even though I am better at it.\nThe same principle applies to an advanced economy: It should deploy its resources of land, labour and capital where it can do best and earn most -rather than incurring the opportunity cost of using some of them up to produce things of less value.\nThe UK doesn’t export a great deal of manufactured goods, but despite being a small Island our earnings from exporting manufactured goods are in the top ten internationally: our strength is at the high-tech end of precision manufacturing. So, the question is, given where our strength lies, should we be investing our very scarce capital and skilled resources into saving our steel making capacity, in a world where there is already a surplus, and where we haven’t made a success of it for decades?\nWhatever the answer, its an important question to ask",

I was challenged about my decision at the Hustings during the election campaign by my Labour opponent, who is a local family doctor. My reason for having voted against the measure is simple: I believe that adults should be able to make up their own minds about whether they should smoke or not, and it is no business of government to interfere with their liberty to do so.\nFrankly, I thought the bill was absurd and would be unenforceable. It would have allowed some adults to purchase cigarettes and tobacco products, whilst denying that possibility to other younger adults: Some adults would have a right to smoke, but others would not.\nHad the measure become law, it would have provided a new bureaucratic overhead for each transaction at the tobacconist or other retailer’s counter.\nRishi’s Bill never made it to the statute book because Parliament was dissolved for the general election. The new Labour Government has made clear its intention to reintroduce the Bill with the same absurd distinction based on the age of adults.\nIn addition, it has trailed the possibility that it will include within the new bill, a provision to ban smoking in public places. In particular, it has pubs and other hospitality venues in its sights. This might have a significant damaging impact on the trade which is already experiencing a worrying number of closures.\nThe argument that smoking outside might impact the health of third parties, particularly when it is often in a designated separate area, is pretty difficult to sustain.\nMinisters, and many of our citizens, especially in the medical professions, strongly disapprove of smoking. The mark of a free society, however, is that -within reason- we tolerate things of which we disapprove. It is difficult not to believe that adults are to be forbidden from smoking in public, because other adults and the new government just don’t like it.\nThe Prime Minister’s stated rationale for making the proposal is based on the need to protect the NHS from having to treat a cause of so much avoidable death.\nGiven our socialised healthcare system, there is a logic for coercive control over the lifestyle choices of individuals which might place too great a burden on the medical provision that has to be shared for everyone.\nJust reflect for a moment however, where this principle is leading. It is the thin end of a very thick wedge. It opens the door to interference with all sorts of lifestyle choices, what we eat, drink, and even what potentially dangerous hobbies we might be allowed enjoy.\nOr, was the real purpose of this announcement to grab the headline, taking the attention away from other government woes?",

From 31 December 2023, it will be against the law to sell, breed or give away an XL Bully. It will also be illegal to have an XL Bully in public without a lead and muzzle, as well as abandon an XL Bully or let it stray. From 1 February 2024, it will be a criminal offence to own an XL Bully dog in England and Wales unless you have a Certificate of Exemption.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has published the official definition of an XL Bully dog with physical characteristics. The full list, as well as other guidance from Defra, can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/official-definition-of-an-xl-bully-dog/official-definition-of-an-xl-bully-dog\nIt may be the case that suspected XL Bully breed type does not need to fit the physical description perfectly. If a dog meets the minimum height measurements and a substantial number of the characteristics in the official definition, it could be considered an XL Bully breed type. This includes if it was not sold as an XL Bully. Defra has recommended taking a precautionary approach. For owners who are not sure if they have an XL Bully dog, they should comply with all new requirements for this dog type. This includes puppies that may grow up to be an XL Bully dog.\nDS",

Drawing a line under a conflict can be like that: There are still scores to be settled and investigations unresolved, but after so many years there has to be an end to it all.\nEqually, we had to stop the outrage of elderly former soldiers being hauled before the courts to answer charges that they overstepped the rules of engagement. When, at the same time, the immunity of so many terrorists has been provided by indemnities in the form of ‘letters of comfort’ furnished to secure the peace agreement in the first place.\nLabour opposed the Act and made it clear that it would be repealed after the election. But there was one part of the ACT that enjoyed unanimous support in both the Lords and the Commons: the part the which prevented compensation for Adams and others like him -sections 46 & 47.\nIt is complicated:\nIn the 1970ies, Adams, with so many others, was interned (imprisoned without trial on the orders of the government, not the courts). In 2020 Adams successfully appealed against convictions for escaping from his internment, because his internment was unlawful – having been ordered by a minister rather than the Secretary of State.\nSection 46 and 47 restore the longstanding principle that powers conferred on the Secretary of State can properly be exercised by subordinate ministers, effectively reversing the Supreme Court ruling by statute.\nIn February last year Adams appealed again and the Northern Ireland High Court ruled that section 46 and 47 were incompatible with European Convention on Human Rights and issued a Declaration of Incompatibility with the Act.\nBut Parliament remains supreme. Such a declaration does not change the law or require Parliament to change it. Parliament can just decide to leave things as they are.\nSunak’s government chose, in the first instance, to appeal. There is now a body of expert legal opinion of the view that the government appeal would have been upheld and that the original Supreme Court ruling was flawed.\nNevertheless, in July the new Government withdrew the appeal and last month used its power under the Human Rights Act 1998 to issue a remedial order for Parliament to repeal sections 46 & 47 of the Legacy Act.\nIt is this unforced and chosen course of action, this remedial order, that now reopens the frightful possibility of thousands of pounds of taxpayer’s money being paid in compensation to hundreds of murderous terrorists. The Prime Minister says he will find a way to prevent such payments. He’d better, because he has opened up the possibility, which the last Government had shut down.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_praying-peace-jerusalem-continued/content_305.html": "A word of caution when praying for the peace of Jerusalem.\nFurther to my remarks in this column last week, I thought I’d risk giving even greater offence. All religions are a bit ‘wacky’ and stretch the credulity of their adherents. That is certainly my own experience as a Christian. Perhaps Mormonism has got to be the wackiest of all beliefs. I can say that because Mormons are gentle people who do not easily take offence, unlike other religions where ‘blasphemy’ is perceived almost everywhere, and is punishable by death, with – or without – the necessity of any proper judicial process.\nYesterday’s ghastly assassination of Israeli soldiers in Jerusalem by Daesh marks a further unwelcome and worrying ‘religious’ aspect to the conflict in Palestine. The West Bank of the Jordan has hitherto remained a predominantly secular place where women can go about their business freely, unaccompanied and uncovered. Much less so in Gaza where the Hamas and other sinister Islamist thugs hold sway.\nThe growing religious sensitivities on the other side of the conflict are all too apparent as a muscular Israeli settler movement increasingly treats Palestine as its biblical theme park. The Israeli interior minister (equivalent to Amber Rudd as Home Secretary) has stated that with the election of Donald Trump we are witnessing “the birth pangs of the Messiah when everything has been flipped to the good of the Jewish people”.\nAlas, if you really believe that God promised you the land, there isn’t much scope for negotiation.\nWhat I always find odd however, is the support for this position to be found amongst evangelical Christians. Later this month Parliament will be visited by ‘Christian Friends of Israel’ and I will be lobbied by a number of constituents, some of whom are convinced that the ancient borders of Israel have to be fully re-established according to God’s promise to the patriarchs, before Christ’s second coming and the messianic age can begin.\nThis wacky eschatology is, at least, not mainstream Christianity: Christ’s first coming was God’s final and complete revelation to mankind. All the promises of the Old Testament and the New are already fulfilled in him. There is nothing left outstanding and still to be delivered; Through Christ all humanity become the ‘children of Israel’, including the Palestinians.\nSo, when I ask for people to pray for the peace of Jerusalem, I ask them to do so, at least in one respect, with the intention of keeping God out of it.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_more-assistance-will-be-demanded/content_63.html": "We’ve now had sight of the Assisted Dying Bill that we will debate on 29th November. The lobbying has been under way for some time. Already I’ve had literally hundreds of letters and emails.\nNow the meetings have started too, with invitations to discussions led by any number of eminent people. On Tuesday I went to one addressed by Liz Carr, the actress who is one of the stars in the BBC drama Silent Witness. She’s made a documentary entitled Better off Dead. It is well worth watching, whatever angle you come at the subject from. You’ll find it on BBC i-Player.\nThe principal strength of the Bill is that it avoids, to some extent at least, the profound impact on the medical profession that authorising practitioners to kill their patients would have. The key point here is that patients will have to do the deed themselves, having first secured a terminal prognosis of death within six months, confirmed by two doctors and signed off by a judge. Only then can the prescription be had, which -I reiterate- must be administered by the patient.\nThe difficulty with this is that it is also the Bill’s weakest point too. Most of the reservations of those who oppose the bill are that it is the start of a slippery slope. That once the principle of assisted death is breached, then the permitted circumstances will be swiftly extended, as they have in so many other jurisdictions. This was certainly my own reservation when I blogged previously Medically Assisted Death .\nThe problem is that the Bill’s method fails to address the aspirations of those who have been campaigning hardest for the service. Patients with progressive wasting conditions want to continue life as long as its quality is bearable. When it becomes unbearable, they want to die. The terrible dilemma they face is that, whilst they do not want to die early and before they are really ready, their condition may, at any time, rob them of the ability to take the potion themselves, making them them reliant on what remains the unlawful agency of someone else. They will have to die by their own hand early or run the risk of being unable to do the deed at all, so either facing exactly the sort of death that they feared or having to secure unlawful assistance.\nThis Bill will not help them. So, the self-administration requirement will be the focus of the first campaign to extend the Bill’s provisions and allow the doctor to administer the drugs.\nNext, campaigners will question the cruelty of the requirement for a six-month terminal prognosis. If you are suffering unbearably and expected to live for a year, why should you have to endure another six months of agony before you qualify. Indeed, if you are in agony, or extreme misery, and are desperate for the relief of death, why should you need a terminal prognosis at all?\nIf the Netherlands can be so humane as to accommodate the death wishes of those who experience a much wider are extremity of circumstances, why shouldn’t we?\nThe cast iron guarantees of the Bill -death in six months; two doctors, a judge, and self-administration, are merely an aiming target for further reform. It is indeed a slippery slope.",

  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_parliament-unseen/content_666.html": "Most people’s impression of Parliament is conditioned by the angry exchanges at Prime Minister’s Questions.\nWhat is never seen is the fist official business of every parliamentary day in the Commons: Prayers led by the Speaker’s Chaplain, and very often to a pretty a full House.\nHere I reproduce the Official Report of the proceedings as a community thanks, and takes leave of its pastor:\nTributes to the Speaker’s Chaplain\n31 October 2019\nVolume 667\nMr Speaker\nwe now come to the very happy business of the motion on tributes to the Speaker’s Chaplain. I have the great pleasure of calling the Leader of the House to move the motion.\n2.42 pm\nThe Leader of the House of Commons (Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg)\nI beg to move,\nThat this House congratulates the Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin on her twenty-eight years of ordained ministry in the Church of England, nine years of which have been in the service of Mr Speaker and this House as Chaplain to the Speaker, the first woman and the first BAME holder of that post; expresses its appreciation for the generous, ecumenical and compassionate spirit of her work among hon. Members and staff of the House; and wishes her every success in her forthcoming ministry as Bishop of Dover and Bishop in Canterbury.\nYou are absolutely right, Mr Speaker, to say we are moving on to a really happy discussion. It is a great honour to move the motion and give the House the opportunity to pay tribute to the Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the 79th Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons. I would like to thank her on behalf of the whole House for her service.\n“Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.”\nThese are the beautiful uplifting words that the reverend prebendary reads to us in her strong, resonant, resounding voice every morning when we meet in private to send up our petitions to God. It is when your chaplain, Mr Speaker, creates an atmosphere of prayerfulness that allows right hon. and hon. Members to set their souls at ease with God as they prepare for the business ahead of them. She does so in a way that would move the heart of the most stony-hearted atheist to feel there is a true and a divine presence. To achieve this through the power of speech and the use of language is a great achievement, and one that has daily been the triumph of your chaplain, to the benefit of Members of Parliament.\nIt is not only liturgically that your chaplain, who is now retiring to go on to greater things, has been a major asset to this place, Mr Speaker; it is also in her pastoral work, for the chaplain has been a help to many Members, in counselling, guiding and supporting them through difficulties in their lives and giving them succour as a true shepherd to her flock. She has worked closely in a spirit of ecumenism with Father Pat Browne and has not been in any sense narrowly sectarian. Anybody who has had dealings with your chaplain or who has met her has found it a help and benefit. What more can possibly be asked from someone in clerical orders?\nIt has been 359 years since the first Speaker’s Chaplain, Edward Voyce, was appointed in 1660, and while it is of great significance that the reverend prebendary is the first in the intervening three and a half centuries to be a woman and the first to be from an ethnic minority, I look forward to the day when we no longer have to remark on the race or sex of the Speaker’s Chaplain. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but Lord looks at the heart. She is a person of God—the highest calling of all. Dare I say it, but the calling to God is a higher calling than the calling to political life, and all that matters is that calling?\nFor the chaplain, it has always been very simple. God’s calling has made her who she is, and she has followed her calling with the calm confidence we all admire so much. Her key responsibilities, in addition to pastoral care and daily prayers, have included running a weekly eucharistic service in the chapel and performing weddings, marriage blessings and baptisms for Members and their children. She has also led many services to celebrate the lives of those who have died during their service to Parliament. I think many of us would particularly like to thank her for her part in the commemorative ceremonies and her support following the loss of a dear colleagues, Jo Cox and PC Keith Palmer. We will never forget the bravery and passion of all those who have worked in this place, and we will never forget the chaplain’s dutiful care to her flock.\nThe chaplain has always shown her devotion to those who need her, whether in Montego Bay or on these shores, and I know so many people in the parliamentary estate feel that her remarkably self-possessed view of life has sustained them through difficult times. We will never forget the chaplain’s trust in God’s grace, which has, I think, helped give her the courage of her convictions to speak out during her ministry. We should all seek to live by her words on the importance of improving the culture in Westminster and making this a place where everyone is treated as they should be.\nIt only seems suitable to end with words from the 1662 Prayer Book—that great book of liturgical beauty, that ornament of the Church of England and, speaking as a Catholic, that bit of the Anglican Church of which I am possibly the most jealous; some of our translations are nothing like so beautiful. Leaving that to one side, it seems suitable to end with words from the Prayer Book:\n“Almighty and everlasting God, who alone workest great marvels: Send down upon our Bishops and Curates, and all Congregations committed to their charge, the healthful Spirit of thy grace; and, that they may truly please thee, pour upon them the continual dew of thy blessing.”\nI hope, Mr Speaker, that as your chaplain moves to Dover, the continual dew God’s blessing will rain down upon her.\nValerie Vaz (Walsall South) (Lab)\nI thank the Leader of the House for a really wonderful tribute to Reverend Rose. Before I pay tribute to Reverend Rose, I want to refer to your statement yesterday, Mr Speaker, on the new Speaker’s Chaplain. We welcome Reverend Canon Patricia Hillas, who will be with us shortly. I am sure she will do the same wonderful job as Reverend Rose has done. I was sorry to miss mass yesterday, when Reverend Rose and Father Pat were together. They have made a formidable team in our darkest hours.\nWe wish Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin—I am sorry she is not here in the Chamber, in her usual place—a heartfelt farewell. Reverend Rose arrived in the United Kingdom to join the Church Army as an 18-year-old young woman, displaying the Windrush generation’s adaptability. It did not take long for Reverend Rose to flourish, and in 1994 she was ordained to the priesthood, at the point where women had only recently been allowed to be priests. She continued to splinter the glass ceiling spectacularly given the context of the male-dominated area she was called to—not only for women, but crucially, and seemingly effortlessly, for women of colour.\nIt is no surprise to those of us who know her that, while holding the prestigious position of 79th Chaplain to the Speaker of the House of Commons—as you heard, Mr Speaker, in tributes to you, a well-deserved appointment—and being one of the three chaplains to Her Majesty the Queen, she is much loved by her congregation at Holy Trinity church, Dalston, and at All Saints church, Haggerston, where she has worked for over 16 and a half years.\nIf you ask Reverend Rose, I am sure she will say that her pastoral missions both here and in Hackney share a common thread, and that is to make sure that everyone is well spiritually and everyone feels good enough to do their jobs well. The Leader of the House was right: when she says prayers, which she does every day, I often feel as though I have never heard those prayers before. She has an amazing way of making you feel that that is the first time you have ever heard those important words. Reverend Rose will tell you that prayer is at the heart of what she does.\nReverend Rose has always been a visible presence and is often seen around Parliament, as she says, “loitering with intent”, comfortable in her own skin and “in her hair”. I know that she has sought out hon. Members when they have faced difficulties. We have not had to go to her; she comes to us, and she makes sure that she counsels us in the appropriate way.\nBut what Rose has always been keen to emphasise is that in all she does she feels connected with—rooted to—her past in Jamaica, her grandparents and their grandparents, with sacrifices, ideas and hope passed through stories flowing from one generation to the next. She says that such a foundation will be an integral part of success for the next generation of young black people growing up in the UK, on the basis that “they survived, so we must thrive.” Yes, she has a way with words.\nTrue happiness, Reverend Rose maintains, flows from where you come from, where you are rooted and the depth of spirit that tells you who you are. She poses questions: why should women be seen and not heard? Why not live in this world and not in the past? Why should not women be in leadership? Why should people of colour not be seen in all walks of life? But a good leader, she says, acts with integrity and loves the people whom they serve.\nWe certainly have felt the warmth of the Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin’s spiritual leadership while she has been in Parliament, and at a very exacting period of our history. In an interview with The Observer, she revealed that her secret prayer was that she would like to see a more civil attitude among MPs. She warned that the world was looking in, and she would like to see a change in the way we MPs handled listening and speaking to one another. I think that it is a work in progress. Perhaps, when she is looking back on us from Dover, she will see that we have achieved her aims.\nI have seen Reverend Rose sitting through many debates, particularly the European debates. Rose, we shall miss having you with us, guiding us gently but—in the words of Labi Siffre—with “something inside so strong” so that we learn to deal with our individual experiences through the way in which we respond to them, and, in the case of us women, teaching us to respond to high barriers by becoming taller.\nWe wish you, Ken, your two daughters and son all the very best in your new role. We know that you will continue, as Bishop of Dover, with your own mantra: to achieve, to excel, to overcome obstacles—that no limitations will rule your efforts. As we have already witnessed, we know you will go on to greater things and are proud to have crossed paths with you. A true pilgrim’s progress, from Jamaica to Canterbury. As Aretha Franklin would say—respect! Reverend Rose, we thank you. You were there for us when we needed you most.\nThis content has already been edited and is awaiting review.\nMr Speaker\nI must thank the shadow Leader of the House, and I think I speak for the House in doing so, for the sheer warmth and magnificence of that tribute. I think that there is an electricity in the Chamber as a result of what the right hon. Lady has said and the unadulterated passion with which she has delivered it, and I want to thank her.\nSir Peter Bottomley (Worthing West) (Con)\nAs parliamentary warden of St Margaret’s church, Parliament Square, may I join in supporting the motion of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House? The only thing that surprised me about his speech is that he did not mention—although the motion does—that Rose Hudson-Wilkin will be the Bishop in Canterbury, where my right hon. Friend married his wife, with a number of people presiding, and he managed to incorporate in this presently Anglican cathedral a Roman Catholic mass. I think that it is almost coming home time for him.\nMay I say how much I welcomed the words of the right hon. Member for Walsall South (Valerie Vaz)? Watching Rose Hudson-Wilkin work with John Hall as Dean of Westminster, with Andrew Tremlett and with Jane Sinclair, who have been the rectors at St Margaret’s, and in her sharing of the monthly parliamentary communion and the breakfast in your house, Mr Speaker, we have seen closely in private what she is also well known for in public. I add that it was a delight to meet her grandchildren at the reception in your house, Mr Speaker; they are a tribute to the modern generation in this country, and if some of them were to come here not perhaps as Speaker’s chaplain but as Members of Parliament it would be a delight, especially if I could remain here to welcome and join them.\nI want to end with some words that will be familiar to Rose Hudson-Wilkin:\n“Our vision is for everyone, everywhere to encounter God’s love and be empowered to transform their communities through faith shared in words and action.”\nShe says she comes from Montego Bay; I say she comes from the Church Army, and those words are the Church Army dedication. I thank her for her dedication to us.\nMr Speaker\nBless you; I am deeply obliged to the hon. Gentleman for what he has said.\nPatrick Grady (Glasgow North) (SNP)\nMr Speaker, I hope you will not mind if I start by briefly expressing my thanks to you for your service in the Chair and wishing you all the very best for the future. You have been a source of encouragement and sound advice to many of us in the Scottish National party, and I have been particularly grateful for your support in my role as Chief Whip. Of course, for Scottish National party Members, staying at Westminster is not a long-term ambition, but the role that you have played and the reforms that you have introduced have certainly made our time here more tolerable.\nAs others have said, Mr Speaker, one of your most significant legacies and early decisions is the appointment of Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin as your chaplain. I remember as a younger, keener but casual observer of business in this place reading some of the coverage and criticisms of that appointment at that time, but, as you have previously said, Mr Speaker, those critics were wrong in every single respect.\nFrom the start, SNP Members here have found that Rose brings a presence of welcome, comfort and reassurance. There are some who would question the value or relevance of starting the parliamentary day with Prayers, but of course participation is voluntary and, as the Leader of the House alluded to, I do not think that anyone, believer or non-believer, who has had the privilege of experiencing the prayers led by the Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin could doubt their value. No matter how tense the day may be, no matter how important or portentous the business to come, her tone and eloquence at the start of each day have a levelling effect and remind us all that ultimately we are all equal—for believers, we are equal in the sight of God.\nPrayers, especially in recent times, have provided some memorable moments, even if they have not always been visible to the public. The Rose’s choice of texts often matches with uncanny ability the occasion of the day and hits the right note. At the start of our proceedings on the historic Saturday sitting a couple of weeks ago, she began with St Paul:\n“Do not be anxious”.\nThat was the moment that broke the ice, and chuckling could be heard across the Chamber.\nBy leading those prayers, Rose has ministered to the House collectively. Her presence in the Under Gallery, literally praying for us as we have taken part in some of the biggest and most historic votes of recent years, has not gone unnoticed. She has also ministered to many Members individually as a chaplain, especially at times when tragedy has struck Parliament and the House. She has also built strong ecumenical relations, forging, in particular, a firm bond with Canon Pat Browne He may officially be titled the Roman Catholic duty priest to the Houses of Parliament, but to the Catholic community in Westminster—and, I believe, to many others—he too is undoubtedly a chaplain, and early-day motion 71 congratulates him on his 10 years of service. He invited Rose to address us at mass in the crypt yesterday—it is, after all, the chapel of her chaplaincy—and her reflection was once again on that admonition to not be anxious but to trust in God. We hope that that is what she will do as she takes on the role of Bishop of Dover. Once again she is breaking down barriers and conventions, as she has done here in Westminster, and as you have done, Mr Speaker, in appointing her.\nWe will warmly welcome, in due course, Canon Tricia Hillas. She brings considerable experience of promoting diversity, inclusion and ecumenism, all of which means that we can have every confidence in her as a worthy successor to Rose.\nRose said to us last night that, although she was leaving this place, she would carry us in her heart and in her prayers. She can be assured that we will do the same for her, in ours. This morning, at Prayers, she invoked the priestly blessing from the Book of Numbers:\n” The Lord bless you and keep you; The Lord make His face shine upon you”.\nPerhaps, in return, we can invoke the old Irish blessing:\n“May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face; the rains fall soft upon your fields and until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hand.”\nMr Speaker\nI thank the hon. Gentleman for what he has said. I hope that observers of our proceedings understand the enormous affection and esteem in which we all hold Rose. I just want to mention that a constituent of mine, and a former constituent, are in the Public Gallery: Julie Kincade, my constituent, and former councillor Sue Polhill, who was one of my constituents until relatively recently. In this session, I hope that they are seeing the House at its best.\nI want also to mention, because I think it is apposite and there is a piquancy about it, that the Church of England’s diversity adviser, Elizabeth Henry, who has helped to deliver real beneficial and progressive change, is with us as well. Elizabeth, you have been the most enormous asset to the Church, but I want to thank you publicly. You have been a great support in relation to Rose—you were an early champion of hers, knowing her quality—and you greatly assisted my colleagues and me only the other day in the recruitment of her successor. I salute the work that you do, the passion that you share, the experience that you bring, and the counsel that you offer. They are very precious.\nSir Roger Gale (North Thanet) (Con)\nI have always thought that the job of the Speaker’s Chaplain is rather like the job of the person known as “the bish” on one of Her Majesty’s warships. That person prowls around the lower decks, surrounded by heathens and heretics, waiting for somebody to call upon him. I guess that this place, particularly in the last few months, has been just a little bit like that. But the wonderful thing about Rose is that she has always been there to be called on when she is needed, and through some very stressful times for everyone on both sides of the House she has been a tower of strength.\nYou guys and girls have come to say goodbye to Rose. I have come to say hello. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley) said, the Bishop of Dover is the Bishop in Canterbury. Let me also say, just as an aside, that earlier today, during questions to the Church Commissioner, it was asked, “How does the Archbishop of Canterbury manage when he has so much to do, not only at home but overseas?” The answer is, of course, that he is not the Bishop in Canterbury. That will be Rose, and I know that she will be a tower of strength to Archbishop Justin, as she has been to this place.\nBut Rose is coming to east Kent, and I have warned the lady who is going to become Bishop Rose that one of her first duties will be to visit the wonderful constituency of North Thanet, and to spend a couple of hours on Margate’s seafront—in January, when the rain and the wind and the snow will almost certainly be horizontal. That is when we in Margate celebrate the Blessing of the Seas. That is the occasion, on the feast of the Epiphany, when we throw a small Greek Cypriot boy into the freezing waters of the North sea and—so far without success—try to drown him. The Bishop of Dover—the Bishop in Canterbury—plays a key role in that event. Rose, we are looking forward enormously to welcoming you to east Kent.\nMr Speaker\nThat speech was typical of the hon. Gentleman. Thank you.\nGavin Robinson (Belfast East) (DUP)\nI am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this tribute, but I regret that I was not in my place to take part in the tributes to you, Mr Speaker. I should say that I was not here for your tributes because I was adhering to your rule that we cannot just beetle into the Chamber after the start of a debate, although I realise that you might not have been adhering to that rule quite so strictly today as on other occasions. Had I been here from the start, or had I had the opportunity to participate, I would have said that one of the things you have done, with which I would like to associate myself in every way, is to give steadfast support to Rose. Not only before I joined this House but subsequently, on a number of occasions, I have heard you stand steadfastly and resolutely against racism associated with her as an individual, and against gender bias and gender discrimination. What you have exuded with your appointment of Rose as Speaker’s Chaplain is what I hope we as a House embody. I have never heard a Member of this House—maybe they did previously— criticise Rose. I think she is wonderful. She exudes a faith that I do not talk about often but that I hold personally and privately.\nThe shadow Leader of the House, who is also a wonderful lady, said that she was sorry that Rose was not here. I think that that embodies Rose’s character. She was here during your tributes as a steadfast support for you, Mr Speaker, but she is much too humble to be here for this. She exudes the Christian strength that we should all embody. I have been here four years. On occasions I have gone to Rose, tapped her on the shoulder and shared with her the difficulties that some of my colleagues have been facing. I know, without asking, that she then went to see them. She provided the strength, the assurance and the love that she exudes on our God’s behalf.\nThe Leader of the House mentioned the comfort that we get from liturgy. There is huge comfort from liturgy, but depending on who gives it, it can often appear repetitive. That has never been the case during Prayers in this House. I remember the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Alex Chalk), who is not in his place, talking about her beautiful intonation. The poetry she injected into scripture brought it alive for us. As somebody from Ulster Protestantism who knows how important Sunday morning is, I did not think I would skip into those Anglican ways of believing that coming into this Chamber for Prayers was important. Not only is it important, but it has provided huge comfort for me. Not every day, but on the days when we are facing difficulties collectively and on days whenever, nationally, we know that politics is in a bad place, just coming here for those three or four minutes and hearing the Word expounded in such a beautiful way is a huge source of strength.\nI have never spoken publicly before, and I probably will not do so again, about the difficulties that my wife faced when my son was born. Those difficulties meant that public baptism at the front of church was not an option. So, two years after he was born, Rose baptised him here, very privately and very personally. As a two-year-old, when the light of life was passed, he blew it out. When solemn prayers were being shared, he was trying to run around. Rose just put her arm around him and held on there during all those precious moments. She has been precious to me and to my wife, and I know she has been precious to many in this House. For my part, Mr Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to speak so early and for giving me the opportunity to participate in this debate and to thank Rose from the bottom of our hearts.\nSir David Lidington (Aylesbury) (Con)\nI am delighted to be able to associate myself with and wholeheartedly support the motion moved by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. I want to say two things about my memories of Rose. First, from those few minutes at the beginning of our parliamentary days when the Speaker’s Chaplain reads a psalm and leads us in a brief session of prayer, I will always remember the sheer musicality of Rose Hudson-Wilkin’s voice, which gave extra resonance and meaning to the texts in which she was leading us. I remember, too, her willingness to vary the normal order of prayers when the occasion made that right. There have been times—I remember this from when I was Leader of the House in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack on Westminster bridge and the Palace of Westminster—when the sense of shock in this Chamber at the beginning of the day has been palpable. Somehow on those occasions, Rose knew which psalm, which passage, which prayer to introduce in place of one of our usual prayers to reflect that mood in the House and to respond to the particular occasion.\nMy second point is about her pastoral care. The hon. Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson) has spoken of his and his family’s experiences. Again from when I was Leader of the House, in the months and, indeed, years that followed the dreadful murder of our colleague Jo Cox, one of the things that is etched in my memory is how Members on all sides—particularly, though not exclusively, women Members—began to open up about the abuse and threats that they had been suffering for quite some time. Whether it was about those things or whether it was dealing with a Member at a time of personal or family crisis or tragedy, Rose was always there: quiet, listening, offering comfort, and offering solidarity when it was most needed.\nIn years when the reputation of this House and of its Members collectively has been under fierce and sometimes vicious attack, Rose was also willing to speak up in public to affirm the value of the political vocation and to assert that, from her experience, she knew that most Members here, regardless of which political tradition they represented, had come into politics with a noble motive of trying to make things better for the people they serve.\nRose is now going on to greater things within the Church, and I am sure that the people of Margate and the rest of north Kent will soon discover that they have a shepherd in Rose Hudson-Wilkin of great talent and unparalleled pastoral commitment. Those of us in this House now, whether we are hoping to stay or intending to leave, will always remember Rose with affection, with pride and with a sense of love, because love was what she brought to this place and what she always sought to embody.\nStephen Pound (Ealing North) (Lab)\nI appreciate that you, Mr Speaker, are occasionally someone who believes in constructive iconoclasm. This is the sort of occasion when I say to myself, “Would it not be wonderful if, just for once, we could not sit as Robespierre demanded we sit in the revolutionary council, on the left and the right, but we all sat together, on one side or the other?” I say that because today we are not divided. We are not divided by politics, theology or religion; we are divided in no way. We are united by an extraordinary admiration for a truly remarkable woman. We have heard some extraordinary contributions. Everyone who has spoken related to Rose Hudson-Wilkin in their own particular and personal way. That is so typical of the henotic qualities of the woman: that she appealed to every one of us, from our different traditions, in so many different ways.\nSome of the tributes that have been paid today have been emotional. Some of them have been stirring. Some of them have been hard to listen to. But in many ways, that was Rose’s ministry here in this place; sometimes she went when the words were difficult to say. When my mother died, Rose was an extraordinary source of comfort to me, and I think every one of us has had a similar story to tell. The hon. Member for Glasgow North (Patrick Grady) was slightly censoring his comments when he gave that famous Irish blessing about the wind always being at your back and the road always rising up to meet you. I mention my late mother, God rest her soul, and I seem to remember that the last two lines of that blessing are:\n“And may you be in heaven\nhalf an hour before the devil knows you’re dead.”\nI cannot imagine why my late mother, Dominica, felt it appropriate for me to learn that couplet, but she certainly did and, in the manner of education back in those days, she made me repeat it on a regular basis.\nSlightly oddly, we have heard Rose described as the “Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin. As she ascends to the Episcopal purple, some of us refer to her as the “about to be bishop”. But whatever we call her, a Rose is just as sweet by any name, and what we have here is our Rose, be she bishop, prebendary, or canon. Be she whatever, she is our Rose Hudson-Wilkin and she is remarkable for that.\nThe horror of the murder of Keith Palmer was mentioned earlier. Many of us were in the House on that occasion, and many of us remember that Rose and Canon Pat Browne organised three different services on that very day, so that everyone could have the opportunity to make their peace with God and to find comfort and succour on that day. It was a truly remarkable occasion, and she rose to that occasion. I think you rose to that occasion too, Mr Speaker, as did the House. It is a tragedy that it took that appalling, cold-blooded murder of such a good man for us to come together, as we did in the memory of Jo Cox. We have had some terrible times in Parliament in the past decade, but we have also had some great, great times, and the terrible times have been mitigated by the love, warmth, illumination and prayer of Rose Hudson-Wilkin.\nLast night, as my friend, the hon. Member for Glasgow North said, Rose concelebrated the holy mass in the Chapel underneath. The reading was from Romans, which has wonderful lines saying, “Don’t worry too much about praying because if you can’t find the words, God will give you the words. God will always find the words for your prayer. You don’t need to worry about getting the words right. You don’t even need to worry about getting them in the right order. You don’t even need to worry about your vocabulary or your enunciation. God will give you the words.” Rose Hudson-Wilkin always had the words; she always knew what to say, be it a short contribution or a long one.\nIt has been mentioned that Rose is not in her usual place in the Under-Gallery, where I have seen her sit many a time, shaking her head, almost imperceptibly, but sending us the message that says, “Oh dear, oh dear, what are you doing now?” and praying for us. I believe she is without at the present time, but close, and I like to think she will always be close to this place.\nThe former Bishop of London the Right Reverend and right hon. Richard Chartres and I were at school together. We have an arrangement whereby he does not say anything about what got up to and I reciprocate. We took different theological paths, but when it came time to appoint the next Bishop of London, I felt it appropriate to write to him to say, “I make no suggestion as to who the next bishop should be, but she should be a woman of colour, she should be a woman, her initials should be R. H. W. and if possible, she should come from Montego Bay. If you can find anyone who fits those criteria, I am sure she would make an excellent Bishop of London.” An excellent choice was made, and I am glad to say that Rose has found her bishopric down on the south coast—although I have to say that when the right hon. Member for North Thanet (Sir Roger Gale) talked about hurling young boys into the foaming brine for some extraordinary marine sacrifice, I thought that perhaps a bit of exorcism might be appropriate in such places. Had Rose been appointed the Bishop of London, she would have broken not only another ceiling but a stained-glass ceiling. That is what Rose has done. She would have achieved so much by doing that.\nI find Rose’s kindness, generosity, warmth and love remarkable—they are characteristics from which I draw strength—but let us not forget her intellect. She has a formidable intellect: she is a great Bible scholar and a great student of theology. From the discussions we had, perhaps from slightly different theological perspectives, I learned such a number of things from Rose. She is one of those people who believes that intelligence is like a fire to be lit and a brain is like a bucket to be filled. She actually wants to draw you out and discuss matters with you. She is a truly remarkable woman. I feel the need to head down to Dover just to keep in contact with her. Whether or not I transport myself corporeally down to Dover, all I know is that her prayers will be enveloping this building and this place, because she is part of our history and part of the culture that we have here, and we are the better for it.\nThis morning, during the tributes that were quite rightly paid to you, Mr Speaker, one thing we could not do was give any credit to your successor, because we do not know who your successor is—bookmakers appear to know, but that is entirely inappropriate to mention—but in the case of Rose we can mention my good friend Tricia Hillas. On behalf of all the community and congregation of St Barnabas Northolt, may I say what an excellent choice you have made, Mr Speaker? Despite an unfortunate predilection for Watford football club—I rather suspect she was attracted to Vicarage Road for theological reasons, rather than the lure of Troy Deeney—I must warn you, Mr Speaker, that when we come to meet Tricia Hillas, there will be dancing, singing and music, because Tricia Hillas can never stand still in one place from one minute to the next. We have talked about our different theological traditions—I tend to be with the late Monsignor Ronnie Knox, who felt that by and large enthusiasm was not a good thing and that we have a bit too much of it—but Trisha Hillas is an enthusiast. She is a marvellous pastor and will bring so much energy, courage, colour and excitement to this place.\nI am, of course, backing away from the stage and the limelight, returning to well-merited obscurity—[Hon. Members: “What a shame!”] No, no; were it put to a vote, I think I would have left years ago. [Hon. Members: “Never!”] Well, I think there is precedent for holding a seated vote, or a standing vote—I forget which one is which—but let us not chance fate. I wish everyone who is standing in the election every success and happiness. I want Members to know two things for when the new House assembles and they meet Tricia Hillas. First, she is absolutely a woman of God to the marrow of her bones. She is a woman who will bring God’s blessing to this place. Secondly, it is almost impossible to imagine anyone following Rose Hudson-Wilkin, but believe you me, Mr Speaker, Tricia Hillas is going to come very, very close.\nWe are here to mention Tricia for the future, but for the present and for the future in Dover, let us remember for a moment how incredibly lucky every one of us has been to be touched by that extraordinary, joyous, joyful Christian woman Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Chaplain to the Speaker, a woman who has taught us all so very much.\nThere was a time when I was the mayor of Ealing, and I revived the old habit of appointing the mayoral chaplain, which had fallen into desuetude. I appointed Father Pat Foley, my parish priest. At the beginning of each council meeting, he would stand, look at all the councillors, look at them again and then cast his eyes up to heaven and pray for the Borough of Ealing.\nI have to say that Rose has never ever stopped praying, not just for us poor parliamentarians, but for what we stand for—for our democracy, for our nation, for our community and, I hope, for a better, fairer and safer world. Rose has been an exemplar. She is going to Dover, but she is going with our prayers. Let us ask her to take with her our thanks, our gratitude, our respect and, if you will allow me, Sir, our love.\nDr Julian Lewis (New Forest East) (Con)\nAs I have listened to the successive tributes, I have been looking at my page of notes of all the things that I wanted to say in order to show appreciation for everything that Rose has brought to this place during her years of service here, and I have been having to cross them off one after another, because the heartfelt speeches so far have really encapsulated everything. But, as we know, Mr Speaker, in politics, everything may already have been said, but the show is not over until everyone has said it.\nI wish to try to say something that has not been said explicitly from a slightly unusual perspective in this context. What I mean is that most of the tributes that have been made so far have clearly come from people blessed with deep religious belief, but, sadly, I am not such a person, having had my religious belief holed below the waterline when I read too much for someone at a young age of some of the things that had happened in British and European history in the first half of the 20th century.\nIf, as some people say, religion is irrational, then also agnosticism can be irrational, too. What do I mean by that? I mean that somebody who does not have a particular religious belief is nevertheless hugely touched and impressed by those people who do, and particularly by those people who do and who put it into practice by praying on one’s behalf. At the risk of slightly embarrassing him, and I suspect that he will be the next to be called, the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) has a habit of sending little notes to colleagues on the eve of elections—[Interruption.]\nMr Speaker\nOrder. I know that the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) would want to hear this. The right hon. Gentleman is referring to him and I am sure that he will want to hear it.\nDr Lewis\nAs I was in mid-sentence saying, the hon. Gentleman has a wonderful habit of sending little notes to colleagues at election time and at other times when he thinks that they may need a little bit of encouragement saying, without any sort of patronising air, but with an air of true Christian love, that he is praying for them and their welfare. As someone who is not blessed with deep religious faith, I know how much I deeply appreciate that, and that is, I am sure, one of the reasons why he, irrespective of politics, is loved and respected in all parts of this Chamber. Rose Hudson-Wilkin falls into, from my perspective, exactly the same character. It must have been very daunting for her to descend into this pit of monstrous egos, but she carried it off tremendously. She has never talked down to us or scolded us. She has gently guided us. As has been said, she has given hints through the choice of appropriate prayers and appropriate language, and through the putting forward of a philosophy of righteousness, encouragement and love from which we all have benefited, whether we are religious, whether we have faith or whether we lack it. For that and for her kindness to all who work in this place, I thank her.\nJim Shannon (Strangford) (DUP)\nIt is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis). He has come through a hard time in relation to health. As I was aware of that, I made it my business to hold him very much in my prayers, as I do many people in this House—not that anyone will know, because our prayers are private. The right hon. Gentleman does know that, however, because I spoke to him about it.\nI am also very pleased to follow the hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound), who made a constructive contribution, as he always does. I will miss him when he leaves, as he is my friend in this House. In fact, he was one of the first Members I met when I was first elected to the House. I wish him well in whatever the future may hold; I know it will be a good one. I have very much enjoyed our fellowship. He has also had a hard time health-wise, and has come out the other side, due—I believe in my heart—to the prayers of God’s people.\nI wish to add my voice to the many who have paid tribute to the Speaker’s Chaplain, Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin. I have met her on many occasions, and I have always been inspired by the gentle, measured and thoughtful manner with which she has approached personal conversations as well as scheduled events. I do not think there is one of us who could say that they did not enjoy and feel uplifted by a conversation with Reverend Rose. I know that I always did; I just always felt so encouraged by what she said.\nScripture says, in Proverbs 31, “Who can find a virtuous woman? Her value is greater than that of rubies.” Well, this House has been blessed and encouraged to have been guided spiritually by Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin. We can easily see the worth of her guidance and the worthwhile things that have been accomplished in this place. Rose by name, rose by nature; I think every one of us has enjoyed her time here. Parliament has seen frustration and tempers rising to unheard levels in this place, with repeated calls for calmness and compassion. Reverend Rose has had a gentle spirit and calming influence, and has been a true ambassador for the Lord Jesus. We are exhorted by the word of God to speak the truth but to do so in love, and she does so all the time. That has been missing all too often in this Chamber, but never, ever in the actions of Reverend Rose.\nI am a member of the Baptist Church. When I first came to this place, I was made aware that there was holy communion in St Margaret’s church across the way. Although I am not an Anglican, I felt that I should—I wanted to—be there. From the very beginning, I was encouraged by that holy communion. As I look around the Chamber today, I see many Members who were also at holy communion. We enjoyed that time of fellowship together.\nWe have daily Prayers in the Chamber. People back home ask me whether we still have Prayers and Scripture in the Chamber, and they are encouraged when I tell them that we do. I am also encouraged every day when I come into this Chamber and hear Scripture and Prayer, which is so important. I can honestly say that that makes me feel encouraged for the day ahead. I said to Reverend Rose once, “I would like to have holy communion at least once a week or maybe every day, if that is possible, instead of once a month, because every day that we have holy communion I feel that we have had a visit from the Lord himself.” Holy communion was an important part of what she did.\nMy hon. Friend the Member for Belfast East (Gavin Robinson) referred to the empathy and compassion that Reverend Rose has shown him, his wife and his young child. None of us in this Chamber—especially not me, as his colleague and friend—could fail to be moved and encouraged by that.\nI wish Reverend Rose every success and God’s richest blessing as she continues her ministry as the new Bishop of Dover. I exhort her to keep pressing towards the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. May the words of St Patrick—our patron saint in Northern Ireland—be her battle cry as she moves forward:\n“Christ with me,\nChrist before me,\nChrist behind me,\nChrist in me,\nChrist beneath me,\nChrist above me,\nChrist on my right,\nChrist on my left,\nChrist when I lie down,\nChrist when I sit down,\nChrist when I arise,\nChrist in the heart of every man who thinks of me,\nChrist in the mouth of everyone who speaks of me,\nChrist in every eye that sees me,\nChrist in every ear that hears me.”\nI thank Reverend Rose. God bless her in all that she does and will do in the future. I know that in Dover or wherever it may be, she will serve her Lord and Saviour, who we serve here.\nSir Desmond Swayne (New Forest West) (Con)\nIt is a privilege to follow the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon).\nThe hon. Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound) referred to the holy mass. What is the meaning of the word “holy”? Daily, at Prayers, we invoke the fellowship of the Holy Ghost. I know that the hon. Member for Strangford would say “Holy Spirit”, but I prefer to stick with the original words. I have no idea how to define “holy” or “holiness”, and I am satisfied that there is no satisfactory dictionary definition, but I know holiness when I have encountered it, and we have encountered it in the presence of Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin.\nRobert Neill (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con)\nI want briefly to add a personal note of thanks and tribute to Rev. Rose Hudson-Wilkin. Rose married Anne-Louise, my wife, and I about 18 months ago. She did that with great charm, great style and joyfulness, and great Christianity. She showed great care and sensitivity to us in preparing us for that wedding, and also to our families, and, in particular, Anne-Louise’s two children, who had lost their own father tragically. The care that she showed has always stuck with us. Since then, particularly in the past few months, when Anne-Louise, sadly, has been unwell, Rose’s continuing support and prayers, and the kindness that she has shown to our family, mean more to us than words that I can say in this Chamber could ever adequately convey.\nI also want to say a quick word about Rose’s husband, Ken, who has been a great support to her, and who I, as Chair of the Justice Committee, had the pleasure of meeting when he was working as a prison chaplain. He, too, has been a great servant of God and of the broader community, and a great witness to his faith. That enables me also to say how valued the work of the prison chaplaincy service is by many in difficult times of their lives.\nAnne-Louise specifically asked me to come here today and say that she is still in hospital but on the mend, and that Rose’s support has meant more to us than anything. For those of us who do have a Christian faith, she could not be a better pastor and shepherd. For those who do not have such a faith, there could be no better ambassador. Dover will gain immeasurably from her arrival as its suffragan bishop.\nFinally, Mr Speaker, I wish you every success and your family every happiness for the future. It might not be so easy for me to see directly eye to eye with your successor; that might be more of a physical challenge for some of us. I wish you well and hope that all goes happily for you and your family in the future. In the end, we ought to remember that the things that bring us here in our desire to serve our communities are more important than the things that may divide us on political grounds.\nMr Speaker\nThe beauty of the hon. Gentleman’s tribute to Reverend Rose will, I think, remain with colleagues for a long time to come. As to the matter of physical stature, he, I and the right hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Sir Alan Duncan) share in common that characteristic of notable shortness, but I have always argued that we should at least be regarded as environmentally friendly on the grounds that we do not take up excessive space.\nMartin Vickers (Cleethorpes) (Con)\nIt is a pleasure to join these tributes to Reverend Rose. Only a remarkable lady could have come from Montego bay to the position of your chaplain, Mr Speaker, and those of us who have heard something of her journey realise how remarkable it has been.\nI am one of those who has regularly attended her morning communions, followed by breakfast in your apartments, Mr Speaker. One of the great beauties of those occasions is that, as the Leader of the House said, the service is based on the Book of Common Prayer, which is vastly superior to all that has followed. We have heard a wide range of speakers from the community, and Rose has introduced us to many people who have shared with us the challenges of their ministry or work, which has been exceptionally valuable. On those occasions, Rose has also invited individual Members to describe their faith journey, and I have found those sessions to be of particular value.\nI also want to talk about Rose’s wider ministry. Last year she came to my parish church in Grimsby, St Giles with St Matthew, and I learned that she has visited other Members’ constituencies—or, in my case, the neighbouring constituency—to preach at their parish church. It was a wonderful occasion, and I know that the whole congregation greatly appreciated it.\nAs we heard earlier, Rose has varied the Prayers that she says at the beginning of our daily sessions. I am sure that that has caused a few ripples here and there, because the exact prayers that must be said are probably laid down in statute, but it has been extremely helpful and valuable. She is not in the Chamber at the moment, but when I popped out a short while ago, she was providing pastoral care and comfort to a Member. That just shows her devotion to her calling, which I think we would all want to place on record.\nMr Speaker, if you will indulge me for an extra minute or two, I would like to say a few warm words about you. We first met when I was the constituency agent in Gainsborough. I drove you around on various visits, one of which was when I was studying at Lincoln University, and you spoke to the politics group of which I was a member. I can assure you that that went down particularly well. You returned to Lincoln University two or three years ago to give an address. You spotted me in the audience and spoke very warmly about me as a Member. My wife said to me, “He’s going a bit over the top, isn’t he?”, and I said, “John going over the top? No, never!” I greatly appreciated that.\nYou have called me relatively early in the proceedings. One or two of us at this end of the Chamber have, on odd occasions when we have been bobbing up and down, thought that your eyesight may be failing. You have always been particularly courteous to me, and I thank you for that. In particular, this occasion calls for our thanks to Rose. May God go with her.\nMr Dominic Grieve (Beaconsfield) (Ind)\nI shall be very brief. Throughout the time that Rose has been the chaplain to the Commons, it has been abundantly clear that her pastoral skills are outstanding. Those of us who have gone to the monthly communion in St Margaret’s have come to value her fellowship and her company. In addition, we have had the benefit of seeing her around the building and enjoying her pastoral support at times when some of us have needed it.\nLike my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers), I have had Rose visit my parish to preach, during a time when we had an interregnum between priests. She was something of a star attraction, which showed just how extensive her reach had become in using her chaplaincy of the Commons to spread the gospel and the word that she wanted to put forward in her own way. I will be very sorry at her departure, but I am delighted that the Bishopric of Dover will be available to her, where I am sure her pastoral skills will be used to full measure. I wish to use this opportunity—on behalf of both myself and my wife, who got to know her—to wish her farewell.\nFinally, I would just say that Rose was of course your choice, Mr Speaker, which I seem to remember attracted some controversy at the time. As we consider the end of your career here in the House and of your period as Speaker, I would just like to repeat my thanks to you. It is abundantly clear that if you have ruffled feathers, but there are some feathers you ruffled for very good reasons. Ten years on, those who look back will conclude that our proceedings and our life in this House were enhanced by many of the things that you did.\nMr Speaker\nI am very grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. That is very kind of him, and I take it in that spirit. As he knows, I wish him extremely well. Quite apart from his contributions in the House, the right hon. and learned Gentleman is the most exemplary county colleague that anyone could want. He has been a brilliant colleague for me in Buckinghamshire over the last 22 years, and I salute him.\n3.45 pm\nMr Laurence Robertson (Tewkesbury) (Con)\nAt the beginning of my short address, perhaps you will allow me, Mr Speaker, to thank you for and congratulate you on your work. I think we have known each other in excess of a quarter of a century. You have visited my constituency, and you were very helpful to me when I was Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. You have championed Back Benchers; I have a long record of being one. I would like to thank you and wish you well for the future.\nMr Speaker, you very kindly allowed me to use your state rooms on the occasion of my wedding reception on 7 February 2015. Mentioning that leads me seamlessly into thanking Rose for her work, because she did me the great honour of marrying my wife Annie and me on that date in the chapel downstairs—St Mary Undercroft. What a wonderful day it was. No one who attended will ever forget it. It still gives us strength and fills us with great affection when we look back at it. I well remember that I had to be interviewed separately, Annie had to be interviewed separately and then we had to be interviewed together before Rose recommended to the Dean of Westminster that we should be allowed to be married, and it was a wonderful occasion. That is my personal recollection.\nIt has also been wonderful to see Rose in action over the past 10 years. I have attended many services. I tend to go to the one at 12.45 pm in the chapel downstairs, which is immediately after Prime Minister’s questions, and it is a welcome contrast from that experience to hear Rose tell us about Christianity, peace, love and how important the way we treat each other is. I hope that one of her many legacies, as she goes, will be for us to remember that how we treat each other is very important. Personally, I will never say anything in this Chamber in a tone or in words that I would not say outside it to the person I am talking about or to, and I hope that we could all try to do that as we move forward. I think the public would really like us to take on the lesson that Rose has taught us.\nIt hardly seems credible that, 25 years ago, there was a terrible split in the Church of England about whether to ordain women. That seems incredible thinking back. I was very much on the side of ordaining women because I believe that the person who should get the job is the one who is best qualified and best able to do that job, regardless of whether they are a man or a woman. I am glad the right side won in that debate, because we would have been deprived of the services of Rose if that debate had gone the wrong way. Many years on, when it came to the question of women bishops, it was hardly a debate at all—quite rightly—and that has enabled Rose to move on to be appointed as the Bishop of Dover.\nI would like to thank Rose for all the enormous work she has done in this place, and the messages she has instilled in us about Christianity, the beliefs and what it means to be Christian. I would like to wish her all the very best as she goes forward.\n3.49 pm\nMr Richard Bacon (South Norfolk) (Con)\nIt is a pleasure to take part in this brief debate, Mr Speaker, and have the opportunity to offer my own tribute. I will start by offering a tribute to you, Mr Speaker, because I was not able to be here earlier. I remember well, as a young man, running into the party conference in 1985 to hear you speak, so we must have known each other for at least 34 or 35 years. You were a remarkable young man, and you have had a remarkable, and in some ways famous and controversial, speakership. Of all the things you have done—someone said earlier that you have undoubtedly ruffled feathers—I think that your best decision was to appoint Rose as your chaplain.\nRose has served this House extraordinarily well, and she always seemed to have a knack of knowing what to say. In one of the most difficult times in my life, I happened to bump into her in New Palace Yard. She looked at me from across the yard, pointed at me, and said, “I need to see you.” Although I had not talked to her at all about the difficulties I was facing, she already knew. She had a way of having her finger on the pulse and of knowing who needed help and counsel. Within an hour and a half or two hours, she had made time in her diary, and I spent probably 80 minutes in her study. Those were the most reassuring and illuminating 80 minutes of all the time that I spent talking to people about the difficulties I was facing, and she gave me an enormous amount of reassurance and relief. Rose has an extraordinary gift for pastoral care, and I shall always be extraordinarily grateful to her. She set me on the course that I am relived I ended up on, and I felt reassured by her that it was an okay course on which to embark.\nI endorse the tributes we have already heard. The Church of England often gets a lot of stick, and people worry about the future of our established Church. I believe that so long as people such as Rose are within it, and rising within it, the future of our Church will also be secure.\n3.51 pm\nLuke Graham (Ochil and South Perthshire) (Con)\nI appreciate the opportunity to pay a tribute to Rose. Like many in this House, I had experiences here that, when the personal combined with the professional, meant that I found myself having what might professionally be called “a bit of a wobble”—I know that many colleagues from my intake have had similar experiences. The one thing I would say about Rose is this: she was there. Her office is one of duty, but everyone would agree that her performance goes far beyond that. She makes time to see people, and gives them the opportunity to speak. She listens, far beyond the level that her office would necessarily require.\nRose has set an incredible example and a fantastic precedent for new Members and the future chaplain to follow. More broadly, the prayers that she leads before each sitting of the House give us the chance to reflect. In a time when we are constantly on social media and looking at emails, iPads and phones, that gives us a moment to step back in silence, listen to the words being said and think about the principles that are laid out here and that make this place and make us who we are. That is one of the greatest contributions that Rose has made to this place. Both personally and professionally, Rose has helped all Members strive to become the better part of ourselves while we are here, and I thank her on behalf of myself, my colleagues and our families.\nQuestion put and agreed to.\nResolved,\nThat this House congratulates the Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin on her twenty-eight years of ordained ministry in the Church of England, nine years of which have been in the service of Mr Speaker and this House as Chaplain to the Speaker, the first woman and the first BAME holder of that post; expresses its appreciation for the generous, ecumenical and compassionate spirit of her work among hon. Members and staff of the House; and wishes her every success in her forthcoming ministry as Bishop of Dover and Bishop in Canterbury.\nDawn Butler (Brent Central) (Lab)\nOn a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you indulge me for a moment? I have a bit of FOMO—fear of missing out—because as a Front Bencher I have not been able to say thank you for everything that you have done in the House. I thank you for all you have done on issues of equality and for not shying away from talking about race. I thank you for all you have done on LGBT+ issues, and for making this House more inclusive. Thank you for opening your state rooms, so that small organisations that thought the Houses of Parliament did not care about them could come to some of the grandest rooms in the Palace and feel valued. Thank you for all you have done.\nI also want to thank you, Mr Speaker, for bringing Reverend Rose into the House. Hearing everybody’s testament on how she has touched all our lives has been very moving. She has touched my life in many ways. My right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall South (Valerie Vaz) spoke about Labi Siffre. Reverend Rose and I talk often about this song and I just wanted to say the first verse:\n“The higher you build your barriers\nThe taller I become\nThe further you take my rights away\nThe faster I will run\nYou can deny me, you can decide\nTo turn your face away\nNo matter ’cause there’s\nSomething inside so strong\nI know that I can make it\nThough you’re doing me wrong, so wrong\nYou thought that my pride was gone, oh no\nThere’s something inside so strong”.\nThank you, Mr Speaker, for being so strong. I thank Reverend Rose for all that she has done for the House, for me and for everybody. Thank you.\nMr Speaker\nWell that was extraordinary and magnificent. I thank the hon. Lady for her excessively generous personal remarks as regards me, but what is much more important is what she said about Rose and I want to underline and reinforce that.\nColleagues, I am extremely grateful to each and every one of you, as we approach the end of this Parliament, for sparing the time and making the commitment to share your experience of and demonstrate your—I was going to say respect for—devotion to the Reverend Rose, who has after all been devoted to us for nine years. In every particular—I say this not so much for colleagues, but for those observing our proceedings—Rose has not just done the job, she has excelled beyond anything that we could reasonably have imagined or contemplated. Her daily commitment is there for all to see, day after day, combining her duties in the Chamber with the responsibility for the conduct of services and the need to attend to St Mary-at-Hill in the City and to interact with large numbers of people on the parliamentary estate.\nOn big occasions, as so many colleagues have eloquently evidenced, Rose has found the words that needed to be expressed. She has expressed them with feeling and with a transparent and undeniable sincerity. It is that authenticity about her that impresses everybody who hears or meets her. We all know, of course, that a very important part of Rose’s role, as has been referred to by many colleagues during these tributes, is the offer of pastoral care. To Members, to Members’ staff, to the staff of the House, to anyone not employed by the House but contracted to work for it, or to anyone who has reason to be on the parliamentary estate who needs help, Rose has been there to provide that help. It has been a singular and unforgettable contribution.\nI certainly do not mind vouchsafing to the House that as well as being aware in many cases of when, how and to what extent Rose helped other colleagues, she has been a terrific source of support, succour and counsel to me. Until my dying day, I will appreciate that support, that succour, that counsel and that camaraderie, which she has been able to provide. Many people have also referred to the circumstances of the terrorist attacks. In those circumstances, we could not have wanted anyone, for the purpose of providing comfort and mitigation of pain, other than Rose.\nSo many people over the past three years have referred to our departed and beloved colleague, Jo Cox, and someone referred earlier to Birstall in Yorkshire, where the then Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition went the day after the appalling murder of Jo. Of course I went as well, but what was really significant was how Rose went, and each of us, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and I, observed the impact of Rose’s presence and persona—her love, kindness, compassion and empathy—on people who were experiencing quite unendurable pain. That pain could not be removed, but it could at least be mitigated, and it could be mitigated by no one better than the Reverend Rose. I have a sense, my friends and colleagues, that we are all agreed in this Chamber that the House of Commons’ loss is Canterbury and Dover’s gain.",

On the contrary, the matter is as complicated as you can get, with international treaty obligations…and the rest.\nThe Government is wrestling with the complexities and is determined to get on top of them. The opposition parties however, believe that the solution is to make more ‘safe and legal’ routes available so that migrants are spared the danger and expense of paying gangsters to bring them by dingy.\nI think this is naivete of the first order: the ‘safe allocations’ would quickly be exhausted and everyone else would simply resort to dinghies once again.\nAt least a part of the problem is of our own making. We are a ‘soft touch’ and we allow ourselves to be taken for fools. For example, the Albanians -who make up about one third of this year’s arrivals in small boats, yet there is no war or oppression in Albania. Equally, if you claim, as an Albanian, that you have been trafficked as a modern slave, surely it is reasonable that, once having been rescued, you be returned to your home.\nGiven the choice, I’d rather live in the UK than Albania, but as a country that has an acute housing shortage and which saw net migration of half a million in the last year for which figures are available, we cannot be in the business of making such choices freely available.\nSo, how is it that we accept the claims of well over half of our Albanian asylum applicants?\nWhy does France accept only 2.3 % of their Albanian claims?\nWhy do Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and eleven other European countries not accept any of such Albanian claimants?\nClearly, there is something wrong with our law, our processes, or our judgement. Actually, it is probably all three.",

The Government backs small businesses, including responsible short-term holiday letting, which brings significant investment to local communities. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the impact that large numbers of holiday lets concentrated in an area can have on local communities.\nThe Government’s proposed planning changes would see the introduction of a new national use class and, simultaneously, the introduction of a new permitted development right. The new permitted development right would provide flexibility where short-term lets are not a local issue and allow for this flexibility to be removed where there is a local concern. Any Article 4 direction to remove the permitted development right must be evidence based and should apply to the smallest geographical area possible, and could therefore be focused on those areas or streets that see the highest numbers of short-term lets, or individual properties.\nAs set out in the consultation document, when the use class comes into effect existing properties would fall into the short-term let use class where they met the definition or remain as C3 dwellinghouse. Any re-classification is not considered development and so property owners should not need to apply for planning permission where they meet the definition of short-term let. They would be classified as such and would not require planning permission.\nAs you may know, the Government has also consulted on plans for a short-term lets registration scheme. A registration scheme is important. Crucially, it will provide information to help local authorities enforce health and safety regulations and apply and enforce the planning changes.\nDS",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_tory-leadership-choice/content_196.html": "This week party members will receive their ballots to vote in the Conservative leadership election.\nThere are two very strong candidates, but we have to choose between them. I’ve set out the reasons for my own choice below.\nIt starts with honesty. We need to be clear about why we lost the election. We lost because we were seen as incompetent and divided, and no-one knew what we stood for. This wasn’t entirely fair but it was true enough to turn off millions of voters who left us for Reform, the Lib Dems, Labour, or to stay at home and not vote at all.\nTo restore our reputation for competence, to unite the Party, and to rediscover what we stand for – we need leadership.\nLeadership isn’t about grabbing media attention, though we certainly need a good media performer. It’s about doing the hard work to identify the real causes for our national malaise – on productivity and growth, on defence and security, on social breakdown and the state of the public services – and putting in place a plan to fix them.\nIt’s about setting a clear direction, with explicit policy commitments on the main issues the voters care about: immigration, the economy and the public services, especially the NHS. When the leader is clear on direction, the troops will unite and follow.\nAnd it’s about being professional, diligent, decent and respectful towards all strands of conservatism (and indeed non-conservatives). We need courage and radicalism, but with the spirit of emollience and courtesy. You don’t win by hectoring people. You win by putting across a clear and persuasive message.\nThis combination – clarity on policy direction, and an inclusive and generous spirit – is what Robert Jenrick represents. He has set out a detailed analysis of what is wrong with our country, a clear set of Conservative principles to address them, and policies to get there. His pledge to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a case in point.\nI like and greatly admire Kemi Badenoch. If Rob had been knocked out of the contest earlier, I would have backed her. Indeed, I backed her in the last leadership contest. I share her politics – pro-Brexit, pro-growth, anti-woke – and I recognise her strengths as a punchy debater and, of course, if Kemi wins this contest, I will gladly follow her. We have a great chance of winning back power from this plainly failing Labour government, and we will need unity to do that. But for the next week we have a choice and I see Robert Jenrick as the stronger of the two",

On the contrary, he said that the Bill was a neutral measure, and that it could be used to establish new British standards which have so often in the past established the international standards.\nIndeed he reassured us by saying that the last Conservative administration had been planning to bring forward just such a Bill.\nWe were not. Our Bill would have differed in a vitally important respect. Its aim would have been the same: to provide the architecture for establishing product standards given that we no longer rely on the European Commission to do that for us. But we would not, as the current bill does, handover the power to legislate entirely to ministers.\nParliament has done enormous damage to our constitution by delegating powers to independent law-making bodies, so much so, that when the public complain about some outrageous decision or situation, Parliament finds that it cannot put it right because it simply gave away the power to do so. We have had a classic example of this in the last few weeks when the woke-obsessed Sentencing Council sought to undermine a fundamental principle of justice, equal treatment before the law. When the Lord Chancellor and Parliament objected, we were told to get stuffed. We are now in the absurd position of having to introduce emergency legislation to put the Sentencing Council back in its box.\nThis Metrology Bill takes the proper power of Parliament to legislate and hands it unlimited to Ministers. Whilst, the aim of the bill may be about the better regulation of products; it also gives the Government the power to do what they like, when they like, for reasons they do not have to explain, and then impose it as they see fit. And all with the coercive and intrusive powers of search, confiscation and arrest, all of this without having to return and seek the consent of Parliament.\nDemocratic institutions, particularly when led by decent and principled people, need to take care to legislate against the worst case, such as government falling into less scrupulous hands. Power must always be limited, because -as Lord Acton observed- it corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.",

I am absolutely clear that this practice has no place in civilised society. Being lesbian, gay or bisexual is not an illness to be treated or cured.\nI am encouraged that this view is shared by the head of the NHS, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the UK Council for Psychotherapy, the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and the British Medical Association. Each of these bodies have concluded that such therapy is unethical and potentially harmful.\nThe Government Equalities’ Office commissioned a large-scale LGBT survey in 2017. Sadly, two per cent of respondents to the national LGBT survey said they had undergone conversion therapy in an attempt to ‘cure’ them of being LGBT. Unfortunately, in this survey, what conversion therapy entailed was not defined, nor were the respondents asked whether or not the conversion therapy referred to in their answer was offered in the UK.\nI very much welcome the fact that the Government is delivering on its promise and will legislate to ban conversion therapy to protect LGBT people from this harmful practice.\nThe Government has now launched a six-week consultation, closing on Friday 10th December, on how Ministers plan to ban practices of so called ‘conversion therapy’. This consultation invites views on the Government’s proposals from members of the public, victims of conversion therapy, LGBT organisations, faith groups, psychiatric and counselling bodies, charities and other interested stakeholders to ensure we hear from all voices in shaping the ban on conversion therapy. I would therefore encourage you to take part at the following link – https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/banning-conversion-therapy.\nThe Government’s proposals include the creation of a new criminal offence and we will also ensure that conversion therapy is considered by judges as a potential aggravating factor upon sentencing for existing violent criminal offences. Ministers further propose a range of other supportive measures including the introduction of statutory Conversion Therapy Protection Orders to protect individuals facing imminent risk, such as forced travel abroad to receive conversion therapy.\nI would like to reassure you that the results will be analysed and will inform the Government’s next steps in preparing legislation for spring 2022.\nDS.",

It has taken some degree of will power. I receive a large number of emails about it daily. Some constituents have taken to emailing several times a day with their reaction to every twist in the latest news bulletins. I hope they are not too dissatisfied with a simple “thanks, your views are noted” because there is just not enough time in the day to provide a running commentary on the latest news.\nAs I write, the latest thing to generate email outrage, was the PM’s suggestion on Wednesday that we might remain in a transition phase for a further year in order to enable the enduring trade deal with the EU to be fully negotiated and implemented, and to give more time for to the Northern Ireland border problem to be resolved.\nMany people believe that time is of the essence: Another year means another year of fully paying our dues; It will take us into the next EU budget period where we will have no input to the budget setting process, nor enjoy our existing rebate, so the price of that year will be correspondingly much higher.\nBy the time that that additional year is over it will be over 5 years since the referendum, and three years living under rules that we have given up our power to influence.\nHaving waited 43 years to leave the EU already, adding one more to the two already suggested in the proposed transition agreement, is not the deal-breaker for me personally.\nWhat is my deal-breaker, is signing up even to just the two year transition, when our exit from it relies on a solution –acceptable to the EU- of the Northern Ireland border\nSigning-up to such an agreement is a recipe for a permanent state of limbo, a vassal to the EU: making the payments, but without influence.\nThe only solution to the Northern Ireland border is available now, and the EU has rejected it. There is no new different solution that will suddenly emerge in the next three years. Especially so, because now is the time when our negotiating leverage is at its strongest: we haven’t given them the money. Once the transition agreement is signed and ratified however, the £39 billion will be committed and they will have us where they want us, they will be under no pressure whatsoever to agree to end the transition.\nUnless the EU negotiation position changes dramatically and soon, I believe that the only sensible way to proceed is to announce that we will leave on 29th March on World Trade Organisation rules, and seek a number of minor technical agreements to ease that process, recognising that both UK and EU are bound by the provisions of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.\nAs for to-day’s rally for a second referendum, all I can say is that I haven’t heard a single argument in the last 2 years that wasn’t thoroughly debated before the 2016 referendum.\nThere was only one thing that both sides agreed on, namely that the voting in that referendum was vital because it would settle the question for a generation.

May they never lead the nation wrongly through love of power, desire to please, or unworthy ideals but laying aside all private interests and prejudices keep in mind their responsibility to seek to improve the condition of all mankind; so may your kingdom come and your name be hallowed.”\nThese sentiments seem to me entirely proper given that the most common complaint levelled against MPs is that they are self-interested, or put party before country. Reciting these words in the presence of the Almighty should ensure that they at least start each parliamentary sitting in the right frame of mind.\nPrayers are not compulsory, members are quite entitled to wait and come into the chamber after prayers are over.\nFor some, the voluntary nature of praying is not sufficient: the National Secular Society now demands that formal parliamentary prayers be abandoned altogether.\nJust a few years ago a parish councillor took his council to court to stop them praying before meetings –unbelievable, the lengths some people will go to!\nAnyway, the courts decided that he was right and that formal prayers could not be part of the agenda. Fortuitously however, within 48 hours the Secretary of State used his own statutory powers to grant councils the authority to pray at meetings, which the courts said that they hadn’t until then had.\nI pray that the attempts to ban parliamentary prayers will prove as unsuccessful as was the battle to stop councils praying. We are a Christian nation with an established Church with the Queen at its head at the heart of our constitution.\nGiven the strife over BREXIT I cannot imagine a less propitious time to abandon prayers.

Also, the promotion or facilitation of suicide and people smuggling. Further amendments will include controlling or coercive behaviour, in recognition of the specific challenges women and girls face when going online.\nOfcom, the UK’s independent communications regulator, will oversee the regulatory regime, backed up by mandatory reporting requirements and strong enforcement powers, including blocking access to non-compliant sites from within UK, and eye-watering fines of up to ten per cent of annual worldwide turnover.\nThat said, when the Bill was first published my principal worry was that, in its laudable intent to protect children, it nevertheless came at the expense of free speech.\nAt the heart of the problem was the creation a new category of ‘legal but harmful’ content, empowering lawful content to be removed when considered ‘harmful’. In effect, this subcontracted power of censorship to service providers and raised all sorts of questions about what constitutes a ‘harmful opinion’. It would also have introduced a ridiculous situation where censorship online could exclude opinion that would remain perfectly legal if said or published in print.\nMercifully the ‘legal but harmful’ provisions from the Bill has been struck out.\nInstead, content that is illegal will be required to be removed along with any legal content that a platform provider prohibits under its own terms of service. Adults can choose whether to engage with legal forms of abuse and comment that fall short of being unlawful, so long as the platform they are using allows such content. It is a free market.\nArguably, the changes to the Bill have ensured that it substantially protects free speech while holding social media companies to account for their promises to users, guaranteeing that users will be able to make informed choices about the services they use and the interactions they have on those sites.\nNo solution is ever perfect. The provider retains the ability to silence lawful content which breaches its own rules. In effect it can exclude arguments of which it disapproves. I do not see a way around this. After all, it is the provider’s own platform and they can make their rules in the same way that publishers impose their own standards. Indeed, nobody has an absolute right to see their opinions printed in any particular newspaper or print publication.\nIn mitigation we will have to rely on the powers of the regulator to see that providers apply their rules properly and fairly. In addition, there will be reputational damage to providers who capriciously censor content when other publications draw attention to it.\nA concern that I have which does not fall within the scope of the bill which may have a chilling effect on lawful expression, is a ruling by the Commons that social media content generated by Members of Parliament shall be subject to the scrutiny and ruling of the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life. How long will it be before this official tells MPs what they can and cannot say on social media?",

I told him that the his statement was grotesque and that he should reflect on the dreadful magnitude of how things would have turned out had the efforts of that generation really been in vain.\nOf course, the Government must redouble its efforts to get a grip on what is happening on our own shores. But as it does so it is worth recalling that the opposition parties have no answers beyond offering ‘safe and legal routes’ to UK by those currently trying to get here illegally by dinghy. The reality is that we have already made generous provision for refugees to resettle here and our ability to be even more generous is utterly overwhelmed by the illegal trade across the Channel. In any event, no matter how many legal routes are offered, those who don’t qualify will continue to try their luck in a dinghy unless we can stop them, because the demand to come here is limitless.\nFrance is struggling to secure its border with Italy, as Italy and Greece wrestle to halt the flow across the Mediterranean. Indeed, every European jurisdiction is trying to fix their own migrant problem as the EU itself cannot get agreement from its member states on a common approach.\nBeyond, Europe the problem is so much greater. Pakistan is host to millions of refugees from Afghanistan, as Turkey and the countries surrounding Syria host millions of Syrian refugees.\nThe states of Central America see a continuous flow northward to try a penetrate the borders of the USA. I could go on.\nThe fix that we find for our problem to halt the flow to the shores of the UK will ultimately be as temporary as Donald Trump’s wall, unless the rich developed world return with urgency to the task of improving the economic prospects of millions of people in wretched poor and war-torn countries. Until that happens, people are going to continue to risk everything to get here.",

International law largely does not exist in that same sense. Instead it exists in treaties between consenting parties:\nWe won’t jump a red light only because we agreed that we wouldn’t.\nSome of these agreements have grievance procedures written into them in order to arbitrate when there is a dispute between the parties about an action by one of them which allegedly breaks a provision of the treaty.\nThe European Court of Justice has before it a long list of cases still to be settled involving proceedings against EU members. Whilst you can make it sound awesome by saying that the member states in question are alleged to have ‘broken international law’. The reality is that its an arbitration between signatories to an agreement.\nThe World Trade Organisation maintains a similar arbitration process for trade disputes between its members. It also has a long list of alleged infractions to settle. Call it ‘breaking international law’ if it sounds more exciting.\nThe Markets bill does not break our Withdrawal Agreement with the EU or alter its terms in any way.\nWhat it does is to empower the UK Government, after seeking further authority from Parliament, to alter the arrangements that we agreed in the treaty if we find we need to.\nSo, the Bill doesn’t breach the treaty arrangements of itself. Even if it becomes an act of Parliament it does not do so. The arrangements in the agreement will only be altered if the Government, having sought further authority from Parliament, were then to actually change the arrangements originally agreed.\nOnly then does the question arise: would we be breaking the terms of our agreement, or if you want to put it that way, would we be breaking international law?\nThe Government is taking these powers in response to a direct threat made by EU during the negotiations for a trade deal.\nIn order to persuade the UK to concede our interests they suggested that, if we did not do so and that the outcome was no deal, then they would use the Northern Ireland Protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement to exclude UK mainland produce from Northern Ireland Markets.\nClearly, no UK Government could tolerate such action and it is essential that we arm ourselves with powers which act as a deterrent to prevent it ever happening.\nSuppose it did happen though and that we used the powers, would we have broken the agreement?\nNo, because by interpreting the treaty perversely and excluding UK goods from part of the UK – which was never the intent of the agreement, the EU would itself have broken the treaty, and our action would be self-defence.\nThe Lords, in seeking to remove our deterrent whilst we are still in the middle of negotiations, have shown their irresponsibility.\nBy equating the deterrent power with China’s treatment of Hong Kong and other enormities, they have shown that they have no sense of proportion either.\nShould we abolish them?\nWell, there is a frighteningly long list of priorities on the ‘to do’ list…but one day",

It was a brave effort and in my estimate it is essential that we redouble our efforts to get them there, irrespective of the objections of bishops, opposition parties other commentators, however appalled. We simply cannot go on accommodating a limitless number of refugees.\nIn the last year 60,000 have applied for asylum in the UK. The only proposal that opponents offer is that we provide ‘safe routes’ for applicants to get here, so that they don’t have to try their luck crossing the Channel in small boats.\nSafe routes?\n-We made safe routes for 20,000 Afghans and more (about 12,000 of whom are still accommodated in hotels), for 20,000 Syrians and doesn’t the Government expect 300,000 Hong Kong Chinese to come here over the next five years by the safe route we’ve provided (beware, government expectations have always been underestimates – and by a country mile). 60,000 Ukrainians have arrived in the last few months by a safe route.\nIn all, Migration Watch estimates that 250,000 refugees have come to the UK via ‘safe routes’ since 2004.\nThe reality is that ‘safe routes’ make no impact on the trafficking trade because a sufficient number, unable to make it by one of the safe routes, provide a continuing and unlimited source of demand for the traffickers.\nRefugees, seek safety but migrants pursue better economic opportunities. The refugees who arrive in UK unlawfully have passed through several safe countries before getting here. Their unwillingness to claim asylum in those countries, in my estimate, moves them into the category migrants. I do not blame them for that. On the contrary, were I one of them, I wouldn’t settle for France or anywhere else, I’d want to come to Britain too.\nNevertheless, safety is to be had in Rwanda, and a measure of economic opportunity too.\nThere has to be a limit to the numbers that we can accommodate here. Last year alone we issued 900,000 visas for people to come here entirely lawfully.\nOur Continued adherence to the European Convention on Human Rights prevented the first Rwanda flight proceeding.\nI long argued that the Convention had outlived its usefulness and that we should leave it.\nAddressing, the issue is an essential part of any reform of our own human rights legislation, to which the Government made a manifesto commitment.\nLabour’s Human Rights Act 1998 makes the Convention rights justiciable in UK courts. Repealing it, whilst remaining within the Convention, merely means that appellants will have to go straight to the court in Strasbourg rather than trying their luck in British courts first. Repeal of the 1998 Act won’t alter the fact that what happens here can ultimately be determined in Strasbourg.\nUnfortunately, extricating ourselves from the ECHR will now be complicated. We have used it to define competencies within our devolution settlements and the Belfast Agreement. So, our best legal brains need to work on how we can lawfully limit the Convention Court’s jurisdiction without necessarily leaving the convention itself. I’m confident that it can be done, after all, Parliament is supreme, but we need to get it done quickly and get those flights on their way to Kigali",

Almost 1 million young people are not in education, employment or training—that’s one in eight of all our young people. Some 2.8 million are out of work due to long-term sickness, and the number of people claiming personal independence payments is set to double this decade from 2 million to 4.3 million, with the growth in claims rising faster among young people and those with mental health conditions.\nTaxpayers are paying billions more, with spending on working-age sickness and disability benefits up by £20 billion since the pandemic, and set to rise by a further £18 billion by the end of this Parliament, to £70 billion per year. In most other comparable countries spending on these benefits since the pandemic is either stable or falling, but ours continues to rise inexorably.\nSo, in response to problem which she had set out with such clarity, she announced savings of a mere £5 billion by 2029/30.\nI put a simple question to her:\n“because working is so good for mental health, will she require claimants to do socially useful work to retain their benefits.”\nI got a one word answer: “No”\n60 people were signed off onto sickness benefit in the time that Liz Kendal was on her feet telling us how little she was going to do about it.\nI don’t disagree with any of the measures that she did announce, but they just are not going to be enough. She said that she would not proceed with any of the measures that were planned by the last government – and I didn’t believe they would be enough either.\nThere is a both a practical and moral case to require people in receipt of benefits, and who are able to work , to do socially useful work whilst they are out of paid employment.\nAs the number employment opportunities contracts due to the Chancellor’s disastrous jobs tax on employers, the need for an initiative of this sort will become more glaringly obvious.\nNothing will come of Nothing",

So, I was tempted to join the protest march last weekend in London against the Coronavirus regulations and for which I had received a couple of email invitations.\nI certainly wasn’t put off by the prospect fine because it struck me as entirely possible to attend such events and yet abide by the required social distance set out in guidelines. Furthermore, so many other protest marches have been allowed to proceed largely unmolested by the authorities including the Black Lives Matter protests, and just in the last week Extinction Rebellion.\nAs for the liability of an on-the-spot fine of a whopping £1000 for the organisers, I certainly wasn’t one of them, and anyway, even if one were, the organisers of the other protest marches were not pursued.\nIn the event I didn’t go simply because I have so many other demands on my time on a Saturday.\nPiers Corbyn, Jeremy’s elder brother, has always struck me as a rather odd fellow, with some pretty wacky views. Nevertheless, I was pretty horrified that he was fingered for the £1000 on-the-spot fine for the march that I had at least contemplated attending. This is very unfair given that the other more fashionable marches did not receive this heavy-handed approach. I am glad that there is a campaign to fight his corner and challenge the fine, to which I’ve made a very modest contribution.\nThe regulations under which our right to lawful protest has been removed -undebated and without a vote in Parliament- gives the power to any police officer, including police support officers, to levy the on-the spot-fine on you for being involved in a gathering of more that 30 people. Well, in that case I’m very glad I didn’t go. The original official description of the regulations was that the £1000 was just for the organisers, actually the wording of the regulations however, state that it’s anyone involved.\nWhen I received the emails advertising the March, I did contemplate forwarding them to those constituents who have been most vociferous in their criticism of Coronavirus regulations. I didn’t, but had I done so, would I have ‘involved’ myself, and might I be liable to be fined?\nI am informed that this is indeed the case. In fact, anyone present, carrying banners, shouting slogans, is ‘involved’ and could be liable.\nAnother chilling aspect of all this is how police photographers take long lens photographs of entirely peaceful participants: they can come for you later.\nAs the barrister Matthew Scott has put it\n“One should shudder at a law that gives such vast powers to the most junior officials; that was introduced by an emergency procedure, and after the publication of grossly misleading official guidance as to its intended effect”\nWe should never be careless with our liberty and freedom of expression",

Certainly, it would not help those young women where family circumstance rather than money is the root of the problem.\nEven for those families living on benefits and in straightened circumstances, I have often been surprised at the choices that some make. In the USA expenditure would be conditioned by the rules of the ‘food stamps’ system. Here however, more generous benefits would not necessarily translate into a greater provision of ‘necessities’.\nThere is at least the prospect of a 20% reduction in sanitary product prices because the Government is pledged to zero-rate them for VAT when we make good our escape from EU regulation.\nWhat I do find so very encouraging, is that public spirited individuals, having identified a problem, have set about doing something about it locally.\nIf you want to find out more contact redboxprojectuk.lym.brock@gmail.com",

The one thing that government ministers are not short of at the moment, is advice. Indeed, they have access to the best medical and crisis management advice that can be had.\nOne email correspondent, responding to the false news -published in Times last week- that Parliament was to go into recess for 5 months, told me that he was glad that I was being sent home to my constituency to get ill along with everyone else.\nI responded by pointing out that the danger from the covid19 is not so much to our health as to our wealth (as demonstrated by the collapse of Flybe and the consequences for Southampton Airport that will follow from it).\nSome 17,000 of our fellow citizens die of flu in our country every year but we don’t hide ourselves indoors to try and avoid it. Covid19 is unlikely to kill many more than flu does and most sufferers will experience only mild symptoms, some won’t even realise that they’ve had it.\nThe difficulty is that Covid19 is much more ‘catching’ than flu, with the prospect that one in five of us may be off-work at when it peaks, and for those who do get severe reactions, hospitals will be overwhelmed.\nIt is for this reason that we need to delay the progress of the contagion, pushing its peak as far into the summer as we can. First, this will relieve the NHS of other winter pressures, including flu, so that it is better able to cope with the numbers that will have to be hospitalised. Second, there may be a seasonal decline with covid19, just as there is with flu.\nThe key issue is what to do to slow the progress without wrecking the economy. Clearly, we want to take measures that are effective in retarding the spread but don’t have a downside. That’s why washing your hands frequently is so helpful: it is very effective and has no economic downside whatsoever. Once you start banning large gatherings like sporting events, or even closing schools you will cause major economic dislocation for what might be only a marginal impact on the spread of the disease.\nIf you already have a damaged immune system or are weakened by other health or age-related conditions, I can understand the need to take precautions and to isolate yourself from the risk of exposure to Covid19 as far as you can. The rest of us however, should take advantage of the opportunities to be had, carry on going shopping, going out, and eating out. There are bargains now to be had from the holiday industry, I see no reason why they should be passed-up.\nDon’t waste your money on expensive gels and masks when soap and water will do well enough.\nAnd why people would imagine that they need to hoard loo paper -God only knows.",

The problem with the EU is that the judges at the European Court and the 28 commissioners who increasingly are making our laws are not accountable to anyone: more and more, we are being governed by people who we do not elect, and who we cannot remove.\nAt a another meeting in Ringwood the following day, someone drew our attention to Anthony Bamford’s excellent letter to his JCB employees, reassuring them that their jobs were safe, and that they would prosper if we left the EU. In that letter he makes the point that when we joined the Common Market as its eighth member, it accounted for fully 31% of the world’s economic output. To-day however, with 28 members, the EU’s share of the world’s economic output has shrunk to 17%. I draw two inferences from this. First, the EU is of diminishing importance in the world economy and that if we are to prosper in the future we will have to look beyond its confines to the younger and growing markets of the future. Second, the EU is to a significant extent responsible for the diminution of its share of the world’s economy. The reality is that, far from acting to promote trade with the growing economies of the world, it acts to restrain that trade. In effect, the EU’s trading policy is one of constructing a ‘fortress Europe’ where trade between the member states within the EU is encouraged, but trade with the rest of the world is discouraged by the tariff wall that the EU has built around itself.\nWhere the EU has sought to make trade deals with countries beyond its own borders, it has proved extraordinarily dilatory. Canada has been trying to reach such an agreement with the EU for fully seven years. India, with a huge and lucrative potential market, waited so long for an EU agreement that it eventually gave up.\nAt a debate in Canford last Saturday the point was made that, irrespective of the undemocratic imposition on our ability to govern ourselves, membership of the EU – however frustrating – was necessary to secure our prosperity. As Anthony Bamford’s letter points out, the reverse is true: the EU is, on the contrary, holding back our prosperity.

Alongside providing £10 billion a year to support people through our overseas aid, the UK is a global leader in refugee resettlement. As a country, between 2016 and 2019 we resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any member state of the EU. In 2015, the Government committed to resettle 20,000 of the most vulnerable refugees who fled the conflict in Syria through the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) – the Government has now met that commitment.\nIn total across all of our resettlement schemes, the UK has now resettled more than 25,000 vulnerable refugees in need of protection over the past 6 years, with around half being children. These refugees are resettled directly from regions of conflict and instability rather than from safe European countries. I believe that it is most important to prioritise those refugees in dangerous situations, not those already in Europe.\nThe Government already provides safe and legal routes for people needing protection or seeking to reunite with their families. In the year ending December 2020, over 5,400 refugee family reunion visas were issued to partners and children of those previously granted asylum or humanitarian protection in the UK. Over 29,000 family reunion visas have been issued in the last 5 years.\nLet me assure you that the new Nationality and Borders Bill will allow the UK continue to resettle genuine refugees directly from places of danger and offer refugee family reunions. It will improve support for refugees to help them build their life in the UK, integrate and become self-sufficient members of society. The Bill also seeks to introduce a new temporary protection status for those who do not come directly to the UK or claim asylum without delay once here but who have, in any event, been recognised as requiring protection.\nIt is also the case that refugees in the UK need to have the freedom to succeed as they settle. This means ensuring refugees have access to the tools required to become fully independent and provide for themselves and their families. This will allow refugees to be in a position to contribute and integrate into the economic and cultural life of the UK.\nIn order to achieve this, the Home Secretary has announced £14 million of funding to help newly granted refugees to integrate in the UK. This fund will pilot new approaches across the country to support newly granted refugees to learn English, move into work, access housing and build links in their local communities. Lessons learned from these pilots will inform future support available to all refugees.",

If your counterparty knows that you really won’t be able to walk away, then he can increase his price accordingly.\nThe estimate that I made of the parliamentary proceedings over the last week was that, given the make-up of the Commons, there is very little likelihood of the House accepting our leaving the EU without EU agreement on the terms.\nUnfortunately, the EU Commission will have been watching too and may have drawn the same conclusion",

The awesome size and age of the Universe laid out before us in night sky never ceases to fill me with wonder, and presents a certain tension -if not a standing challenge-to my professed Christianity, particularly at this time of year.\nThe principal Christian truth is that we are the critical factor in understanding God’s purpose: that humanity is central to the creation; that we were created to glorify God and enjoy him forever; and that -to this end- God created Heaven and Earth and then intervened in human history, through Jesus Christ, to redeem mankind and restore the integrity of that original purpose. This dramatic intervention took place only a couple of thousand years ago. Indeed, human history itself only stretches back before Christ by some 5,000 years.\nSo the key problem is this: Given that the age of the Universe is nearly 14 billion years, why did The Almighty leave it so long before adding the central feature of the creation –humanity, and to make his key intervention –through the life of Christ?\nI believe that the answer, if there is one, lies in the fact that we are literally made of stardust: the heavier elements -so critical to the formation of the larger molecules essential to the existence of Life, take eons of time to form, being the product of the life-cycle of generations of massive stars, and the enormous pressures created by their subsequent collapse.\nThe proper response therefore, on looking out into the Universe, from the space station window, from the Southern Hemisphere, or from a garden in the New Forest, shouldn’t be one of ‘how insignificant we are’ as such recent and tiny occupants in such an incredibly old and massive universe. Rather it should be the opposite: ‘How incredibly important we must be to God’s purpose’ that we are the product of such a vast and time consuming process.",

I know because, during the Cameron regime, I worked closely with him. This latest wheeze however, puts him in close competition with King James the First for the title of ‘wisest fool in Christendom’.\nSir Oliver says he supports the Boris agreement, and I believe him, his honesty is absolute and his integrity of the highest standard.\nHe is passionately against leaving the EU without a deal and if, he argues, we had approved the agreement on Saturday, then the terms of the Withdrawal Number Two Act (September 2019) -(the ‘surrender act’ requiring the PM to ask the EU for a further extension of our membership) – would have been satisfied and Boris would have been freed from making that humiliating request.\nSuppose however, the bill subsequently put to Parliament to ratify the agreement as an international treaty then failed to be passed by 31 October (perhaps due to opposition by the ERG brexiteer ‘Spartans’), the result would then be that we would be out of the EU without any agreement and subject to all the terrifying possibilities whipped up by ‘project fear’.\nSo, Sir Oliver’s solution, set out in his amendment, was to withhold approval until the ratification bill becomes law, forcing the PM to apply for an extension just in case it doesn’t.\nThe blindingly obvious, which has escaped Sir Oliver, is that the greatest enthusiasts for his amendment are those who are opposed to us leaving the EU at all, and they intend to use the delay caused by his amendment to achieve the very opposite of what he intended.\nBy my book, king James narrowly beats Sir Oliver to the title.\n*\nAs to the Agreement itself, like the previous agreement, it involves an implementation period in which a future free trade deal with the EU is negotiated. The shape of this agreement and its accompanying Political Declaration means that the likely outcome is a much looser association with the EU than Mrs May’s agreement envisaged.\nThe huge advantage of the Boris agreement is that we are in a much stronger position during the trade negotiations. The previous agreement would have left us in a state of powerless limbo (The Backstop) had the negotiations failed to deliver a continuation of the absence of any border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\nSo dreadful was the possibility of the Backstop, that we would have accepted almost any terms demanded by the EU in order to avoid finding ourselves in it. That danger no longer exists\nThe fly in the ointment however, is one the Agreement shares with Mrs May’s earlier effort: during the implementation period we remain subject to all EU law and jurisdiction, including any new laws -the making of which we will have been excluded from.\nIt is a risk, but on balance, I’m prepared to take it.",

He was, of course, wrong and ignorant of his own US Constitution which specifically excludes any religious bar to the office of President. It was pretty mild fare by comparison with the anti-Muslim propaganda that a number of my constituents continue to bombard me with. This is usually stuff they have picked up from dodgy websites and chain emails. In effect, they insist that the only authentic interpretation of Islam is as a totalitarian and violent ideology, ignoring the experience of over a thousand years of, for the most part, tolerant and peaceful co-existence.\nThe interaction of politics and religion has been an important factor in our own constitutional development. Lord Halifax in his Letter to a Dissenter sought to point out to Protestants opposed to the Anglican establishment, the dangers of making common cause with the papist tyrant James II, against the Church of England. Warning them that “infallibility and liberty are the two most contrary things in the world”. In this respect, returning to US politics for a moment, it is interesting to note that John F Kennedy, when he ran for president, made statements disavowing his Roman Catholicism, and insisting it would not unduly influence him as President.\nOur own nation, notwithstanding its established Protestant religion, has evolved to be perhaps the most tolerant in the world of religious diversity. Equally, the USA, despite its Constitution defining itself as a ‘Nation under God’, is also a haven of toleration and diversity. I think that this earns us the right to comment critically on regimes that are failing to protect the rights of religious minorities, whether they be Islamic states accommodating increasing conservatism, or those in Israel wanting to define it as a Jewish state, with an aggressive settler movement determined to turn Palestine into a biblical theme park.\nMost religions are benign, and all of them are a bit wacky, even my own. As Origen, one of the early church fathers pointed out ‘the more absurd it is, the more I believe it’. When it comes to the wacky stakes however, there is plenty of competition: Scientology; the Moonies; but is there anything to beat Mormonism?\nWell, perhaps Atheism?",

The reality is that when Parliament passed the regulations in December which enforce the policy of sacking unvaccinated NHS and care workers (although I voted against the provisions), we didn’t then know what we now know: Which is that risk the unvaccinated pose to patients declines after a very short period and that we have the alternative of regular lateral flow testing, which will tell, whether healthcare professionals pose a threat to their patients.\nThe vaccination doesn’t stop you catching COVID or passing it on, what it does is reduce your risk of serious illness. So, the rationale for forcing it on NHS and care staff has gone.\nThe Government’s own analysis is that that 73,000 NHS staff and 38,000 domiciliary care workers will leave as a consequence of the policy of enforced vaccination.\nWe have no plan for how to replace them and there is already a critical shortage of domiciliary care workers, so much so that beds are unnecessarily occupied in hospitals because care providers have insufficient staff to care for them if they were allowed to go home.\nThe Government should seek to persuade NHS and domiciliary care workers to be vaccinated, not threaten to sack them.

I want to assure you that the NHS will always be free at the point of use, and any proposed reforms will aim to continue to improve the quality of these services and patient outcomes.\nAs we recover from the pandemic, it is right and necessary that our health and care services are at the forefront. The pandemic underlined not only the dedication and skill of those in this sector, but also the necessity of a broader, more integrated health and care system. I welcome the intention to develop more joined up, integrated care between the NHS, Local Government and other partners including the voluntary and community sector, which will be vital in tackling the factors that affect the long-term sustainability of patient services. The Bill will make permanent some of the innovations we have seen as a result of the pandemic. I understand that these proposed reforms will also include proper accountability mechanisms, and give patients and the public the confidence that they are receiving the best care from their healthcare system.\nThe measures set out in the Health and Care Bill deliver on the NHS’s own proposals for reform in its Long Term Plan. I believe these proposals have been developed in consultation with key stakeholders in this sector, and I am encouraged by the preliminary positive feedback received. In particular, the comments from the former Chief Executive of NHS England, who has said that this Bill “will support our health and care services to be more integrated and innovative so the NHS can thrive in the decades to come”, are reassuring.\nDS.",

This is a vitally important document because it sets out the terms within which local planning authorities (in our case the elected New Forest District Council) must determine planning applications.\nI say it is vitally important because housing development is, by a country mile, the most common complaint that prompts constituents to contact me.\nThere is an acute housing shortage nationally, and the New Forest is no exception. Few young people, born and brought-up in this district have any prospect of being able to afford a home here either to purchase or to rent. Nevertheless, almost every significant housing development becomes the focus of local opposition. Increasingly, even though residents accept the need for more houses, they believe that proposed developments represent the sort of housing that it suits developers to build, rather than the sort that the community actually needs.\nThe new National Planning Policy Framework is designed to support the Government’s commitment to building more homes; more quickly, more beautifully and more sustainably.\nIt gives much greater scope to local planning authorities like NFDC to determine what kind of development is appropriate through their own updated local plan; to reject inappropriate development and protect the Green Belt.\nIn this respects it builds on the reforms that have been implemented incrementally since 2010, including abolishing housing targets imposed from Whitehall. Frankly, those Labour-imposed regional targets simply didn’t work. In fact, they built nothing but resentment: housebuilding fell to its lowest peacetime levels since the 1920s. By contrast, net housing supply last year was higher than any point under the last Labour government’s targets, and over 2.5 million extra homes have been delivered across England since 2010. It is just bizarre, given the evidence, that the Labour Party have announced that, were they to return to government, they would re-impose the central housing targets.\nThe new Framework was preceded by a consultation which began in December 2022 and ended in March 2033 and generated 2,600 responses.\nOne of the issues consulted upon, and about which the Government has yet to respond, was the question of implementing the power set out in the Levelling-up Act 2023 which will enable local planning authorities to decline applications from developers whose previous record has been poor.\nCurrently every planning application has to be determined entirely on its own individual merit. It is important that this new power to take into account the developer’s previous record is implemented as soon as possible. One of the reasons given by opponents of proposed housing developments is the developer’s poor record of honouring undertakings and abiding by the conditions upon which permission has been granted in the first place. Giving the promised power to planning authorities would improve public confidence in the planning system by ensuring that developers raise their game.",

The problem is not the Lords, but the Commons. The Lords are trying it on because they know that the arithmetic is very tight in the Commons, so given their lordships’ distaste for BREXIT, they think it’s worth a try.\nWere the position in the Commons robustly in support of the Government’s BREXIT policy, the Lords would not be bothering.\nThe Problem in the Commons is a direct consequence of the election last year. The PM, with a majority of only 15, didn’t think it was enough to get BREXIT through Parliament, so she asked the people for a stronger mandate, but they chose not to give her one. And that is why their Lordships believe that they have leave to gum-up the process and the negotiations.\nIn ordinary circumstances the Lords is just a revising chamber and the overwhelming majority of those legislative revisions are accepted by the Commons. If it really comes to a crunch in a row between the two houses at which neither is prepared to blink first, then ultimately all the Lords can do is delay, until the Commons forces the matter through under the provisions of the 1911 Parliament Act.\nMy email correspondents demand however, that the Lords become more democratic, by which they mean elected, as is the Senate in the USA, so that it will reflect the popular will.\nThe greatest obstacle to any such plan, and I have seen two crash in my time, is the House of Commons. Were the Lords to be elected in some way, then that democratic legitimacy would soon enough lead to the demands for real power beyond their current status as a mere revising chamber. That power could only come from the Commons: and we have no intention of giving it up.\nAs a parliamentary representative of the New Forest, the last thing I would welcome would be some peer on my turf purporting to represent the very same people as I do.\nGiven this hornets’ nest, there is little appetite in any government for investing the time and energy to try and resolve it with a reform that will command sufficient support in both houses to get it through.\nSo, given the current state of affairs, reform of the Lords, or the empty threat of it, is no solution to the wrecking amendments to the EU withdrawal bill that are currently being passed there.\nThe only remedy is to overturn the amendments when they return to the Commons.\nWill there be a majority in the Commons to do so?\nIt’s just too soon to tell.",

Dianne Abbot, Labour’s immigration spokeswoman has, in effect, called for the abandonment of measures to identify and remove illegal immigrants, including the closure of the detention centres.\nI hope that the distinction between ‘compliant’ and ‘hostile’ is just semantics. I regard it as vitally important to both have effective immigration controls and to enforce them rigorously. Not to do so, sends a very powerful signal to hundreds of thousands of other potential illegal immigrants that UK is a soft touch and that it is open house.\nAs for the suggestion that now is the time to abandon our legal immigration reduction target, it is folly.\nEven though we have little experience of it in the New Forest, nevertheless, for years the level of immigration was the top concern in my postbag. Although that concern has abated somewhat, it has not gone away, and if mishandled by politicians it will undoubtedly return.\nEver since in the late 1970ies when Mrs Thatcher, then Leader of the Opposition, caused a furore when she referred to people feeling “swamped” by the volume of immigration, it became a subject to be treated with proper caution and sensitivity by mainstream politicians.\nSo many of my correspondents are clearly nervous about expressing their concerns and hedge their use of language fearful that by expressing their opinion they might be thought to be racially prejudiced.\nIf politicians, unwilling to provoke the opprobrium of a vociferous ‘liberal elite’, fail in their duty to address the issue, then they leave the field open to demagogues of a much less fastidious nature.\nI see no good reason to relax immigration policy at this time.\nWe live in one of the most densely populated countries and we already have an acute housing shortage.\nThe evidence that immigration boosts economic growth and genuine economic welfare is, at best, mixed.\nWe already have significant problems arising from the failure to sufficiently assimilate existing immigrant populations.\nWhilst London, our capital city, wears as a badge of honour and celebrates its ethnic diversity, and the revelation of the 2011 census that only a minority of its population (44%) is now ‘White British’, for many of our subjects this is something about which they are somewhat uneasy.\nA sensible immigration policy needs to take that unease into account. There has to be a balance to deal effectively with short term skills shortages and economic opportunities, whilst reassuring people that immigration is very much under control.",

The collective whinge by the minor parties however, is in stark contrast. They prefer to blame our electoral system, which, they claim, is ‘broken’.\nIt isn’t. On the contrary, it appears to be working properly again having malfunctioned in 2010.\nThe Anglo-Saxon voting system, now copied and used in the majority of the world’s democracies, has a beautiful and well understood simplicity: the candidate who gets the most votes wins.\nThe purpose of the system is to identify, and to reward the winner. It isn’t its purpose to try and be fair to losers; on the contrary, it disproportionately rewards winners. For example, last month the Conservatives came first with 38% of the votes cast, but were rewarded with over 50% of the parliamentary seats. The advantage of this disproportionate winner’s reward is that the successful party gets a clear majority with which it can deliver legislation and govern decisively. This is in contrast to continental electoral systems which deliver indecisive results and leave the winner scrabbling to find coalition partners and to put together a compromise programme that nobody actually voted for. They have a tendency to put parties which command broad support, at the mercy of demands for concessions from small parties with comparatively little support.\nNothing of human design is ever perfect, and our own electoral system failed to deliver decisive results in 1973 and 2010. It is a matter of some satisfaction that last month it appears to have started delivering properly once again.\nThere is nothing new about the disproportionate winner’s reward delivered by our voting system. This feature is at the heart of why so many of us approve of it, and some disapprove of it. What the critics appear to have forgotten is that we rehearsed all these arguments and came to a decisive conclusion to stick with our Anglo-Saxon system in a referendum only 4 years ago in 2011. The winning margin was a whopping 70% to 30%, enough to settle the question for a generation.\nUK politics is not a promising place for parties who want to occupy a niche.

  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_cycling-to-save-petrol/content_645.html": "Last Tuesday evening, in an effort to conserve fuel. I decided to cycle to a meeting in Bransgore despite the filthy weather. On my return journey, having cycled up the long hill between Bransgore and Burley, I changed to high ration to make the most of the downhill sprint. Alas, a vehicle coming up the hill in the opposite direction, failed to dip its headlights and momentarily dazzled me: so that I slipped into the rough edge of the road; went head over heels; gashed my leg through waterproofs and trousers, and ended so heavily bruised I’ve been limping ever since. So, ended my contribution to easing the current fuel crisis.\nI have received a number of representations from frustrated constituents still awaiting HGV tests that were suspended during the lockdown. Apparently, there are 40,000 tests in the queue.\nIn addition I’ve had quite a correspondence from former HGV drivers explaining why they gave it up and what it would take to persuade them to return. They tell a similar tale: they say that the terms and conditions deteriorated to such an extent over the last decade or so, that it was no longer sufficient compensation for the long and anti-social hours that they put up with. They tell me that the hourly rate of pay has halved. They put this down to the influx of foreign drivers who were prepared to do the work for less money and with poorer conditions.\nMany of those foreign drivers returned home during the lockdown and there is no pressure for them to return, given that there is plenty of work for them in Europe which is itself short of some 400,000 HGV drivers.\nNotwithstanding, the demand of the employers is that visa restrictions be lifted to encourage the return of the foreign drivers. This cannot be the answer because it was the influx of foreign drivers that drove down wages and conditions in the first place, causing our own HGV drivers to retire or look for more rewarding work elsewhere.\nIn a free market a shortage of a particular skill will drive up the wage paid for it, and that higher wage will attract workers prepared to acquire the particular skill so much in demand, therefore addressing the shortage. To be fair, this is what has been happening recently. There are many reports of significantly higher wages being offered and even substantial ‘golden hellos’ being paid to newly recruited drivers. Over time this will address the shortage…but we don’t have time, the crisis is now…so bring back foreigners immediately!\nAs it happens the shortage of HGV drivers has been a minor irritant for months. Many of us will have noticed the odd fuel pump out of commission more often than usual. It was no more than an inconvenience, and one that we could certainly have lived with. What made it intolerable was our own behaviour rushing to the pumps to fill up unnecessarily.\nSo, was the scare of severe shortage deliberately engineered, in order to create the panic buying, as a way of forcing the Government to lift visa restrictions on foreign HGV drivers which employers had unsuccessfully been demanding for months?",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_paying-doctors/content_186.html": "Junior doctors work seven days per week, they are the backbone of medical care in hospitals every day, at weekends and at night. I have had a number of emails from them complaining that, under the provisions of the proposed new contract, they will have to work harder and for less pay. I assure them that they won’t – that is an absolute guarantee that no-one will lose out compared to their current contract.\nThis Government was elected on a mandate to deliver a 7-day NHS and ensure care is the same quality across the week. At present, if you are admitted to hospital at the weekend your chances of dying are 15% higher. Illness does not take weekends off, it is essential that we so organise the NHS so that it doesn’t either.\nChanging this means reforming the current contracts – put in place by Labour (for junior doctors in 2000, and for consultants in 2003). Last week in the Commons the Government guaranteed that not a single junior doctor will see their pay cut compared to their current contract. On the contrary, they will get same pay as they receive under their current contracts; but with a reduction in the maximum number of hours that can be worked in any one week (in order to end the unsafe practice of tired doctors treating patients).\nThis is not a cost cutting exercise. We are not seeking to save a penny from the junior doctors’ pay bill. We want the new contract to improve patient safety by better supporting a seven day NHS. For junior doctors, this means some increase in hours which aren’t payable as overtime, but backed up with a significant increase in basic pay.\nOur ambition for the NHS to be the safest health care system in the world, is underpinned by reducing, not increasing, the number of hours junior doctors work each week.\nThis is a fairer deal for doctors. The new contract will mean no junior doctor is required to work more than an average of 48 hours per week, with tougher limits on unsafe hours including a new maximum working week of 72 hours, and a new maximum shift pattern of four consecutive night shifts and five long day shifts, compared with the current contract which permits more than 90 hours a week, 7 consecutive night shifts and 6 long day shifts. It will also better reward pay progression based on achievement and experience.\nTo threaten strike action is bizarre in the circumstances. Beyond the present dispute however, doctors should think about the profound implications of such a step, and the consequences for patient safety. By adopting the mores of the unionised factory shop floor, thet would abandon the standards of their profession.\nIt is time that the British Medical Council got back to the negotiating table, and inform its members of what really is on offer.",

Existing and thriving ecosystems, which also have the advantage of being beautiful to behold, are -at truly eye watering expense- being destroyed by large earth moving machines and hundreds of thousands of tons of clay. This clay is shipped in by the lorry load from nowhere near the New Forest (something that would never have been allowed in the past). All this, for such a marginal benefit, and that only if the schemes worked as the theorists predicted. The problem is that they don’t: there are already any number where the alien clay has simply been washed away as pollution, with mounting repair bills.\nWhy in the face of this evidence and expert ecological reviews which have panned the scheme, do the Forestry Commission persist?\nThe New Forest National Park authority is also a supporter of the restorations. As a consequence I do not believe that it is proper that it should be allowed to determine the planning application for the largest and most controversial scheme at Latchmoore. Rather worryingly, constituents have written to me to complain that the Park Authority has wrongly categorised objections to the proposal. Apparently, objections from ecologists and conservation organisations which clearly opposed the scheme, have been designated as ‘Neutral’: cock-up, or what?\nI have written to the Secretary of State asking him to call in the planning application.\nWhy have Natural England allowed this destruction to proceed?\nIt is the organisation with a statutory duty to ensure that these sites of special scientific interest, some of which enjoy the highest levels of protected status, are preserved. I have written to ministers asking why Natural England gave the go ahead without first observing its own clearly stated rules by ordering an ‘appropriate assessment’ of the impact.\nThen, a brown envelope gets dumped anonymously on my doorstep containing a printed email chain dating back to 2008 when the scheme was cooked up to secure EU funds and avoid the normal public expenditure rules which ought to have prevented them getting it. The Official Verderer even asks in an email for an indemnity from Natural England in case the ruse is exposed by an audit and the money has to be paid back.\nConspiracy theory or what?\nI’ve handed the emails over to the National Audit Office.",

  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_category_ds-blog_page_26/content_707.html": "From the very outset of the pandemic the objective of the Government’s policy has been to ‘protect the NHS’ from being overwhelmed with more hospital admissions than could be accommodated. The political imperative was to avoid the scenes of chaos at hospitals that we witnessed in Lombardy last February.\nFor this reason the restrictions were placed on human contact in order to reduce the rate of infection and so to slow the pace of hospital admissions. Stating the obvious, these restrictions have come at an enormous economic and social cost, so it is vital that they are lifted as soon as possible.\nWhen to lift them has to be a political decision. Yet, over recent days a number of the Government’s scientific advisors have been speaking in public about the need to maintain restrictions to the end of the year and even beyond.\nThey need to be reminded that the main effort of the entire policy is not to eradicate the disease, but it is to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed.\nThe key issue, is to identify the point in the progress in the vaccination programme where a sufficient proportion of the most vulnerable groups (which, if infected, are more likely to be hospitalised) have been vaccinated so as to reduce the risk to the NHS to an acceptable level. The job of the scientists to model the data in an attempt to match vaccination levels with the potential for hospital admissions.\nIt is for politicians to consider the result of these deliberations, and to balance the risk of lifting the restrictions against the social and economic costs of keeping them in place.\nScientists have a legitimate point of view, but it is exactly that: only a point of view.\nFailed Lockdowns\nIn my speech in Parliament in on 30th December in opposition to the previous tightening of restrictions (now overtaken by the all-England lock-down) I identified a need for competitive sources of expertise on which the Government could rely, even if only to frame the right questions to put to its current scientific advisors on SAGE -which suffers from all the disadvantages of decision-making by committee.\nThat speech has provoked a welcome email response from scientists from all disciplines, and in particular from some of our most eminent statisticians and mathematicians. They have sent me their analyses challenging the orthodoxy with which we are daily presented.\nIt is of some reassurance to know that you are not alone, and that that your stance is supported by credible experts. This is especially the case as the public debate has become more strident and toxic: The derision with which dissident professors have been treated in the media is itself a form of censorship.\nTwo things are clear. First, the last 12 months have been by no means exceptional in terms of total UK deaths. This is not, in any way, to fail to recognise the suffering of people mourning those who have died, but it does raise questions about the accuracy of recording any death within 28 days of a positive Covid test as being a Covid death.\nIf one accepts the accuracy and validity of the figures for Covid deaths, then it follows that 10 months of lockdowns have failed to reduce them. The Lancet published an evaluation of lockdown policy across governments and of varying severities, here is the conclusion:\n‘Increased mortality per million was significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence and per capita gross domestic product…. Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per million people’\nIn plain language, lockdowns didn’t impact on Covid deaths, neither did mass testing. Yet these are the two of the baskets into which we have placed most of our eggs.\nSetting aside the question of deaths, the main effort has always been to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed by the number of hospital admissions. As these have risen sharply over the last couple of weeks it is further testimony to the failure of lockdowns as a policy.\nFrom the outset a number of us have argued that a lockdown merely postpones the progress of the disease: the moment social isolation measures are eased, then the disease accelerates until a further lockdown is ordered. Yet this failing policy comes at an enormous social and economic cost which will scar our collective life for a decade.\nA sensible alternative would have been to identify the vulnerable groups most likely, if infected, to be hospitalised and incentivise their isolation (bluntly: assist them and pay them to isolate). This would have been neither easy nor inexpensive, but it might well have delivered a manageable level of hospital admissions with very much less damaging social and economic consequences.\nWe expect now to be rescued by vaccines, vindicating the Government’s strategy of suppressing the virus until vaccines became available.\nI would hope that the failure of lockdowns however, would be a lesson that we have learnt for the future, but the way that the critics of lockdowns have been silenced, derided and presented as mavericks, is hardly encouraging.\nOrdered by Dr Heinz Kiosk\nRegular readers of this column may recall that, looking forward at New Year, I often refer to my favourite reading: The Coffee Table Book of Doom. Here is a flavour from the advertising blurb:\n“…with the apocalypse at hand, don’t fret about dying uninformed. The Coffee Table Book of Doom is a revelatory, brilliantly funny, superbly illustrated and erudite compendium of all the 27 doom-laden horsemen we need to worry about – personal doom, gender erosion, asteroid impact, pandemics, super storms, sexual ruin – and much more besides.”\nSo, this year we actually had the pandemic.\nStrangely however, despite a prediction of 500.000 deaths, an examination of the Office for National Statistics website shows that 2020 Spring/Winter deaths were far from exceptional over the last quarter of a century or so, and that the number of deaths have often been higher.\nFor years commentators will pick over the measures that we took to control the virus and history will judge. Even if I am ultimately proved wrong in the sceptical stance that I have taken, I believe the questions that I asked, and which have remained largely unanswered, have been the right ones.\nCorrespondents tell me to be silent because that I am unqualified to comment on science. I am sensitive to the criticism because it is true: I never got beyond O levels in 1973, indeed I failed Chemistry (having caused mayhem in the practical by using a 5 molar solution of sulphuric acid rather than a .05 molar solution, or something like that anyway. Maths was always my weakness, although I did acquire a reputation as a boffin during a residential accountancy training course. One evening, a delegation of students came to my dormitory to see if I had managed to solve the simultaneous equation with which they were all having such difficulty. They found me relaxing with Jane Austen’s Persuasion. I cast my eye over the equations and immediately came up with the solution. They looked at me in awe. I’ve never been able to account for it, perhaps just a complete fluke. In any event, it was to no purpose as I had decided that there had to be an easier way of making a living and was already planning my escape.)\nWe cannot allow ourselves to be led by experts. They need to make their method and their conclusions understandable and persuade us of their validity. We cannot have Doctor Heinz Kiosk ordering us about because he alone understands that it is for our own good. I fear that this is what has in fact happened throughout this pandemic. Ministers, against their natural inclinations, have followed advice to introduce restrictive measures with devastating consequences. I believe that they were ‘bounced’ by science and data-modelling that they did not understand and lacked the ability to establish its validity. That’s why I’ve advocated a competitive set of advisors to, at the very least, arm ministers with the right questions to ask.\nOf Course, I acknowledge the possibility that the authors of the latest dire warnings and lock-downs may turn out be right, but it is prudent to be sceptical. Acceptance and reluctance to challenge are the worst responses for a politician.\nThe temptation is to remain silent for fear of revealing ignorance. I remember attending a presentation by a think-tank recommended by David Cameron’s strategy guru, Steve Hilton. I went with Greg Clark, now Chairman of the Commons Science & Technology Select Committee, who has a brain the size of a planet. It was complete gobbledygook to me. What a relief when we left and Greg turned to me and said “I have absolutely no idea what that was about”.\nAgain, I recall attending a lecture on space and time by an eminent scientist who raised the possibility of the same object being in two places at one time. When he illustrated this with a table, pointing to one leg ‘here’ and then the other leg ‘there’. I knew immediately I had wasted an evening.\nRemember it was not the little boy’s courage that revealed that the Emperor was not wearing any clothes, rather it was naiveté.\nSpeech in the Commons\n7.25pm 30 Dec 2020\nThat the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (All Tiers) (England) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2020 (S.I., 2020, No. 1646), dated 24 December 2020, a copy of which were laid before this House on 29 December, be approved.\nThis House legislated explicitly for specific arrangements to govern the celebration of Christmas, and no sooner than the House had risen itself for Christmas, the Government, by ministerial fiat, changed those arrangements. We are asked this evening to give retrospective legislative approval to the changes that they made. We are in the absurd position of being asked to vote for the ghost of Christmas past. Sometimes in a democracy, process has an importance.\nI am constantly—daily—confronted by individuals and businesses facing ruin, notwithstanding the huge investment that they made in covid-secure premises and procedures. What we have never had, and what we have always been asking for, is the cost-benefit analysis that the Government made on each of the restrictive measures that make up the menu of their tier system.\nI do not for one moment question the motives of Ministers. I do, however, question their ability, in exactly the way that I question my own ability.\nWhen the House rose, the lobby of Government scientific advisers—a lobby, we should remember, that had already publicly expressed their frustration that their earlier strictures on how Christmas should be celebrated had not been fully taken on board by the Government—announced that they had discovered a new strain of the disease so much more transmissible than the earlier one. They bounced the Government. Whilst I have to accept, of course, the possibility that they may be right, but I know this: were I presented by such a lobby of eminent scientists—eminent people leading in their field—and told that they had discovered this new emergency, and that so many more people were going to die, and unless I did what they said, I would be responsible for their deaths, I would find great difficulty in having the wherewithal to identify and ask the right questions to be sure that they were on the money, or 100 miles from it.\nWhat I would certainly want, and what I believe the Government need, is an alternative source of expertise—a competitive source of expertise—particularly statisticians leading in their fields, who would be able to furnish me, to arm me, to arm Ministers, with the right questions to ask about the validity of the modelling and the data. It can only improve the decision-making process.\nBut what is really galling in all this is then to hear on the airwaves Professor Ferguson being interviewed, giving his wisdom to the nation once again, to all intents and purposes as if he were still a key Government adviser. I do hope that the Minister winding up the debate will be able to assure us that that is most certainly not the case.\nI was always rather jealous of Poole, Christchurch and Bournemouth, because our infection rate in the New Forest was substantially lower than theirs, but they turned out to be in tier 2 and we were in tier 3. Now we are all together in tier 4.\nMy right hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that we are now in tier 4, but in statutory instrument No. 1646, which was laid before this House on 29 December, we were in tier 2. Today—one day later—we are in tier 4. Is that not a mockery?\nThe reality is this. These are the questions that my constituents put to me, and I am reduced to saying, “It’s one of life’s great mysteries.” The decision-making process is entirely opaque. That is why I voted against it when I had the chance.\nEU Trade Deal\nIn the second election campaign of 1974, the Labour party’s manifesto offered the prospect of a referendum on our continued membership of the Common Market, which we had joined without a plebiscite and only on the strength of Parliament passing The European Communities Act 1972.\nEnoch Powell, a former Conservative minister, urged Conservatives to vote Labour in that election in order to be able to take advantage of its referendum offer. I was very tempted by Powell’s advice. In the end however, I didn’t take it, but when Labour won, I was consoled by the prospect that we would -as a consequence, have a referendum.\nWhen the referendum came in 1975 I vigorously supported the ‘No’ campaign. Alas, I was on the losing side, but that’s democracy.\nFor years previously the UK had been trying to join the Common Market in order to benefit from the free trade advantages that would accrue to the significant proportion of our trade with it’s members. Our government’s enthusiasm was based on economic gain, and our politicians persuaded themselves that the Treaty of Rome, to which we would have to accede, did not really mean what it said about evolving towards a political ‘ever closer union’.\nOur earlier attempts to join were thwarted by General de Gaulle, who did not want the UK to enjoy the same competitive advantage in the Market as France. The Irony is that whilst de Gaulle was the brake on our joining, he was also the brake on the reality of ‘ever closer union’. The end of his presidential tern in 1969 opened the way to a successful prospect for serious negotiations on UK accession, but it also gave renewed impetus towards the creation of the European Union.\nThis trajectory was already obvious to those MPs who voted against the European Communities Act 1972 and rejected Prime Minister Edward Heath’s assertion that membership entailed “no essential loss of national sovereignty”.\nThe Common Market, then the EEC, then the EU evolved in exactly the way we had foreseen and warned in the 1975 referendum campaign. I joined the Campaign for an Independent Britain and I was never reconciled to our membership, notwithstanding its economic benefits. I was not however, an enthusiast for a second referendum, having been on the losing side in 1975 and I feared that the experience would be repeated. Nevertheless, when the second referendum came in 2016, I campaigned even more vigorously than in 1975, addressing 15 public meeting across the South East of England. I was surprised and delighted by the result, even though it ended my ministerial career.\nSo, how will I vote on our newly negotiated trade deal with the EU?\nWell, before deciding I will want to have the chance to thoroughly digest it which, as I write, I have not yet had the opportunity to do, but here are the principles on which I will decide: First, I have to acknowledge the advantage for free trade arrangements with our closest and largest market, it was this that drew us into joining in the first place and reverting to tariffs and quotas will be significantly to our disadvantage.\nSecond, trading advantage however, must not be secured at the price of our sovereignty, we cannot allow ourselves any longer to be governed by people whom we did not elect and cannot remove.\nNevertheless, any trade deal comes at a price, there are trade-offs that have to be made and we have to make an assessment of the balance of advantage to be had.\nIf the price of this new trade deal is to be paid principally in fish, then that is a price I am, at least, certainly prepared to consider.\nPro-Vax\nI was interviewed for a documentary about movements opposed to Coronavirus regulations and any kind of coercion in the vaccination programme, to be broadcast in January.\nI have voted against coronavirus regulations, and am opposed any suggestion of coercion in the vaccination programme, as will have been clear by my earlier contributions to this column.\nThe Programme’s producer showed me a video by an organisation which raised questions about vaccination which included extracts from a speech I made in the Commons. She asked me if I had previously known about the video or if my permission had been sought. Well, I didn’t know, but I couldn’t object: proceedings in parliament are everyone’s property. Overall, the video was, despite a rather sinister voice-over, not on the loopier end of the Anti-Vax spectrum.\nNow, I don’t want to be offensive, but clearly, whilst most are sane enough, some of the anti-vax emails that I get are from constituents who are clearly deranged, some others are just a bit odd.\nThere is a spectrum: belief that the vaccination is an excuse to inject us with microchips to control our subsequent behaviour, is obviously at the nuttier end. Where expressions of concern about the speed at which vaccines have been tested and approved, come at the other end.\nTo be fair the ‘normal to nutty’ proportions do not differ significantly between anti-vax emailers and those who email me on any other subject, or indeed those who take the trouble to write to me.\nI am not ‘anti-vax’. As a child, my father’s occupation took me to all sorts of remote places, as a soldier I served where there were issues with biological weapons, as a minister I visited some of the world’s poorest and most conflicted places. Consequently, I have been vaccinated against almost every medical condition, perhaps with the exception of rigor mortis.\nOn the contrary, I see vaccination as the escape clause from our current enforced confinement with all its devastating economic consequences: The more people who are vaccinated the better, and the sooner the better.\nThe thrust of the interview however, was to explore whether anti-vax opinions, being injurious to our public health policy, ought to be censored on social media and any other platform.\nI am deeply nervous about extent to which we allow the ‘tech giants’, or any other agency, to censor views of which they ( and we) disapprove.\nI believe in freedom of expression, and that there is no right of ‘not to being offended’. Equally, we are under no obligation to respect opinions with which we disagree, we have every right to argue robustly against them.\nAnd that is the proper course with the anti-vax movement: not to silence them, but to defeat them by exposing the falsehood of their claims.\nCurrently most of my emails are from people wanting to be vaccinated immediately, and who believe I can pull strings to get them to the front of the queue. Alas, I can’t, but I understand their enthusiasm.\nMore on Vaccines\nlast week, in this column, I explored a number of questions surrounding explicit and implicit coercive pressure to receive Covid-19 Vaccinations.\nI can understand the enthusiasm from some industries to open up again -in particular hospitality (but by no means exclusively) – so much so that they might advertise service provision exclusively to vaccinated patrons.\nIt would make no scientific sense however: None of the vaccines that are available, or are about to become available have been tested with respect to their ability to reduce transmission. They have only been tested on their ability to reduce the severity of the recipient’s reaction to a dose of the virus. So, the rationale for having the vaccination is to protect yourself, we do not know if it will protect others from you.\nNotwithstanding the irrationality of excluding non-vaccinated patrons from premises, does our respect for the property rights of proprietors nevertheless extend to allowing them to exercise their right to exclude any customers, however irrational: I don’t think so. As a society we have moved beyond such an elevated view of the rights of property. For years now, equality legislation has constrained the rights of commercial undertaking from discriminating against categories of customers of whom they may disapprove. The unvaccinated should not be so excluded either.\nThe vaccination process is going to be a long haul until a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated to afford us ‘herd immunity’. I suspect it may well take until the summer or longer. So, I do nor depart from the position that I originally took, and still urge on the Government: Namely, that the virus is not particularly dangerous to anyone outside the groups with specific vulnerabilities, so it would have been much more proportionate to have designed measures to protect them, rather than to have imposed measures on everyone with truly devastating economic and other consequences.\nThe statistical basis upon which the most damaging restrictions were made have always, in my opinion, been highly suspect. Now government itself has had to recognise that decisions were made on an insecure foundation. On 30 October the Office for National Statistics reported that infection had doubled between 2nd October, and 17 October -from 4.89 infected people per 10,000 to 9.52 infected people per 10,000. It was on this alarming basis that a second national lockdown was imposed upon us. Well, they have now revised that estimate of 17 Oct right back down, and that the rate never went above 6.62 people per 10,000 and that wasn’t until well into the lockdown on 12 November.\nVaccination Passports\nLast month it was reported that the Secretary of State for Health, whilst being interviewed, refused to rule out the possibility of compulsory vaccination for Coronavirus. This week the newly appointed minister with special responsibility for the vaccine programme suggested instead, that having the vaccine would be a ‘passport’ to being able to do things that might otherwise be denied -such as visiting a pub, cinema, or using public transport.\nFor months worried constituents have been contacting me to voice their fears that vaccination would be compulsory. I have responded by saying that they should not worry because it is unthinkable.\nUnder existing law it would constitute an assault: So primary legislation in Parliament would be required to enable it, and that in my estimate a majority would not be found for such a radical departure. It would set a worrying precedent for other vaccines, medicines and medical procedures.\nI expect however, that the concept of a vaccination certificate being used as a passport to freedoms and opportunities which would otherwise be denied, might be more palatable -superficially at least.\nIt might be done by statute setting out what may or may not be done without having had the vaccination. Or it might be left to the discretion of operators and proprietors whether to admit non-vaccinated patrons to their venues and services.\nIt raises an interesting philosophical question which is by no means new: Are our rights fundamental and absolute, or are they to be balanced by our responsibilities to society at large through some legislative process, democratic or otherwise?\nIf you take the latter view you might conclude that a citizen has a responsibility be vaccinated to protect the community as a whole, and if that responsibility is not accepted, then it would be reasonable to withhold rights and freedoms.\nI have often had to produce my Yellow Fever vaccination certificate to enter those countries where it is a legal requirement.\nThere does seem to me however, to be something repugnant about being coerced into having a medical procedure, it would certainly be a departure from long established limits.\nThere is however, a practical solution without troubling the philosophers. The herd immunity that vaccination promotes can be achieved with vaccination rates that fall well short of everyone having had the jab. We should be able to make the vaccine effective whilst tolerating the non-cooperation of conscientious objectors.\nOverwhelmingly, most of us will have the jab because we recognise that it is in our own self-interest, as well as the interests of everyone else.\nAs I said in the Commons, there are ways of promoting the vaccine without any need to coerce: line up the PM, ministers and all their loved ones to take it first, demonstrating the confidence of our rulers in its safety. Second, mount a public information campaign, fronted by our most popular celebrities and personalities.\nThe last thing you should contemplate is coercion of any kind. Nothing could be more calculated to play into the hands of the conspiracy theorists. It would end horribly with public disorder on a scale with which we have hitherto been relatively unfamiliar.\nHappily, it appears that the minister who suggested vaccination as ‘passport’ appears to have been slapped down, but I’ll remain vigilant.\nCutting Aid\nI was the Minister for International Development who shepherded the Act, which placed a statutory duty on government to pay 0.7% of GDP in Official Development Assistance, through all its Commons stages.\nIt is now to be replaced which is particularly worrying because, if the full payment is not made in any year, the Act only requires a statement from the Secretary of State in both Houses explaining why.\nTo amend or repeal the Act would appear to indicate a much longer-term intention to set aside the commitment.\nI do not doubt that this measure is popular, I have had any number of complaints about overseas aid, even before we met the 0.7% commitment and protected it in statute.\nMost people consider such aid to be charity and, accordingly, believe that it should ‘begin at home’ (thereby completely misinterpreting the meaning of the phrase, which was coined as a challenge to people who flaunted their philanthropy in public whilst treating their family and employees with meanness).\nCharity is something you give away freely without any expectation of return.\nInternational aid is not charity, rather it is an investment we make in the expectation that we may prosper and trade in a more stable and secure world, less prone to insecurity and waves of migration.\nIt is also a ‘soft power’ by which we project our influence abroad. In this respect it is much more versatile and deployable than our investment in our military capability to project power.\nI do not doubt that our retention of a seat at the UN security council owes more nowadays to the fact that we are the World’s second largest donor, rather than that we remain a nuclear power.\nThere are many things I would wish to see reformed about our aid effort. Jus for starters, it needs to be even more focussed on economic development and ability to trade: when I was the minister I would constantly remind people that ‘aid is all about jobs’.\nBut we are in queer street: the Chancellor has told us that our Economic crisis is only just beginning. We are at greater risk of further economic shocks because we are borrowing so much. George Osborne used to constantly remind us of the need to ‘fix the roof while the Sun is shining’, well now the roof’s been blown away.\nSo, protecting any item of public expenditure comes down to a question of priorities. I know most of my constituents will disagree, but I believe that as we re-establish ourselves as an independent power outside the EU and seek to increase our influence in the counsels of the World, then cutting our International Development Aid is a wrong priority.\nWas Churchill racist?\nI’ve had a spurt of anti-Islamism vitriol by email demanding to know why the Government hasn’t been voluble in support of President Macron’s campaign to protect the French secular state from terrorism, and from the growth of an increasingly separated Islamic culture and practice.\nFrankly, the Government has quite enough on its plate at present than to provide a running commentary on what is happening in France. I take the point however, and I share their President’s concerns.\nTypically, my correspondents go on to elaborate, claiming the expertise and knowledge to pronounce that Islam is, of necessity, an inherently violent creed. Here I think they are quite mistaken. Of course, its history is quite as violent as the history of any other religion, but overwhelmingly it has been characterised by contemplative sufism.\nMy correspondents quote blood-curdling passages claiming authentic interpretation from the Koran. Well, as a Bible-believing Christian I’m quite able to quote any number of much more blood-curdling passages from the Bible -so, straight off the top of my head, what about the savagery meted out to Achan (Joshua 7 & 8): Stoned to death with his whole clan, including women, children and livestock when it was discovered he had hidden some booty from the destruction of Jericho, sufficiently annoying God so that he denied victory to the Israelites in their first attempt to capture the City of Ai. Having sorted Achan, the Israelites had a second shot at Ai, resulting in complete destruction -including every living thing within the city.\nOn the face of it we are supposed to approve of these actions, after all, surely Achan, his family, their animals, and subsequently the all inhabitants of Ai ‘had it coming’. I rather think however, that there is a subtly in the account, and ‘between the lines’ the narrator is asking us “…and do you really believe that this was the will of God?”.\nI am not qualified to imagine what subtleties there may be in the Koran, I leave that to real Islamic scholars, rather than trust my correspondents.\nAs to the violent history of Islam. I wonder if it measures up to the blood- lust of Christendom: Crusades, pogroms, our wars of religion including the Inquisition, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, the Defenestration of Prague, the burnings during the reign of Bloody Mary, and on and on.\nSecular religions, Fascism and Communism, have taken an even greater toll.\nWhen my correspondents go on to claim that we are harbouring an alien and increasingly dangerous religious community in our midst I like to draw their attention to the contribution of Indian soldiers made to the defence of the Empire and to point to their WWI memorial in Barton on Sea in my constituency. Then, last week, I came across this magnificent passage whilst re-reading Churchill’s history of WWII\n“…the glorious heroism and martial qualities of the Indian troops who fought in the Middle East, who defended Egypt, who liberated Abyssinia, who played a grand part in Italy, and who, side by side with their British Comrades, expelled the Japanese from Burma, stand forth in brilliant light.\nThe loyalty of the Indian Army to the King-Emperor, the proud fidelity to their treaties of the Indian Princes, the unsurpassed bravery of Indian Soldiers and officers, both Moslem and Hindu, shine forever in the annals of war.”\nThat is something to be proud of, and to continue to build upon. The irony is that some are now denouncing Churchill as a racist.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 24\n- 25\n- 26\n- 27\n- 28\n- …\n- 59\n- Next Page »",

Constituents write to me in frustration demanding action without specifying what action they have in mind. I sometimes ask what it is that they can suggest.\nI never had much faith in the prospect of the French stopping the flow even though we are paying them to do so. They could if they had the will, but they have other priorities. I suppose we should be grateful for the 30% of crossing that we estimate that they are preventing.\nNeither had I any faith in training provided to Border Force to enable them to turn boats back. Despite that training, they have proved most reluctant to do it. I can understand their reluctance, as would the public when the bodies of children start being washed ashore.\nThe crossings, which are uncomfortable, dangerous and very expensive, will only be deterred when the probability of swift deportation makes the endeavour uneconomic. Currently the barriers to deportation make it a near certainty that those who are successful in making the crossing will get to stay.\nThe Immigration and Borders Bill, currently going through Parliament, is designed to address the barriers to deportation and remove the possibility of endless appeals -so recently exploited by our latest suicide bomber.\nIt does still leave however, the problem of to where we can deport our failed asylum cases to. I spent some time as a minister trying to persuade foreign governments to adopt a more helpful attitude to taking back their own citizens, but without much success.\nThe bill will make it an imprisonable offence to enter the UK unlawfully, which will include crossing the channel in a dingy, but I am sceptical that we will fill our prisons with migrants. Even were we to, we would still face the difficulties of deportation once sentences have been served.\nThe real hope that I see in the Bill is its enabling provisions that will empower the Government to set up off-shore processing centres. The prospect of being swiftly removed to an overseas processing facility for an indefinite period will be a powerful disincentive to undertaking the expensive and dangerous crossing.\nThis is the solution that has worked effectively for Australia. We must not imagine however, that implementation will be swift or straightforward. It will certainly be controversial and there will be plenty of voices that will denounce the policy as inhumane. It will also prove expensive: Any country that is prepared to host our off-shore processing will want to be richly rewarded.\nDespite these difficulties, I see no alternative than to persevere. Our current problem is bound to get worse. Potential migrants watching from so many less eligible countries have seen the social media output from those that have successfully made the crossing, which will encourage them to follow.\nThe relative ease with which it turns it turns out that the Channel can be crossed has opened a new migration route. It is vital that we close it off before climate change and instability generates a so much greater flow of migrants.",

All the high energy drink bottles, water bottles, and increasingly sophisticated muscle gel pads etc. are more likely to have come from Lycra clad cyclists (rarely does one see runners there).\nThese litter bugs are just too idle to give a moment’s thought to the consequences of what they are doing. On the other hand however, the fellow who dumped his sofa at Picket Post a fortnight or so ago, clearly went to a great deal of effort. It is a pity he didn’t have the intelligence to spot that, in all probability, it would have taken less effort to dispose of it lawfully at the municipal facility on the way to Verwood.\nWhat really gets to me are those people who assiduously bag up their dog poo and then leave the sealed bag on the ground or hanging from a bush for somebody else to deal with. Do they imagine that there is a collection service?\nAre they worried that, were they to dispose of it properly, then they would be denying some Forestry Commission employee a livelihood?\nI doubt it, I suspect they too are just idle and thoughtless.",

Our own -relatively new- Supreme Court has the quite different purpose of being the final court of appeal in determining the intent and purpose of our own common law and statute law as it applies in different situations.\nEach and every act of Parliament has the same status, we have no special constitutional laws that have a higher value. No parliament can bind its successors: Parliament can amend or repeal any law that it made previously. The Courts cannot strike down laws made in Parliament, all they can do is point to any contradiction between our laws and statutory rights. It is up to Parliament choose when and if to remedy any supposed conflict.\nThe law on abortion in the UK makes it clear that there is no general right to abortion services. On the contrary, the default position is that abortion is a criminal matter unless two doctors sign a document about the necessity of the procedure for the sake of the health and safety of the mother to be. Even then, these provisions are circumscribed by the length of the pregnancy, with abortion being permitted in only exceptional circumstances after 24 weeks.\nThese conditions were debated and decided in Parliament with the intention of balancing the needs of an expectant mother with those of a child growing in her womb. They remain controversial. The 24 week limit was last reset in 1990, since when medical science has progressed, so much so, that the life of a child prematurely outside the womb is now viable at fewer than 24 weeks. Accordingly, many will argue that the law should change to reduce the time in which abortion can take place. Equally, clinicians have presented studies indicating that the child in the womb can experience pain much earlier than was previously thought, perhaps this should be a factor in changing the law.\nThese are matters over which people argue passionately and about which there is rarely a consensus. They need to be settled in a democratic and accountable forum, which means in Parliament. We should not contemplate handing such decisions to judges.",

Alongside providing £10 billion a year to support people through our overseas aid, the UK is a global leader in refugee resettlement. As a country, between 2016 and 2019 we resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any member state of the EU.\nLet me assure you that the new Nationality and Borders Bill will allow the UK continue to resettle genuine refugees directly from places of danger and offer refugee family reunions. It will improve support for refugees to help them build their life in the UK, integrate and become self-sufficient members of society. The Bill also seeks to introduce a new temporary protection status for those who do not come directly to the UK or claim asylum without delay once here but who have, in any event, been recognised as requiring protection.\nI have always believed that resettlement is vital as a safe and legal pathway to protection for vulnerable refugees fleeing persecution. It is right that the Government continues to offer safe pathways for those in need, and I will continue to ensure that this is the case. The launch of a new global UK Resettlement Scheme will now build on the success of previous schemes and continue our proud record of resettling refugees who need our help from around the world.\nIt is also the case that refugees in the UK need to have the freedom to succeed as they settle. This means ensuring refugees have access to the tools required to become fully independent and provide for themselves and their families. This will allow refugees to be in a position to contribute and integrate into the economic and cultural life of the UK.\nIt is therefore good news that the Home Secretary has announced £14 million of funding to help newly granted refugees to integrate in the UK. This fund will pilot new approaches across the country to support newly granted refugees to learn English, move into work, access housing and build links in their local communities. Lessons learned from these pilots will inform future support available to all refugees.\nDS.",

Applying strengthened penalties will send a clear message that animal cruelty will not be tolerated and will enable our courts to take a firmer approach to cases where pets are illegally imported. The Government plans to take forward legislative measures to tackle puppy smuggling as soon as parliamentary time allows.\nThe UK has one of the most rigorous pet travel border checking regimes in the world and every dog travelling into Great Britain on approved routes has its microchip and paperwork checked to make sure they are properly vaccinated and are old enough to travel. In addition, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) consulted on proposed changes to the commercial and non-commercial movements of pets into Great Britain.\nFurther, Ministers have taken action to tackle the practice of puppy farming. Following the introduction of Lucy’s Law in 2020, everyone must now buy directly from breeders or consider adopting from rescue centres, which is a major step in stopping the illegal pet trade.

The only remarkable thing about it was that it was ever considered as a matter for secrecy.\nAs to how plausible these scenarios are, that is another matter entirely. Recent polling indicates that those wishing to remain in the EU are significantly ahead. I am a veteran on the ‘No’ campaign of 1975. I recall having a two to one lead in the polls for withdrawal, yet still losing that referendum. It is still very early days but I just do not detect the great groundswell that would be required to sustain a successful campaign to withdraw, in the face of what will be a well-funded and determined effort on the part of business and corporate interests to ensure that we remain.\nDuring the recent election campaign I was asked at the hustings how I would vote in the referendum this time around. I replied that it is too soon to tell. I remain as hostile to the EU as I was to the concept offered to us back in 1975. I do believe however, that David Cameron has earned the right to be trusted with a renegotiation. After all, he is the only British Prime Minister ever to veto an EU treaty, ever to secure a reduction in the EU budget, and ever to bring back powers previously given away to Brussels. His record is a very good one.\nDo I have any ‘red lines’ which will determine my referendum vote one way of the other?\nI would certainly want to be shot of ‘ever closer Union’ from the original Treaty of Rome. Beyond that, the things which I dislike most about the Union are not the subject of renegotiation. For example, it is the institutions of statehood like the parliament which I regard as illegitimate. I want a Europe of nation states co-operating together, and not a Europe claiming to be a state in its own right. A parliament represents a people, and I just do not believe in a European people, rather the peoples of Europe have their own parliaments to represent them.\nCounterintuitively, one of the things I like most about the EU is the principle of freedom of movement, and it is something that 1 million Britons have taken advantage of. I certainly don’t believe however, that it extends to a right to claim social security benefits anywhere in Europe.\nUltimately, this referendum, like the Great Charter of the eighteenth century, is a “knife and fork question, a bread and cheese question”: I believe that the outcome will come down to the issue of jobs; people will decide on the basis of how they think it will impact on their prosperity.\nMy own belief is that in the long term our prosperity depends upon our competitiveness, and my prejudice is that our competitiveness in international markets may be increasingly compromised by the burden of EU regulation. There is however, a rub: If we are to have continued access to the EU’s single market – which is the world’s largest free market – then, like Norway and Switzerland, we will have to abide by all the regulations anyway, but without having any voice in their making.\nWe are deluding ourselves if we believe that the referendum is going to present us with simple and easy options.",

I remain of the view that it didn’t do me any harm and, on the contrary, may have done me some good. In some cases the sharp painful rebuke made you see the error of your ways, and to abandon a path leading to nowhere. On other occasions a swift caning spared you the misery of a prolonged tedious punishment, and spared the teacher from having to supervise it too.\nWhen we complained to our parents about the injustice, they tended to the sensible view that ‘the little blighter had it coming’.\nYears later I enjoyed a short career as a teacher myself in a school where we not too infrequently used the cane.

It does however, take a lot of hard work and teachers do have an enormous amount on their plates. No doubt, there are extraordinary teachers who can quell disorder with just a stern look, but that ability is rare.\nIf punishing a pupil will involve a delayed and time-consuming administrative process, there may be a temptation to ignore the offence, perhaps to choose not to have heard a profanity, or answering-back muttered under the breath by a pupil, and so standards slip.\nYes, there are plenty of good schools, but ask yourself this question:\nOverall, have our classrooms become better ordered and disciplined, and has society at large become more polite and less violent in the years since we outlawed corporal punishment?",

Instead, they go into the government revenues with all other taxes to pay for current public expenditure. This expenditure will include pensions as well as defence, the NHS, and every other public expenditure. There is no direct read-across from the National Insurance levied, and the amount of the state pension.\nNational insurance contributions are necessary to qualify for the State Pension but they do not earn it: The State Pension is a ‘contributory benefit’.\nBecause our contributions are a percentage of our incomes, we will all make very different contributions, but qualify for the same benefit, a fixed amount of pension.\nThe tax system is complicated. There are two taxes levied on income from employment: Income Tax and National Insurance.\nWhy have two?\nWhy not simplify the tax system and just combine them into one?\nThese are questions that have occurred to several Chancellors of the Exchequer, including the current Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, who, in his last Budget, expressed his ‘aspiration’ that , when it becomes possible, to get rid of National Insurance altogether.\nThis will be a long way off because both Income Tax and National Insurance have intricate complications, making it difficult to combine them without creating a significant number of losers (including pensioners who don’t pay National Insurance).\nThe author of the current scam is a political party which is seeking to terrify voters with the false assertion that the aspiration to do away with National Insurance is, in effect, a threat to abolish the State Pension.\nThis is nonsense. There is no direct link between revenue from National Insurance and the State Pension, and here is the proof: we’ve cut National Insurance contributions by 2%, but the state pension has just increased by 8.5%, another £900, the highest increase for 30 years.",

Now however, they can get onto Facebook, Twitter or whatever, and broadcast bile to ever wider audiences.\nIn addition, as I have observed before, many people will say things whilst typing away at their laptop or mobile telephone, that they would never have dreamed of putting on paper and sending in a letter. Rather in the same way that motorists will shout at other drivers in the privacy of their own car, using language that they would be most unlikely to use in public.\nI have definitely seen the temperature rising over the last year. There is at the root an anger and frustration at the apparent unwillingness of elected politicians to implement the result of the referendum. Parliament was explicit when it passed the legislation for a referendum in 2016: it clearly stated that the future of our membership of the EU, in or out, would be decided by the voters themselves, and that Parliament would implement their decision, whichever way it went.\nSince when we have seen political parties renege from that commitment, some openly and honestly, others by a pretence.\nThe anger and frustration that this has caused is as understandable as the stridency and volume of protests, and even the threats, have become worrying.\nI am not persuaded that, as is alleged, it is the language used by politicians themselves that has set the nation alight and corroded the public discourse. We have always enjoyed robust political language in our debates. Prime Minister’s question time has, for as long as I have been in Parliament, been a popular spectacle, in a way that proceedings in foreign assemblies rarely match.\nI note that those who complained loudest about the PM’s use of language last week, were themselves amongst the worst habitual offenders.\nArgument focussed on the term ‘surrender act’ as the PM’s chosen description of the European Union Number 2 Act 2019. The reason he calls it a surrender act is because it requires him to ask for a further extension of our EU membership and to accept whatever terms the EU demands in return for that extension. ‘Surrender’ is the best description, and the reason the opposition is so angry about the language is because they know how effective it is.\nThose who want to prevent BREXIT have spotted that Boris is the last obstacle standing in their way, so absolutely everything is to be thrown at him.

The experience reinforced my prejudice that the principal problem that we face is a culture of welfare dependency.\nOur out-of-work benefits are not particularly generous by European standards and those who are dependent upon them are not, by any stretch, enjoying a ‘cushy’ lifestyle. Nevertheless, recipients grow accustomed to the life and learn to ‘get by’, particularly so, when they are relieved of the inconvenience of going out to work for a living.\nThe trends are particularly worrying amongst the young\nMore women are now out of the workforce due to sickness than those who don’t work because they are raising children. Whilst the number of young men off work due to sickness has trebled in the last decade and three quarters of them indicate that they have no interest in finding a job.\nThe economically inactive population of working age now stands at a record 10 million.\nThe bill for sickness benefits is currently running at £65 billion annually, and is predicted to rise to £100 billion by 2030.\nThis has to be set against a background of several years with vacancies at record, or near-record, levels and enormous pressure from employers on government to ease immigration control in order to enable them to recruit from overseas.\nSome 40% of those claiming sickness benefits state that mental health issues are their reason for doing so. Yet nothing could be better for mental health than the stimulation of work, with a consequent improvement in self-esteem.\nMinisters have undertaken to bring forward reforms to the welfare system this year with the intention of encouraging recipients back into the workforce. We will have to wait and see what they propose. I did however, try and steer the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in the direction of the work of Jeremy Bentham and his utilitarian principle of ‘the greater good for the greatest number’. I do not believe that society can, or should, carry a growing cost of an increasing proportion of its members who are not working.\nThe most effective way to achieve this would be a return to Bentham’s policy of ‘less eligibility’: that life on benefits must be less eligible than the meanest form of independent existence, so as to discourage anyone from choosing to live on benefits.\nHow could we implement such a policy without cruelty and a return to the Victorian workhouse?\nI think we need to ensure that, as far a possible, welfare rights have to be balanced with responsibilities. We need a system of ‘workfare’ where benefits are paid in return for socially useful work. This would be good for the self-esteem of many claimants with mental health problems and encourage them to take a further step towards paid employment.",

We had a perfectly civil conversation but, alas, no meeting of minds. We were proof however, that you can agree to disagree about important matters without any unpleasantness whatsoever.\nTypically, I get half a dozen letters or so, each year on this subject. We did, readers may recall, have a referendum on the question back in 2011 (it was the price demanded by the Liberal democrats for entering a Coalition government with the Conservatives). We voted by 70% to 30% to keep our existing electoral system. I remain of the view that it settled the matter for a generation. I am not inclined to reopen the question in what is a crowded political agenda.\nThere is no perfect voting system. Each methodology has advantages and disadvantages. The principal weakness of our current system is that it often disproportionately rewards the winner, granting them a numerical majority in Parliament despite only getting more votes than other parties, but not a majority of all the votes cast. Equally, I would argue that this is its principal strength: It ensures that, more often than not, the party that got more votes than any other, forms the Government.\nThe difficulty with more proportional systems is that they tend to lead to permanent coalitions which hand disproportionate power to small parties that supply the governing party with a majority. Israel would be a good example: there the largest party invariably needs to gain the support of minority religious parties to cobble together a coalition. This has led to a whole raft of religious legislation, including sabbath day observance, of which a majority of Israeli citizens disapprove and for which only a small minority vote.\nThe discipline imposed by our own system is that a party needs a very broad base of support to secure any parliamentary representation whatsoever: they have to be ‘broad churches’ that form a coalition before any election. Continental PR systems however, which strictly reward parties according to the total of votes cast for them, give them the freedom to be more ideologically focussed and exclusive. The focus of coalition building then takes place after an election where parties come together to thrash out an agenda for government that was never put to the voters at all.\nWith the plethora of complex voting systems where some votes are counted multiple times, formulae are applied, and out comes a result from the ‘sausage machine’ that is difficult to understand, we have, on the contrary, a refreshing simplicity: the candidate with the most votes wins.",

It pays a taxable grant worth 80 per cent of the average monthly trading profits, paid out in a single instalment covering three months’ worth of profits, and capped at £7,500 in total.\nAlternatively, those who paid themselves a salary through their own company, were eligible for the ‘furlough’ Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, available to employers, including owner-managers, and individuals paying themselves a salary through a PAYE scheme.\nThe main complaint I ‘ve been getting is that those people who pay themselves a dividend from their company rather than a wage, are not covered.\nThe difficulty is that incomes from dividends aren’t wages, they are a return on investment, and are taxed differently because of that.\nEven setting aside this difference of principle, under current reporting mechanisms, it is not possible for HM Revenue and Customs to distinguish between dividends derived from an individual’s own company and dividends from other shares that they possess.\nThe Government did consider providing a new system for those who pay themselves through dividends, but this is much more complex. The information required by the other support schemes, is already held by HM Revenue and Customs.\nA dividend scheme would require owner-managers to make a claim and submit information that HM Revenue and Customs could not efficiently or consistently verify to ensure payments were made to eligible companies, for eligible activity.\nSome of my correspondents suggested that that a ‘pay now, but clawback later’ approach could have been taken, but that would have required manual and highly resource-intensive procedures to ensure compliance, and there would still be a high risk that incorrect or fraudulent payments could not be recovered.\nThe proper recourse for those who do not qualify for the schemes is to fall back on Universal Credit, which has performed incredibly well, in paying out on time for a surge of millions of new applicants.\nThe difficulty is that you cannot qualify for Universal Credit it if you have savings of more than £16,000, and this is where the perceived unfairness lies. None of the Covid-19 schemes are subject to a savings threshold, so I can quite understand the disappointment of those who’ve worked so hard, but don’t qualify, and are now having to live off their savings, whilst others are receiving help.\nShould the savings threshold have been raised, or suspended, during the pandemic?\nIt sounds easy, but it raises questions about hundreds of thousands of applicants denied Universal Credit because of their savings before Covid-19 even came along.\nDoes the very existence of a savings threshold discourage thrift by penalising the thrifty when they run in to hard times?\nBut then you wouldn’t want to see millionaires claiming Universal Credit even if they had lost their job.\nEqually, one of the reasons that we save is for “a rainy day” as my Granny used to say.

I can express my satisfaction at the removal of another intrusion to deny children their childhood: the removal of aspects sex education until year 9 (typically 12 to 13 years-old) and the complete exclusion of transgender ideology.\nOf course, as a former teacher, I have some reservations about government telling teachers what to teach, when to teach it, and how to teach it. Nevertheless, some members of the profession had clearly taken leave of their senses, evidenced by the inclusion of inappropriate material, often provided a considerable expense to schools, from third parties with an ‘axe to grind’, and in many cases, an unwillingness to be transparent about that content with parents.\nBut let me return to the question of children and smartphones, which was debated at Westminster last week, and quote from my colleague, Miriam Cates MP’s speech last week:\n“In this country, we often take the physical safety of our children for granted, but imagine if our streets were so lawless that it was unsafe for children to leave their homes. Imagine if, on their daily walk to school, our children had to witness the beheading of strangers or the violent rape of women and girls. Imagine if, when hanging out in the local park, it was normal for hundreds of people to accost our child and encourage them to take their own life. Imagine if it was a daily occurrence for our children to be propositioned for sex or blackmailed into stripping for strangers. Imagine if every mistake that our child made was advertised on public billboards, so that everyone could laugh and mock until the shame made life not worth living. This is not a horror movie or some imaginary wild west; this is the digital world that our children occupy, often for hours a day.”\nThe point is well made. The consequences are dreadful. I am besieged with requests from desperate parents seeking assistance in securing mental health interventions for their children. Suicide rates for teenage boys in the UK have doubled. They have trebled for girls. Incidents of self-harm for 10 to 12-year-old girls have increased by 364%. Anxiety rates for the under-25s have trebled. Feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness, loneliness and despair are growing among our youngest citizens. In just 15 years, childhood has been abolished.\nThe evidence and research points to smartphones and social media as the culprits. They have become an addiction throughout the developed world. This is hardly surprising given that the suppliers design applications with the intention of making them addictive.\nIt is significant that TikTok, one of most popular social media amongst children, severely restricts Children’s screen time in its native China, but unlimited in its ability to undermine them in the free world.\nMy prejudice has always been to resist interfering with the freedoms and personal choices of the people who elect me. Nevertheless, I do not think we can simply stand aside as we witness the creation of an ‘anxious generation’ whose confidence has been so undermined by hours and hours of often harmful screen time and starved of real social interaction with peers. It is our duty to protect our children.\nThe Online Harms Act is a start, but we now need to proceed much further and faster to to restrict access by age and content.",

Hopefully, we’ll think carefully about it beforehand, during, and after the debate too.\nBy co-incidence, Dr Trudo Lemmens, Professor of Health Law and Policy at the University of Toronto, visited Westminster last week. The Professor, who enthusiastically supported the introduction of MaiD (Medical Assistance in Dying) in Canada, shared with MPs his concerns and misgivings about the way that the law quickly evolved, post implementation.\nCanada’s 2021 MAiD law has a two-track system: Track One, for those approaching a reasonably foreseeable death, and Track Two for those who are not. Patients in group One require no waiting period and the procedure, once approved, will be carried out even if they subsequently lose mental capacity. Those in the Track Two group however, require a 90-day assessment alongside an assessor with expertise in the applicant’s medical condition.\nProfessor Lemmens told us that Canadian policy prioritises ‘access to death over protection against it’. It is now an obligation in Canada for clinicians to offer MAiD to all who qualify, including most disabled people who, by the very nature of their disability, qualify under Track Two.\n(I had heard this previously from a Canadian practitioner who described how a disabled patient was told that the budget would not extend to adapting his dwelling to further accommodate the development of his disability, nevertheless, the Track Two process to medical assisted death was available instead!)\nThe Professor stated his concern that disabled persons and the elderly are often ignored, or are addressed by measures which will always be incomplete, more expensive, or easily de-prioritised in times of cost constraints.\nHe told us that standards of medical care are no longer upheld so that death is prioritised over ensuring the ‘most basic professional standards of care’.\nHe said that many of those on Track Two engineer their health circumstances to move to Track One in order to bypass a waiting period and the thoroughly safeguarded assessment. And that this process is not solely driven by the MAiD applicants themselves, rather it is actively endorsed by the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers, who provide recommendations on how to transfer a patient eligible under Track two to Track One\nHe Concluded that death is now regarded as a legitimate therapy for suffering, regardless of other available therapy options or the actual source of the suffering. And that this has had effect of shifting MAiD from being a tool to avoid ‘suffering in death’, to now one of avoiding ‘suffering in life’.\nI’m Glad we’ll only be debating on Monday and not voting.

Democracies can be quite as prone to tyranny as any other form of government. It is worth remembering that Hitler first achieved power after winning an election.\nThese proper restraints on democratic power are nevertheless, a source of constant frustration.

It is a process of which I disapprove both in principle and on practical considerations.\nI was opposed to creating the Supreme Court in the first place. It was preceded by the ‘Law Lords’, more properly called the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary: they sat as part of a parliamentary process as members of the House of Lords. I was brought up with the doctrine that the ‘High Court of Parliament’ was our highest court and that no other court could question proceedings in Parliament.\nTony Blair’s downgrading of the role of Lord Chancellor and the creation of a new supreme court separate from Parliament, struck me as an unwise decision, potentially setting Parliament and the courts against one another. I believe that it is the proper role of Parliament to hold government ministers to account, and not for the judges to do so.\nOn practical grounds, I think the Government might have been wiser to have simply accepted the High Court’s judgement that parliamentary approval was required to trigger article 50, and to have brought the necessary measure before Parliament, rather than seeking to appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe Government however, believes that there is an important point of principle about the use by ministers of the Crown Prerogative, which needs to be properly settled. Well, then let it be settled in Parliament with legislation. One of the most important lessons I learnt at school was ‘if you are not going to like the answer, then don’t ask the question’.\nThere is now every possibility that the judges will settle the matter in a way that constrains ministerial use of prerogative powers that will have much wider restrictions on effective government. Even worse, the appeal has provided for the Scottish Executive to join in the legal action. What on earth will be the outcome if the court rules that the Government must first seek the consent of the Scottish Parliament before triggering Article 50?\n‘Sufficient unto the day is the trouble thereof’. Perhaps it’s unwise to worry ourselves with speculations about all the things that could go wrong. It is possible, after all, that the Government might just win the appeal.

I recall the way that expression of such concern was derided by the ‘establishment’ over the last decade. During the 2001 election campaign there were howls of anguish and indignation, indeed there was even a walk-out, when I raised the subject at a hustings organised by a New Forest church.\nNow that we have the leave of the Archbishop to discuss it, I can say that – overwhelmingly – immigration has been the subject most often raised with me by constituents over the last 19 years. It has been their top concern, where their dislike of the EU has been way down the list by comparison.\nThe two are intimately connected however, to put it bluntly, we can’t control immigration because of our membership of the EU. Most of our immigrants come from the EU and the terms of our membership require that they be given free movement into our country, and the same employment rights as British subjects. So, when governments announce honest intentions to reduce immigration, they fail because they have absolutely no way of limiting the greater part of the source of immigrants.\nWe are often told that immigration is good for us and promotes prosperity and economic growth. It is true that foreign entrepreneurs bring their skills, enterprise and investment here. In the end however, it comes down to a question of numbers and a balance of advantage: 70% of EU migrant workers in the UK claim in-work social security benefits, at the same time they consume public services and acquire a pension liability; The notion that this is all economic gain is fanciful.\nClearly, the Government recognises this, and that is why we tried to create levers to control the flow of EU migrants. We failed: the re-negotiation has come up only with an ‘emergency brake’ which requires the consent of the EU Commission if we wish to operate it. The brake consists of nothing more than a temporary diminution in amount of benefit payable. It is certainly better than nothing, but it does not amount to control of our borders and I do not believe that it will diminish the numbers of migrants.\nThis brings us to a key principle underlying the whole EU debate: Control. Pundits demand that both sides paint a picture of what the future holds inside, or outside the EU. Of course, neither of us can with any certainty, because we live in an unpredictable world and we are not clairvoyants. The real issue therefore, is that we are likely to fare far better in this unpredictable world, if we have control of our own affairs to pursue our national interest, rather than that control should reside in Brussels.",

This reported that ethnic segregation is increasing and that we need to do more to ensure that immigrants integrate fully into British society.\nThe review identified a need to establish a set of values around which people from all different backgrounds can unite. To this end, it suggested the introduction of an integration oath on arrival for immigrants intending to settle in Britain, but the review also identified a need to increase standards of leadership and integrity in public office, suggesting that this could be done by developing a new oath for holders of public office.\nThe lobby against the proposal is promoted by evangelical Christians concerned that the oath may be used as a means of excluding from public office anyone who has religious reservations about the validity of same sex marriage.\nI think this is somewhat implausible given our fundamental commitment to freedom of religion. To be fair to their suspicions however, oaths have certainly been used to exclude religious dissenters in the past.\nThe Test Act of 1673 required an oath not just from office holders, but also from entrants to professions and universities. It was in response to Charles II’s willingness to move on from the lingering divisions of the civil war and the years of Cromwell’s Commonwealth. In 1672 he used his prerogative powers in the Declaration of Indulgence to remove disadvantages and restrictions placed on non-conformists and Catholics. Parliament’s response a year later proved that there was still no mood for forgiveness and that bygones were to remain top priority. The Act required that applicants give ‘assent and consent to all and everything contained in, and proscribed by the Book of Common Prayer’. Clearly, the only shared value around which Parliament believed the country should unite, was to be full membership of the Church of England.\nThis had profound social consequences. The exclusion of non-conformists from public office, professions and universities led them to concentrate on commerce and industry, with their own schools to nurture them. It is for this reason that so many of our historic successful companies were founded in the non-conformist tradition, for example Barclays, Wilkinsons, Courtaulds, and Cadburys.\nThe Government will respond to Dame Louise’s recommendations in the spring.

It couldn’t have been clearer.\nIn fact, at the election last year 80% of the voters supported parties committed to exactly that: because it was what the Labour, Conservative, DUP and UKIP manifestos promised.\nSubsequently, and unfortunately for the strength of the UK’s negotiating stance, the Opposition has sought to join nationalists, Greens, Lib-Dems and Tory rebels in trying to hang on to some aspects of EU membership, be it a customs union or membership of the internal market.\nWere they to be successful, they would have to explain to the voters how it was that they broke their pledges at the last election.

The reality is that when Parliament passed the regulations in December which enforce the policy of sacking unvaccinated NHS and care workers (although I voted against the provisions), we didn’t then know what we now know: Which is that risk the unvaccinated pose to patients declines after a very short period and that we have the alternative of regular lateral flow testing, which will tell, whether healthcare professionals pose a threat to their patients.\nThe vaccination doesn’t stop you catching COVID or passing it on, what it does is reduce your risk of serious illness. So, the rationale for forcing it on NHS and care staff has gone.\nThe Government’s own analysis is that that 73,000 NHS staff and 38,000 domiciliary care workers will leave as a consequence of the policy of enforced vaccination.\nWe have no plan for how to replace them and there is already a critical shortage of domiciliary care workers, so much so that beds are unnecessarily occupied in hospitals because care providers have insufficient staff to care for them if they were allowed to go home.\nThe Government should seek to persuade NHS and domiciliary care workers to be vaccinated, not threaten to sack them.

As a country, between 2016 and 2019 we resettled more refugees from outside Europe than any member state of the EU.\nLet me assure you that the new Nationality and Borders Bill will allow the UK continue to resettle genuine refugees directly from places of danger and offer refugee family reunions. It will improve support for refugees to help them build their life in the UK, integrate and become self-sufficient members of society. The Bill also seeks to introduce a new temporary protection status for those who do not come directly to the UK or claim asylum without delay once here but who have, in any event, been recognised as requiring protection.\nI have always believed that resettlement is vital as a safe and legal pathway to protection for vulnerable refugees fleeing persecution. It is right that the Government continues to offer safe pathways for those in need, and I will continue to ensure that this is the case. The launch of a new global UK Resettlement Scheme will now build on the success of previous schemes and continue our proud record of resettling refugees who need our help from around the world.\nIt is also the case that refugees in the UK need to have the freedom to succeed as they settle. This means ensuring refugees have access to the tools required to become fully independent and provide for themselves and their families. This will allow refugees to be in a position to contribute and integrate into the economic and cultural life of the UK.\nIt is therefore good news that the Home Secretary has announced £14 million of funding to help newly granted refugees to integrate in the UK. This fund will pilot new approaches across the country to support newly granted refugees to learn English, move into work, access housing and build links in their local communities. Lessons learned from these pilots will inform future support available to all refugees.\nDS.",

So, I’d make it clear that we will simply ‘park’ any legislative process in Parliament until the EU blinks first.\nIf they don’t blink however, well unfortunately then we will leave with a sub-optimal outcome but, hey, we’ll have £40 Billion to spend on the NHS before the next general election.\nOf course this plan would provoke a furore in Parliament.\nRemember however, Parliament handed the decision to the people in a referendum. The people took Parliament at its word and they voted to take back control of our borders, our laws and our money. If a principal obstacle to effecting that decision of the people is Parliament itself, then we will have to deal with that. Perhaps even proroguing it if necessary.\nClearly, we’re getting into King Charles the First territory here, but then my being in the PM’s shoes was an utterly fanciful notion to start with.\nBut by heck, there’d have been some changes!",

I am also fortunate to receive briefings from the dedicated experts Tony Gent and Owain Masters.\nThe range of the smooth snake (coronella austriaca) is limited to our lowland heaths like much of the New Forest. Britain accounts for 20% of the World’s total lowland heath.\nThe smooth Snake is what is known as an ‘umbrella species’ because it serves as a flagship for promoting conservation of its own habitats and also that of many other species. Smooth snakes are recognised as a conservation priority in Britain, are fully protected by law and identified as key feature in many sites with conservation designations.\nSmooth snakes will have been active since late March, when the warming weather would have brought them out of hibernation. Having mated from in April and May, the females will be basking in the sun with the next generation being born from mid-August to early October.\nThough there is the danger that welcome warm dry weather, brings with it an increased risk of heath fires, which can be devastating to local smooth snake and reptile populations. So don’t barbeque in the Forest.\nCurrent proposals for Species Abundance Targets under the provisions of the Environment Act 2021 do not include any reptile species so I will have to keep badgering Rebecca Pow, the responsible minister, using the data provided by Tony and Martin as ammunition, in order to see that this deficiency is addressed. The key point being that reptiles are a ‘weathervane’ for so much else in terms of biodiversity and healthy habitats.\nThe Snakes in the Heather project, run by Amphibian & Reptile Conservation and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, started in 2019, has the smooth snake as its flagship species. The project is a volunteer-based wildlife survey to raise awareness of reptiles within local communities with both public events and school-based activities across the range of the smooth snake in southern England. The project is giving many more people an understanding and appreciation of smooth snakes and all of our native reptile species, leading to improvements in habitat condition.\nOver 200 people are now trained to survey for smooth snakes using the latest technology developed for the project. – Preliminary habitat suitability models have been completed for smooth snake, adder and sand lizards allowing us to ensure the survey programme targets potential gaps together with historic locations and known populations.\nOver 2000 children have received lessons about the UK’s reptile species. There has been coverage on the Countryfile TV programme. A Snakes in the Heather children’s story book In Search of Old Uncle Blue has been published. We are looking at developing a campaign around raising the profile of smooth snake over the coming year, to involve a number, conservation organisations and schools – and hopefully local businesses.\nWildlife Conservation and habitat restoration needs to be high on our political agenda if our planet, as we have known it, is to survive.",

Frankly, I am not going to take lectures from the Conservative party, which crashed the economy. Let me remind the House what the right hon. Gentleman said about the disastrous mini-Budget:\n“I share entirely the free-market ideology that underpins the Chancellor’s statement…The Chancellor was right to be radical.”\nHe added:\n“I rejoice at the two fingers the Chancellor has raised to socialist dogma and envy.”\nI think that the financial markets and the British public have united in their view on the previous Government.”\nLecture -Moi !\nI didn’t give her a lecture, I merely asked a question. Nevertheless, I am quite flattered that, evidently, she studies this column. What she quoted so enthusiastically, but nevertheless, rather selectively, was word-for-word what I wrote here on 25th September 2022 ( Two fingers to Socialist Dogma and Envy ).\nIt was my assessment of Kwasi Kwarteng’s disastrous mini budget. I don’t resile from anything that I said back then. I long for the implementation of all the measures that he announced. I just thought that to try them all at once, and at the same time as announcing a mind-numbingly expensive commitment to pay half of all our energy bills (and without first ‘rolling the pitch’ with the financial markets) was, to say the least, ‘high risk’.\nJust weeks later I had to defend government policy in the annual no-confidence motion at the Oxford Union. I was half-way to Oxford on the train when breaking news came that Kwasi had been sacked. It wasn’t a good wicket on which to have to go out and bat. My speech is still available at\ndesmond swayne oxford union speech – – Video Search Results\nI lost -heavily.\nThe upside is that the Chancellor is reading this column and I shall have to take that into account as I consider what to write about!",

Nevertheless, I feel confident that we will all still be here next week and that things won’t have changed that much, notwithstanding some of the hyperbole in the news headlines suggesting that we at the most dangerous point in international relations since the Cuban missile crisis and that we are approaching the brink of thermo-nuclear Armageddon. I continually remind my constituents and correspondents of General William Slim’s dictum that nothing is ever as bad as it is reported.\nOver the bank holiday weekend I’ve managed a bit of gardening and some routine maintenance on my Morris Minor. At no stage have I felt the random urge to go and do something I’ve always wanted to, on the grounds that it may be my last chance before the world ends.\nNone of this however, should be taken as in any way a denial of the dreadful state that much of the world is in, or as an attempt to trivialise it. North Korea is a ghastly place, much of it a vast prison camp for the half-starved rural population. The slighted evidence of lese-mageste towards the regime will prove fatal to the offenders, their families and any known associates. Profession of Christianity attracts the heaviest of penalties. As Kim Jong-un’s late brother discovered in Thailand recently, the regime’s murderous reach extends well beyond the hermit kingdom’s own borders.\nAs for Syria, our TV screens tell us all we need to know of the suffering there. I was surprised to hear however, a senior parliamentary colleague in an interview, state that President Assad could have no rational motive in launching a chemical attack at this stage in the war, attracting such international condemnation, when otherwise everything was going his way.\nThat Assad was indeed responsible, was proved beyond doubt, when he piped-up to insist that the whole incident had been completely faked (despite respected journalist witness accounts, and – even more surprisingly – contradicting the Russian carefully crafted cover story that it was the result of a rebel chemical weapons factory).\nTo suggest that Assad was without motive, is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of his regime. The Assads share a great deal in common with the Kim dynasty of North Korea: their purpose is the same; to terrorise their subjects into submission by demonstrating that they will stop at absolutely nothing.\nTo suggest, as I have, that next week we will still be here and the world won’t have changed very much, is not necessarily a good thing. We should always count our blessings that we can do normal stuff like mow the lawn and wash the car. For so many of our fellow citizens of the world, ordinary every-day life is very different – and we’ve only considered just two of the world’s grizzliest places.\nLast week’s:\nGassing of Khan Sheikhoun\nAfter the ghastly scenes from the deployment of sarin nerve agent by the Assad regime in rebel held Idlib, and before the USA response with 59 tomahawk cruise missiles, I received a flurry of emails from constituents demanding that ‘something be done’.\nI reply by asking my correspondents to give me a clearer idea of what he or she thinks that ‘something’ ought to be.\nWe already apply sanctions, asset freezes, and we have withdrawn diplomatic relations. Is there really an appetite to get even more involved in another conflict in that deeply troubled region?\nI hope so, but I have not yet detected it.\nIn my response to the emails I pointed out that the key moment of our failure came in August 2013 when Assad previously used chemical weapons, crossing President Obama’s declared ‘red line’. Instead of taking the threatened punitive action, neither the USA nor the UK did so. Indeed, in Parliament we voted down the Government’s request to take action: we chose explicitly to do nothing. Inaction can have dreadful consequences as the children and parents of Khan Sheikhoun have now discovered.\nIn 2013 Russia, though involved, had not deployed its own forces to any great extent, so our freedom to respond militarily would have been much greater than it is now, when the risk of a clash with Russia is so much greater. Of course I said that two days before President Trump did take the risk of responding militarily, it is far too soon to tell what the consequences will be.\nTo be fair, I think our biggest misjudgement came much earlier than August 2013. Our failure was at the very outset of the rebellion in 2011, through our refusal to arm the Free Syrian Army. We supported its objectives but we sent it only medical supplies and radios. The consequence was, as a fighting force, it was completely overtaken by the vastly better armed and financed Islamist militias.\nRussia’s initial response to the US military action has to be to condemn it as an ‘act of aggression against a sovereign state contrary to international law’.\nThis doctrine that sovereign states can act with complete impunity within their own borders goes back to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia which ended the 30 years war in Europe. Russia may still adhere to it, but the rest of the civilised world has moved on: Chapter VII of the UN Charter allows action to be taken in the interests of international peace and security.\nThe carnage and suffering in Syria has now lasted longer than the Second World War, and with profound and destabilising consequences for Europe. Something has to be done to bring it to an end –but what?",

Well, it certainly did, though calm has now returned, for the present at least. As I write Sterling is trading at a better rate than it was before the Chancellors statement. The reality is that Sterling has been falling throughout the year, together with so many other currencies, losing 20% of its value against the US Dollar, which is about the same as the Euro has lost. It has rather a lot to do with the virility of the Federal Reserve’s response to inflation, something that the Bank of England might learn from.\nIn the midst of the criticisms of the Chancellor’s plans, the International Monetary Fund piped up with its own critique. This is the Same IMF that denounced George Osborne’s spending cuts in 2011, telling us that they would result in mass unemployment. It didn’t, on the contrary, we achieved record low unemployment. Last week the IMF’s commentary was about our tax proposals giving rise to greater levels of inequality. If I recall correctly my days as an economist, income distribution is measured by the gini coefficient, and UK has one of the most even distributions amongst developed countries.\nOur problem really isn’t to do with the lack of equality, it is lack of economic growth. It is exactly this that the tax proposals are designed to address. Equally important is the need to raise more tax revenue through that economic growth. Given that fully one quarter of all our income tax revenue is raised from the top one percent of tax-payers, it is precisely this top one percent that we most need to encourage to maximise their initiative, enterprise and effort in order that, by paying a lower rate of tax individually, they pay even more tax collectively.\nParliament has been in recess since the very day that the Chancellor made his statement in the Commons. As a consequence, the only plotting of which I am aware is what I’ve seen reported in the news media. Frankly, I’m pretty sceptical about these stories of Tories conniving with Labour to defeat the tax proposals. Rarely does anything turn out to be quite as reported. Were it to be true however, any such plotters should remember that voting against a budget measure is a confidence matter, which should properly be repaid by withdrawal of the party whip.

I accept that, as has the Prime Minister.\nMy focus remains the much greater folly of what I still consider the disproportionate regulations themselves. I am entitled to blame the PM for them, but I must acknowledge that his Government’s efforts first to relax and then to revoke the regulations, were opposed by the opposition parties now demanding the PM’s head, but they wanted even stricter and prolonged restrictions.\nCan a Woman have a Penis?\nA Constituent emailed me to ask if I believed that a woman could have a penis.\nClearly, she wasn’t contacting me for an insight into my biological understanding and expertise. Rather, she was seeking to identify where I stood on the question of ‘trans rights’ which has produced so much confusion and obfuscation from front-line politicians when that question has been put to them recently.\nI am relieved that the Prime Minister has now brought some robust common sense to the matter.\nThere is nothing new about transgender issues. It is as old as human experience. As for it becoming a matter of public discussion and interest, I remember reading Jan Morris’s book Conundrum about her own experience, when it was first published way back in 1974.\nPersonally, I don’t have a problem with people, who are uncomfortable with their biological sex, identifying as the opposite gender. It does me no harm to me and it isn’t my business to enquire after the personal choices of others: live and let live.\nThere is a proper distinction to be drawn however, when it comes to a man who identifies a woman, yet retains his male genitals, being admitted to exclusive female facilities such as changing rooms, toilets, hospital wards, and even prisons. I find it difficult to comprehend that some people even question this, let alone mercilessly persecute female academics and authors who have sought to protect these exclusive biologically female spaces.\nNow let’s come to the question of ‘conversion therapies’: There is little disagreement that the more cruel and brutal parts of conversion therapy should be banned, indeed current legislation already outlaws the more egregious aspects. There are important interventions however, that need to be thoroughly explored and which must not be caught by the ‘chilling effect’ of ill-defined and poorly thought through legislation. It is crucial that teenagers with gender dysphoria receive support from medical and psychological professionals before they take irrevocable decisions about a transition, which they might later regret. This is not attempted conversion, but merely investigating the causes of gender dysphoria, which can be numerous and complex.\nThere are particular concerns about the exposure of children to radically progressive ideas concerning sex and gender. We must avoid heading down a road where a generation of young people are taught to think that it is normal to transition to a different gender before becoming an adult.\nFinally, Women have been fighting for decades for their sport to achieve the same status and prize money as men, yet we now find ourselves in a situation where biological males can announce themselves to be female and proceed to blow their biologically female opponents out of the water. This is ridiculous. Biological men should compete with biological men and biological women with biological women. A compromise might be to create transgender events where those who have transitioned are able to compete against each other on a level playing field, rather than denying those who have been training for an event their whole lives a fair shot at glory.\nEnergy Bills\nI have received a large number of emails about the rise in energy bills.\nSome have asked for a windfall tax on the oil companies to generate revenue that can then be used to reduce consumer bills. I addressed what I consider to be the folly of a windfall tax in this column last week.\nThe Chancellor announced a £9 billion package in February to provide some relief through council tax rebates and a scheme for spreading costs over the next two years. This will help but it represents only a fraction of the increased bills that we all face.\nEnergy prices are determined by supply and demand in international markets and are beyond the control of any government. Growth in international demand relative to the supplies available was already driving prices up as economies recovered from the Covid pandemic. The impact of war in Ukraine and the sanctions that we imposed on Russia sent the prices of oil and gas through the roof. As I said in the Commons, when we impose sanctions on Russia, we are also imposing them on ourselves. The only consolation is the privations that we will endure are as nothing, compared to the suffering of the people of Ukraine. There are a number of sources of assistance for people worried about their energy bills or falling into debt. Smart Energy GB has worked with the fuel poverty charity National Energy Action to provide simple and helpful advice which can be found on their websites. Many other organisations also provide advice and support, such as Age UK and the British Gas Energy Trust.\nPeople who prepay for their energy might benefit from upgrading to a smart prepayment meter which provide new ways to top up online, over the phone, by text, or by smart phone apps. The accurate and near real-time data allows energy suppliers support prepay customers more easily, by offering tailored support assistance as emergency payment applied directly to the meter, or advice on managing energy costs.\nIn the end there is no way of getting over the fact that we have to pay for the energy that we use to heat our homes, and we need to reconcile ourselves to using less of it.\nThese days may come again\nFlexible working email campaign\nLegally, at present, all employees with 26 weeks’ continuous service with their employer have the right to request flexible working.\nThe Government is working to strengthen day one employment rights and increase the productivity of businesses. Under plans to modernise the way we work, employees will have the right to request flexible working from day one. Delivering on a commitment set out in the Government’s 2019 manifesto, around 2.2 million more people will be given the right to request flexible working.\nThe proposals, which were open to consultation up to December 2021, considered whether the current limit of one flexible working application per year continues to represent the best balance between individual and business needs. The consultation also looked at cutting the current three-month period an employer has to consider any request.\nIf an employer cannot accommodate a request, as may be the case, they would need to think about what alternatives they could offer. For example, if they couldn’t change their employee’s hours on all working days, they could consider making the change for certain days instead.\nResearch has shown companies that embrace flexible working can attract more talent, improve staff motivation and reduce staff turnover. In addition, flexible working can boost a business’ productivity and competitiveness.\nHowever, there are some circumstances where businesses will not be able to offer flexible working and therefore there is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. An employer should still be able to reject a request if they have sound business reasons. Therefore, is important that government does not prescribe specific arrangements in legislation. Instead, the new plans would provide a strengthened legislative framework that seeks to encourage conversations around flexible working to be more two-sided, balancing the needs of employee and employer. It also shifts the focus to what may be possible, rather than what is not.\nDS\nFree NHS staff parking email campaign\nThe Government provided funding for free parking in hospital car parks for NHS staff during the pandemic. This temporary measure gave much needed assistance during such a difficult time, but in light of the wider changes to the Government’s Covid-19 response, this has come to an end. However, over 94 per cent of NHS Trusts that charge for car parking have implemented free parking for those in greatest need, including NHS staff working overnight.\nDS\nLack of online gambling regulation email campaign\nGambling is for many people an enjoyable pastime, but equally for some it can become a serious problem. While we all want a healthy gambling industry that makes an important contribution to the economy, we must also do everything we can to protect those that use it from harm.\nOperators providing gambling facilities to customers in Great Britain must be licensed by the Gambling Commission and comply with the conditions of their operating licences. In recent years, the Gambling Commission has also introduced a number of licence conditions specifically in relation to online gambling to ensure the protection of children and vulnerable people. In 2019, the Gambling Commission introduced new age and identity verification rules to ensure operators verify customers’ age and identity details quickly and robustly. Furthermore, in 2020, the Government and Commission strengthened these protections further, including a ban on credit card gambling, making participation in the self-exclusion scheme GAMSTOP mandatory for online operators, as well as issuing new guidance for operators to address the potential for some customers to be at heightened risk during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe Gambling Commission is looking at the role technology and data can play in preventing harm from arising and it will soon publish its enhanced requirements for customer interaction, thereby making sure gambling operators are doing proper checks, and the Government is looking at this in their review too.\nDS.\nWater fluoridisation postcard campaign\nThe following is from a speech I made in the House of Commons in 1999 on the topic of water fluoridisation:\nThe existing state of the law governing the addition of fluoride to the water supply is most unsatisfactory. The water industry resents the discretion—and, therefore, the responsibility—that is placed upon it. Those who oppose the addition of fluoride to water resent very much the power and influence that is placed in the hands of health authorities and water companies. For my part, I share the natural suspicion of any free man with respect to the presumption of health professionals to decide what is good for me and whether or not I should consume it. Are we horses to be led to water and forced to drink?\nI am happy to take advice, from any informed source, about what may be good for me with respect to medicine or diet, but I reject utterly the notion that the decision about whether to consume should rest in any other mind than my own. However, it is not that philosophical question upon which I wish to dwell this evening.\nMy initiation of the debate results from the persistent lobbying of my constituent, Dr. Anthony Dunstan Fox, who practises in Barton-on-Sea. He has drawn my attention to the fact that fluoride compounds are a poison, so much so that I am persuaded that we should be taking considerable steps to remove fluoride compounds from our environment, not providing yet another source of them.\nThe state of the debate in this country is rather quaint. The Government pride themselves on their modernisations, so it is odd that we still appear to be addressing in this debate the preoccupations, fads and fashions of the 1960s and the 1970s. In the United States, for example, localities and cities are discontinuing their former policy of adding fluoride to the water. In Europe, that trend is equally apparent. Indeed, Germany—which is so much the model for the Government’s modernisations—has abandoned the policy of adding fluoride to the water.\nThat trend is a consequence of a growing consensus—a growing body of evidence—that fluoride compounds are a poison. In the United States, the Food and Drugs Administration has required since June 1997 the makers of any toothpaste product containing fluoride compounds to publish a health warning on the packaging. Consumers who ingest the product are advised to seek the advice of a poison control centre. The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the Government’s most prominent scientists, toxicologists and lawyers, has voted unanimously to oppose any fluoridation of the water.\nThere is a growing volume of evidence of the poisonous consequences of fluoride compounds. In this brief debate, I cannot possibly do any justice to that evidence, nor am I qualified to do so, but I draw the attention of the House to the work of Dr. Phyllis Mollenix, the toxicologist at the Boston children’s hospital in Massachusetts. Her work attempts to define a causal relationship between the presence of fluoride products and changes in brain activity that may give rise to hyperactivity and learning difficulties. Hon. Members may be aware of the work of Professor Shusheela, who has tried to find a causal relationship between the presence of fluoride compounds in very small quantities and irritable bowel syndrome, anaemia, bone weaknesses, dental and skeletal fluorosis, genetic damage, still-birth and miscarriage.\nHowever, the medical establishment in this country is still wedded to the notion that fluoride compounds are good for us and should be put into the water supply. It is either unwilling or incapable of addressing the growing volume of evidence. That may be due to intellectual laziness, but if it is, it is strange that it is wedded to a campaigning zeal. Its unwillingness to consider the evidence goes back a long way. As far back as 1970, the British Dental Journal contained an article which stated:\n“Perhaps the greatest deterrent to meaningful political engagement of dentists in the promotion of water fluoridation is the mistaken but widespread assumption that to do so they must have full and complete knowledge of the detailed and voluminous scientific literature on the relationship of water fluoridation to dental and general health. They do not … as soon as dentists recognise their responsibility in the politics of fluoridation, their performance will be outstanding…the emphasis is on propagandising rather than education.”\nI doubt that any of the Government’s spin doctors could have put the point better. Indeed, it is an opinion of which Dr. Goebbels would have been proud.\nAll I can say about my party’s position on fluoridation is that it was inherited from the previous Administration. My party believes that there are benefits from fluoridation—a view I regard as curious—but the decision to add fluoride compounds to the water should be taken locally. I believe that it should be taken at a very local level—by the consumer. Whether any meaningful locality could be defined for the purposes of a water supply is problematical.\nI am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) for opening up the debate on this subject. He has asked the medical establishment—the British Medical Association in particular—to produce new evidence to prove that fluoride compounds are good for our dental and general health, and that they are not bad for us. I welcome his initiative but, when surfing the internet, I noted that the website of the pro-fluoridation lobby names him as one of its supporters. As I understand it, that is not his position, and I urge him to correct that.\nThe medical establishment clings to the tenuous belief that fluoride compounds are good for our dental and general health, despite the fact that the evidence is pretty thin. If fluoride compounds attack the bacteria that would otherwise decay our teeth, it is probably because they attack all living organisms, including us. I cannot imagine why any mammal would ingest fluoride compounds. They are pollutants and are increasingly evident in our environment largely as a result of industrial and agro-chemical processes, such as fertilisers. We should make strenuous efforts to remove those compounds from our environment rather than add another source. If we add fluoride to our water, it will be in our milk; it will be in our cereals; it will be in our vegetables; it will be in our soup; it will be in our tea; it will be in our beer.\nIt would be legitimate for the advocates of fluoride compounds to ask, “Where are the casualties? Where are the sick children, and the sick elderly people, who must be consequences of the fact that fluoride compounds are added to 10 per cent. of our water supply?” I would answer that question with another question: “What resources has the Minister’s Department—have we—put into identifying the victims? What new studies have we initiated to update ourselves about evidence of the damage that is being done by fluoride compounds?”\nIn that context, let me draw attention to the findings of Dr. Schatz. Dr. Schatz is no ordinary physician: he discovered streptomycin. In 1993, Dr. Schatz said that artificial fluoridation\n“may well dwarf the thalidomide tragedy, which was dramatic because it produced crippled children who are living testimonials to what that drug has done. Many victims of artificial fluoridation, on the other hand, die quietly during the first year of their lives, or at a later age under conditions where their deaths are attributed to some other cause.”\nI urge any water authority and any water company seeking to acquiesce to a health authority’s suggestion that fluoride should be added to water to bear those words in mind. I urge the Minister to consider them before introducing any measure that would ensure that my constituents and their children had to drink water to which fluoride compounds had been added.\nDS.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 21\n- 22\n- 23\n- 24\n- 25\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_warring-parents/content_441.html": "Of the problems that constituents bring to my ‘surgeries’, I would estimate that for nine out of ten cases, in whatever way the problem has presented –be it housing, debt, schooling or whatever- scratch the surface, and the real underlying cause is family-breakdown.\nSometimes that breakdown is explicit and presents in a dispute over access to the children.\nI never cease to be amazed at the way in which some parents are prepared to use their children as weapons in a continuing vendetta against their former partner.\nI think that the current state of family law exacerbates the situation and cries out for reform.\nIn practical terms, the amount of access that the non-resident parent can have, is set by the resident parent. If the non-resident parent accepts this then that is fine, but if this is not accepted, then the only option is for the non-resident parent to go to court.\nThe court will decide the matter in accordance with the principle set out in the Children Act, namely ‘the Child’s best interests’, but nowhere is this defined, and nowhere is it set out what reasonable expectations of access ought to be.\nOf course, cases will differ and there must be discretion. Indeed, there will be some parents that ought properly to be denied any access to their children whatsoever.\nThere ought to be however, a principle underlying a child’s right to see a parent and a parent’s right to see a child. I suggest that the principle should be: ‘unless there is a good reason not to grant reasonable access, then such access should be had’.\nThis still leaves us with the problem of what ordinarily will constitute reasonable access. The Judges in the family courts rely on the ‘expert’ advice of the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS). I am suspicious of this expertise: I understand that CAFCASS gives its officers no written guidance on the parenting-time that should be recommended. Neither does it offer that advice to parents, so that they can have an idea of what sort of access is expected in their type of case.\nThe absence of any published guidelines is a standing invitation to the resident parent to be unreasonable and to resist any settlement arrived at by mediation, because there is no expectation about what a court would decide in their sort of case. So, the burden and expense then falls on the court system. Where, because there is no defined principle or reasonable expectation, the outcome can range from full reinstatement of contact to protracted and near total severance as the case grinds on.\nFurthermore, unreasonable behaviour can become habit-forming. Resident parents -having got into the habit before a court settlement, find it hard to get out of it, resulting in multiple returns to court.\nI believe that it is high time that the judiciary defined reasonable expectations for broad categories of cases (age related, or whatever).\nThis guidance needs to be given to separating parents so that they know how the courts are likely to deal with them, should they get there.\nThis will then inform their behaviour from the outset and make for more reasonable and less costly mediation.\nAt the very least, it’s worth a try.",

That argument can run and run.\nWhat unnerved me was the enthusiasm with which colleagues preyed-in-aid the skills of lip-readers to work out exactly what he said.\nI sometimes whisper things under my breath: They are my private thoughts, perhaps to be shared with a close neighbour only, that’s why I whisper them rather than stating them out loud for the record.\nThe notion that we should be watched by lip-readers to see what we are whispering, so that we can be hauled before the authorities (in this case Mr Speaker), is deeply worrying.\nThis is dangerous territory: we are on a slippery slope to the ‘thought crime’ of which George Orwell so eloquently warned in his novel 1984.

They say that they were explicitly told that no decision could be made in Brussels without the agreement of a British minister responsible to Parliament. Were they lied to, as they believe? They were not: what they were told was true – at that time.\nThe fact is that the European Union is a continuously evolving institution. The rules changed: British ministers no longer enjoy such power to prevent decisions which they judge to be against our national interest, and they are over-ruled. The choice in the referendum is being presented as one of sticking with the certainties of the EU, against the unpredictable consequences of leaving. This is a false prospectus: there is no certainty about what the EU will evolve into next.\nThe only certainty is that we have been offered an opportunity to reclaim the ability to govern ourselves, or to leave increasing power in the hands of Brussels.",

Of course, this year we’ve been able to indulge ourselves in this favourite pastime since the bright long days of the summer, when we were warned that the world would all but end for us if we voted to leave the European Union. Those predictions have now been deferred until next year. We should comfort ourselves with the reassurance that every generation in human history has thought that it would be the last one.\nActually, the definitive ending of the world was supposed to have been in 2012 when the 5000 year old Mayan civilisation’s calendar ran out. A year earlier my favourite book of all time The Coffee Table Book of Doom was published by Art Lester and Steven Appleby. Here is a flavour from the advertising blurb:\n“…with the apocalypse at hand, don’t fret about dying uninformed. The Coffee Table Book of Doom is a revelatory, brilliantly funny, superbly illustrated and erudite compendium of all the 27 doom-laden horsemen we need to worry about – personal doom, gender erosion, asteroid impact, pandemics, super storms, sexual ruin – and much more besides.”\nI can’t speak for all 27 doom laden horsemen but at least the prospect of being vaporised in a nanosecond by an asteroid is now less likely than the book suggested because a more recent NASA study has downgraded the threat: apparently there are only half as many threatening asteroids than was previously thought.\nThere is still plenty to worry about. Only the other day I heard that there is a volcano under a lake near Naples rumbling away and if it blows it will make Vesuvius look like a camp fire. The lava lake under Yellowstone Park could go at any moment, taking most of the USA with it. Unfortunately ‘remoaners’ would not be able to blame either on Brexit.\nWith elections in France and Germany next year, and every possibility that Greece or even Italy might still crash out of the Euro, there is plenty that could destabilise one of our major export markets beyond anything that Brexit might be blamed for.\nPersonally, and on the contrary, even on these dark mornings I still wake up – as I have done every morning since the 24rd of June – and my first thought is “we are going to be free again, WE ARE GOING TO BE FREE!”",

In April, the State Pension was increased by 10.1 per cent, in line with inflation. As a result, the full yearly amount of the basic State Pension will be over £3,050 higher, in cash terms, than in 2010.\nRegarding the uprating of the State Pension, the Government is maintaining the Triple Lock in full for 2024/25. This means that in April 2024, the basic State Pension, new State Pension, and Pension Credit minimum guarantee will be uprated in line with September 2023 average earnings growth- 8.5 per cent.\nAdditionally, while concerns are noted about pensioners that live alone, the Government is providing substantial support for pensioners through the welfare system.\nThe Government is continuing to provide support to older through the provision of free bus passes, free prescriptions, Winter Fuel Payments and Cold Weather Payments for those in receipt of Pension Credit. The Government is also providing targeted support to older people through the £300 Pensioner Cost of Living Payment, which will be paid to all households in receipt of Winter Fuel Payments.\nAll households, including pensioner households, will benefit from the Government’s Energy Price Guarantee (EPG). This guarantee limits the amount consumers can be charged per unit of gas or electricity. The current price guarantee, set at £3,000, will support households until April 2024. Although energy prices are currently below the level at which EPG payments would be made, it will remain in force until the end of March 2024 to protect households from price spikes, putting in place a safety net for the most vulnerable.\nMoreover, the Government is providing an additional £1 billion of funding to enable the extension of the Household Support Fund (HSF) this financial year, bringing total funding to £2.5 billion. Since its launch in October 2021, the HSF has issued early 26 million awards to those in need of support.

We still have the best part of the 100 hours or so of scrutiny to go.\nIt is important to remember what the purpose of the bill is, because that purpose occupied little of the debating time.\nIts purpose is to provide predictability, continuity and certainty to businesses, Government and individuals by ensuring that our domestic law is the same the day after we leave the EU as it as it will be on the day before we leave.\nWhat has happened however, is that the bill has been hijacked by MPs who want to use it as a vehicle to wrest control of the negotiations with the EU from the Government, and to have Parliament dictate the terms of any agreement itself.\nOn the face of it this is a not unreasonable thing to demand in a democracy. After all, Parliament is the elected, representative and sovereign body, and the Government is accountable to it.\nThe problem with this is twofold. First, the one thing Parliament is least fitted for is negotiating a treaty. Binding the hands of the Government in public debate in terms of the sort of agreement that it demands will leave the Government’s position completely exposed and at a huge disadvantage in negotiations with the Commission: If you play high stakes poker you need to conceal your hand, as the EU is doing.\nSecond, the demand to legislate on the terms and process, and indeed the outcome of the negotiations –which is the thrust of the amendments- is a demand to put off Brexit indefinitely until Parliament gets what it wants, even if that isn’t available. This became explicit during the debate: They will use the provisions with which they seek to amend the bill, in order to prevent Brexit if they do not like the agreement that the Government reaches. They want a veto and they were clear that this means delaying Brexit indefinitely. It is for exactly this reason that they do not want a leaving date in the legislation.\n(This strategy is an invitation to the EU to offer less eligible terms, given that the 27 are still canvassing for us to change our minds about the whole thing.)\nAs far as possible they try and maintain the fiction that they have accepted the will of the people expressed in the referendum result and that their only purpose is to improve the terms on which we will depart. But the mask slips: sometimes quite explicitly in what is said; sometimes in extravagant applause for an unreconstructed ‘remain’ speech.\nTheir real strategy is to delay the whole process long enough for the public to lose interest or, as they desperately hope, until it changes its mind.\nSo it comes down to this: do they have the numbers to wreck the Bill?\nThe answer:\nIt’s still too soon to tell.",

The purpose of this bill is to give legislative effect to a commitment made in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto Viz.\n“We will ban public bodies from imposing their own direct boycotts, disinvestment or sanctions campaigns against foreign countries”\nI supported that commitment: Of course, whilst individuals and private organisations can suit themselves, I believe that foreign policy is the preserve of the Government and that we should not have local authorities or other public bodies pursuing their own foreign policies by boycotting countries of which they disapprove. It should only be for the UK Government, with parliamentary support, to deploy sanctions.\nIn the days preceding the second reading debate I received a large correspondence divided equally between those asking me to vote against the bill, and those urging me to vote for it. In the event, I abstained, not because constituent’s opinions were equally divided, but because I have grave reservations about the way that the Bill goes about implementing the commitment, though not sufficient to enable me, in conscience, to vote with Labour against my own party manifesto.\nI will need to see how the bill is amended at committee and report stages before reconsidering how I will vote at third reading.\nClauses 1 & 2 of the bill deny public bodies the power to boycott or disinvest. Clause 3 however, empowers a minister to make exceptions, that is, to name countries against which public authorities are able to implement boycotts.\nBut Clause 3, part 7 specifically excludes Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories and the Occupied Golan Heights from this exception-making power. The message being sent is ‘these are places, alone in all the world, whatever they do, however bad it might be, we will never allow economic sanctions against them’\nWere Clause 3, part 7 to be left out, the bill would still achieve its objective of preventing public authorities meddling in foreign policy and it would prevent them implementing sanctions, including against Israel.\nLeaving the clause as it is however, sends a powerful message to Israel that we give them an absolutely blank cheque for their continued occupation of Palestinian territories. This is at a time of high tension when we have the most right-wing government of Israel ever.\nWe still adhere to the policy of a ‘two-state solution’. But the policy of Israel has been to accelerate the building of illegal settlements in the West Bank of the Jordan to exclude the geographical possibility of any future coherent unified Palestinian State.\nI support Israel as the only real democracy in the region and I support its right to defend itself. Its present policy however, is a block in the way of the peace process. The entirely gratuitous and unnecessary message we’ve inserted into this bill has no proper place at this time.\nPerhaps even more bizarre, clause 4 of the bill makes it an offence for a person subject to clause 1 (presumably the leader of a council or other public body) to publish a statement saying that they disagree with it, or what they would do were they not subject to it.\nGadzooks! We only recently passed legislation guaranteeing freedom of speech, yet here we are introducing a vicious restriction on it. Of course, we have to obey the law but surely we have to remain entitled to say we disagree with it and what we might do had it not been implemented.\nI’m an optimist: I’m confident that the Bill won’t get to third reading without being thoroughly amended.",

The Coffee Table Book of Doom is a revelatory, brilliantly funny, superbly illustrated and erudite compendium of all the 27 doom-laden horsemen we need to worry about – personal doom, gender erosion, asteroid impact, pandemics, super storms, sexual ruin – and much more besides.”\nI can’t speak for all 27 doom laden horsemen but at least the prospect of being vaporised in a nanosecond by an asteroid is now less likely than the book suggested because a more recent NASA study has downgraded the threat: apparently there are only half as many threatening asteroids than was previously thought.\nThere is still plenty to worry about. Only the other day I heard that there is a volcano under a lake near Naples rumbling away and if it blows it will make Vesuvius look like a camp fire. The lava lake under Yellowstone Park could go at any moment, taking most of the USA with it. Unfortunately ‘remoaners’ would not be able to blame either on Brexit.\nWith elections in France and Germany next year, and every possibility that Greece or even Italy might still crash out of the Euro, there is plenty that could destabilise one of our major export markets beyond anything that Brexit might be blamed for.\nPersonally, and on the contrary, even on these dark mornings I still wake up – as I have done every morning since the 24rd of June – and my first thought is “we are going to be free again, WE ARE GOING TO BE FREE!”",

We have been regaled with tales of children cowering under desks and pit props and that this is a metaphor for ‘broken Britain’ where nothing works.\nThis, of course, is the same Britain that recovered faster than any other economy from the pandemic; the Britain whose economy has grown faster than France and Germany; The Britain where we are educating one million more pupils in our schools than in 2010. The Britain where we are spending more on educating our children than ever before – by every metric: total cash, total real terms, and per pupil.\nAnd as a consequence of thirteen years of education reforms – all of them opposed tooth and nail by the opposition parties, this is the Britain where we now have the best readers in the western world, where 90% of our schools are rated ‘good’ or ‘outstanding’ and where children from the most challenging backgrounds are now 75% more likely to get to University.\nAs for crumbling concrete, well, this is the Britain where Since 2010, we have invested billions of pounds in school capital. We have opened 650 new free schools. This is Britain, where we launched the priority school building programmes, rebuilding or refurbishing 532 schools between 2012 and 2020. The Britain, where funding for school maintenance and rebuilding will average £2.6 billion a year over this Parliament as a result of a 20% increase on previous years. Indeed, far from cutting budgets this is the Britain where the amount spent last year was the highest in a decade.\nYes, this is the Britain where the BBC (in reality a partisan campaigning organisation) has ‘discovered’ that a number of the schools now with a concrete problem were due for rebuilding by Labour’s ‘Building Schools for the Future’ programme, which the Conservative-led government cancelled in 2010.\nHold on!, That government’s incoming Chief Secretary to the Treasury received a note from his predecessor stating that ‘there is no money left’. Furthermore, that programme was expensive, bureaucratic, involved an elaborate quango, with most of the money being spent before a single brick had been laid, and mostly built with the disastrous Private Finance Initiative which saddled schools and hospitals with interest payments and outrageous management fees for 30 years. It was a rip-off.\nFrom the hyperbole you’d think that that the entire roof really had fallen in.\nOf 22,000 schools about a hundred were identified as a problem. Only four have had to close temporarily.\nAs a former teacher I understand just how unwelcome this whole business is at the very busiest time – the start of the school year.\n(My own school burnt down over a weekend and temporary classrooms had to be in place for Monday morning).\nThe reality is that the problem was known about and being addressed. The government continued to alert local government education authorities to their responsibility to survey, identify and manage the problem. The sudden need to raise the profile urgently now, was entirely down to new technical evidence leading to a change in our understanding of the concrete product itself. It is very inconvenient and disruptive, but we need a sense of proportion: One might be tempted to profanities, but Britain isn’t finished!\nIn the longer term however, let’s raise our game. Why have we been building schools since the nineteen seventies with an expected life-span of merely 30 years?\n-And not very inspiring buildings either.\nThere are plenty of schools all over the country built by the Victorians that are beautiful and still giving good service. We would do well emulate our forebears.",

That money goes much further and helps many more refugees in the region than it does if it is spent in Europe.\nOffering resettlement in Europe costs more, meaning that we can help fewer families; even worse, it encourages a disgusting trafficking trade masterminded by gangsters; and it attracts migrants from well beyond Syria, inducing them too to undertake an all too often fatal journey.\nNever the less, we have implemented resettlement schemes for the most vulnerable refugees selected direct from camps in the region (in order not hold out any incentive that encourages the flow across the Mediterranean and Aegean seas) and we will resettle 20,000 Syrians over the course of this parliament through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement scheme. Of the 4,400 already settled under this scheme so far, half are children.\nUK will also resettle 3,000 children and their families from the wider region. In the last year the Government has granted asylum, or another form of leave to remain, to over 8,000 children.\nThis week the Government announced that, in accordance with section 67 of the Immigration Act (the so-called Dubs amendment), that it will admit 350 children who have already made it to Europe. This number includes over 200 children already transferred from France, and a further 150 over the coming months.\nThe Government was obliged by the Immigration Act to put a specific number on how many children Britain would take based on consultations with local authorities about their capacity to make provision for them. 350 wasn’t just arbitrarily plucked from the air, it was reached after months of consultations with the local authorities about what they can absorb. Finding suitable homes for these children is actually quite difficult and adds to the pressure that already exists, arising from the 3,000 or so unaccompanied asylum-seeking children arrive in Britain every year.\nCurrently many children are camping out in Eastern Europe, in dangerous and frightful conditions, eschewing the shelter and official assistance that is available (and to which we are contributing financially) because they believe that their chances of making it to the UK are better.\nThe bishops and others who demand that we take in more children, need to recognize the hard facts: they are encouraging the flow of children undertaking the risks, and that money will go so much further in providing relief to many more children when spent in the region, rather than drawing them to seek refuge in Western Europe.",

Over the last few weeks I have used this column to debunk these ‘risks’ and to show that there is no economic argument for remaining (as, I believe, there was no economic case for joining in the first place).\nWhat the doom-mongers have completely ignored however, are the very significant risks of remaining in the EU. It is the only trading block in the world that is pursuing the political integration of the nation states of which it is composed. It is the only trading block in the world that has suffered a consistently shrinking share of world trade. It is the only trading block in the world that has attempted to create its own currency.\nThis, as we know, has been an absolute disaster and has left much of the EU stuck in persistent recession, whilst in Britain we have been enjoying the fastest economic growth of the world’s developed economies. This has, in turn, made our growing employment a magnet for EU job seekers, with consequent severe pressures on housing, schools and healthcare.\nHitching ourselves to this permanent EU recession mechanism is bad enough, but there is potentially an even greater danger: That the EU grasps the nettle and makes the necessary political changes that will enable the Euro to work properly as a single EU currency. This will mean centralising sufficient power in Brussels to control taxation and expenditure in the Euro member states.\nOnly ourselves and tiny Denmark will ultimately remain outside these arrangements. Do we really think that their design and implementation in the Euro currency block will take account of our very different interests outside of it?\nParticularly, given that we have already surrendered any negotiating leverage that we would otherwise have had in this process.\nIn effect we are being asked to write a blank cheque. We are invited to remain within an organisation which is about to change dramatically, and in a way that we cannot predict, and over which we will have no control.\nAnd for what?",

This is a private member’s bill which is due to have its second reading early in September. The bill would make it lawful for medical professionals and others to assist someone in committing suicide. The correspondents in favour of the bill were well ahead earlier in the summer but, after a late surge, the antis have caught up. Currently it’s neck and neck.\nMany correspondents tell me it is my duty as their representative to vote in accordance with their wishes. I respond by telling them that my duty is to represent all my constituents, the vast majority of whom have expressed no opinion whatsoever.\nSuicide, and attempted suicide were once criminal offences. The church would even refuse Christian burial to suicides. Nowadays we have rather more understanding and greater compassion. You can now lawfully take your own life. Were anyone to assist you however, they would commit a criminal offence, and it is this that the bill seeks to change.\nThe key change however, is to make suicide easier by allowing medical professionals to provide the required service at the time of the patient’s choosing.\nI have every sympathy for those with terminal medical conditions with gruesome prognoses who, having decided to avoid a grizzly end by terminating their own lives, face the dilemma of going early or delaying too long and losing the physical ability to actually do the deed.\nFor me however, allowing assisted suicide is a step too far. I have no doubt that what starts as a possibility would all too soon become an expectation.

Whilst US negotiations with Putin appear increasingly to be to Ukraine’s disadvantage.\nThe truce in the Black Sea, for example, will free the Russian fleet which Ukraine has successfully confined to port, when Ukraine has already secured its routes for grain exports. Equally, though any relief for Ukraine’s energy structure is welcome, nevertheless the agreement will neuter Ukraine’s most effective strategy which has been to decimate Russia’s oil processing capacity (as I pointed out in this column on 15th Feb: Farage has tied his party’s fate to something over which he has no control )\nOn TV we have witnessed the appalling barbarity of Russian forces in Bakhmut, their ruthless targeting of civilians, the abduction of 700,000 children (the joint statement following US / Russian talks this week made no mention of them, but USA has withdrawn from the international working group investigating these Russian war crimes, and Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, which was tracking 30,000 of the abductees have had their access to US intelligence systems withdrawn)\nDespite our dislike and increasing horror at the way things appear to be turning out, isn’t the US entitled to put its own interests ahead of those of an unimportant far-away country, irrespective of how aggressively Ukraine has been attacked?\nIn answering that question we need to examine the commitments that we in the UK made, together with Russia and the USA.\nIn 1994 Ukraine had the third largest stockpile of nuclear weapons – 1,900 intercontinental nuclear missiles. Enormous pressure was brought to bear in order to get Ukraine to sign up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and divest itself of the weapons. Notwithstanding the resignation of government ministers in protest, Ukraine complied by signing the Bucharest Memorandum at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe on Dec 5 1994.\nIn return for giving up its nuclear weapons it received assurances with respect to its independence and territorial integrity from Russia, USA and UK.\nWhat are those assurances worth?\nThe Ukrainian translation of the memorandum describes them as ‘guarantees’ but the English version only as ‘assurances’. The distinction is that the US and UK did not consider themselves committed to going to war on behalf of Ukraine, as implicit in a ‘guarantee’. Rather, that our commitment was limited to diplomatic and materiel support.\nRussia insists that it has not abrogated the agreement, stating that its undertaking was only not to attack Ukraine with nuclear weapons. This is a monstrous re-writing of the Treaty. In any event, Russia has indeed threatened the use of nuclear weapons.\nI am confident that, thus far, the United Kingdom has honoured its commitment.\nBut, as we watch events unfolding, I believe that we are entitled to ask ‘what is an assurance by the USA now actually worth?’",

This makes huge difficulties for our overstretched teachers. This is a time when schools will have to make herculean efforts rebuild the habits of consideration for others, good behaviour and discipline.\nStrangely, the headmaster of the Harris Westminster Sixth Form in London has chosen this moment to order pupils to desist from addressing beaks as ‘sir’. Instead, they must preface any remarks with the teacher’s title and name, excusing themselves first if they are not sure of the name.\nThe reason given for this imposition is because ‘Sir’ evokes respect and compares unfavourably with the female staff alternative of mere ‘Miss’.\nWell, I certainly wouldn’t want to be called ‘Miss’ but in the Army we called female officers ‘Mam’ which just as respectful as ‘Sir’. Perhaps this woeful headmaster might have thought a bit more carefully and come up with this military solution instead of guff about a “better and more equal world”.\nI suppose it could have been worse.

They are, after all, designed to have a lasting effect on our prosperity in the long term. This isn’t always the case, as we discovered with Kwasi Kwarteng’s autumn statement, all which was largely reversed within weeks.\nYesterday’s budget needs to be judged in the context of events dating back to 2010 when the Coalition Government inherited the most disastrous state of the public finances in peacetime, and a recession worse than any since the 1930ies. Incoming Treasury ministers were left a leaving note by their predecessors announcing that ‘there is no money left’.\nOf absolute necessity, there followed the most significant cuts in public expenditure in order to ‘fix the roof’ as the Chancellor, George Osborne put it, and which he accused Gordon Brown of not doing during the much more advantageous economic circumstances that he had inherited in 1997 – when “the sun was shining”.\nThe Coalition’s financial policy was dubbed ‘Austerity’ by the opposition and it was predicted that it would lead to mass unemployment. On the contrary, as Jeremy Hunt boasted yesterday, it generated 800 new jobs per day, for every day that Conservatives have been in government since 2010.\nAnd It put UK economic growth ahead of the other G7 wealthy economies.\nWithout the successful delivery of that financial policy, Britain would never have been able to access the billions that were needed to keep employment and the economy stable during the pandemic and to weather the economic impact on energy prices delivered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nWithout the ‘headroom’ created by the Coalition’s policy we would have faced the most disastrous of outcomes from either of those shocks to the economy.\nThat we were able to deal with them by hosing them with money, now provides the immediate context for this present budget. The phenomenal costs of business support and furlough, together with the eye-watering bill for subsidising energy bills are the explanation for the level of taxation being at a peacetime record: Record sums spent to get the economy through a pandemic and Russia’s war required record taxation.\nThe task of the Chancellor yesterday was to use what little room to manoeuvre that he had, to plot a path to lower taxes and reduced debt without spooking the markets.\nIn my estimate, he made a reasonable fist of it with a second recent reduction in direct taxation.\nNo doubt, my critics will complain that I have omitted two important factors from the context in which this budget fits: Brexit, and the short-lived Truss premiership.\nI addressed the economic outcome of Brexit previously in this column Brexit Freedom Day (desmondswaynemp.com) . In a nutshell, our relatively good performance in growth, inflation and interest rates compared to the EU suggests that Brexit is not part of the problem.\nI remember well, that was on a train to Oxford to defend the Government’s record at the University debating Union when I heard the news that Kwasi had been dismissed and that the measures that he had set out were to abandoned. Clearly it was a poor wicket on which to go out to bat.\nThe spike in interest rates, most unwelcome to those of us with mortgages, were on the way up in any case, and their trajectory has been similar to those experienced internationally.\nAs I said here at the time Two fingers to Socialist Dogma and Envy (desmondswaynemp.com)\nI approved of all the measures individually and I want to see them all implemented as soon as possible. Kwasi’s mistake was to spook the markets by attempting them all at once, and at the same time as announcing the most generous energy subsidy entertained by any jurisdiction.\nThe modest measures set out yesterday are designed to get us to the same desirable high growth\ndestination to which Kwasi aspired, but -this time- by a secure route.",

I said however, that we would have to await the election result to know which MPs were the turkeys. Well, with the Tories having lost seats, and Labour having gained them, we now know the answer.\nThe Prime Minister’s campaign lacked a strategic object: She set out her aim in Downing Street when she announced the election, saying that it was to secure a position that would enable her to negotiate our departure from the EU from strength. She then published a manifesto however, which failed to sustain that stated aim. It contained 85 pages, offering a range of inducements from free school breakfasts (for which the costs had not been accurately calculated), to a major change to the agreed government policy on funding social care, which was quickly dubbed the ‘dementia tax’. The PM then had to trash her own brand of ‘strong and stable government’ when she carried out a U turn from that manifesto policy.\nI was taught at Sandhurst that the first principle of war is the ‘selection of the aim’, and the second principle is the ‘maintenance of the aim’. Applying that to politics, the PM selected and set out her aim quite clearly in her Downing Street briefing at the outset. Her failure was in the maintenance of that aim: the disastrous manifesto distracted attention from her objective.\nThis was compounded when events intervened in the form of the terrorist outrages, and the PM was not particularly successful at articulating a defence of her policy and achievements on policing during her time as Home Secretary.\nIn addition to the failure to maintain the aim, the PM’s performances lacked charisma and authenticity. Altogether, it was a dreadful campaign. Yet, more people voted Conservative than have done so since 1992, and the PM secured the highest share of the vote since Mrs Thatcher in 1983.\nThe triumphalism of Labour needs to be tempered by the fact that, notwithstanding their gains, after 7 years of Conservative austerity and a shockingly bad Conservative election campaign, they are still some 60 seats behind the Conservatives: they didn’t even come close.",

Whilst some might say it was his own contributory negligence for loitering in the vicinity of the Tory Party conference in Manchester, I told him that he should wear it as a badge of honour.\nI am afraid that I missed all the demonstrators: these are folk who do not rise early, and as I was always up with the lark and into the secure zone before 9 AM, there were never any demonstrators about.\nBy all accounts however, when they did get there they thoroughly enjoyed themselves hurling abuse at almost any passer-by. There were a couple of left wing media commentators who were really quite hurt to be called ‘Tory scum’. When they hurled more than just abuse their aim was often no more accurate: Boris Johnson had the best line, demanding the reintroduction of ball games in schools to revive these essential skills, given that the mob had missed him with every projectile that they had thrown.\nOn that basis perhaps Colm Lock’s egg was just a luck strike. Nevertheless, he can be justifiably proud of it. I recall the pride that I felt when I was struck by an egg in Wednesbury Market when I was fighting the West Bromwich West constituency in the 1992 general election – it was on the same day that John Major also took a direct hit with an egg. I took the view that, whilst I was in no danger of actually winning the seat, if I was important enough for someone to take the trouble to buy an egg and throw it at me, then I really had made my mark politically.\nThe spectacle of the demonstrations does however, beg the question of what has happened to the ‘gentler’ politics which Jeremy Corbyn announced that he would be ushering in?\nIt has been fascinating to watch a body of Labour supporters retreat into their comfort zone, readopting the ideology and modus operandi that served them so ill in the early nineteen eighties, but at least they appear to be enjoying themselves – whatever the electoral consequences might turn out to be.",

I’ll elaborate: the historical context was a series of riots from 1710 onwards including the 1714 Coronation Riots, sparked by the arrival of our first Hanoverian George. All of which was made much more complex by a change of government from Tories to Whigs, High Church agitation, and the possibility of an alternative monarchy under the Old Pretender, James Stuart (son of James II, who was deposed in 1688).\nThe Act enabled the proper authorities to require the dispersal of any gathering of more than 12 persons within an hour of the proclamation, on pain of death!\nThe efficiency of legislating for a modernised version of that measure is that it relieves the police and prosecuting authorities of the difficulties in securing evidence of any criminal act, beyond merely being present at the scene, after the warning that everyone must disperse.\nThere are all sorts of tensions within our nation that politicians, Clergy, and communities need to address. But I believe that it is a mistake to discuss how they might be addressed, or who and what are the causes of them, in the context of the riots to which they may have been a contributing factor. To do so, in my estimate, is to come too close to explaining them as if they may be an understandable, even a predictable expression of social discontent. The mere inference of such causality has already got our own Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner into very hot water.\nThe proper and immediate concern is the one that the authorities have quite properly already taken: to respond with force and swift sentencing.\nMy contention is that this would be assisted in future, were we to legislate for a new riot act.\n*\nThe alleged author of the original misinformation on social media, that the Southport murders were the work of an asylum seeker who had arrived on a cross-channel dingy, has been arrested and detained. The key issue for any conviction will hinge, not on whether the information was false, but upon her intent -the mens rea.\nIncitement to violence and disorder is a crime. irrespective of veracity of the information provided.\nThe Government’s suggestion that they might now reopen the distinction within Online safety Act between what is lawful and what may be harmful, strikes me as very unwise. Parliament invested a great deal of time and debate on this distinction, and the provisions of the Act are only now being sequentially implemented. Enabling governments to censor information that they deem ‘harmful’ though if falls short of ‘criminal’ is to provide a standing challenge to freedom of expression.\nSo, what if the fake news on social media had actually been correct, what if the Southport murders had indeed, been the work of an asylum seeker?\nThe suggestion by a couple of my correspondents that, had this been the case, the violent public expression of anger would have been understandable, is utterly grotesque. The response of rioting to the tragedy of Southport is no more justifiable than would have been the case had there been any such public reaction to the monstrous murder in 1996 of 16 children by Thomas Hamilton in Dunblane. The radical depravity of mankind is equally distributed between all classes and ethnicities.\nDivine intervention is our only possible redemptor in that respect.\nThe connection, now under investigation, between rioters and football hooligans may be instructive.\nSome people just enjoy violent disorder as a form of recreation. They need little excuse.\nThe purpose of the state must be to provide a sufficient deterrent: bring back the Riot Act.",

The Triple Lock is Government policy and has been for a long time.\nAs happens each year, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is required by law to undertake an annual review of benefits and the State Pension. The outcome of that review will be announced in the autumn, following the publication of the relevant indices by the Office for National Statistics in October, and the new rates will take effect from April 2024.\nIn April, the State Pension saw its biggest ever rise, increasing by 10.1 per cent. The full yearly amount of the basic State Pension is over £3,050 higher, in cash terms, than in 2010. That’s £790 more than if it had been uprated by prices, and £945 more than if it had been uprated by earnings (since 2010).\nThe Government also provides additional support to older people, which includes the provision of free bus passes, free prescriptions, and Winter Fuel Payments, with Cold Weather Payments for those in receipt of Pension Credit.\nDS",

In turn, she is practised at extracting information about what has happened during the night: have they been harassed by the authorities, or anyone else, are there any injuries or are any of them sick?\nA new boy is brought forward by the others, his first night, he hasn’t slept because he was too frightened.\nThe street worker asks the others to bring him to our centre later in the morning, and we move on to check-in with other groups of boys of different ages close by.\nI ask about girls. I’m told that you won’t find them: they hide themselves away because it’s much more dangerous for girls.\nWe did however, see a young mother packing-up her bedding and hoisting her baby onto her back.\nBy 7.30 we’re having coffee at a stall on a market square, stallholders and street vendors are setting-up shop. Many of the boys that we saw earlier are congregating round some burning cardboard for warmth. Others are buying something to eat –they have some earnings from fetching and carrying for the vendors.\nA motorcyclist stops and gives 1000 shillings to a vendor to distribute ten buns amongst the boys, apparently he comes by and does it every day.\nWe end up back in our centre, little more than an old classroom a few hundred yards away, little boys and girls are making things with putty and playing games, and a ‘pop-up’ school comes by.\nThe new boy sits with a social worker. He has had enough and wants to go home, but it’s a very long way. Our family workers will have to check it out and address the issues that led him to run away before he can be re-integrated with his family with appropriate follow-up.\nLater that evening I saw him accommodated in a very basic but cheerful and loving short-term shelter: The emphasis is to avoid long term institutionalisation.\nAlso that day, I saw the mutual support groups that the charity sets-up and assists with help and advice until they are in a position where members can be supported with a loan or training to get a livelihood and somewhere to stay. The high point was meeting seven older boys who had been trained at the technical college over the last two months in shoe-making.

(Consequently, we have tumbled from the top of the European league table of countries where most people own their own homes, down almost to the bottom. Economists insist that there is nothing particularly wrong with this, after all, look to Germany, where a majority are content to rent throughout their lives, but I am a politician not an economist and we are not Germans. My alarm bell rings because most of us still aspire to own our own homes, and it just won’t do if we can’t.)\nClearly, the economics all this requires such an increase in housing supply as to bring about a reduction in house prices and rents.\nThe forth most frequent thing that constituents write to me about however, is that whenever there is a housing development proposal, they complain that they don’t want it built anywhere them.\nSo, how to square this circle?\nThere is nothing new under the sun: Go back a hundred years and you will find that politicians were wrestling even then over how to solve the housing problem.\nOver the years all sorts of things have been tried, some with modest success, and some with consequences the very reverse of what was intended: perhaps the best example of this being the introduction of rent controls which led to a drastic reduction in accommodation available, and a significant deterioration in the quality of that which remained.\nLast year 217,000 houses were built, which is better than in any of the previous 18 years, but there is a big backlog of under-building to address.\nThere is no silver bullet.\nAt the Conservative Party conference there was a proposal to give incentives to landlords to sell to their tenants. It’s a helpful initiative, but it changes only the tenure not the total supply.\nHere are some other suggestions.\nFirst, the evolution of the new local planning process may, over time, lead to a reduction in the level of protest over proposed housing developments. Local politicians, instead of having housing targets imposed upon them, will assess the genuine local housing need and -knowing their own ‘patch’- designate the places where building can be more sympathetically accommodated. That process will be strengthened when they can also specify the type and even the style of development.\nAt present so much of this discretion is in the hands of the developers rather than the community.\nSecond, we need a much better quality of dwelling. I am inundated with complaints about poor quality of newly built houses, and the fact that the individual purchasers are at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with large developers when things have to be put right. There needs to be a better balance in these disputes. I am glad that a minister already working on what can be done.\nThird, to address that part of the market where private sector developers have little incentive and interest, we just have to get councils building again. The very recent lifting of the cap -which had been placed on the ability of councils to borrow against the security of the flow of future rental revenue, in order to fund development, ought now to get things moving.\nSocial housing however, should be for need, not for life. It is unreasonable for people to be allocated social housing on the basis of need, yet to remain in it so many years later when their income and family circumstances have changed dramatically.\nPerhaps most controversially, we should consider the price of land. The extortionate value of building land encourages development suitable to the most expensive end of the market and drastically reduces the scope for building something affordable for the first-time buyer.\nIt encourages ‘land-banking’ –the hogging of land by speculators in the expectation that when planning permission is granted their land will be worth many multiples of what they paid.\nTheir capital gain will be taxed, of course, but notwithstanding the historic right to dispose of property at the best price that the market will bear, ought we to artificially put a cap on it?\nFinally, I offer my sympathy, but no apology to the many buy-to-let landlords who have written to complain to me about the phased withdrawal of tax relief on their principal cost of doing business, namely on their mortgage interest payments.\nThe simple fact is that this relief put them at an advantage against every first time buyer in the market, it meant they could afford to offer more to secure a purchase: it just wasn’t fair.",

Overwhelmingly, correspondence was delivered by a postman. The strength of a constituent’s opinion on a matter, and the determination to convey that opinion to their MP, would be tempered by the need to write a letter and purchase a stamp.\nNow that foxhunting is back on the parliamentary agenda however, there is no similar restraint: your MP is only one easy click away. Consequently, I have had to spend much of my time clearing my inbox of hundreds of emails – in equal numbers from constituents on either side of the hunting argument.\nI am afraid that many of my correspondents have got quite the wrong end of the stick. This week’s parliamentary proceedings are not about the principle of the hunting act and they do not seek to amend it. The Government has laid a statutory instrument before Parliament in response to the complaints of upland farmers about the problem of foxes killing lambs. The statutory instrument makes a number of small changes to regulations, not to the Hunting Act itself, to align them to what currently works in Scotland.\nThese technical amendments to the regulations will not lift the ban on hunting with dogs: Changes to regulations, secondary legislation (like statutory instruments) cannot be used to defeat the purpose of the original Act . The Hunting Act will remain in place and will continue to prohibit the pursuit and killing of a wild animal by dogs. What the changes do is to amend the exemptions – that Members on all sides of the House of Commons agreed during the passage of the Act – where they are necessary for the purposes of “pest control”.\nThe purpose of the amendments to the regulations is to:\nEnable farmers and gamekeepers to make a judgement, based on the terrain and other circumstances, as to whether it is appropriate to use more than two dogs to flush out foxes and other wild mammals. This is particularly important in upland areas where the use of two dogs across large and difficult areas of ground, often covered by woodland, is not regarded as effective or practical. There is no limit on the number of dogs that can be used in Scotland;\nTo maintain the current restrictions of only one dog being used below ground in stalking and flushing out animals, but to enable the current provision for the protection of game and wild birds to be extended to livestock as well. This amendment will help provide upland farmers with an additional tool against livestock predation. A dog may be used below ground for a much wider range of purposes in Scotland;\nTo amend the requirement to produce evidence of land ownership or landowner consent in cases where a dog is used below ground. In Scotland there is no such requirement. This amendment will mean that the evidence does not need to be carried by the person carrying out the activity but can be presented at a police station within seven days. This is in line with the timeframe for presenting a driving licence under road traffic law;\nTo extend the scope of the “rescue” exemption to include “diseased” animals. This is a logical extension of the provision that enables hunting to be undertaken to relieve a wild mammal of suffering when it is injured.\nThese changes do not lift the ban on hunting with dogs and whilst placing greater trust in farmers and gamekeepers – those who know the land and terrain they operate on best – the controls remain more restrictive than those in Scotland. Any pests still have to be killed by shooting, and not by the dogs.\nFoxhunting with a pack of hounds in the traditional sense that we have known it, remains banned. That is a battle that has yet to be refought. The Government had a manifesto commitment to put it to a free vote. I don’t know when that vote will come, but when it does, I am confident that my email inbox will know all about it.",

My word, there will have to be a major effort to manage expectations in paradise).\nMuch better to imprison them for life so that they have years of boredom in which to dwell upon the virgins (or raisins) that they are presently going without.\nThe first priority however, is to secure a conviction rather to put the cart before the horse and fret about the punishment.\nThe Government had exactly the right priority in furnishing the United States with the intelligence and evidence that it held against the two alleged terrorists so that they could be brought to trial, without making our assistance conditional on the outcome of any trial (by securing an assurance that, in the event of conviction the death penalty would not be invoked).\nThat the Government has had to suspend its assistance to the USA because of a legal challenge from the mother of one of the accused, illustrates just what a mess our Human Rights law is now in.\nAs I’ve made clear, for these particular individuals, if guilty, there are better punishments, but that must be a matter for the judgement of the court in the jurisdiction in which they are to be tried.\nIf we have evidence that could convict gruesome murderers we should provide it irrespective of what punishment may await them.\nThe great roar of indignation in Parliament earlier this week about the Government’s failure first to secure a ‘no death penalty’ assurance from USA before giving our assistance, is another measure of how out- of-step our ‘great and good’ political class has become from the people that they are supposed to represent.\nIn my experience the good people of these islands are not so squeamish about the possibility of the death penalty as their liberal- minded politicians appear to be.",

Some of its agenda is just so daft that it becomes funny, or infuriating, dependent entirely on one’s natural disposition. Other aspects of it strike me as just politeness and gentleness. I shudder to recall some of the terrible things that we called one another at school, which now would be considered beyond the pale.\nI doubt that Donald Trump and Sarah Champion would welcome being linked in any way. For my own part I do not see the link between the news stories about them that my correspondents think they have identified.\nMy email correspondents insist that President Trump was right to condemn the violent behaviour of anti-fascists at the same time as he deplored the violence of neo-Nazi demonstrators in Charlottesville.\nI hold no brief for agitators who hijack every issue from the Grenfell Tower, to trade union disputes, to anti-racism, or whatever. On 9th July, in this column, I pointed out the similarity they bear to the ‘sans culottes’ of the French Revolution. In my estimate the fascism of so many anti-fascists differs little from UK to USA.\nThe fact is however, that a known neo-Nazi committed an act of terrorism by using his car as a weapon to kill a woman. Any attempt to add a ‘but’ in those circumstances creates the impression of some sort of excuse, be it ‘they started it’ or ‘the other side are just as bad’. That, in my opinion was the President’s error of judgement.\nAs for the notion that there were ‘good people’ demonstrating with the neo-Nazis, surely the sacrifice made across Europe and USA in defeating Nazism should warrant that anyone parading with swastikas should attract the universal condemnation.\nThat there is a wider agenda at stake involving the survival of US heritage and monuments commemorating the Civil War is an irrelevance when it comes to condemning a terrorist murder.\nI have sympathy with some critics of the iconoclasts. We have seen campaigns here to judge the past by the standards of the present and to remove statues and change names. Are we to demand that statues of Roman emperors be removed from public view on the grounds that they too supported slavery?\nThe prophet Muhammad condoned the sale of captives into slavery too, crikey! now we really are getting into politically correct hot water.\nAs for Sarah Champion, her analysis was correct and she should have stuck to her guns. It is nonsense to speak of a problem with ‘Asian men’ grooming white underage girls in Rotherham and other northern towns. How many Chinese are involved, how many Indonesians, how many Tamils? Why should all Asian men be so branded when the reality is that the problem is with a tiny proportion of men from Pakistani backgrounds?\nWe need to say so, and recruit their own communities in condemning their behaviour.

Notwithstanding her youth, the loss of two children, and just having given birth to a third, my correspondents have little sympathy for her. To be fair, she hasn’t helped with her own comments to journalists about having no regrets, and for trying to justify the 2017 Manchester bombing that murdered the children of others.\nWe have had two sessions on this in the Commons and I found myself having to make the same point to the Home Secretary on both occasions.\nAlthough, he would not address Mrs Begum’s case specifically, the objective is to resist the return of as many Daesh fighters and their camp-followers from Syria as we possibly can.\nEstimates vary, but we are talking about several hundred, of which just less than half have already managed to slip back.\nThe Home secretary was robust in announcing his intention to use all the powers available to him to keep them out, including stripping them of UK citizenship. True to his word, he then stripped Mrs Begum of her citizenship.\nThe problem is that the ability to take away citizenship only applies in cases where dual nationality is held. The Home secretary has already lost a number of legal challenges and I have every confidence that after a few rounds in the courts Mrs Begum will recover her citizenship and arrive back in full expectation of access to public services, housing and benefits.\nOf course, she will be subject to police enquiries as to what UK laws she broke in Syria as a Jihadi bride, but then we can imagine the difficulty of securing credible evidence and witnesses sufficient to sustain any charges beyond reasonable doubt.\nWith literally hundreds of these cases our resources will be swamped. Indeed, they already are.\nOur regime for monitoring suspected terrorists is extraordinarily expensive and demanding of police time. The old ‘control orders’ introduced by Labour were difficult enough to administer, but then, at the insistence of the Liberal Democrats in the coalition government, they were revamped and emerged as TPIMs – an even more complicated and expensive arrangement.\nThe reality is that we cannot rely on the courts to deliver security in the face of this returning threat.\nThere is an expedient to which we have had recourse in the past both in wartime and during heightened terrorist threat: internment. Or, as it is properly known, ‘executive detention’.\nIt is not a silver bullet, and certainly it needs to be selectively and intelligently applied.\nSome experts argue that it was counterproductive in Northern Ireland: that the intelligence was poor, leading to many of the wrong people being interned with consequent greater opportunities for radicalization. Also, that the circumstances in which they were accommodated facilitated that process of radicalization.\nIf however, we learn from those mistakes, internment could be a useful tool for more effectively taking out of society a large number of returnees, at least until they are sufficiently assessed and quarantined.",

I am also fortunate to receive briefings from the dedicated experts Tony Gent and Owain Masters.\nThe range of the smooth snake (coronella austriaca) is limited to our lowland heaths like much of the New Forest. Britain accounts for 20% of the World’s total lowland heath.\nThe smooth Snake is what is known as an ‘umbrella species’ because it serves as a flagship for promoting conservation of its own habitats and also that of many other species. Smooth snakes are recognised as a conservation priority in Britain, are fully protected by law and identified as key feature in many sites with conservation designations.\nSmooth snakes will have been active since late March, when the warming weather would have brought them out of hibernation. Having mated from in April and May, the females will be basking in the sun with the next generation being born from mid-August to early October.\nThough there is the danger that welcome warm dry weather, brings with it an increased risk of heath fires, which can be devastating to local smooth snake and reptile populations. So don’t barbeque in the Forest.\nCurrent proposals for Species Abundance Targets under the provisions of the Environment Act 2021 do not include any reptile species so I will have to keep badgering Rebecca Pow, the responsible minister, using the data provided by Tony and Martin as ammunition, in order to see that this deficiency is addressed. The key point being that reptiles are a ‘weathervane’ for so much else in terms of biodiversity and healthy habitats.\nThe Snakes in the Heather project, run by Amphibian & Reptile Conservation and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, started in 2019, has the smooth snake as its flagship species. The project is a volunteer-based wildlife survey to raise awareness of reptiles within local communities with both public events and school-based activities across the range of the smooth snake in southern England. The project is giving many more people an understanding and appreciation of smooth snakes and all of our native reptile species, leading to improvements in habitat condition.\nOver 200 people are now trained to survey for smooth snakes using the latest technology developed for the project. – Preliminary habitat suitability models have been completed for smooth snake, adder and sand lizards allowing us to ensure the survey programme targets potential gaps together with historic locations and known populations.\nOver 2000 children have received lessons about the UK’s reptile species. There has been coverage on the Countryfile TV programme. A Snakes in the Heather children’s story book In Search of Old Uncle Blue has been published. We are looking at developing a campaign around raising the profile of smooth snake over the coming year, to involve a number, conservation organisations and schools – and hopefully local businesses.\nWildlife Conservation and habitat restoration needs to be high on our political agenda if our planet, as we have known it, is to survive.",

The ministerial resignations from the Department of State for Exiting The EU are testimony to the fact that those ministers discovered that 10 Downing Street was negotiating quite separately and keeping them in the dark.\nSecond, She insisted that ‘no deal would be better than a bad deal’, but to sustain that position it would have been essential to have begun preparations for a no deal Brexit even before the Article 50 negotiations had started. Indeed, a proper analysis of all the necessary measures and the time it would take to implement them should have preceded the Article 50 process. Only then could the mantra ‘no deal better than a bad deal’ have been taken seriously by EU negotiators.\nThird, and perhaps the biggest mistake, was to have accepted the EU’s demand for the sequencing of negotiations so that there could be no discussion of future trading arrangements until a financial settlement was agreed: never agree a price before you’ve seen the product.\nWhether the Government can now recover the confidence of the nation under a new prime minister, it’s too soon to tell",

Is there really an appetite to get even more involved in another conflict in that deeply troubled region?\nI hope so, but I have not yet detected it.\nIn my response to the emails I pointed out that the key moment of our failure came in August 2013 when Assad previously used chemical weapons, crossing President Obama’s declared ‘red line’. Instead of taking the threatened punitive action, neither the USA nor the UK did so. Indeed, in Parliament we voted down the Government’s request to take action: we chose explicitly to do nothing. Inaction can have dreadful consequences as the children and parents of Khan Sheikhoun have now discovered.\nIn 2013 Russia, though involved, had not deployed its own forces to any great extent, so our freedom to respond militarily would have been much greater than it is now, when the risk of a clash with Russia is so much greater. Of course I said that two days before President Trump did take the risk of responding militarily, it is far too soon to tell what the consequences will be.\nTo be fair, I think our biggest misjudgement came much earlier than August 2013. Our failure was at the very outset of the rebellion in 2011, through our refusal to arm the Free Syrian Army. We supported its objectives but we sent it only medical supplies and radios. The consequence was, as a fighting force, it was completely overtaken by the vastly better armed and financed Islamist militias.\nRussia’s initial response to the US military action has to be to condemn it as an ‘act of aggression against a sovereign state contrary to international law’.\nThis doctrine that sovereign states can act with complete impunity within their own borders goes back to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia which ended the 30 years war in Europe. Russia may still adhere to it, but the rest of the civilised world has moved on: Chapter VII of the UN Charter allows action to be taken in the interests of international peace and security.\nThe carnage and suffering in Syria has now lasted longer than the Second World War, and with profound and destabilising consequences for Europe.

Unfortunately, hot on the heels of its announced revocation of regulations to safeguard freedom of expression in our universities, the new government is indicating that it will adopt and implement the All-Party Parliamentary Group’s definition\nI should point that the designation of ‘All-Party Parliamentary Group’ does not convey any more authoritative status than that there are at least twenty self-selected parliamentarians (of both Lords & Commons) that share a ‘bee in their bonnet’ on the subject about which they’ve chosen to form their group.\nThe central weakness about this group’s definition is that it is manifestly absolute nonsense: Islam is a religion and not a race. It is comprised of adherents from many different races, in exactly the same way as is Christianity.\nThe central danger of defining a religion as a race is that any robust criticism of dogma or practice, then becomes a form of ‘racism’. In our free society where we have had a long tradition of, biblical criticism, it would be outrageous to exempt Islam, or any other religion, from the sort of critique to which Christianity has been, and remains subject.\nAs a Christian, I’m entitled to say that there are aspects of religion are a bit ‘wacky’ (though, surely, Mormonism has to be wackiest of all) and that people of any religion or none, have every right to say so, without receiving a visit from the thought police.\nThus far, the charge in defence of freedom has been led by the Sikhs who have written to the Government lobbying against adoption of the definition. They argue that they would no longer be free to teach the history of their own religious struggle and the martyrdom of their gurus at the hands of the Mughal empire as it expanded Islamic hegemony in the Indian sub-continent by military conquest.\nI’m not convinced that they are correct, I very much doubt that their history lessons could fall within the scope and I think there are much more pressing dangers that might shield aspects of Islam from quite proper scrutiny. Nevertheless, the very fact that Sikhs are alarmed at the proposals is itself significant. Indeed, police chiefs lobbied against the definition because they were concerned about the impact it would have on community harmony.\nIt is a very bad Idea",

Some of my correspondents have got the wrong end of the stick, likening it to the takeover of Cadbury by Kraft back in 2010, they appear not to have spotted that Melrose is a UK enterprise just as much as is GKN.\nI have not been able to get excited about it. GKN has been a great British enterprise with an illustrious history, but with respect to the takeover bid, I think it had it coming.\nFor the last few years the performance at GKN has been less than impressive. The impression was of a company coasting, event slacking, and senior management lacking focus and energy.\nMelrose, on the other hand, has performed formidably and has a record of refocusing enterprises on their core business and sharpening the management. As for the fear that parts of the business will be sold off, there is nothing unusual about that, it can often be the sensible thing to do, and apparently GKN was planning to do that itself anyway\nOne great British enterprise bought-up by another successful British enterprise, is not a great headline, that is why it has been dressed up with all that pejorative stuff about ‘asset-strippers’ and ‘greedy city hedge funds’.\nMy perspective different: it’s one of free markets exercising a discipline that keeps companies and their managements on their toes, performing at the top of their game.\nJust suppose however, that Melrose had been a foreign-owned undertaking. Would my attitude be different?\nIt would not. I believe in free trade and the free movement of capital, from which we prosper more than most: In the UK we own more overseas assets per head of population than almost any other country in the world. The profits from which flow back into UK coffers. It is something we have been doing for generations. As the greatest of ‘offenders’ we are hardly in a position to complain when somebody else buys-up something British.\nI felt that all the angst about Cadbury was rather misplaced. Traditional British chocolate manufacturer, still informed by the social values of its Quaker founders, swallowed-up by multinational giant. Not quite!\nRemember, whilst Cadbury was indeed once a traditional Quaker confectioner, it had itself become a voracious and acquisitive predator, it was after all actually Cadbury-Schweppes.\nIf companies want to fund their expansion and investment in one of the most effective ways available, raising the capital by selling shares, then we must accept that shareholders have a right to realise their own investment and sell the shares when, and to whom they choose. To seek to interfere with that right will drive capital from our shores and kill the goose that is laying the golden eggs.",

This week the newly appointed minister with special responsibility for the vaccine programme suggested instead, that having the vaccine would be a ‘passport’ to being able to do things that might otherwise be denied -such as visiting a pub, cinema, or using public transport.\nFor months worried constituents have been contacting me to voice their fears that vaccination would be compulsory. I have responded by saying that they should not worry because it is unthinkable.\nUnder existing law it would constitute an assault: So primary legislation in Parliament would be required to enable it, and that in my estimate a majority would not be found for such a radical departure. It would set a worrying precedent for other vaccines, medicines and medical procedures.\nI expect however, that the concept of a vaccination certificate being used as a passport to freedoms and opportunities which would otherwise be denied, might be more palatable -superficially at least.\nIt might be done by statute setting out what may or may not be done without having had the vaccination. Or it might be left to the discretion of operators and proprietors whether to admit non-vaccinated patrons to their venues and services.\nIt raises an interesting philosophical question which is by no means new: Are our rights fundamental and absolute, or are they to be balanced by our responsibilities to society at large through some legislative process, democratic or otherwise?\nIf you take the latter view you might conclude that a citizen has a responsibility be vaccinated to protect the community as a whole, and if that responsibility is not accepted, then it would be reasonable to withhold rights and freedoms.\nI have often had to produce my Yellow Fever vaccination certificate to enter those countries where it is a legal requirement.\nThere does seem to me however, to be something repugnant about being coerced into having a medical procedure, it would certainly be a departure from long established limits.\nThere is however, a practical solution without troubling the philosophers. The herd immunity that vaccination promotes can be achieved with vaccination rates that fall well short of everyone having had the jab. We should be able to make the vaccine effective whilst tolerating the non-cooperation of conscientious objectors.\nOverwhelmingly, most of us will have the jab because we recognise that it is in our own self-interest, as well as the interests of everyone else.\nAs I said in the Commons, there are ways of promoting the vaccine without any need to coerce: line up the PM, ministers and all their loved ones to take it first, demonstrating the confidence of our rulers in its safety. Second, mount a public information campaign, fronted by our most popular celebrities and personalities.\nThe last thing you should contemplate is coercion of any kind. Nothing could be more calculated to play into the hands of the conspiracy theorists. It would end horribly with public disorder on a scale with which we have hitherto been relatively unfamiliar.\nHappily, it appears that the minister who suggested vaccination as ‘passport’ appears to have been slapped down, but I’ll remain vigilant.",

My response is always to say that I am inclined to abide by the ‘advice’ that my constituents gave me in that referendum.\nThis issue of an ‘advisory referendum’ however, goes to the heart of the question now dividing the nation.\nIn terms of pure constitutional theory my correspondents are correct: Parliament is sovereign and is not bound by any expression of public opinion, even when given in a lawfully and properly organised referendum.\nPractical political realities are rather different: Parliament and Government clearly indicated to the voters that the issue of EU membership would be settled by the outcome of the 2016 referendum.\nMost voters, whichever way they voted, were prepared to accept that.\nWhat has so angered the nation and prolonged the agonising process is an ‘establishment’, so over-represented in Parliament, and determined to reverse the decision that we made in 2016.\nFrom the very start this ‘fifth column’ has sought to undermine the Government’s negotiations by signalling to the EU that concessions were unnecessary because any agreement would be rejected in Parliament. The intention has been to prolong the process, exasperating and boring the public in equal measure, until the authority of the 2016 referendum is sufficiently eroded.\nThis really is now a question of Parliament against the people. It is too soon to know which will prevail. Were Parliament to succeed in preventing BREXIT, the damage to our democracy would be profound. We would awake and find ourselves in a different country, a country where democracy had been defeated. Many would not trouble themselves to vote again, the process having been proven to be pointless.\nThe stakes are very high indeed",

Either that, or they are just too polite to disagree.\nI am no different. Almost everyone I speak to appears to agree with me that our response to Covid19 has been a disastrous overreaction.\nIt a hard thing to say when so many people have died of the disease, many of whom were relatively young and with no other health problems. Nevertheless for the vast majority of us the experience of catching the disease is mild to imperceptible. Yet our disproportionate response has been to close down our economy with devastating consequences for employment and incomes, with all the health problems -both mental and physical- that will flow from their diminution.\nWe have prioritised our healthcare system to the enormous disadvantage of anyone suffering from conditions other than Covid19, which will cause much suffering and many deaths.\nAnd we have devastated education by closing schools.\nTo cap it all, we have sacrificed our liberty to the extent that we are now told whom, when and where me may meet, marry, worship, or whatever. And even what we must wear.\nAll this might be bearable (though personally I doubt it) given the prospect that it is only to be short-lived. The announcement yesterday however, poured cold water on any such notion. There was a deeply chilling note in the Chief Scientist’s observation that we may have reached the limit of possibilities with respect to easing of restrictions.\nWe appear to be at the mercy of these scientists. And our only prospect of relief is scientific advance in the form of a vaccine or a cure, neither of which is guaranteed.\nYet the science which has imprisoned us is controversial. There is another point of view and course of action: whilst taking care to protect those who are particularly vulnerable, to allow the natural process of ‘herd immunity’ to build up amongst the rest of us so that the virus has much less opportunity to spread.\nI said almost everyone I speak to agrees with me. Well, I’m not stupid: I know they tell me what I want to hear; they email me because they’ve already heard that I agree with them.\nNevertheless, there is clearly a difference of opinion amongst scientists and amongst the public in general.\nSo, the key question for me as an elected representative -in what is supposed to be a democracy -is this: why is there so little debate in Parliament about the measures that have been forced upon us and the science that justifies them?\nOn occasions I have found myself as almost a lone voice in opposition to the Government’s chosen course of action.\nMost shocking of all, I have never had the opportunity to legislate: I have neither voted for nor against any of the laws that now govern and constrain our social intercourse and which the police have the power to enforce.\nThe Government simply rules by decree, without argument or challenge in Parliament.\nIt does so using powers granted to it in the Public Health Act 1984.\nI have said it before, but it bears repetition: how prescient George Orwell was in his choice of that year in naming his dystopian novel.",

However, often families feel that this is not the case with killer drivers. I am encouraged the Government is taking action to put this right.\nI welcome the fact that the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill will increase the maximum penalties for causing death by dangerous driving and death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drugs to life imprisonment.\nIn addition, it is the case that there is a gap in the law relating to serious injury.

Since when it has been given fairly rough treatment in the Lords.\nWhen we exited the EU we retained all EU laws to provide a period of continuity and stability. It also afforded us the time to examine each of them in detail to see if we wanted to keep them, amend them or remove them. The Bill gives ministers the power to do this with a default setting that they will lapse, if not specifically retained, by 31st December this year.\nIt is vital to our productivity that we remove this ball and chain of red tape that holds us back from experiencing the economic benefits of having left the EU.\nThe principal argument that has been made against the bill is that the procedure allowing ministers to make these decisions about what to retain and what to discard, lacks democratic accountability and that Parliament should debate each one of the 4000 pieces of legislation.\nAs I said in this column of 26th April Frost in Morocco (desmondswaynemp.com) this would effectively delay the process for years. In effect it would be a wrecking measure.\nI rather suspect that it owes more to a determination to keep us close to the EU regulatory orbit, in the hope that one day we may re-join, than it does to a fastidious preference for parliamentary scrutiny.\nAs for democracy, the reality is that these laws were made in the EU Council of Ministers by qualified majority voting and in secrecy – not even a transcript of the deliberations. The swifter we review them the better.\nI hope I am mistaken, but I suspect that ministers are beginning to get cold feet. There is a very significant volume of work to be done. Officials will have to go through all the legislation and offer ministers advice on the options. It will be hard work.\nIs it achievable whilst officials work from home?\nWill some in Whitehall resist on the basis of their ideological objections to the whole concept of completing Brexit?\nI think the Prime Minister needs to appoint someone from the business world with a track record of successful delivery to grip this entire endeavour, which is in danger that it just isn’t going to get done. Perhaps another Tsar?\n*\nAs a postscript, I see that the civil service unions want to negotiate a four-day week with no loss of pay, such will be their claimed increased productivity.\nI once worked for a firm that retained the 3 Day week, imposed during the miner’s strike in 1973, for a couple of years afterwards because of their very real increased productivity. Alas, they ended it because it didn’t work for their customers who wanted contact 5 days per week.\nThis will prove the rub for the public who need the services provided.\nMuch of the work of my office is spent contacting public sector organisations on behalf of constituents who have had difficulty making contact themselves. There is no doubt that this has become so much harder and more frustrating since the arrival of ‘working from home’.\nI don’t believe we should even consider the possibility of a shorter working week until they are all back in the office and we can actually measure their productivity.",

As I said in this column almost exactly a year ago, I haven’t. On the contrary this is the first Government to set a clear requirement for water companies to reduce sewage discharges. Water companies are having to invest £3.1 billion now to deliver 800 storm overflow improvements across England by 2025, which will reduce discharges by 25%.\nThe fact is that we previously had little idea how much foul water was being discharged, because it simply wasn’t being measured: In 2016, only 5% of storm overflows were monitored. Following the action of this Government, almost 90% are now monitored, and by next year 100% of all storm overflows will be required to have monitors fitted. This new information has allowed regulators to take action against water companies. The Environment Agency and Ofwat have launched the largest criminal and civil investigations into water companies ever, at more than 2,200 treatment works, following the improvements that have been made to secure the monitoring data. That follows 54 prosecutions against water companies since 2015, totting-up fines of nearly £140 million.\nIt is now a legal requirement for companies to provide discharge data to the Environment Agency and make it available to the public within an hour of the discharge. That’s what I voted for. The Environment Act that will clean up our rivers and restore our water with tough new duties to tackle sewage overflows for the first time.\nOfwat is currently working up proposals that will enable it to take enforcement action against companies that do not link dividend payments for shareholders to their environmental performance.\nLast month the Government laid before Parliament the storm overflows discharge reduction plan which starts the largest investment in infrastructure ever undertaken by the water industry: an estimated £56 billion of capital investment over the next 25 years, with strict new targets for water companies to reduce sewage discharges.\nBy 2035, water companies must ensure that overflows affecting designated bathing waters meet strict standards to protect public health.\nWhy so long?\nBecause just banning discharges, as my correspondents demand, without first building the very significant infrastructure necessary to make accommodate the foul water, will ensure that it -with nowhere else to go- backs-up into out toilets and drains.

That is why I fully support Dr Liam Fox’s Down Syndrome Private Members’ Bill, and I am delighted the Government does too.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need to improve access to services for people with Down’s syndrome.

This makes huge difficulties for our overstretched teachers. This is a time when schools will have to make herculean efforts rebuild the habits of consideration for others, good behaviour and discipline.\nStrangely, the headmaster of the Harris Westminster Sixth Form in London has chosen this moment to order pupils to desist from addressing beaks as ‘sir’. Instead, they must preface any remarks with the teacher’s title and name, excusing themselves first if they are not sure of the name.\nThe reason given for this imposition is because ‘Sir’ evokes respect and compares unfavourably with the female staff alternative of mere ‘Miss’.\nWell, I certainly wouldn’t want to be called ‘Miss’ but in the Army we called female officers ‘Mam’ which just as respectful as ‘Sir’. Perhaps this woeful headmaster might have thought a bit more carefully and come up with this military solution instead of guff about a “better and more equal world”.\nI suppose it could have been worse. I’m told there are schools where they embrace familiarity and the beaks are referred to as Pat, Bill, Chis and even Nicky. We all know what that breeds.\nEco Madness\nThe energy policy announced by Sir Kier Starmer defies belief, it is just bonkers: He has announced a ban on further exploration and extraction licences in the North Sea.\nTo be clear, this is not a ban on new oil and gas sources, it is just a ban on any new British oil and gas sources.\nSurely sensible eco-warriors realise that we will be dependent on hydrocarbons for the next 30 years or so, even as we approach our target of ‘net zero’ carbon dioxide emissions. So, as we will have to use oil and gas anyway, it much better that we use our own than have to import from sources that generate significantly higher emissions and come with all the supply hazards that have driven energy prices through the roof. The policy gift-wrapped for Putin.\nIts implementation would swiftly lead to the decline of inward investment and skilled jobs. For the first time I find myself on the side of the unions.\n“simples!” as the meerkat would say.\nPR\nOut of the blue, four constituents emailed me to ask for a meeting with me at Westminster because they were attending a rally, in favour of electoral reform: they wanted an electoral system which awarded seats in proportion to the votes cast for each political party, typically known as ‘proportional representation’ (PR).\nI agreed to meet all four of them in Parliament at the same time. We had a perfectly civil conversation but, alas, no meeting of minds. We were proof however, that you can agree to disagree about important matters without any unpleasantness whatsoever.\nTypically, I get half a dozen letters or so, each year on this subject. We did, readers may recall, have a referendum on the question back in 2011 (it was the price demanded by the Liberal democrats for entering a Coalition government with the Conservatives). We voted by 70% to 30% to keep our existing electoral system. I remain of the view that it settled the matter for a generation. I am not inclined to reopen the question in what is a crowded political agenda.\nThere is no perfect voting system. Each methodology has advantages and disadvantages. The principal weakness of our current system is that it often disproportionately rewards the winner, granting them a numerical majority in Parliament despite only getting more votes than other parties, but not a majority of all the votes cast. Equally, I would argue that this is its principal strength: It ensures that, more often than not, the party that got more votes than any other, forms the Government.\nThe difficulty with more proportional systems is that they tend to lead to permanent coalitions which hand disproportionate power to small parties that supply the governing party with a majority. Israel would be a good example: there the largest party invariably needs to gain the support of minority religious parties to cobble together a coalition. This has led to a whole raft of religious legislation, including sabbath day observance, of which a majority of Israeli citizens disapprove and for which only a small minority vote.\nThe discipline imposed by our own system is that a party needs a very broad base of support to secure any parliamentary representation whatsoever: they have to be ‘broad churches’ that form a coalition before any election. Continental PR systems however, which strictly reward parties according to the total of votes cast for them, give them the freedom to be more ideologically focussed and exclusive. The focus of coalition building then takes place after an election where parties come together to thrash out an agenda for government that was never put to the voters at all.\nWith the plethora of complex voting systems where some votes are counted multiple times, formulae are applied, and out comes a result from the ‘sausage machine’ that is difficult to understand, we have, on the contrary, a refreshing simplicity: the candidate with the most votes wins.\nOnline safety\nSeveral constituents have emailed me to ask if I would set out in this column my views in The Online Safety Bill.\nThe Bill Has completed its passage through the Commons and is now going through its detailed committee stage in the Lords, where debate rages over the extent to which the details of mandatory age verification should be set out on the face of the Bill or in subsequent regulations.\nThe Government has added offences the Bill which include revenge porn; hate crime; fraud; and threats and incitement to violence. Also, the promotion or facilitation of suicide and people smuggling. Further amendments will include controlling or coercive behaviour, in recognition of the specific challenges women and girls face when going online.\nOfcom, the UK’s independent communications regulator, will oversee the regulatory regime, backed up by mandatory reporting requirements and strong enforcement powers, including blocking access to non-compliant sites from within UK, and eye-watering fines of up to ten per cent of annual worldwide turnover.\nThat said, when the Bill was first published my principal worry was that, in its laudable intent to protect children, it nevertheless came at the expense of free speech.\nAt the heart of the problem was the creation a new category of ‘legal but harmful’ content, empowering lawful content to be removed when considered ‘harmful’. In effect, this subcontracted power of censorship to service providers and raised all sorts of questions about what constitutes a ‘harmful opinion’. It would also have introduced a ridiculous situation where censorship online could exclude opinion that would remain perfectly legal if said or published in print.\nMercifully the ‘legal but harmful’ provisions from the Bill has been struck out.\nInstead, content that is illegal will be required to be removed along with any legal content that a platform provider prohibits under its own terms of service. Adults can choose whether to engage with legal forms of abuse and comment that fall short of being unlawful, so long as the platform they are using allows such content. It is a free market.\nArguably, the changes to the Bill have ensured that it substantially protects free speech while holding social media companies to account for their promises to users, guaranteeing that users will be able to make informed choices about the services they use and the interactions they have on those sites.\nNo solution is ever perfect. The provider retains the ability to silence lawful content which breaches its own rules. In effect it can exclude arguments of which it disapproves. I do not see a way around this. After all, it is the provider’s own platform and they can make their rules in the same way that publishers impose their own standards. Indeed, nobody has an absolute right to see their opinions printed in any particular newspaper or print publication.\nIn mitigation we will have to rely on the powers of the regulator to see that providers apply their rules properly and fairly. In addition, there will be reputational damage to providers who capriciously censor content when other publications draw attention to it.\nA concern that I have which does not fall within the scope of the bill which may have a chilling effect on lawful expression, is a ruling by the Commons that social media content generated by Members of Parliament shall be subject to the scrutiny and ruling of the Commissioner for Standards in Public Life. How long will it be before this official tells MPs what they can and cannot say on social media?\nVotes for EU Citizens?\nWhat could possibly be Keir Starmer’s motive for considering an extension of the general election (and referendum) franchise to EU citizens settled in the UK?\nWhilst, we are generous with our local government franchise, allowing settled EU nationals to vote for local councillors, nevertheless, there are few, if any, jurisdictions that extend national voting rights to the citizens of other countries. I certainly don’t know of any, beyond our own historic rights for the Ireland and some to Commonwealth countries\nGeneral Elections and referendums can change the whole course of our country’s progress and history in a way that local council elections can never do. Accordingly, the right to participate in national elections should be reserved for our own nationals.\nIt isn’t even as If they’ve asked: The move appears to an unsolicited offer, or to be strictly correct, potential offer by the Leader of the Labour Party.\nIf EU nationals settled in the UK really want to vote on our national issues then they can apply to become one of our nationals. The process is straightforward, and you only have to have lived in the UK for 5 years in order to apply.\nThere are almost three and a half million EU nationals settled in the UK. Were they to be automatically granted the right to vote in our general elections and referendums then, as a group of voters, they would amount to more than all the voters in Wales. They would potentially have more influence on the outcome of any poll than one of the constituent nations of our United Kingdom.\nSo, what could be the motive for this sudden and unsought generosity to participate in determining the national affairs of the UK?\nForgive me, but I’m a politician, and I simply can’t help it: My suspicious mind immediately leaps to the conclusion that Sir Kier has spotted some electoral advantage for the Labour Party by expanding the franchise in this way. To be blunt, I suggest that he expects the bulk of this new cohort of voters to vote Labour. Perhaps he even dreams of harnessing their support to reverse our referendum decision in 2016 to leave the EU. After all, he tried to do so several times during the 2016 to 2019 Parliament.\nMy advice to any voter is to be very careful if considering voting for a party that contemplates being so careless with the right to vote. We could very well find that we’d lost sovereignty over our affairs once again.\nLocal Elections in New Forest West\nRarely do local elections have much to do with local politics. However hard local politicians struggle to keep a local focus, the political parties centrally fight them as proxies for future general elections. Last week was no different.\nOf all the voters that I spoke to in the New Forest, they were focussed on the national picture and saw their vote as a comment on the Government’s performance rather than that of New Forest District Council which, almost without exception, they considered to be well run.\nOf the two local issues that were raised with me, the biggest was potholes, which is a County Council responsibility rather than a matter for the District Council. The other was confined to specific locations where controversial housing developments had been approved. On this last question, my postbag divides between those who recognise that one of the major problems that we face in the New Forest is a desperate shortage of housing; and those who insist that the proposed developments are in the wrong place.\nIn any event, having had local elections based on a national rather than local focus, it is extremely difficult to make sense of the results. The psephologists have an algorithm for scaling up last week’s results where elections were held, to attribute similar results to where they weren’t held at all. And, so proceeding, to forecast what the result of a General Election would have been. I am very sceptical of the value of this exercise. First, even where national performance is at the forefront of their minds, nevertheless, people vote quite differently at local elections than they do at general elections.\nSecond, it is difficult enough to interpret the outcome on a party-political basis even within a relatively small geographical area. Take, for example, the New Forest West parliamentary division which comprises 12 of the New Forest District wards contested last week. Of those wards, in one each voter had three votes, in nine each voter had two votes, and in only two they had one vote as in a general election. To make interpretation even more complicated, it is clear from looking at the difference in votes cast for candidates of the same party within a single ward, that hundreds of voters used their multiple votes to vote for candidates of different parties.\nEven more difficult, not every one of the main parties fielded a candidate in each ward. All this before we take into account the average turnout of only 33% against a general election where you would expect nearer 80%.\nSo, for what it is worth, taking the votes for the leading candidate of each party in each ward in New Forest West, I estimate that of the 25,542 votes cast , the vote shares attributable to each party are: Conservative 37%; LibDem 23% ; Labour 15%; Green 13% ; Independent 12%. As for what any of this bodes for the general election -which might not even be until Jan 2025, I suggest it is far too soon to tell.\nCoronation\nAt the mystical heart of the Coronation is the intimate moment when the king is anointed with Holy oil, sourced from the Mount of Olives, before being prepared and blessed by the Orthodox Patriarch in Jerusalem.\nIn fact the ritual predates the crowning of King Solomon, to which it is often attributed. It was carried out two reigns previously, over 3000 years ago, when the Prophet Samuel anointed Saul as Israel’s first King, then subsequently, when Saul proved something of a dud, Samuel sought out the youngest son of Jesse, and anointed David, as King instead.\nThough instrumental, Samuel was a somewhat reluctant participant. He didn’t rate the prospects of monarchy and he warned the people of Israel that, by demanding a King like other nations, they were making a rod for their own back, with taxes and other oppressive impositions. His greatest fear was that kings would wander from proper devotion to the one true God. His fears were not misplaced. To put it mildly Israel’s experience of monarchy might be, at best, described as ‘mixed’.\nA fellow from the Plymouth Brethren used to come campaigning with me at elections. He was happy to deliver leaflets and canvass voters, but he wouldn’t vote himself. When I challenged him about this, he told me it was because he believed in the principle of Biblical Monarchy.\nWell, good luck with that! As we went through the reigns described in the Bible there was perhaps only one paragon, Josiah 640 -609 BC (to whom our own Edward VI was compared by contemporaries as ‘the new Josiah’ in 1547). Many of the others were pretty dreadful.\nOf course, our own experience of monarchy has also been mixed. We’ve had both saints and monsters. Nevertheless, we had a very unsuccessful, and not to be repeated experiment of doing without a monarch from 1649 to 1660.\nUndoubtedly, what has saved our monarchy was the wisdom of separating the institution from political power so that it could become what it is to-day: the focus of unity, majesty and awe.\nThe thought of replacing our Head of State with an elected politician is just grotesque. Think about it! Which one of us would you vote to have instead?\nCompleting Brexit\nThe Brexit Freedoms Bill, or to give it its proper title, The Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill, passed through the House of Commons with a healthy majority. Since when it has been given fairly rough treatment in the Lords.\nWhen we exited the EU we retained all EU laws to provide a period of continuity and stability. It also afforded us the time to examine each of them in detail to see if we wanted to keep them, amend them or remove them. The Bill gives ministers the power to do this with a default setting that they will lapse, if not specifically retained, by 31st December this year.\nIt is vital to our productivity that we remove this ball and chain of red tape that holds us back from experiencing the economic benefits of having left the EU.\nThe principal argument that has been made against the bill is that the procedure allowing ministers to make these decisions about what to retain and what to discard, lacks democratic accountability and that Parliament should debate each one of the 4000 pieces of legislation.\nAs I said in this column of 26th April Frost in Morocco (desmondswaynemp.com) this would effectively delay the process for years. In effect it would be a wrecking measure.\nI rather suspect that it owes more to a determination to keep us close to the EU regulatory orbit, in the hope that one day we may re-join, than it does to a fastidious preference for parliamentary scrutiny.\nAs for democracy, the reality is that these laws were made in the EU Council of Ministers by qualified majority voting and in secrecy – not even a transcript of the deliberations. The swifter we review them the better.\nI hope I am mistaken, but I suspect that ministers are beginning to get cold feet. There is a very significant volume of work to be done. Officials will have to go through all the legislation and offer ministers advice on the options. It will be hard work.\nIs it achievable whilst officials work from home?\nWill some in Whitehall resist on the basis of their ideological objections to the whole concept of completing Brexit?\nI think the Prime Minister needs to appoint someone from the business world with a track record of successful delivery to grip this entire endeavour, which is in danger that it just isn’t going to get done. Perhaps another Tsar?\n*\nAs a postscript, I see that the civil service unions want to negotiate a four-day week with no loss of pay, such will be their claimed increased productivity.\nI once worked for a firm that retained the 3 Day week, imposed during the miner’s strike in 1973, for a couple of years afterwards because of their very real increased productivity. Alas, they ended it because it didn’t work for their customers who wanted contact 5 days per week.\nThis will prove the rub for the public who need the services provided.\nMuch of the work of my office is spent contacting public sector organisations on behalf of constituents who have had difficulty making contact themselves. There is no doubt that this has become so much harder and more frustrating since the arrival of ‘working from home’.\nI don’t believe we should even consider the possibility of a shorter working week until they are all back in the office and we can actually measure their productivity.\nExpelling Bridgen\nRaab\nI look back on my ministerial career with great affection. I thoroughly enjoyed my close relationship with my private office of six civil servants and my wider interaction with the Civil Service generally. I don’t recall ever having a cross word. Perhaps I was just fortunate, or maybe I’m looking back with rose- tinted spectacles.\nI do recall however, two occasions when my staff went to great effort to persuade me not to do something that I was determined to do. Of course, when it became clear that I was so determined, they quite properly facilitated the decision that I had made. I have no doubt that on both occasions I was right, and that the outcome was successful. I speculate, but I always suspected that the inability of my officials to persuade me not to persist in my intention, was judged a failure on their part, by their superiors.\nDominic Raab’s experience in government may have been a very different, but he has my support. I really wish that the PM had refused his resignation. My reading of report is that he is very largely exonerated, and on the two counts on which he is criticised, they both, in my estimate, fall below the threshold for resignation. On the contrary, in the circumstances, Raab’s reaction was entirely understandable.\nBullying should always be rooted out. That’s why, when I was a schoolmaster, the cane was our first resort when it came to bullying. I fear however, that there is a danger that the pendulum has swung too far the other way and that demanding exacting standards in the workplace is becoming impossible. As a consequence we are becoming less and less efficient -something that constituents are constantly drawing to my attention – and so proceeding, we will become ungovernable.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 15\n- 16\n- 17\n- 18\n- 19\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",

No one can fault her in the effort and perseverance she has put into BREXIT. My heart was definitely for the PM.\nMy problem is that I do not trust her judgement.\nI have already set out in this column my reservations about the Withdrawal Agreement that she has negotiated. Before we even begin to negotiate the main effort, our trade deal, it agrees to the financial settlement, and also agrees that we cannot walk away from the negotiation no matter how unsatisfactory is the deal on offer.\nIt is, in my estimate, a potential disaster, even before we consider the arrangements which treat Northern Ireland separately, and have which have so angered the Democratic Unionists.\nI am confident that many of those who -spurred on by the Daily Mail- wrote to me demanding that I vote for the agreement, have not themselves studied it.\nWhilst I was among the 117 who voted against the Prime Minister, I was not one of the 48 who sought the ballot in the first place, by writing to Sir Graham Brady as Chairman of the 1922 Committee. On the contrary, I urged colleagues not to write.\nThe ballot having been triggered however, I felt that it was better to go with my head rather that my heart.\nIn the end it came down to this: I believe that we are close to an election because the PM has no majority in Parliament, and can no longer rely on the Democratic Unionists to provide her with one (because they perceive that they have been treated in bad faith).\nAfter my experience of the 2017 election campaign I just do not have the confidence to go into another one under the same leadership.\nThe PM did try and address this issue during the day on which the ballot was held, by announcing that she would not lead her party into the next election. This was persuasive, and I wavered. It became clear however, that she spoke specifically of the election scheduled for 2022. Whereas my fear is for an election that may happen in the next few weeks.\nIn spite of my doubts, and my vote, the Prime Minister won, and -as I said to critics who were unimpressed by the margin of her victory- she won by a more decisive margin than the LEAVE campaign in the referendum and whose victory we are making such an effort to implement.\nShe won, and we must make the best of it.",

It is a national problem: we have a million vacancies. With that in mind, I am now lending my support to Starting Fresh – a campaign being run by Sodexo, one of our principal recruitment specialists, which aims to encourage businesses to employ more people with criminal convictions. The campaign is designed to help remove the barriers associated with the employment of ex-offenders.\nApart from the benefit to businesses in finding employees in a tight labour market, getting ex-offenders into work is an important part of making sure that they successfully reintegrate into their local communities.\nToo often misconceptions and prejudice prevent businesses from tapping into this underutilised resource. Concerns about hiring people with criminal convictions can often be attributed to a failure to appreciate the quality of education which now takes place in prison. Many of the 50,000, or so, offenders who leave prison every year do so with formal qualifications they didn’t have before they were sentenced.\nBusinesses can access the Starting Fresh online hub, where they can find advice about how to make use of this underutilised resource and provide support in the workplace.\nSodexo also runs prisons on behalf of the Ministry of Justice and is, in addition, using this campaign to let employers know they are welcome to visit their prisons if they are interested in offering job opportunities to prisoners when they are released. Organisations with multiple job opportunities can even run employer days in the prisons.\nMore information on the campaign can be had from https://uk.sodexo.com/startingfresh.hmtl",

I doubt however, that there would have been displays of public grief and affection in the way that we have seen in the last few days. Would crowds of well-wishers have flooded to the presidential palace and to the presidential country retreats?\nWould there have been such ceremony, even in the midst of the mourning, to mark the inauguration of a president’s replacement? I was out very late on Thursday night walking along the Mall and watching the crowds thronging towards Buckingham Palace, some with flowers, others just to stand, wait, and reflect. On Saturday morning I walked up the Mall again, this time on my way to take part the Accession Council at St James’s Palace as a member of the Privy Council. The crowds were out in even greater force to witness the Proclamation of our new King with a great shout of ‘God Save The King’ followed by a rousing three cheers. Unlike relatively short presidential terms, a monarch provides something of a backdrop for a lifetime, providing a constant presence and reassurance. We may imagine that we have been almost familiar with our monarchs simply because it seemed that they were always there, an ever constant presence.I was Vice Chamberlain to our late Queen from 2012 to 2014. I cannot claim to have known her better than any other of her subjects, but one of the rare privileges had by the Vice Chamberlain is private audiences with the Monarch when a humble address is sent by the Commons to the Sovereign. These take place following every State Opening of Parliament, they mark important events like royal marriages and births, but they are also used for more mundane business, for example, where the Commons wants a particular individual appointed to a job that is in the gift of the Crown.\nOn these occasions the Vice Chamberlain is entirely alone with the Monarch, nobody else is present. My experience was that once the formal business was concluded, the Queen would relax and we’d have a brief chat. She had quite a sense of humour. I’ve told a story in this column before, but I think it bears repetition: When I presented my first humble address to the Queen at Buckingham Palace, I was briefed beforehand by a courtier about the proper etiquette. In particular, he insisted that on no account was I to observe the ‘former custom’ of walking backwards so as not to turn my back on the Sovereign when I left the room. He said that this sort of ‘flummery’ had been abandoned for good. So, I presented the humble address, I enjoyed our chat and then, when I was about to take my leave, with a mischievous smile the Queen asked me “ now, are you going to walk backwards?”. I replied that I had been ordered not to, but if she’d like me to..? She chuckled, saying it that she didn’t mind at all either way, but she just had the impression that I might be a stickler for tradition. I said that, if it was really all the same to her, then yes, I would like to walk backwards. She smiled and said “just make sure you don’t trip up, or I’ll be in real trouble”",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_rwanda-facing-down-the-judges/content_357.html": "Some of my parliamentary colleagues, particularly those who are lawyers, get frightfully upset when I criticise judicial decisions. They believe that the separation of powers -political from judicial- is so sacrosanct that no politician should intrude by criticising the judgements of the courts.\nI disagree. As an elected politician it is quite proper for me to give voice to the frustration that so many constituents express to me about judicial decisions, whether it is the leniency of sentences or ‘high politics’, where courts have frustrated the will of Government -which should properly be a matter for Parliament.\nThere is enormous anger about leniency in sentencing. More than half our most prolific offenders -with at least 45 previous convictions- are never sent to prison. This is the reason that Parliament has increasingly been intervening with new laws to set mandatory minimum sentences to bind the judges, as we will again on 28th November with the second reading of the Criminal Justice Bill.\nGreater still is the frustration with Judicial intervention in the most contentious political issues of the day. I expressed my robust rejection of the authority of the Supreme Court in this column in my blog about the prorogation of Parliament back in September 2019:\nYes, it is a coup (desmondswaynemp.com)\nNow we have had the judgement that the Government’s scheme to deport asylum claimants to Rwanda is unlawful, with which I profoundly disagree.\nNevertheless, I’d be the first to acknowledge that throughout history Judges have played a key role in preserving our liberty. And that an independent judiciary is an essential part of a functioning liberal democracy. In any event, we already have a solution where we believe judicial activism has gone too far.\nIn their decisions judges make law. If we don’t like the laws that they make, then we have the remedy in Parliament, just as we have with lenient sentencing: Statute law made in Parliament trumps law made by judges in the courts.\nThe problem is that it will take time, and time is running out. A bill to make the Rwanda scheme lawful would pass at speed in the Commons but would be held up by the delaying power of the Lords, where the Government has no majority. We could prorogue, and re-present the bill in the new parliamentary session, forcing it through under the Parliament Act. it would be controversial and messy, it might not be quick but it would work.\nThat leaves us only having to deal with the international judges whose power derives from the treaty obligations to which we voluntarily acceded. They will not be overawed by Parliament. If they intervened, we’d have to withdraw from those obligations. The PM has indicated that, if necessary, he will do so.\nThe Rwanda deal, as a deterrent to illegal migrants, is an essential element to successfully stopping the boats, but it is only one element. Of greater importance are bi-lateral agreements to return the migrants to their countries of origin. Our agreement with Albania, from which the greatest number were coming, has cut those numbers by 90%.\nThe argument is made that, were we to withdraw from the international conventions, then it would be so much more difficult to sustain and extend bi-lateral return arrangements, that we’d be a pariah and that nobody would deal with us.\nI think this is nonsense. Other European countries are experiencing very much greater numbers of illegal migrants and are already following where we have led. There is a common view now that the historic conventions on refugees are completely unfit for the current reality. I’m confident that where we continue to lead, other developed nations will continue to follow.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_the-brexit-bill/content_471.html": "This week we begin our marathon parliamentary proceedings on the BREXIT bill.\nIts title is ‘A Bill To Repeal The European Communities Act 1972’ but in reality it is not so much a bill of repeal, as of enactment: the twin purposes of the bill are to leave the EU, and to ensure that on the day that we leave our UK law and regulations are identical to those of the EU that we are leaving. This is in order to provide businesses and individuals with certainty and continuity.\nSubsequently we may want to diverge and to tailor our own arrangements, but there is too little time now to pick and choose. In the circumstances it is far simpler to incorporate virtually all of EU law and then reconsider bits of it at leisure.\nThis is an enormous undertaking, and will only be possible if the Bill expressly delegates powers to ministers for secondary legislation. This is already common practice in virtually all modern parliamentary bills. For example, if a bill were to grant new powers to local authorities to enable them to, say, compulsorily purchase land in order to build affordable homes, it might delegate to the minister power to draw up detailed regulations as to the circumstances in which the powers can be used, the limits, the consultation period, the compensation criteria, arbitration, and etc.\nSubsequently, after the bill became law, the minister would draw up the regulations and present them to Parliament. This can be done in one of two ways, and the original bill would have specified which of them must be used.\nThe first method is to debate the new regulations in a committee followed by motions put to both Houses to adopt the regulations. Parliament has to accept or reject the regulations (there is no provision just to amend them).\nThe Second method is where the regulations automatically become law unless MP’s or peers ‘pray’ against them, secure a debate, and vote them down.\nEither way, ministers only enjoy the powers specified by Parliament, and are still constrained by the need to secure parliamentary approval in the exercise those powers.\nSuch is the complexity of the BREXIT bill, we will have to go further. The European Communities Act 1972 explicitly set EU law above UK domestic law. We did not have to legislate to remove any conflict between EU law and our own, because the 1972 Act instructed the courts to give precedence to EU law. If our law is to be exactly the same as EU law on the day that we leave, then we will have to legislate to resolve all the conflicts that existed or have arisen over the decades, because the 1972 ACT, which automatically resolved them will have been repealed.\nThis will be a massive undertaking requiring amendments to hundreds of statutes, and it will only be achievable if we do it by secondary legislation -as I have described above, but in these cases we will be granting ministers power not just to make new regulations, but to make regulations that actually amend previous acts of Parliament.\nThere will be a huge protest about the use of ‘Henry VIII powers’ to steamroller Parliament by allowing ministers to alter laws made by Parliament. The reality is however, that the power is narrowly defined, time limited, and still subject to a vote in Parliament before it can be exercised.\nThose who resort to hyperbole about dictatorial powers quashing parliamentary government have a quite different agenda. Their real purpose is to make the BREXIT bill unworkable, in the hope that the democratic decision of voters in the referendum can be ignored, and that we don’t leave the EU at all.",

The American XL Bully- seemingly prized as status symbols by some for their aggressive temperaments- has been disproportionately involved in this rise. It is therefore only right that the Government takes decisive action to prevent these dogs from causing further harm.\nBanning these dogs has been under consideration for some time, but this has been complicated by the fact that the XL Bully is not formally recognised as a breed in the UK. For this reason, the Environment Secretary and the Home Secretary will now urgently convene experts to define the American XL Bully breed type, including police, canine and veterinary experts, and animal welfare stakeholders. The Government will then legislate to add the XL Bully to the list of breeds banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. These changes are expected to be in place by the end of this year.\nOf course, the existing population of XL Bullies will need to be safely managed, so an amnesty period will be introduced. It may reassure you to know that owners who come forward to register their XL Bully during the amnesty period will be able to keep their dog until the end of its life, provided they meet conditions such as neutering the dog and keeping it on a lead and muzzle in public. Any XL Bully owner who does not come forward to register during the amnesty period will be committing a criminal offence if they are subsequently found to be keeping an unregistered dog.\nIn the meantime, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will continue to work with the police, local authorities and animal welfare groups to help prevent future attacks by encouraging responsible dog ownership and to make sure the full force of the law is applied.\nDS",

As it happens, I was listening at the time he gave it, but the reason the that the Chamber was empty was because it was the end-of-day Adjournment debate: There is a ballot for the half-hour slot at the end of each day’s parliamentary business. The successful applicant gets 15 minutes to speak on his chosen topic and the minister with responsibility has 15 in which to reply. Nobody else is expected to participate. As the debate falls at the very end of day’s whipped business, the Chamber empties and in is not uncommon for only the four MPs to be left: the member who secured the slot, the minister answering, the duty whip and Mr Speaker. No particular indifference or disrespect was being displayed on this occasion.\nMr Bridgen has since been suspended from the Commons and some of my correspondents have emailed to express outrage at this denial of freedom of speech. Their concern is entirely misplaced: Bridgen’s suspension was for a breach of the lobbying rules that has been going through the quasi-judicial processes for some time and has nothing to do with the recent speech on vaccines.\nNevertheless, the claims that Mr Bridgen made are very serious and demand answers. There has been plenty of coverage on social media, but the issue has been almost completely ignored by the press and broadcasters.\nBridgen gave detailed statistics and revealed the sources of his data.

The experiment, far from failing, never even commenced. It would indeed have proved useful to see what impact tax cuts and radical supply-side reforms would have made in several months time. Alas, we will never know because the endeavour was aborted before the measures were implemented.\nI have always been an advocate for precisely those economic policies, nevertheless I am not convinced that that the outcome would have been a rosy one. I fear that the implementation would have been purchased at the cost of very high interest rates (in this column on 25th of July I predicted they might rise to as much as 7%) because the increased purchasing power arising from tax cuts would have an impact before many of the supply-side reforms would improve productivity. Consequently, inflation would rise even further, and the Bank would have to respond with higher interest rates. Equally, markets -sceptical of the policy (notwithstanding our relatively low debt to GDP ratio brought about by George Osborne’s years as Chancellor) would require a ‘premium’ to persuade them to cover our deficit.\nIt was for these reasons that I backed Rishi in the head-to-head contest with Liz Truss. As I said in my blog Backing Winners (desmondswaynemp.com) of 27 July, I saw no ideological difference between the two candidates (indeed and between most of the earlier leadership contenders). They shared the same objective of a low tax, free market, entrepreneurial productive UK. The difference came down the speed at which the changes could be made and getting the government finances into better shape before commencing. The Conservative Party made the wrong ‘call’ and the result was the disaster Rishi had predicted.\nWe must not however, allow this catastrophe to undermine the possibility of pursing prosperity through these radical remedies, albeit at a sensible pace and having prepared the right conditions.\nThe narrative currently being pedalled by some right-wing critics is that the abandonment of ‘trussenomics’ means that the Tories have snuck back into a ‘remainerdom’ comfort zone of big government, high taxes and burdensome regulation: Sacrificing all the potential liberations of Brexit.\nThis is nonsense.

Our leadership is established by the fact that despite generating only about 1% of the world’s carbon emissions, notwithstanding being the 6th largest world economy. we have cut those emissions by more than any other developed economy – they are down by a whopping 30% from the level they were at in 1990.\nThis achievement has been partly secured by cutting out coal for power generation and increasing\nreliance on wind and solar for electricity. In 2010 these two forms of power generation accounted for only 7% of our electricity, now they are producing 40% of it.\nUK led has the world to give legislative imperative to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe important thing to remember about this net-zero target however, is that it is ‘net’.\nWe will continue to generate emissions after 2050 because we will need many more years to replace our need for hydrocarbons in any number of uses from powering vehicles, heating our homes, manufacturing products, and generating electricity until we are able to replace gas-fired power stations, increasing nuclear, and until we have improved our capability to store power generated earlier through better battery technology.\nDespite this time lag, we will reach a position of net zero by removing more carbon from the atmosphere through carbon capture and storage, so that overall we will balance continued emissions with the amount that we are removing.\nThis will be no mean endeavour: it will require new technology; transforming agriculture, and changes to the way we do things.\nNevertheless, it is much more manageable than the hair-shirt mentality that wishes to hobble our economy and prosperity by prematurely closing down one of our greatest assets: oil and gas in the North Sea.\nWe still need it; and we will still need it for decades after we achieve net-zero in 2050. So, if we do not get it by issuing new licences for North Sea exploration and extraction, then we are going to have to import it from overseas at much greater cost to ourselves and we will forgo what has been a lucrative source of tax revenue to fund public services, currently to the tune of £16 Billion annually.\nThe Opposition state however, that far from needing the oil and gas ourselves, we are exporting it.\nFirst, they are largely wrong: virtually all the gas goes into our own UK distribution network.\nBut a significant amount of the crude oil does indeed go to Europe to be refined. This generates export earnings and tax revenues. It also obviates the need of those European refineries to get their crude oil from Russia and the Middle East, removing a source of profound insecurity in our energy mix.\nThe reality is that the opponents of new licences for the north sea are not against oil extraction in principle, or the 200,000 well paid skilled jobs that enable it, they are just opposed to them being British jobs in British waters. They know we will simply have to get the oil and gas from other countries at higher cost.\nThe trump card however, and which renders the opponents case to the realm of ‘bonkers’, is that the carbon emissions created by extraction from our North Sea are vey much lower than the emissions generated by having to import it.\nMercifully, sanity prevailed and the Bill was carried by 293 votes to 211",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_medically-assisted-death/content_107.html": "It is reported that the PM wants to accelerate parliamentary legislation on medically assisted dying by affording government time to a private member’s bill. The are two from which the Government may choose, Lord Falconer’s bill in the Lords and Jake Richard MP’s bill in the Commons.\nI am concerned that there should be any haste in the parliamentary process and the time for consideration.\nNobody, should have to fear a grizzly death. The proper answer is to invest in palliative care and end of life services. For the present however, that fear remains significant, but to alleviate it with medically assisted death would, in my estimate, be the greater of the two evils.\nThe provision of such a choice, I believe would, more swiftly than we might expect, become an expectation. The process may be subtle, but the elderly and infirm, together with the handicapped and others, can perceive that they might be considered a ‘burden’.\nAnd who would wish to be a burden?\nOregon has released its data for 2023. Of those who applied for an assisted death, 51% did so because they felt that they were a burden rather than because the feared a painful death.\n(as an aside, let us not imagine that an assisted death is always straightforward. Oregon reports that in 2023 at least 10% of assisted deaths involved complications including regurgitations or seizures, and one established a new record: 5 days and 17 hours from the time of ingestion).\nIt is difficult to stand out against overwhelming support reported by pollsters and campaigning by celebrities like Dame Esther Rantzen. Nevertheless, altering the law will fundamentally change the nature of medicine and the purpose of the medical profession.\nWhatever safeguards we insert into the legislation, we will have accepted the principle that clinicians can lawfully use their skill to hasten death, and we cannot know how the application of that principle will evolve subsequently. The examples we have of jurisdictions that have adopted this principle, are that once a line has been crossed, the new service is very rapidly extended well beyond what was originally envisaged.\nWhen I debated against Baroness Meacher, who had her own bill in the Lords at that time, she was emphatic about her safeguards, namely the requirement for a confirmed diagnosis of a terminal condition that would result in death within six months. In that debate at Durham University however, she was undermined by her seconder, a psychiatrist, who demanded that assisted death be available to anyone who wanted it.\nLet’s be honest, there is demand for it. Of the 5000 or so suicides in England annually, only 400 have a terminal medical condition.\nDr Lehmens, Professor of Health & Law at University of Toronto visited Parliament in April to tell us that he regrets having been an enthusiast to change the law in Canada because expensive provision and adaptions for the elderly and handicapped are increasingly unavailable and patients are informed that instead they might consider applying for the assisted death.\nIn 2022 a 23-year-old woman had a medically assisted death in Belgium. In 2016, as a teenager, she had witnessed a bombing at Brussels Airport. She was physically unharmed but suffered PTSD.\nWhilst the original intention of medical assistance in dying was to relieve suffering in death, it has become a means of avoiding suffering during life.\nMy argument is no more than one of the existence of a ‘slippery slope’. I make no apology for that, because I believe that it is a very steep slope and very slippery indeed.",

And so it was last week after the trial of Kyle Bevan for the murder of his girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter, Lola James.\nI have voted for the return of the death penalty on three occasions in Parliament but alas, the majorities against restoration were overwhelming.\nI recall an election meeting in a church where I was challenged on the ground’s that as a Christian I ought to oppose the death penalty. I responded by quoting from article 37 of the 39 Articles which form the doctrinal foundation of the Church of England:\n“The laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and grievous offences”.\nI suspect that there would be majority support for restoration, but that a significant minority would remain viscerally opposed. Every death sentence would be the focus of public protests. It might also be more difficult to secure convictions for capital offences as jurors contemplate the finality of a guilty verdict. In any event, whatever the pros and cons, there just is no parliamentary majority to be had for it.\nThe public demand for justice might be assuaged however, were a life sentence to mean what is says. There is nothing more frustrating than to see people who have been imprisoned for the most horrible offences being released to present a danger to the public once again.\nThis undermines our whole concept of justice, and it extends from wicked and violent crimes down to more minor offences.\nWhen a judge hands down a sentence in court it bears little relation to the time that will actually be served in prison. Indeed, it requires multiple convictions of burglary before the offender sees the inside of a prison at all.\nThere was a time when a politician (in those days the Home Secretary) was able to determine the ‘tariff’ -the actual minimum time of any sentence that a convict would serve. But this was considered to breach the constitutional principle of the ‘separation of powers’ between government and judiciary. So, that power was removed from the hands of elected politicians.\nNow the only lever that ministers can pull is the right of appeal that the Attorney General has, where it is considered that a sentence has been unduly lenient.\nWhich brings me to Labour’s recent advertisement insisting that the Prime Minister doesn’t want child sex offenders imprisoned. On the contrary, I rather suspect that the PM shares my prejudice that they should be locked-up and the key thrown away. I don’t know if he would go as far as I would and make it a capital offence, were in in my power to do so.\nIt is very frustrating but the reality is -and Labour knows it, neither the PM nor any other politician, can determine the penalty that the trial judge imposes.\nWhat we can do however, is increase the penalties available to the courts. When we’ve introduced measures to do exactly that, Labour has voted against them.",

Freedom, of speech (however, one may disagree with what is actually said), is an essential element of our democracy. One of our most important parliamentary statutes, the Bill of Rights 1689, is explicit:\n“freedom of debate and speech in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place other than in Parliament’\nI quickly recovered from my apoplectic fit when I discovered what had actually happened. Mr Bridgen did not have the whip withdrawn for the questions he raised in Parliament, rather it was for what he said on Twitter. Frankly, it was grotesque: He quoted a clinician of his acquaintance comparing the Covid vaccine programme with the Holocaust. Whatever doubts one may have about the vaccine, to compare an heroic effort to combat disease -which liberated us from the misery of lock-downs, with a deliberate attempt to wipe out Jewish people, is beyond the pale.\nCovid vaccination is voluntary. Patients can make up their own minds about their effectiveness and the risks of an adverse reaction -the statistic for which are available for anyone with an enquiring mind. (I took a very different view when there was the element of coercion involved, with the threat of dismissal for health professionals and ‘vaccine passports’ for the rest of us, but that has all gone).\nI am not a clinician but my prejudice is that Covid is insufficiently dangerous to justify a vaccination programme beyond those particularly vulnerable to it. Because of my age I was glad to have mine, but I am sceptical about the benefits for younger people and especially children.\nMany vaccinations run the risk of adverse reactions which can amount to an unpleasant few days, to permanent disablement and even death. For our collective benefit we seek to encourage vaccination. So, we really need to address the shortcomings of our vaccination damage compensation scheme: the evidential bar is set too high and the scale of compensation far too low, with the result that claimants face the delays, risks, and expense of having to go to court.\nThere will always be risks, and I have every sympathy with those who have had adverse reactions, but I remain of the view that the swift roll out of the covid vaccine was a triumph.",

A mistake common to most of them is that they treat their contributions as if they were savings that had been paid into a retirement fund – on which they are entitled to draw when fully paid-up, and that any reform constitutes a change in the terms and conditions upon which they made their contributions in good faith.\nThe system just doesn’t work like this, and most people should be very glad that it doesn’t. For the overwhelming majority of us, had our national insurance contributions been paid into a savings fund, they would never have generated anything like the level of income in retirement that the state pension now affords. So, for most of us, it’s a bargain.\nOur contributions, are in fact just taxes. They qualify us to receive a pension but they don’t pay for it. They just go into the total available to pay for all government expenditure, including, of course, the current pensions bill. So, in a sense, our national insurance contributions are paying the pensions of those who are already retired, in the expectation that the national insurance contributions of younger earners will pay for our pensions when we retire.\nThis leads to the critical need for reform: as we live longer and are retired for so much longer, the proportion of those of working age is shrinking relative to that of those in retirement. If the bill for pensions is to remain affordable for the working age people who are having to pay it, then we need to reduce that bill by either cutting the pension or by delaying the retirement of those who receive. Delaying the pension is much the more sensible course.\nUnder the Pensions Act 2011 the pension age for men and women accelerates to reach 66 by 2020. One of the current campaigns argues that this disproportionately affects women in their mid-fifties (born after 5th April 1951) and that for them the change should be reversed. I recognise the complaint of those who now find that they have to retire later (my wife is one of them), but the line has to be drawn somewhere – to the frustration of those just the other side of it. The campaigners need to explain why these particular women should be protected from a rise in State Pension age, when women just days younger – and men of all ages- will wait longer for their state pension.",

Even within a household, people cannot play tennis or golf. Notwithstanding the assault on liberty and livelihoods, why are the regulations pervaded by a pettifogging malice?”\nI used the word pettifogging to describe the interference in the minutiae of our lives, and malice because of the unfairness of allowing supermarkets -which have so done well out of lockdown- to sell alcohol for consumption off the premises but to prevent pubs from doing so.\nIn all this I merely represent the views of my constituents: I have been lobbied hard by pub landlords, golfers and tennis players. There is something rather vindictive about preventing one from playing golf alone, or with a member of your own household. It is hard to see how the restriction reduces the spread of the disease.\nI’m sure that very few NHS workers were ever aware of the exchange, and I doubt that many more have had it brought to their attention by the intervention of this local doctor.\nIn any event, I’m confident that they will ignore it and carry on with the magnificent job that they have been doing on behalf of us all.",

The Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for Nepal quickly raised £83 million, and that is in addition to many other fund raising efforts that took place all over the country. The UK Government has committed £70 million.\nThere remains a significant number of remote areas that are still in need of substantial relief. The monsoon and the coming winter make addressing that need all the more urgent.\nNaturally, focus is now on reconstruction and the need to ‘build back better’ – as the campaign slogan puts it.\nThe most important lesson that people need to understand is, I believe, that the success of the rescue and relief effort was built on the back of our international development budget over several years of investment.\nWe had earthquake-proofed some 60 schools, all of them survived where some 7000 other schools were destroyed, the same is true of the hospitals that we had reinforced. We had put in place a ready-to-use logistical staging facility for relief supplies at the airport. Had this not been ready and waiting it would have cost the relief effort 7 weeks overall in cumulative delays. We had pre-positioned essential supplies and invested in the training of volunteers for distribution, for rescue, and for first aid. We had rehearsed and rehearsed.\nIt is this sort of investment in resilience,every year,that makes the difference, not just opening our wallets once a disaster has happened.\nNepal is now open for tourism again. I visited a number of its fantastic World Heritage sites. The country has so much to offer, including its magnificent Himalayan trekking trails. Tourism is Nepal’s largest earner and it’s down 90 percent since the earthquake. If the Nepalese people are to thrive they need tourists.

First, because my email inbox was daily being filled with desperate constituents who had been on holiday or working abroad and were then having tremendous difficulty trying to come home.\nThe last thing I would have wanted to do, was to lobby ministers to close the airports to make it even harder, or even impossible for them to get back.\nSecond, scientific modelling predicted that once the disease was already spreading in the UK, restricting air travel would make little very difference -perhaps slowing the progress by only some three to five days. (In fact, Italy was first-off-the-blocks to impose an early ban on all flights from China but that did not alter the severe spread of the disease there).\nThe reality was that once the disease was spreading in the UK, travellers from overseas would be as likely to catch it here as they were to have brought it with them\nOf course, had we been a remote Island with a small population and had we shut down flights at the very outset, as did New Zealand, then we might have fared as well as they have done. But the UK is not in a remotely similar position to New Zealand, on the contrary, we are the very centre of international finance and culture. We simply could not have acted in that way in time to contain the disease\nAs the rate of spread in the UK now diminishes and the number of new infections and hospitalisations falls sharply, is it now the time to impose quarantine to prevent infected travellers from re-seeding a renewed spread in the UK?\nClearly, there is some logic to this, but -like the lockdown itself- such actions come at a cost.\nI have already used this column to point out that a severe recession will not be avoided even had we carried on without restricting commercial and social activity whatsoever. This is because we would still -as a trading nation and financial centre, have been hit by the shock to the world economy. In addition, the change in consumer behaviour – already responding before the lockdown, would have been even more pronounced as the disease spread.\nSweden avoided a lockdown but is not going to avoid a sharp recession.\nNow however, just as we are trying to re-start our economy and mitigate some of the consequences of the damage that has been done to it, is this the time impose a severe restriction on commercial and holiday travel?\nWe need to be sending the world a signal that we are open for business, but we appear to be doing the very opposite. I know a number of businesses locally that will be further damaged: the imposition on their contractors working on short but important trips to the continent will be very costly.\nLet alone the enormous damage that further reductions to inbound tourism will have on our earnings.\nI believe that the blanket quarantine decision is a huge mistake and ought to be replaced by the sort of sophisticated airport testing regime which we have now developed, but was simply not available anywhere at the outset of the pandemic.",

Either that, or they are just too polite to disagree.\nI am no different. Almost everyone I speak to appears to agree with me that our response to Covid19 has been a disastrous overreaction.\nIt a hard thing to say when so many people have died of the disease, many of whom were relatively young and with no other health problems. Nevertheless for the vast majority of us the experience of catching the disease is mild to imperceptible. Yet our disproportionate response has been to close down our economy with devastating consequences for employment and incomes, with all the health problems -both mental and physical- that will flow from their diminution.\nWe have prioritised our healthcare system to the enormous disadvantage of anyone suffering from conditions other than Covid19, which will cause much suffering and many deaths.\nAnd we have devastated education by closing schools.\nTo cap it all, we have sacrificed our liberty to the extent that we are now told whom, when and where me may meet, marry, worship, or whatever. And even what we must wear.\nAll this might be bearable (though personally I doubt it) given the prospect that it is only to be short-lived. The announcement yesterday however, poured cold water on any such notion. There was a deeply chilling note in the Chief Scientist’s observation that we may have reached the limit of possibilities with respect to easing of restrictions.\nWe appear to be at the mercy of these scientists. And our only prospect of relief is scientific advance in the form of a vaccine or a cure, neither of which is guaranteed.\nYet the science which has imprisoned us is controversial. There is another point of view and course of action: whilst taking care to protect those who are particularly vulnerable, to allow the natural process of ‘herd immunity’ to build up amongst the rest of us so that the virus has much less opportunity to spread.\nI said almost everyone I speak to agrees with me. Well, I’m not stupid: I know they tell me what I want to hear; they email me because they’ve already heard that I agree with them.\nNevertheless, there is clearly a difference of opinion amongst scientists and amongst the public in general.\nSo, the key question for me as an elected representative -in what is supposed to be a democracy -is this: why is there so little debate in Parliament about the measures that have been forced upon us and the science that justifies them?\nOn occasions I have found myself as almost a lone voice in opposition to the Government’s chosen course of action.\nMost shocking of all, I have never had the opportunity to legislate: I have neither voted for nor against any of the laws that now govern and constrain our social intercourse and which the police have the power to enforce.\nThe Government simply rules by decree, without argument or challenge in Parliament.\nIt does so using powers granted to it in the Public Health Act 1984.\nI have said it before, but it bears repetition: how prescient George Orwell was in his choice of that year in naming his dystopian novel.",

They are also both increasingly interlinked. AI is already being used across the creative industries, including in music and film production, publishing, architecture and design. As of September 2024, more than 38 per cent of creative industries businesses said they have used AI technologies.\nWhile AI has the potential to transform the creative sector, many artists, writers, and designers have sincere fears that AI could detrimentally affect their earnings and, ultimately, their way-of-life. Current laws make it difficult for creators to control or seek payment for the use of their work. It is also true that present ambiguities in the law create legal risks for AI firms, and could deter developers from investing and developing their products in the UK.\nTherefore, the Opposition welcomes that the Government has launched a consultation into the legal relationship between the creative industries and AI developers. The Government is seeking to simultaneously ensure protection and payment for rights holders and support AI developers to innovate responsibly. Key areas of the consultation include boosting trust and transparency between the sectors, so right holders have a better understanding of how AI developers are using their material and how it has been obtained. The consultation will run until the 25 February 2025.\nThe consultation also explores how creators can license and be remunerated for the use of their material. The Government proposes allowing rights holders to reserve their rights, so they can control the use of their content, while also introducing an exception to copyright law for AI training for commercial purposes. This is an effective opt-out which means that creators would have to reaffirm their desire to protect their work.

What they fail to appreciate is that Article 16 is part of that very Protocol and we have every right to make use of it.\nFurthermore, a close reading of the Protocol reveals that it was always designed to be open to replacement by new arrangements and new use of technology.\nThe current way that the Protocol is implemented is undermining the stability of Northern Ireland, and that we cannot allow to continue.\nUkraine\nRussia is continually being warned by western powers that invading Ukraine is massive strategic error. That will depend however, on what his strategy actually is, and the extent to which we are successful in responding.\nIt is worth considering our own strategic errors.\nThe first was Ukraine’s own decision to unilaterally give up its nuclear arsenal in return for a guarantee of its territorial integrity and sovereignty in the Budapest Memorandum signed in December 1994.\nI grant that it would have been extremely difficult and expensive for Ukraine to have held on to those weapons, which it had inherited from the former Soviet Union. Nevertheless, had it retained but a fraction of the arsenal it would not be facing its own extinction as an independent nation state, because the assurance of mutual destruction would be a sufficient deterrent to their attacker. There is a lesson for us in this.\nOur own strategic mistake was, together with our allies, to fail to define our objectives in Afghanistan and an exit strategy from the very start of our intervention there. The consequent chaos and humiliation of our withdrawal sent a powerful message to both Moscow and Beijing about our weakness, divisions and lack of resolve. That perception in Moscow has had consequences for Ukraine.\nHow we now respond to Russian action against Ukraine will be closely watched in Beijing and, depending on our resolve, may have consequences for Taiwan.\nAnother party…and a riot ?\nI have always had constituents who are regular correspondents. Several send me a daily email. A couple send me several emails every day and one sends them throughout the night as well.\nThe number of repeat emailers has increased significantly during ‘party-gate’, presumably to wear me down until I agree with them, notwithstanding that -as I’ve said in this column- I’ll be keeping my own counsel.\nWhen I first heard the PM tell the House of Commons that there were no parties, a shudder went down my spine. Not because I didn’t believe him, but because I was sure that, what he honestly considered to be ‘work events’, others would judge to be parties.\nThe extent of the gulf between these two very different perceptions will only be revealed when we have the facts. That is why I insist on reserving judgement until we get the full account of what took place: when the police investigation concludes and Sue Gray can reveal all the detail that she knows.\nThis week several correspondents have emailed me the latest photograph of the PM at a party; “banged to rights”; “guilty as charged”. How can I any longer hide behind the excuse of awaiting the outcome of the inquiry when the evidence is before my eyes and in full colour…”of course the photo proves he is a liar -there he is actually at the party!”\nAs I look at the photo all I see is the PM standing in an office together with two colleagues, one of whom is seated in front of a screen (apparently he was hosting a workplace Christmas quiz over zoom). It is true that the fellow seated is sporting a string of tinsel and there is an open bottle of Champagne on the table. Nevertheless, if this ‘shock new revelation’ is the best they’ve got, then the PM would appear to be off the hook: it was no party.\nNo doubt, there is plenty more evidence for the police to sift through and which Sue Gray has yet to reveal to us. I will be patient and await the outcome.\nPublic commentary on broadcast media is even more vitriolic than some of my emails. Take, for example, the furore over Sir Keir Starmer escaping from a howling mob, outraged by his alleged failure to prosecute Jimmy Saville and -by implication in the commentary- they were clearly orchestrated by the PM’s remarks.\nHaving examined the footage for myself, they were only a handful of anti-vaxers led by Piers Corbyn; I heard them shouting, demanding to know why Sir Keir hadn’t backed Julian Assange; why he has abandoned the working class; why he has embraced the ‘new world order’ -whatever that may be.\nYes, there was a shout about Saville, but the notion that the activities of this bunch had been motivated by ill-chosen remarks from the PM is a measure of just how hysterical our broadcast news reporting has become.\nThe Calculation\nPreviously In this column Parties (desmondswaynemp.com) I described my original detachment from the PM’s difficulties, because I voted against all the rules of which he had fallen foul. I also explained the confusion between regulation and guidance and how it applied differently between dwellings and places of work: I am confident that the PM is clear in his own mind that he attended work events rather than parties.\nThe difficulty is that the public perception is of serial rule breaking in Downing Street and even more important, that the PM has not been straight with Parliament about it.\nI use the word ‘perception’ because we have yet to have see full facts from either Sue Gray or now, the Metropolitan Police. We are reliant on the hyperbole of journalists who were not present. A ‘prosecco-fuelled party’ might just have been a restrained glass of wine amongst properly distanced work colleagues in an office where they lawfully worked together. Access to the facts is important.\nAlso important, particularly for politicians reliant on the support of voters, is the public perception of these events, and that perception may already be settled opinion.\nThe calculation with which Conservative members of Parliament must wrestle is whether the PM is capable of regaining public trust and the authority to govern. He has, after all, managed it previously: My correspondence was equally large and angry following his failure to sack Dominic Cummings after his ‘eye-test’ at Barnard Castle. Yet he re-established a ten-point poll lead. Could he repeat the feat, or has he irretrievably trashed his brand?\nThey also need to consider the unpredictability of the outcome if they initiate the process of replacing the PM.\nThere remain dedicated and enthusiastic supporters of Boris in Parliament, in the voluntary Conservative party and amongst the Public: I know this because hundreds of them have emailed me. I recall, my own anger and bitterness when parliamentarians jettisoned Mrs Thatcher, which had consequences which lasted years.\nA member of the public put it to me yesterday, that it would be absurd to remove a strong charismatic leader at such a time of national and international danger. It is a proper consideration.\nBoris won a general election and delivered Brexit as promised. Does his parliamentary party owe him loyalty for having delivered them from the chaos of the 2017-19 Parliament, or has he become an embarrassment and permanent liability?\nA number of my parliamentary colleagues are loathe to give satisfaction to the broadcast journalists who always opposed Brexit and are out for revenge. Equally, they know they are receiving a significant number of template letters whose authors claim to have hitherto always voted conservative – when they know full well that it often isn’t true.\nAll these things weigh on the mind.\nTo save anyone asking however, I’ll be keeping my own counsel\n4-Day Week\nThe numbers of unemployed workers are back down to the sort of levels that we experienced before Covid-19 struck and the number of vacancies is at an all-time high.\nNevertheless, before the pandemic we also had record levels of employment too. Now however, we have about a million fewer workers at work. If we accept rough estimates that some 500,000 Europeans have returned to the continent, then that leaves us struggling to explain why half a million people have become economically inactive. Is it that the experience of lock-down and furlough have left them disinclined to return to the stress of the workplace and that they place a higher value on their time away from it? Might a shorter working week tempt them back to work? The demand for a shorter working week with no loss of pay has been on the agenda of the political left for some time. Most people recognise however, that it is economic suicide unless accompanied by greater productivity in the worked hours to compensate. A shorter working week will not suit many enterprises: Most of us will have experienced the frustration of enquiring about an important piece of work, only to discover that the key person to speak to is on leave. Adding 52 further such days per year on which that might occur with a 4-day week, would not necessarily make for greater productivity. Nevertheless, there may be enterprises which could cope well with a shorter week. In 1976 I worked in a factory that operated a three-day week. Initially they had been forced to do so, as everyone had, during the Miner’s Strike of 1973-4. When the strike was over and the 5-day week was restored however, this particular company -having discovered just how much more productive they had become during the national emergency measure- carried on with just the 3 days working.A trial for a four-day week is due to run for six months later this year if 30 or so companies can be recruited to participate. Employees will get 100% of their previous pay for 80% of their previous hours in exchange for 100% of their previous productivity. Academics from Oxford & Cambridge will monitor performance – but not nearly as closely, I expect, as the boards of directors will.\nI am sceptical because my experience was of a manufacturing unit. I ‘m not convinced that the model will work for our largely service based economy, but if firms are willing to experiment, the results may be interesting. Of one thing I’m certain however, it certainly wouldn’t work in the Commons.Protect innocence online email campaign\nWhile going online can be hugely beneficial for children, who use the internet for connecting with peers, accessing educational resources and for entertainment, I completely agree that it is vital that children are protected from accessing inappropriate, harmful content, including online pornography.\nThe Government announced in October 2019 that it would not commence the age verification provisions of Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act 2017. While I appreciate your frustration with this decision, the Draft Online Safety Bill will be able to go further than the Digital Economy Act’s focus on online pornography on commercial adult sites. It will be able to protect children from a broader range of harmful content and activity, across a wider range of sites\nUnder the upcoming Online Safety Bill, companies will be expected to use age assurance or age verification technologies to prevent children from accessing services which pose the highest risk of harm, such as online pornography. This will capture both the most visited pornography sites and pornography on social media. These measures will also bring into scope more online pornography currently accessible to children than would have been covered by the narrower scope of Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act.\nThe final legislation, when introduced to Parliament, will also contain provisions that require companies to report child sexual exploitation and abuse content identified on their services. This will ensure companies provide law enforcement with the high-quality information they need to safeguard victims and investigate offenders.\nMore broadly, in line with the Government’s response to the Online Harms White Paper, the Bill will require all companies in scope to have a duty of care towards their users so that what is unacceptable offline will also be unacceptable online. They will need to consider the risks their sites may pose to the youngest and most vulnerable people and act to protect children from inappropriate content and harmful activity. Furthermore, the largest and most popular social media sites (Category 1 services) will need to act on content that is lawful but still harmful.\nDS.\nMake misogyny a hate crime email campaign\nProtecting women and girls from violence and supporting victims is of the utmost importance. The publication of the tackling violence against women and girls strategy will make progress towards ensuring that women and girls are safe everywhere – at home, online and on the streets. The strategy will increase support for victims and survivors, increase the number of perpetrators brought to justice and to reduce the prevalence of violence against women and girls in the long-term.\nSince the publication of the Hate Crime Action Plan in 2016 there has been an increase in reporting and improvements in identification and recording of crime by the police. However, rates of attrition within the criminal justice system remain worryingly high and targeted online abuse continues to present a significant problem. While in contrast to overall trends, under-reporting still exists within specific groups.\nYou may be aware of the wide-ranging Law Commission review into hate crime. The review, which has now been published, includes a number of recommendations around levelling up the protection for disability and LGBT victims, tackling sex and gender abuse, and protecting freedom of expression. The Government is currently reviewing the report and recommendations and I look forward to its full response in due course.\nWhile this is not making misogyny a hate crime, it can inform longer-term decisions once the Government has considered the recommendations made by the Law Commission.\nBeastly Whips\nI was surprised by the accounts of strong-arm tactics by Government whips. I know too many of them well and they are not unpleasant and aggressive ladies and gentlemen.\nI was myself a whip both in opposition and in Government and over the course of the decades I witnessed the waning of their influence.\nMy whip asks me how I plan to vote rather than telling me. It’s not unreasonable for me to let him know, so that he can at least get the responsible minister to address my reservations and see if he can persuade me with reasonable argument.\nThat one might believe a threat to turn off government largesse in one’s constituency strikes me as highly improbable. Government expenditure just doesn’t work like that. You’d have to be quite gullible to believe any such threat.\nSlightly more plausible would be a threat to stymie your prospects of becoming a minister, or other parliamentary career opportunity, were you flout the whip. Nevertheless, even that threat has diminished over recent years. There was a time when the Party Leader would focus on Cabinet appointments and leave the junior ministerial ranks to the Chief Whip to decide, but those days have gone. Equally, the appointment of so many serial rebels to high office has made nonsense of the notion that promotion is dependent on obedience.\nThe appointment to sit on Commons Select Committees, or to be Chairman of any of them was, until recently, entirely in the gift of party whips, giving them significant patronage and leverage. That however, was reformed under the Cameron premiership and those positions are now elected, removing another potential weapon from the armoury of the whips.\nThere have been other factors at work too which have led to more independence of mind among MPs.\nFirst, the ease of electronic communication has given MPs much more exposure to the opinions and influence of their constituents. It also provides a useful network for like-minded MPs to encourage one another under the radar in any potential rebellion.\nFinally, the opening-up of candidate selection processes to more democratic procedures, such as open primaries, introduced number of MPs who considered that it was more their own personal ‘brand’ rather than their party brand that won the day and, in turn, they exhibited a greater measure of independence. Though they were few in number, their attitude was very infectious.\nThe notion that whipping can influence a leadership challenge is just complete nonsense and it is secrecy makes nonsense of it. Whatever you may tell your whip, or anyone else for that matter, only The Chairman of the 1922 Committee ever knows if you really sent in a letter, and only you yourself will know how you voted in any subsequent ballot.\nIt’s a bit like the constituent who stopped me the other day and told me he’d only vote for me at the next election if I voted for a particular candidate after a leadership challenge. No doubt he trusted me to tell him who I voted for in any such ballot, but how would I ever know that he’d fulfilled his part of the bargain at the next election?\nWith whipping, I think we almost got to the position where, if you want to win, then you’ve got to win the argument. Which in a democracy, is no bad thing.\nUnequal access to IVF treatment email campaign\nIn England, decisions about local NHS fertility services are determined by clinical commissioning groups, taking account of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) fertility guidelines. Local National Health Service bodies are expected to commission fertility services in line with the NICE guidelines so that there is equal access across England.\nThe existing NICE fertility guidelines include provisions for same sex couples who have demonstrated their clinical infertility through six failed cycles of artificial insemination. The criteria in the guidelines were developed as a way of achieving equivalence between opposite-sex and same-sex couples in establishing clinical infertility and accessing National Health Service fertility treatment services. NICE has begun a scoping process for the review of these guidelines.\nNo couple should face disproportionate or unequal costs in their efforts to overcome fertility issues, which is why it is important that NICE is looking at reviewing the existing guidelines.\nDS.\nParties\nI voted against the regulations that deprived of us of so much of our liberty during the various iterations of lock-down over the last couple of years.\nI also spent a significant amount of time explaining the regulations to constituents, advising them and answering their questions about what they were permitted to do. This was particularly the case for so many self-employed constituents who were unclear as to whether they could continue working. The principal difficulty was confusion between what was regulation and what was only guidance. This even confused police officers, with people being told to stop doing things which, in fact, they were entitled to do.\nI rather think that Sue Gray’s inquiry into parties in Downing Street will focus on this distinction between regulation and guidance and, in particular, the fact that Number 10 is a place of work and not a dwelling, where the rules were quite different.\nIf this does indeed turn out to be the Monopoly “get out of jail free card”, I fear it just won’t wash because the distinction between regulation and guidance was never clear in the minds of the public in the first place.\nAs far as they are concerned it looks like one rule for us and another for everyone else.\nA significant danger for the PM, were he to be exonerated by Sue Gray’s inquiry, is that some new allegation then hits the headlines.\nI have received a huge correspondence on this whole business, representing a number of different points of view. I’ve said I will reflect on all that constituents have said to me -and I will.\n- « Previous Page\n- 1\n- …\n- 23\n- 24\n- 25\n- 26\n- 27\n- …\n- 69\n- Next Page »",

I certainly don’t know of any, beyond our own historic rights for the Ireland and some to Commonwealth countries\nGeneral Elections and referendums can change the whole course of our country’s progress and history in a way that local council elections can never do. Accordingly, the right to participate in national elections should be reserved for our own nationals.\nIt isn’t even as If they’ve asked: The move appears to an unsolicited offer, or to be strictly correct, potential offer by the Leader of the Labour Party.\nIf EU nationals settled in the UK really want to vote on our national issues then they can apply to become one of our nationals. The process is straightforward, and you only have to have lived in the UK for 5 years in order to apply.\nThere are almost three and a half million EU nationals settled in the UK. Were they to be automatically granted the right to vote in our general elections and referendums then, as a group of voters, they would amount to more than all the voters in Wales. They would potentially have more influence on the outcome of any poll than one of the constituent nations of our United Kingdom.\nSo, what could be the motive for this sudden and unsought generosity to participate in determining the national affairs of the UK?\nForgive me, but I’m a politician, and I simply can’t help it: My suspicious mind immediately leaps to the conclusion that Sir Kier has spotted some electoral advantage for the Labour Party by expanding the franchise in this way. To be blunt, I suggest that he expects the bulk of this new cohort of voters to vote Labour. Perhaps he even dreams of harnessing their support to reverse our referendum decision in 2016 to leave the EU. After all, he tried to do so several times during the 2016 to 2019 Parliament.\nMy advice to any voter is to be very careful if considering voting for a party that contemplates being so careless with the right to vote. We could very well find that we’d lost sovereignty over our affairs once again.",

There was the gruesome burning alive in public of a captured Jordanian pilot. Then a month or so ago video footage was released to show just how inventive their cruelty could be: a group of captives were tethered at the neck with explosive cord used in construction, and decapitated simultaneously when the cord was detonated; another group were crammed into a car which was then destroyed with a rocket propelled grenade; The worst atrocity was reserved for a third group who were slowly lowered in a cage into a swimming pool to be drowned, with underwater cameras to capture their last agonies.\nThat these tortures were designed by zealots claiming to be the servants of God, and meted out on their own co-religionists, is truly bizarre. What God is it that they worship? Kali perhaps? Certainly not Allah the most gracious, the most merciful.\nIn an idle hour on holiday, whilst my wife busied herself in a museum of cookery, I visited a museum of mediaeval torture. These tortures were designed by Christians for Christians. I am afraid the display of ingenuity at delaying the moment of death, whilst maximising the pain and prolonging agony, puts Da’ash to shame. By comparison with the servants of Christendom – in the pain game, at least – they are a bunch of mere amateurs.\nWhat sort of mind is it that busies itself designing gruesome ways of killing others so horribly?\nI do not believe that such minds have any place in Islam, any more than they had any place in Christianity. There is a darkness within humanity however, some of us just enjoy killing. Whilst some people may play golf, a tiny number of others plan their next serial murder.\nThe added horror is when these twisted souls adopt an ideology which they believe sanctions their grizzly hobby. This perversion is apt to give religion a bad name. It seems to me reasonable that Muslims and Christians alike should strive to point out that it has absolutely nothing in common with true religion.",

Strangely there never has been any legal restrictions on Sunday trading in Scotland (except for pubs). In 1994 however, another less permissive regime did manage to pass into law. This enabled the current situation which we now enjoy: the larger shops (those over 3000 Square feet) are allowed to open for up to six hours between 10 o’clock in the morning and 6 o’clock in the evening on Sundays.\nFollowing the successful extended Sunday opening during the Olympics there has been some pressure to revisit the question of extending Sunday opening once again. Personally, I think that it is unfair to restrict high street opening when internet shopping proceeds unrestrained on a Sunday. Restrictions have never applied in Scotland but they appear to get along quite reasonably: Sundays there seem to remain ‘special’ and I understand that Church attendance is proportionately higher than in England.\nIn recent weeks. I have received quite a large number of emails asking me to vote against changes to Sunday trading hours which are now before Parliament. This is a false premise and I have replied pointing out that no such proposal is before Parliament. The proposal was not to change opening hours, but to change the responsibility for determining the trading hours. Currently Sunday trading in England and Wales is a matter for Parliament in Westminster. The proposal was to allow decisions for England and Wales to be devolved to local authorities, so that elected councils would be allowed to say how long on a Sunday larger shops could remain open for. So, there was no plan to change the hours, only to change who makes decisions about the hours.\nFrankly, it seems reasonable to let more important decisions be made locally, as indeed they are in Scotland. This whole issue has apparently now been shelved because, with a majority of only 12, a small number of Tory rebels threatened to vote against the measure as they believe it is important to defend the rights of Christians not to work on a Sunday. As a Christian myself, I think they are mistaken but I respect their decision and their principles.\nLabour is opposed to the measure because the Trades Unions oppose it. Though I rather suspect that many workers would welcome the extra overtime and the additional jobs it will create.\nThe Scottish Nationalists however, really do win the prize for unprincipled absurdity. They have no restrictions in Scotland, and they can control hours if they want to in their own Parliament at Holyrood. Yet they want to prevent English councils making decisions which do not affect Scotland at all. Having failed to get the Scots to vote for independence last year. I sometimes wonder if their new strategy is to annoy the English to such an extent that we vote for it instead.",

I know- I spent 13 years of it. The Government has the initiative, all the popular announcements, and the ability to disguise any bad news.\nLast week the Opposition’s misery was compounded by their belief that it was their own manifesto’s large expenditure proposals that the Chancellor was stealing.\nTo be fair, there was a little nervousness on the Government side as some of us felt that people had not necessarily voted Conservative in December in the expectation that the Tories would bring in a Labour budget.\nIn reality, the budget wasn’t quite like that. Whilst there was more money for the NHS, it was by no means John McDonnell’s drive for increased day to day expenditure across the board, paid for by taxing business and the better off.\nThe Budget’s emphasis -aside from vital help to deal with Covid19, was on investment to address Britain’s low productivity and to ‘level-up’ those areas that have been in long-term relative decline.\nThis incentive to borrow in order to invest is hard to resist: currently the Government can take a ten-year loan in the markets with a zero, and even negative rate of interest.\nNevertheless, I do have reservations.\nI believe in a smaller state and lower taxes, and that in our mixed economy we need more of the private sector and less of the government sector in the mix. This budget took as a step in the other direction.\nLarge scale investments will be undertaken by the Government, in the past government investment performance has been patchy. I have never had confidence in government’s ability to ‘pick winners’.\nThe distinction between what is ‘investment’ -generating future returns, and what is day to day current expenditure has often been an elastic one. Fiscal rules are not immune to bending.\nThat is why it is always prudent to keep the total government borrowing requirement in check and to see that the stock of government debt is on a downward trend as a proportion of national income (it still is -just).\nI recall a Conservative election poster in 2010 with the image of a new-born baby and the slogan ‘ she has her mother’s eyes, her father’s hair…and Gordon Brown’s debt’.\nTories must continue to heed their own advice about borrowing: never to borrow now in the expectation that future generations will repay.\nAddendum\nWhat a difference a couple of days make:\nWhat I wrote on Sunday for this column was completely overtaken by events on Tuesday.\nHaving expressed some concern about an expansionary budget of £30 billion, how do I react to the announcement this week of a further £330 billion.\nCounterintuitively, I approve wholeheartedly.\nWe are now in an economic existential crisis pf a greater order than 2008. We responded then with an even larger package to prevent the collapse of the financial sector. It was tough but it paid off.\nIt is essential that we respond to the new circumstance to prevent economic oblivion.",

It might be a family in bed and breakfast accommodation; or a house that is too small for their needs; or damp, or next door to unsuitable neighbours.\nThey might come and see me because they are in debt.\nOr it might be that there is a problem with schooling, being unable to manage the journey to the allocated school place, or problems with behaviour or attainment at school.\nOr it might be problems with social security benefits leaving them unable to make ends meet and having to rely on food banks.\nOr it might arise from problems with payments from a former partner for maintenance of their children, or perhaps access to the children being improperly denied by one of the partners.\nHowever the problem presents, scratch the surface, and nine times out of ten the root cause is family breakdown. It is the swiftest way to poverty and it is of epidemic proportions, costing us billions of pounds in dealing with the social consequences.\nFor children under 12 we are judged to have the most volatile family circumstances in the developed world. More than half our sixteen-year-olds no longer have a father living in the home.\nMarriage is not perfect, no human institution can be given our fallen nature. Yet it is the most stable of social arrangements that we possess: For children whose parents marry, those parents are more likely to remain together throughout their childhood by a factor of two thirds, as compared to those children whose parents choose not to marry.\nArguably any number of government policies impact to the disadvantage of marriage.\nCurrently the Department of Education is consulting on how marriage should be treated in our education system, to which end I met the new Secretary of State last week. Notwithstanding the huge social problems that we face it would appear that ministers are reluctant to robustly defend marriage for fear of appearing ‘judgemental’. It seems to me, given the magnitude of the social problem, that there is a proper judgement to be made.\nIn his response to a debate a fortnight ago, the Minister for the Cabinet Office told us that ‘families come in many shapes and sizes’.

Constituency duties were therefore, largely confined to weekends.\nThings have changed, we now only sit on 13 Fridays per year and they are all taken up with private members bills.\nConstituency Fridays have become a habit. Weekends are no less busy, but there are things you can do on a Friday that you just can’t do at the weekend, such as visiting schools, most business premises, or most public services and officials. Consequently, MPs have become quite jealous about protecting their productive Fridays in their constituencies.\nHow does this square with private members bills?\nFirst, to be successful in piloting a bill through Parliament you need to be lucky because the order is determined by ballot. Second, you need to choose a bill that is of very limited scope and almost wholly uncontroversial. This is because your enemy is the limited time available to you. Very rarely will your opponents need to vote against your bill, they just have to take up the available time.\nUnlike the US Senate however, we do not tolerate a filibuster. Scrutiny of your bill must be proper and pertinent. Mr Speaker will order members to resume their seats if they are tedious, repetitious, stray from the point, or read speeches verbatim. If however, your bill has wide implications and is controversial you are multiplying the opportunities for your opponents to legitimately opine at length without difficulty.\nThere have been demands for reform and to make more time available, but the current system has suited Governments of all persuasions. Back-bencher’s bills have bees in their bonnets and happy thoughts that usually come with a large price tag or any number of complicated implications. It is convenient for ministers to rely on a small number of Friday devotees to ‘talk them out’.\nCampaigners write to their MP to demand their attendance on a particular Friday to support a bill listed for that day. It is a ‘big ask’ because several bills are listed each sitting Friday and unless the bill is first in the order there is little chance of it being reached, so your time will have been wasted.\nEven if you support a bill passionately, its enemy is the time available, so you would be foolish indeed if you went along and took up any of that precious time yourself. Actually, the best way to support a bill is to shut up, or to stay away.\nOf course, a very few controversial private members bills have succeeded, but that is only when they have been backed by the Government.\nThere’s the lesson: complicated, controversial, or expensive legislation needs to take place in government time when it will have lengthy and thorough treatment by both Government and Opposition, not just an interested few on a Friday.\nSometimes however, something will turn out to be surprisingly uncontroversial: last Friday the Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill passed its second reading in good time and unopposed",

This measures makes the Electoral Commission more accountable will strengthen the integrity of the electoral process and help prevent fraud.\nOnce in force, the statement will set out guidance and principles which the Commission will have to consider when carrying out its functions. It is commonplace for the Government to set a broad policy framework, as approved by Parliament, by which independent regulators should work. This is already the case for Ofcom and Ofgem, for example.\nAs required by the Elections Act, the Government sought views on a draft of the Strategy and Policy Statement from the Electoral Commission, the Speaker’s Committee on the Electoral Commission and the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee. In light of the feedback of the consultees, the draft statement has been amended to provide additional reassurances that the statement in no way amounts to the Government directing the Electoral Commission. Changes include further clarifying that the Electoral Commission’s executive leadership will remain responsible for determining the Commission’s priority setting and allocation of its resources. The final draft of the statement has been laid before Parliament for approval.\nThese reforms will not compromise the independence of the Electoral Commission. While the Commission will be required to have regard to the Strategy and Policy Statement, this does not give the Government new powers to direct the Electoral Commission’s decision making. The Commission will continue to be governed by the Commissioners and will remain operationally independent of government. The introduction of the statement would not in any way affect the ability of the Commission to undertake investigative, operational or enforcement activity as it sees fit, but it will ensure greater accountability to Parliament on how the Electoral Commission discharges its wider functions. The Government introduced measures to prohibit the statement from including reference to specific investigatory or enforcement activity to provide further reassurance on the Commission’s operational independence.\nDS",

I want to keep it that way and that is why we are taking the action that we are, so that this does not get out of hand like we saw in the first peak.\nNow, I didn’t just ask the question at random. I had already looked at the statistics that are publicly available and which show that the number of daily deaths at 1600 or so daily, is normal -and has been at the normal expected level since June.\nThe Secretary of State’s reply reveals his good intention, to avoid calamity.\nThe action that he is taking however, brings on another set of calamities in terms of ruined businesses, unemployment, consequent mental health problems, and yes, even deaths. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: the proven result of lock-downs, is that they make poor people poorer.\nMy intention in asking that question was attempt to expose the fundamental contradiction between fact and what ministers, guided by the scientists who advise them, are telling us.\nThey claim that a deadly pandemic is stalking the land. Yet the fact is that the number of deaths is consistent with the long-term average. Both these statements cannot be true, they are mutually exclusive. If a deadly pandemic is in progress then the number of excess deaths above the long term average would bear witness to it. They don’t.\nI conclude that the pandemic ended in the summer and that the increase in cases arises from the testing of healthy people on an industrial scale, using a methodology that throws-up false positives. I will not be persuaded that a deadly pandemic is again in progress until it reveals itself in excess deaths (and that those excess deaths genuinely arise from the virus and not from other untreated conditions).\nA very small number of correspondents have written to me to say that I have no right to make such a judgement because I am not a doctor or a scientist.\nOn the contrary, a huge number of scientists and doctors have contacted me to say that they agree with me.\nI am a rational person trying to reconcile what we are being told about the virus, as against the plain facts revealed in the statistics.\nAccordingly, it is proper to demand an explanation as to why measures are being inflicted upon us which intrude into our personal liberty and are deeply damaging to us economically.\nIn the Commons I pointed out that it is precisely because the Government’s actions defy rational explanation, that constituents write to me with increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories of their own.\nHere I draw a blank. However irrational their policy, I am at a loss to explain what motive ministers might have for pursuing it, other than that they genuinely believe it to be right.\nQui bono?\nWhat other motive could they possibly have?",

On the contrary, the opinion polling has been showing a clear lead for compulsory masks.\nBut I know that I spoke for many when opposed this policy in the House of Commons. I was the only dissenter when the announcement was made, and it is important that the significant minority opinion have its voice heard in Parliament.\nThe subsequent reaction demonstrates that I have tapped into a well of outrage: of some 360 emails I received in the 72 hours following my intervention, twenty were in support of the stance that I took to every one against. Again, I do not pretend that this is a representative sample, but clearly a very significant number of people are angry about being compelled to wear a face covering.\nQuite a few of the emails were from clinicians who split evenly between those supporting the policy and those opposing it. Some arguing that masks were a danger to health. I am not qualified to intrude on that dispute. What I can confidently say however, is that scientific opinion remains divided.\n(I understand that no studies have been done on Covid-19 and masks, and we rely instead on studies based on flu, which are inconclusive).\nI possess a mask and I wear it, as required, on the train. Personally, I have no objection to people being strongly encouraged to wear masks, but clearly many people object to being forced to do so, as do I.\nAs I see it, the difficulty is that, having implemented this policy now -when the disease is in abeyance (we have a deficit of deaths: fewer people are dying than the long-term average for this time of year), and we are easing all the other restrictions that have been imposed, how are we ever going to find the circumstance in which we can remove the requirement.\nWhen he was asked this in the Commons, the Secretary of State said we’d have to think about it later.\nWe have discovered that it’s easy enough to impose restrictions but much more difficult to lift them, re-opening schools being an obvious example\nI believe that this policy on masks was a decision taken with the laudable objective of getting the economy moving. Many of our more wary citizens have yet to be tempted back on to our high streets where their footfall and consumption is desperately needed to revive economic activity. The calculation is that they will feel more comfortable and safer if they, and everyone else, is masked.\nI hope the Government has made the right call, and that it doesn’t have the opposite effect -which was certainly the concern expressed to me by a number of prominent local retailers.\nI’ve said before in this column, that in the age of the internet retail has to have ‘a better offer’: it needs to be a pleasant social experience if it is to compete with the convenience of the internet.\nI don’t believe that masks will help, but now that the decision has been made, I really hope that I am wrong about that.",

However hard local politicians struggle to keep a local focus, the political parties centrally fight them as proxies for future general elections. Last week was no different.\nOf all the voters that I spoke to in the New Forest, they were focussed on the national picture and saw their vote as a comment on the Government’s performance rather than that of New Forest District Council which, almost without exception, they considered to be well run.\nOf the two local issues that were raised with me, the biggest was potholes, which is a County Council responsibility rather than a matter for the District Council. The other was confined to specific locations where controversial housing developments had been approved. On this last question, my postbag divides between those who recognise that one of the major problems that we face in the New Forest is a desperate shortage of housing; and those who insist that the proposed developments are in the wrong place.\nIn any event, having had local elections based on a national rather than local focus, it is extremely difficult to make sense of the results. The psephologists have an algorithm for scaling up last week’s results where elections were held, to attribute similar results to where they weren’t held at all. And, so proceeding, to forecast what the result of a General Election would have been. I am very sceptical of the value of this exercise. First, even where national performance is at the forefront of their minds, nevertheless, people vote quite differently at local elections than they do at general elections.\nSecond, it is difficult enough to interpret the outcome on a party-political basis even within a relatively small geographical area. Take, for example, the New Forest West parliamentary division which comprises 12 of the New Forest District wards contested last week. Of those wards, in one each voter had three votes, in nine each voter had two votes, and in only two they had one vote as in a general election. To make interpretation even more complicated, it is clear from looking at the difference in votes cast for candidates of the same party within a single ward, that hundreds of voters used their multiple votes to vote for candidates of different parties.\nEven more difficult, not every one of the main parties fielded a candidate in each ward. All this before we take into account the average turnout of only 33% against a general election where you would expect nearer 80%.\nSo, for what it is worth, taking the votes for the leading candidate of each party in each ward in New Forest West, I estimate that of the 25,542 votes cast , the vote shares attributable to each party are: Conservative 37%; LibDem 23% ; Labour 15%; Green 13% ; Independent 12%. As for what any of this bodes for the general election -which might not even be until Jan 2025, I suggest it is far too soon to tell.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_social-care/content_787.html": "A number of my correspondents over the last few weeks have demanded to know why the Government did not lay before the voters detailed proposals to address the growing problems with social care.\nThose proposals are overdue, they were promised earlier this year. My hunch is that the paralysis caused by the BREXIT impasse and stalemate in Parliament took its toll on a number of aspects of policy which in ordinary circumstances would have secured greater attention and urgency.\nEven had the proposals been ready, it would have been foolish indeed to have sprung them on us during an election. As the polling guru Lynton Crosby says “you can’t fatten the pig on market day”. Measures to address the problems with social care are bound to be controversial and the level of analysis and rational discussion appropriate to them does not lend itself to electioneering.\nTheresa May tried exactly that in the 2017 election with her own proposals for social care, and to her great cost. I was no fan of those proposals, but it was equally clear to me that many of those who were dismayed by them, had little understanding of what they actually were.\nLike so many things, in the end the issue of social care comes down to two questions:\nHow much, and who pays?\nWhen we are ill, we expect the NHS to treat us and for the taxpayer to settle the entire bill, (costing some £134 billion over the next year).\nWhen we are ill and infirm to the extent that we need help everyday life however, we are expected to pay for it ourselves if we can afford to.\nDo we want to ‘nationalise’ another aspect of our life by having taxpayers take responsibility by footing the bill for social care in entirety (with obvious consequences for taxation)?\nCertainly, we cannot go on as we are now, spending too little on it and with the services available stretched beyond their limits.\nMy personal opinion is that the system ought to retain a balance between individuals and the state.\nI was always taught to save for a ‘rainy day’. If you require social care, isn’t that a rainy day?\nOver the years we have had a series of enquiries into the policy and Parliament broadly accepted the results of the commission led by the economist Andrew Dilnot in 2011. We legislated to implement Dilnot’s plan from 2021 onwards (giving more time for the public finances to recover because Dilnot’s proposals were expensive).\nBasically the Dilnot deal was this: social care would remain means-tested with the expectation that, if you could afford it, you would be liable for the first £80,000 of your care costs, and thereafter the taxpayer would meet the bills. The advantage of this design is that would create an insurance market for those who want to protect themselves from that first £80,000 liability. Currently no market exists because the liability for insurers is unlimited, but by creating a cap to liability at £80,000 you give insurers an aiming point for which they can design financial products.\nI never understood why Theresa May re-opened the issue in the 2017 election. We had the Dilnot plan and we should have stuck to it.",

Equally, that we Europeans have coasted under the US umbrella for years, enjoying a ‘peace dividend’ instead of meeting our proper financial share of the defence commitments. Little wonder that we are now being side-lined by the new US administration.\nNevertheless, Trump is making a monumental strategic mistake, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, by rewarding Putin, even before negotiations begin, offering up the key concessions of Ukrainian territory and a veto on its being admitted to NATO.\nNotwithstanding the stalemate on the battlefield, Putin had already lost the war. He anticipated eliminating Ukraine’s independence within days. He has wrought terrible destruction and terror there, but he has also suffered enormous Russian casualties and economic damage at home. He has reduced Russia to little more than a nuclear-armed petrol station.\nAnd now they have a problem with the petrol: According to analysis from Reuters, Russian oil companies are preparing to start forced production cuts as they are unable to sell millions of barrels of oil. Volumes from Russia’s western ports in January were down 17% from a year ago, and the cost of transporting a cargo from Russia’s Pacific ports to China increased fivefold last month. Goldman Sachs estimates that Russia has stored 17 million barrels aboard ships since January 10th. That figure could rise to 50 million barrels in the first half of this year. There is nowhere else where they can store it: there are virtually no large storage facilities in Russia, and the ones that do exist were damaged by Ukraine last month. Ukraine’s drone attacks have also knocked out around 10% of Russian refining capacity.\nRussia is reliant on the largesse of China, North Korea, Iran and Belarus – the world’s pariahs. This is exactly the moment to double down on sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and materiel support for Ukraine. Yet this is the moment that Trump has chosen to bring Putin in from the cold and back into the centre of world affairs. The Kremlin is cock-a-hoop.\nAs the ramifications sink in and events unfold, especially in Britain where we have been so united in our commitment to Ukraine, Reform’s nuptials with all things Trump may well begin to pall.\nAnd Trump may just keep giving… with tariffs, climate vandalism, Gaza, and heaven knows whatever next.\nFarage has tied his party’s fate to something over which he has no control.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_scotland/content_809.html": "I’ve been receiving a steady stream emails from constituents incensed by press reports that the government intends to assuage the thirst for independence in Scotland through ever more generous spending there. Rather more worrying from my point of view, is the government’s ambition to spend so much more throughout the UK: there will be consequences for inflation and interest rates.\nLet’s, for the present however, stick with the Scottish question.\nThe Scotland Act 1998 reserves the constitutional status of Scotland to the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament at Westminster. Accordingly, the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence was held with the consent of Westminster. The agreement to hold it was made on the clear understanding by all parties that it was to settle the question for a generation.\nThe precipitate demand for a further plebiscite is advanced by the argument that the whole nature of the question is now changed by Brexit, notwithstanding a majority of Scotland’s votes being for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.\nI do not accept this as a ‘game-changer’: any Scot voting on independence in 2014 would have factored into their decision the uncertainty of what might happen in the 2016 referendum on the EU, after all, the issue was highlighted throughout the independence referendum campaign.\nFollowing its re-election this month, the Scottish Government has made it clear that it will legislate to hold a second referendum on independence. The Prime Minister has made it equally clear that Westminster will not grant the powers to allow such a referendum to lawfully proceed.\nConsequently, the matter will come before the courts. The judges will look to interpret the Scotland Act 1998 which reserves the question of independence to Westminster: end of story?\nI rather doubt it.\nThe Scottish Government will frame its referendum question to give the Judges sufficient wriggle room to thwart Westminster. A straight referendum question on independence would fall foul of the 1998 Act, but how about a question asking voters to approve their Government in Edinburgh entering into negotiations with Westminster on the terms by which a future separation might be had.\nHow would the Supreme Court justices respond to that?\nI fear that we need to prepare actively and urgently for another independence referendum.\nThere are a number of English Nationalists who are inclined to say ‘good riddance’. I profoundly disagree. Scotland’s departure from the Union will have an enormous impact on the other member nations.\nThe cornerstone of our nuclear deterrent is built on deep water access through the Firth of Clyde.\nThe Scottish Government’s very different appetite for immigration and for re-joining the EU would necessitate a hard border between us which would make our current difficulties with the Northern Ireland Protocol look like a picnic. The economic damage would rebound on both of our economies.\nGiven that the UK of Great Britain and Northern Ireland would have ceased to exist, the question would undoubtedly arise as to whether we, as the remnant, should retain the UK’s permanent seat at the UN Security Council. We would be much diminished.\nWe need to develop a winning strategy, but I’m far from convinced that spending more money is it.",
  "https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_sir-desmond-swayne-td-mp-2_/https_www_desmondswaynemp_com_ds-blog_reform/content_344.html": "I’ve had a few letters from constituents, genuinely solicitous for my own political survival, suggesting that I switch allegiance to the Reform Party -for such is their own preference.\nI am not tempted. Though, some of Reform’s programme certainly appeals:: smaller Government, lower taxes, control of immigration, much greater exploitation of our Brexit freedoms:; A programme that definitely chimes with the section of the political spectrum that I occupy. Nevertheless, political parties in the UK, unlike parties in so much of continental Europe, have to be much more than a manifesto of measures that appeal to a particular segment of the electorate. Most European jurisdictions use electoral systems that are largely designed to ensure that the outcome of an election delivers representation proportional to the votes cast for each party. This guarantee of representation enables political parties to be much more ‘picky’ about the narrowness of their ideological purity and agenda. The constitutional principle in the UK however, is that the candidate with the most votes wins, irrespective of the proportion of the vote achieved. We vote for candidates in whose judgement we place our trust for the duration of a parliamentary term. That is why we do not hold a by-election if an MP switches party: votes were for a named candidate, whose political party allegiance is only secondary. After all, it’s only in my lifetime that we have allowed the names of political parties to be included on the ballot paper at all.Consequences follow from these different voting systems. Proportional electoral systems deliver a modest measure of success to a relatively large selection of political parties, each having put their manifesto to the vote, but rarely do any of whom command a majority. Coalitions are formed after the election through ‘horse trading’ between the parties to cobble together a numerical majority delivering a programme put together and agreed by the parties after the election, but which was never put to the voters at the election.\nTo have electoral success in the UK system however, requires much broader support to secure any representation at all. Consequently, UK political parties are ‘broad churches’. We make our coalitions before elections: each of our parties is a coalition that agrees on a set of values and principles but will encompass members with a spectrum of views on different issues. Unlike the European proportional systems, ours makes it very difficult for a new and ideological party to break through and win any constituency seats at all, even if they secure a proportion of the votes that gets into double figures. Unsurprisingly, part of the Reform offer is to change our system to the continental model. Whilst, all voting systems have differing advantages and disadvantages, we voted to keep our existing voting system in a referendum in 2011 by a margin of 70% to 30%. I’m satisfied with that decision.No, I’m not remotely tempted.",

We’ve not even been out of it 4 years yet. Those 4 years that have been dominated the economic impacts of war in Europe and a pandemic. We should give ourselves rather more ‘ordinary times’ in which to judge.\nThe premise in the motion ‘re-join’ implied that we would be going back to the way we were. We wouldn’t. The EU has changed dramatically; it’s engine, the Franco / German alliance, has collapsed; Schengen is in disarray; and the block is struggling to address the rise of the far-right.\nNeither could we expect the same membership terms – Mr’s Thatcher’s rebate, and John Major’s opt-outs -including a treaty obligation to join the Euro.\nThe favoured statistic of the joiners is that, in years to come, our economy will be 4 to 6 % smaller than if we hadn’t left. The genesis of that statistic however, is the same Treasury forecast which predicted an immediate recession in 2016 following the referendum, with unemployment rising by 10,000 per month. In fact it fell by almost that much and we ended the year as the best performing developed economy.\nForecasting is always bedevilled by incomplete data and questionable assumptions. Typical of its sort, we’ve just had a new analysis from a prestigious business school. It begins by saying that we have seen only modest gains from our accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But that membership hasn’t even started yet -that’s not till 15th December. The report goes on to note a catastrophic decline in aspects of export performance. The problem is that the boffins failed to spot that the export reporting codes have changed and they’ve simply missed the data.\nThat we have significant economic problems is not in dispute. Nevertheless, we are doing comparatively well: in the last quarter for which statistics are to be had, our GDP growth was twice that of the EU, (though EU growth is not a high bar).\nOur future prosperity depends not being in or out of the EU, but rather on how hard we work, our risk appetite, the business-friendly nature of our tax and regulatory regime. In an increasingly competitive world, we will need to be agile and flexible.\nThat agility is bound to be enhanced by our ability to make decisions quickly in our own best interest rather than reliance on mechanisms that require a qualified majority negotiated between 27 member states.\nIn the EU Council of Ministers, we so often didn’t push our objections to a vote because we could see we hadn’t a chance. On the 72 occasions when we did force a vote – we lost every time.\nWe were increasingly governed by people we didn’t elect and couldn’t remove.\nIn this respect Brexit has already delivered: we are no longer required to implement damaging arrangements to which we were opposed.\nThe proposer blamed the Conservative Party for taking us out of the EU. When I pointed out that it was the people who made that choice, my opponent, Rachel Johnson, responded that it was the fault of the Conservatives for granting the people a referendum: proof that the contempt for democracy by the liberal elite, is unabated.",

The resolution to ‘disagree honourably’ without imputing the basest of motives to those with whom we disagreed, certainly didn’t survive Wednesday’s debate. The name-calling and gesticulating was vile, and I’m very sad to say that some of my correspondence has been little better.\nThe parliamentary disciplinary system has the three parts: an investigation by the Commissioner; the scrutiny of her report by the Select Committee: and a debate by the Commons on the Committee’s findings and recommended sanction. The Process is owned by the Commons and its members have every right to explore and question the report, to reject or amend its recommendations.\nNevertheless, Wednesday was the first time we’ve actually done so. What was different this time?\nThe difference was that this was the first time that the defendant has vigorously denied the charges. On all the other occasions in recent years the accused has confessed, apologised and begged for mercy. The system appeared shocked, even affronted, that the accused might resist: there seemed something rather sinister when the Committee Chairman broke parliamentary convention and addresses Mr Patterson directly at the end of the debate : “this could have been very different if you had come to us and said ‘I am sorry, I was trying to do the right thing but I got it wrong’…”\nHe appeared to be unable to comprehend that the accused believed that he had done nothing wrong at all and that, on the contrary, he had acted entirely properly and in the public interest.\nNow, the inquisitorial method adopted by the Commissioner and the Committee may well be satisfactory for the uncontested confessions that we had hitherto experienced, but where the interpretation of the facts is so vigorously contested, a more rigorous process, where witnesses are cross-examined, would be appropriate. The Standing Orders provide for the Commissioner and the Committee to adopt such a procedure. They chose not to, but no explanation was had as to why they had not done so. In my opinion it was therefore proper for the Commons to consider whether the accused had been given a fair hearing.\nThe Committee acts to a large extent as a jury. Jurors have to attend the whole of a trial, they may not absent themselves when attendance is inconvenient. As I pointed out in the debate on Wednesday, when Commons special standing committees sit on private bills hearing evidence they must attend the entire proceeding. In this case however, Mr Paterson’s ‘jury’ adopted another approach: at the three formal sessions on their report, different members were present, barely 50% of them attended all three meetings. Four of the eleven members who sat for the final meeting had not even attended the session in which Mr Paterson was heard by the Committee.\nI signed the amendment which left the Committee’s recommendation unresolved until a further review has examined the process.

The ICB chair would have the power to veto members of the board and there are robust requirements on ICBs to manage conflicts of interests.\nThat said, I do appreciate that there are concerns about private sector involvement in ICBs. It is important that people are assured that the work of ICBs will be driven by health outcomes, not by profits.\nI know that the Bill does not allow private sector providers to influence, or to make, decisions on spending, but it is welcome that the Government has committed to putting that beyond doubt. They have tabled an amendment for the next stage of the Bill’s passage through Parliament.

I am surprised at how soon it has been agreed, because I recall just how challenging it was for my colleague Richard Harrington a year ago. Scotland and the north were generous but it was much harder to find places in the south. Notwithstanding the offers of local churches, the proposal that Ringwood should take a family secured very little support from the council.\nI think the balance the government struck was the right one: we are the second largest donor and, with 4.5 million Syrian refugees, our money goes so much further helping many more refugees in the region. Nevertheless, our decision to take the most vulnerable direct from the camps was both proportionate and properly targeted, because it did not encourage further trafficking across the Mediterranean – where Syrians account for only a minority of those being trafficked. At one discussion a senior cabinet minister told me that it was the job our £14 billion aid budget (his overestimate) “to buy the migrants back to Africa”. It was Theresa May who rescued me by pointing out that, were we to do so, their places would very soon be taken by others. The proper job of our aid budget is to spend it securing peace and economic development in the places where so many people see that their only current option is to leave. That this is in our vital national interest, strikes me as blindingly obvious.\n*\nNews of the personal life the Bishop of Grantham reminded me of that vast correspondence – dwarfing even the letters about hunting – which I received about gay marriage.
