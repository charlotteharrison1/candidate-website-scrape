It's great to meet you.\nTo tell you a little bit about me:\nI'm about to turn 52 and decided to run for the role of the local councillor due to my disappointment in our current political classes.\nI think it's time for change - and bringing in new people with a lifetime of experience, I think, can help us to change things for the better, for us all.\nI have been a psychological therapist for many years now, and used to work in an NHS mental health service. This opened my eyes to so many of the problems we all face in every day life, and I wanted to be able to do more.\nIf you have any questions, or would like to just say hello, please do feel free to email me at hume.maria@gmail.com.\nbottom of page",
