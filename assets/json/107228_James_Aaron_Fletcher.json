Our civil servants struggle to give away the billions of pounds each year so end up giving money to the EU and other global bodies to help spend it. Most of our foreign aid doesn’t even reach the people it is intended for & only lines the pockets of foreign rulers and dictators.\nInstead, I would commit to providing our military as support for disasters worldwide as required. Boots, food and medicine on the ground direct to those who need it when required.\nWe cannot look after our own citizens of the UK adequately and yet we get involved around the world as a priority attempting to impose our version of democracy on countries that don’t really want it whilst imposing trade and financial sanctions on those that question our motives.\nRegardless of our good intentions, many people in the countries that we get involved with resent our ‘assistance’. and subsequently many of the terrorist atrocities we have faced have been inspired by our initial actions abroad. Through Government foreign strategy are we creating the extremists that seek to harm us?\nOpponents to this will say that by intervening in foreign affairs we are helping to protect the UK from further illegal immigration, economic migrants etc. But, economic migration has grown exponentially since we got involved with Afganistan, Iraq, Syria, etc.\nUsing a variety of methods but mainly small boats, Illegal migration coming to British shores has risen to levels never seen before in history with a slue of tory PM’s and Home Secretaries choosing tough rhetoric for public theatre instead of actually doing what is necessary to stop this invasion.\nhttps://reformparty.uk/the_boats_keep_coming\nWhile we arguably have a moral duty to protect the persecuted, I would suggest that our current strategy for doing so is not working & is actually increasing the risk for our citizens. The primary role of Government is to protect its people, culture and beliefs.\nTo save us more than half of the National Insurance increase in April 2022, I would reduce our foreign aid budget. Currently 0.5% of GDP and soon to be increased back to its previous level of 0.7% GDP down to 0.35%. That’s £7 Billion a year down from £14 Billion.\nOur government appears to have an opposite view. Pensioners struggle to stay warm, homeless numbers increase, foodbank use increases, national debt increases, but before we deal with any of that, we as a country give away £14 billion in foreign aid. It isn’t sustainable.\nI’m all for giving to charity. but, I only donate spare money I have. I firstly put food on my table, pay my utility bills, put fuel in my car etc and then with what’s left over I decide what to do with it.",

Our freedom is so valuable, yet so vulnerable. The restrictions on our freedoms by the Government during the Covid pandemic amounted to a major erosion of our rights and civil liberties.\nMany people were affected in a lot of different ways since the initial lockdown in early march 2020 and this will no doubt echo well into the future. We lost a dear family member in 2020, like many others around the country who had to feel the unnecessary heartbreak of being unable to visit loved ones during their last moments due to the restrictions imposed by the then Health Secretary Matt Hancock and those within Boris Johnston’s government and shadow government that voted for and stood behind these draconian measures imposed on the Great British public.\nDuring that time an irregular reality that was created by social media, legacy media who through constant reinforcement of the repeated covid narrative expertly controlled from Government behavioral nudge units has convinced/forced/coerced/shamed quite a few people into taking an experimental drug that for many it has caused problems later down the line and they regret the decision’s made.\nThe censorship & suppression of alternative viewpoints/treatment suggestions that could have helped and now we know would have helped is beyond reproach.\nWe will campaign relentlessly to protect our civil liberties and freedom of speech. We must be able to debate, test and challenge different views, consensus thinking, scientific theories and the establishment approach in a respectful way.\nFurther, conducting a total lockdown in unison with the other western countries all controlled by the central banks using the guise of the emergency powers act brought in during a so called global pandemic which allowed Government to loan from the Bank of England £500 billion with interest attached.\nThis eye wateringly staggering sum has caused very little public debate nor has been fully and openly costed for public scrutiny, currently the BoE interest rate sits at 3%, this is expected to go up again, as per usual it will be the British taxpayer that picks up the bill for the repeated mistakes of elected politicians.\nIf any laws have been broken, they should be held accountable to the full extent of the law.",

I will be standing as your Reform Party candidate at the next General Election.\nMy aim as the Spokesperson for a 3rd biggest political party in the UK is to introduce myself to as many constituents across Luton North as possible in the next 12 months.\nAt Reform UK we believe that we have a comprehensive set of common sense policies that will appeal to a broad cross section of the electorate.\nIf you are fed up with broken promises, high taxes and being taken for granted by successive Governments that seem to put everyone else ahead of you, then Reform UK is the party for you\nThe current Government has been in power for 13 years, in all likelihood they will have been in for 14 years at the time of the next General Election and all we have to show for it is High Tax, Low Growth & the drive to Net Zero at any cost.\nThe NET ZERO AGENDA must be stopped and the UK must withdraw from this agreement.\nIn 2016, the United Nations agreed a Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nThe agreement was opened for signatures on 22 April 2016 in New York. The UK was the 111th signature on the list, King Charles 111 who while Prince made the call to action to many others around the globe advising them to “use all the levers at our disposal” to push this so called climate crisis agenda through which ensured corporate fascism was able to replace the the lifeblood of the UK economy which are small to medium sized businesses.\nBelow is the link for government build back greener agenda\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1033990/net-zero-strategy-beis.pdf\nThe “Build Back Better” mantra chanted by the majority of the world leaders before, during and after they reluctantly released us from the draconian enforced lockdowns being used under the guise of a global pandemic alludes to the fact that this was most definitely planned and the many unnecessary restrictions which included people not allowed to visit loved ones in there last moments or only being entrusted with 20minutes exercise once a day were a flagrant disregard for civil liberties and the right to self determination.\nFrom covid we moved to variants to super variants\nFrom super variants we moved to the climate change agenda whilst attacking oil & gas industries.\nIn-between the modified weather so called climate change agenda we moved to the war against Russia in Ukraine.\nYou will notice it is the same people talking to us during lockdown that have created the the issues that we are facing today.\nThe same people that continually waste money on vanity projects rather than improving our public services locally and nationally.\nThe same people responsible for the soaring Cost of Living & no plan to fix the problem.\nThe same people pushing the Green net zero agenda & massive taxes hikes to pay for it.\nThe same people responsible for insufficient UK power generation to keep the lights and heating on affordably.\nOur bills including petrol and diesel, food and many other basic supplies are all seeing large price increases from the producers which is being passed down to the customers, This is making things very difficult for families up and down this country and it looks likely the economic situation will remain like this for some time, the blame lies squarely on the Boris Johnson Conservative Government and whatever it has morphed into later down the line to escape accountability.\nNow our nation will now face many difficult challenges for years to come, we can overcome them. To succeed,\nWe need to do Brexit properly.\nWe must grow our way out of the crisis, we cannot tax our way out of it.\nThe UK sits on vast energy reserves of coal, oil, natural gas, shale gas and lithium. Currently we are reliant on importing energy when we should be using our own British energy treasure to create wealth and jobs that remain here in the UK, New technologies mean we can extract these commodities safely in a cleaner, cheaper way. Cheap energy is the foundation stone that allows manufacturing to thrive and grow, It is essential for our industry to remain competitive.\nWithout it we are doomed to see more jobs and money go abroad.\nLet’s have £1 trillion plus of proper levelling up by drilling down\nLet’s have a proper immigration policy that works for our country and protects our borders.\nWe see repeated examples of citizens native to other countries who have migrated here legally or illegally celebrating in huge numbers other countries independence day on British streets as if this country is there own… The volume and the rate that this has been happening over the last 10years is cause for immediate concern and shows how little both the labour party and the conservative party have done to curb the ever increasing numbers that have been coming to this country attracted by our generous social welfare system.\nEnough is enough now and we need to get to grips of this situation, Rishi Sunak and his westminster pals are not going to do anything so it’s down to Reform UK\nWe will campaign relentlessly to protect our civil liberties and freedom of speech. We must be able to debate, test and challenge different views, consensus thinking, scientific theories and the establishment approach in a respectful way.\nWE ALL MUST NOW STAND UP for our core democratic values, our civil liberties, our right to free speech, BEFORE IT IS ERODED AWAY.\nWe should celebrate and show our pride in being British: our amazing culture, our unbreakable communities, our incredible heritage.\nWe have lot to be proud of so..\nTogether, WE CAN make Britain Great Again!\nThis website contains my personal opinions & views, not official Reform Party policy.

Becoming a low tax, smartly regulated, high growth economy is the only way to better wages and more tax revenues to invest in better healthcare and other public services.\nStimulus Plan:\n• Free up 6 million people from paying Income Tax by lifting the minimum threshold to £20,000 from £12,571 p.a . This amounts to 1 in 5 taxpayers. Basic Income Tax rate stays at 20%.\n• The less well-off benefit proportionately the most, saving £1,500 p.a. @£20,000 salary, circa £30 per week.\n• Free up 1.2 million SMEs from paying Corporation Tax (over 80% of companies) by lifting the minimum profit threshold to £100,000.\n• Reduce the cost of living by lowering consumer taxes, which will reduce inflation whilst stimulating growth:\n– Scrap VAT on energy bills = save £100 / year per household.\n– Scrap environmental levies = save £160 / year per household.\n– Lower fuel duty by 20p /litre = saves £240 / year per driver.\n– Lower VAT from 20% to 18% = saves £300 / year per household.\n• Funded by cost savings totaling approximately £85 billion:\n– Reduce wasteful Government spending: £5 in £100 = £50 billion per year.\n– Enable over 1 million out of the over 5 million on out of work benefits back into jobs: saves circa £15-20 billion per year. Some 1.5 million more people are on benefits than pre-Covid, so a return just to 2019 levels is eminently realistic.\n– Tax the Renewable Energy industry the full amount of the circa £11 billion in subsidies they currently\nreceive under old contracts; they claim it is cheaper than other energy forms, so they no longer need taxpayer support.\n• Remove vast swathes of unnecessary regulations that hinder growth.\nMedium term tax simplification ambitions as conditions allow:\n• Reduce the main Corporation tax rate from 25% to 20%.\n• Lift threshold for 40% income tax rate to £70,000.\n• Reduce and simplify residential Stamp Duty: 0% below £750k, 2% on £750k–£1.5m, & 4% above, will stimulate economic activity and construction.\n• Abolish the burdensome Apprenticeship Levy, which ironically reduced apprentice numbers.\n• Abolish business rates for small & medium firms, offset with Online Delivery Tax at 3%, which will create a fairer playing field for High Street and physical versus online businesses.\n•Abolish VAT on domestic fuel.\n•Abolish Air Passenger Duty, to help the devastated travel sector\n• Abolish Stamp Duty on share trading, this will help savers and enable the City to compete globally.\n• Abolish Inheritance Tax for all estates under £2m (98% of all estates). 20% tax above £2m — executors can choose to give this to registered charities or HMRC.\n• Abolish the burdensome IR35 rules introduced by the Conservatives in recent years.\n• We aim to reform the over-complicated tax system on savings and pensions, that currently benefits those with the most to save at the expense of those on lower incomes.\n•Abolish business rates for small & medium firms, offset with online Delivery Tax at 3% which will create a fairer playing field for High Street and physical versus online businesses\nReform UK will save £100 billion of taxpayers money to pay for these lower taxes:\n• Scrap the bloated vanity project HS2 saving £100 billion, of which £50 billion would be spent on infrastructure in the North-East and North-West, resulting in a £50 billion net saving.\n• Put the cost of the energy price cap on the UK producers not the taxpayers (as per our Emergency Energy Plan on our website). This should save some £50billion in the first first year, depending on global prices\nThis bold economic vision frees up over 6 million people from paying income tax and frees up over 1.2 million small businesses/self employed from paying corporation tax. We would also remove a raft of stifling taxes and we believe this will generate much faster growth\nThis Government has increased taxes to the highest level in 70 years with more taxes to come. Medium-term growth is expected to be the lowest for 60 years. This means lower wages and less money to invest in health and other public services.\nInflation is at the highest level for over 30 years and productivity is at the lowest for 20 years, with 1 in 8 people of working age on out of work benefits, totaling well over 5 million.\nREORGANISING QUANTITATIVE EASING DEBT\nWe would re-organise the Bank of England internal Quantitative Easing (QE) debt into a 75 year wartime-like Corona Bond, with a fixed notional interest rate of 2%, to be left on the Bank’s computer as internal debt. As this QE debt represents some 35% of the national debt at some £850 billion, this will calm markets by removing the refinance and interest rate risk. It will save some £10-15 billion in nominal annual interest payments used by the Treasury in their forecasts. The Bank must stop its plans for Quantitative Tightening which will increase interest payments completely unnecessarily and worry the markets.\nReform UK is the only party that stands for cutting taxes and simplifying taxes to create higher growth, better wages, and better healthcare.",

We must ensure this continues in the face of ever changing threats, as shown by the war in Ukraine, the energy war and cyber warfare to name but a few. It is vital that our Armed Forces have the people, training and best equipment to achieve this. Reform is needed to ensure more efficient joined up thinking and decision making, especially with regard to procurement of equipment; this is an area where the Ministry of Defence’s track record has sometimes let down Armed Forces personnel.\n.\nVeteran Support\nOur ex servicemen. defended us, risk their lives for us, go to places we would never go to, and do things we would never do. In our name.\nIts our duty to give them a level of care when they have completed their service and to integrate them back into society through retraining and counselling.\nHomeless ex-servicemen littered around Britain’s streets are a failure of our Government and our Military.\nWe need to do far more than what is currently being done. It is currently estimated that around 6000 homeless ex-servicemen are living on the streets of Britain. How can this not be a national disgrace?\nOur armed forces veterans should be our first priority.\nCurrent Government is to policy import refugees from multiple sources and house them at the taxpayers expense.\nApparently we can afford this, and just within this year 40,000 “refugees” are in hotels up and down our country.\nYet we can’t afford to look after 6000 veterans who have struggled after leaving the armed forces.\nBetween May 2020 and Jan 2021 last year NHS Test and Trace (NHST&T) set up with a budget of £22 billion. further allocated £15 billion more: totaling £37 billion over two years that the British taxpayer will have to pick up the tab\n-\nWe could have invested in almost 10 new Aircraft carriers at the cost of £3.8 Billion.\n-\nWe need a full audit as to where that £37 Billion has gone, who received it and what it was for?\n-\nWe also need a full audit into government spending in their war against Russia in Ukraine.\nSTATEMENT ON UK ARMED FORCES OPERATIONAL READINESS AND EQUIPMENT STATE\nMany of you will have seen and been deeply disturbed at comments a senior member of the United States military reportedly made to the Secretary of State for Defence, comments which included an assessment that the British Army is no longer considered a top-level fighting force.\nSadly, this isn’t the first such assessment. Our Army has shrunk to half its Cold War size, while its ability to conduct Land Manoeuvre with fires has shrivelled with no major equipment replacements taking place for two decades.\nPolitical leadership embraced the myth of a peace dividend and looked the other way as an increasingly turbulent world threw military and security challenges at our armed forces, resulting in operational tempo increasing rather than declining.\nThere are several reasons why, despite still having the fourth highest defence expenditure in the world, the British Army may be considered by our closest and most important ally as not fit for purpose.\nGovernments have taken pride in meeting the NATO GDP budget expenditure target on defence of 2%. Those same governments demanded a defence capability not just for territorial defence, but one that is also capable of expeditionary deployment at scale across the globe.\nThe operational complexity, equipment capability and strategic enablers needed to exercise this reach is far beyond that which most NATO members require for their role in the collective defence of NATO territory.\nDefence procurement remains a bureaucratic, over-costly process that is riddled with waste and incompetence. Political and treasury interference combined with an inability to decide on the role of the British Army and the platforms and systems it needs, has meant that the catalogue of expensive capital equipment failures grows longer.\nOver a decade of counter-insurgency operations have skewed the Army’s operational requirements obscuring much of its core purpose to provide a high intensity, warfighting capability at required readiness.\nMore latterly to spare government blushes it has had to turn to providing essential public services during industrial action. Support to Ukraine has hollowed out the force even further with frontline stocks of equipment spares, munitions, already at dangerously low levels, now depleted to the point of exhaustion.\nThe Army are not spoons in a drawer to be pulled out when needed. There is a limit to how often we can rely upon the superb quality of our soldiers to turn to meet each challenge.\nThe danger of escalating state-on-state conflict in Europe demonstrates previous defence strategy has been flawed and how unwise the decision to attempt ‘shop window’ defence and take the Army for granted has been.\nReform UK believes defence should be resourced for the tasks the nation sets it. Capability must be rebuilt and then maintained. Further cuts to the Army should be halted and a rapid equipment capitalisation must take place ensuring that a potential adversary is left in no doubts over the combat power this nation can deliver.\nMr Frederick Chedham\nFrederick Chedham served in the British Army for 25 years, rising to the rank of Colonel, holding command and staff appointments both in the UK and Internationally.",

The last 23 Tory party treasurers have all gone onto the House of Lords. In may well be a coincidence, or it might be related to the fact that you can become the party treasurer if you are kind enough to ‘donate’ £3 million or more to the party.\nIs this really how we want our Government to run in the 21st century?\nShould Knighthoods be used as a gift in exchange for political favours?",

That is not democracy.\nAcross the world Governments intent on dividing their populations. By vaccine status, by colour, by gender. We are being segregated rather than united.\nWe are all equal people. some have had more advantages than others and we need to make sure that we create opportunities for all. But we are equal.\nWe will never all be born equal, but we can make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of the circumstances they are born into. No citizen of the UK should be held back or restricted by accident of birth or personal circumstances.\nEveryone should be free to live their best life, free from judgement and persecution with the same opportunities. We need to provide opportunities to lift the less fortunate not restrict the advantaged.\nTo quote Frank Zappa\n“The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it’s profitable to continue the illusion. At the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain, they will just take down the scenery, they will pull back the curtains, they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater.”\nWith crisis after crises engulfing the UK Gov, the ongoing strike action across many industries by public sector workers it looks like that they are starting to take down some of the scenery.",

This is achievable with reform because many other countries don’t have waiting lists so why should we put up with them?\nWe have been brainwashed that they are the norm; they should not be, and we can achieve zero waiting lists.\nWe must put the patient in charge by having a voucher scheme so they can be seen and treated promptly. Healthcare will always, of course, remain free at the point of delivery.\n• If you cannot be seen by a GP in 3 days, you get a voucher to go private elsewhere.\n• If you cannot be seen by a consultant in 3 weeks, you get a voucher to go private elsewhere.\n• If you cannot have an operation in 9 weeks from Day 1, you get a voucher to go private elsewhere.\nThis should mean zero waiting lists in around 24 months as private capacity increases rapidly.

The agreement commits world leaders to keeping global warming below 2C, seen as the threshold for safety by scientists, and pursuing a tougher target of 1.5C. The carbon emission curbs put forward by countries under Paris are not legally-binding but the framework of the accord, which includes a mechanism for periodically cranking those pledges up, is binding. The agreement also has a long-term goal for net zero emissions which would effectively phase out fossil fuels.\nThe Agreement is a legally binding international treaty. It entered into force on 4 November 2016.\nThe Agreement includes commitments from all countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and calls on countries to strengthen their commitments over time. The Agreement provides a pathway for developed nations to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts while creating a framework for the transparent monitoring and reporting of countries’ climate goals.\nThis sounds like a control and punishment mechanism to me and I believe the United Kingdom must withdraw from this agreement.\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/global-net-zero-commitments/\nLet’s celebrate our success so far, as the UK has led the way by reducing our emissions since 1990 by about 50%. Technology improvements will enable us to reduce emissions further and capture emissions. However, we must be smart about which technologies to use.\nThe Reform UK triple save plan will:\n• save emissions\n• save and create British jobs\n• save households money\nWe must maintain a range of types of energy supply, so we are not overexposed to any one particular supply; prices, technology, and relative performance will vary over time. We will boost the solar and wind renewable sector using a new government-owned Renewable Bank; the panels and turbines must be made here in the UK to save and create British jobs. This will also mean dramatically lower utility costs.\nThe current Government plans will destroy British jobs, sending them overseas especially to China, and lead to huge increases in domestic bills every year to pay to overseas-owned energy firms. This is both unacceptable and unnecessary.\nThis too-speedy a transition to renewable energy has driving the current energy market crisis, and the cost of implementing net zero policies will be far too costly on the poorest in our society\nWhile our Government commits hari kari on the UK economy and creates laws and regulations to tie up business in the name of a so called climate change agenda, China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases with a reliance on coal for energy, The Chinese government has set a 2060 Net Zero emissions target…\nC40 CITIES – https://c40summit.org/\nWith Government forcing companies how to adhere to the net zero agenda or be punished, it is now the C40 groups turn to control the public in the area’s they live.\nIn my opinion, this is just another mechanism of control for the people to do as we say. or you will be punished using the lockdown laws currently in place from the so called pandemic.\nThe Race to Zero is a global campaign to rally leadership and support from businesses, cities, regions, and investors for a healthy, resilient, zero carbon recovery that prevents future threats, creates decent jobs, and unlocks inclusive, sustainable growth.\nfrom the website:-\n“Ours is a vision of climate action that is rooted in equity, because we know that climate, social and economic justice can only be achieved together”\nIt looks like 2023 in going to be a year of massive change in this country towards the climate agenda and the green new deal – We will just have to wait and see how things play out.\nThe leadership standards guide below.\n55 Councils & Towns across the England, 7 more in Scotland & NI have signed up to this C40 agenda that includes 15 minute cities, those involved have agreed to the below and more –\n-\nPublicly endorse the following Principles:\n-\nWe recognise the global climate emergency.\n-\nWe are committed to keeping global heating below the 1.5°Celsius goal of the Paris Agreement.\n-\nWe are committed to putting inclusive climate action at the center of all urban decision-making, to create thriving and equitable communities for everyone.\n-\nWe invite our partners – political leaders, CEOs, trade unions, investors, and civil society – to join us in recognising the global climate emergency and help us deliver on science-based action to overcome it.\n-",

They have signed treaties that syphon of the responsibilities of duly elected leaders putting it in the hands of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrat committee groups all the while a merry-go-round of preselected leaders are pushing us towards the Net Zero/Green New Deal agenda.\nThis is becoming more apparent by the day that it is not in the UK’s national interests and needs to be stopped & public consultation should take place on these issues via a referendum.\nthe UK Government has in the last 3years has;\nFailed to protect free speech\nFailed to protect our heritage\nFailed to protect our education\nFailed to protect family life\nFailed to protect our culture\nFailed to protect the environment\nFailed to protect jobs\nFailed on their COVID19 strategies\nFailed to protect the vulnerable\nWestminster Politics in its current format is corrupt & stagnant and it clearly needs to be REFORMED.\nGreat Britain trading as an independent nation on a fair and equal basis with Europe and being able to do so freely without restrictions, with the rest of the world is probably one of the main reasons 17,410,742 people voted to leave the EU. it was certainly one of mine.\nSince the referendum on Thursday 23rd June 2016 and voting to leave an undemocratic EU, I, like many others felt this was just the beginning and that the People’s eyes have now been opened to the benefits of being an independent sovereign nation.\nI am proud to be British, but we must get our focus back. We must take back control from the corrupt in the corridors of powers and begin rebuilding our country into one that work for us all… One that we can be proud of, one we can be proud to pass down to future generations.\nReform is now possible and essential in these key areas:\nOur Economy\nOur Public Sector\nOur Energy Strategy\nOur Institutions\nThis current unipolar establishment are so out of touch with the people they are supposed to serve and will all need replacing at the next GE. For these reasons I am proud to join Reform UK who are standing candidates in every seat across the UK at the next General Election to offer a genuine alternative at the ballot box.\nThe people know it’s time for real change, the people know it’s time for Reform UK\nReform Party spokespeople can only present our policies nationally and locally making sure that everyone knows all about us. From that point on it, the electorate will ultimately decide if they want us to form a Government & reform the many failing institutions in the UK which clearly badly need it.",

  "https_www_james-fletcher_co_uk_/https_www_james-fletcher_co_uk_reforms-plan-for-the-energy-price-crisis/content_13.html": "The UK is in the early stages of a Global Energy War, which could last for a long time. We need to prepare for the next 5 years.\nTHE PRICE CRISIS:\nWe had a major problem even before the Ukraine war. The growth in heavily subsidised renewable energy has led to over £10 billion of inflation-linked subsidies every year with an extra £5 billion of annual related network operating and balancing costs. This totals £15 billion every year, approximately £500 per household directly or indirectly.\nMuch of the renewable industry is overseas owned, meaning they are making vast profits at British consumers’ expense. Renewables are unreliable when the wind does not blow, so they need the insurance backup of gas generating capacity, which adds significantly to costs due to duplication. In wartime situations the Government must control the price of critical production like energy. This happened in WW2.\nThe Reform UK plan works as follows:\n• Require all UK energy producers to sell to UK suppliers only at the average 2021 price.\n• Domestic cap set to average £2,000 per year.\n• Business cap set at maximum 35 pence per kwh.\n• Extra help still needed for the most vulnerable .\n• The above will exist until normal conditions return and the supply crisis is fixed.\n• This transforms the Government finances as it puts the cost on the producer not the taxpayer\nThe windfall tax would be scrapped as the producers are no longer making windfall profits under this plan. Westminster’s Net Zero plans to send our jobs and money overseas is making us Net Poorer.\nTHE SUPPLY CRISIS: MORE SUPPLY = LOWER PRICES\nEnergy security is of strategic national importance and we must be self reliant. We are blessed with vast different energy resources under our feet that can look after us for at least 50 years or more.\nWe need a National Planning with Local Compensation scheme to accelerate new energy sources:\n• Accelerate gas and oil exploration in the North Sea.\n• Build High Efficiency Combined Cycle gas turbines.\n• Accelerate the commission of the latest nuclear reactors including small modular ones.\n• Unlock the vast reserves of shale gas using the latest safest techniques.\n• Restart opencast coal mines using the latest cleanest techniques.\n• Accelerate Lithium mining in UK to help with electric battery production, instead of relying on less environmentally sound mines overseas.\n• No more expensive subsidies for renewables — they must stand on their own merit.\nOur Solutions to the Energy Crisis\nTHE REFORM UK PLAN WILL:\n• Save huge amounts of emissions by using our own energy treasure compared with the extra CO2 created when importing energy from overseas.\n• Save and create many thousands of British jobs in the regions.\n• Save households and businesses money.\nThis is the best and easiest way to unlock vast wealth in the ground for the benefit of us all. We should establish a Sovereign Wealth fund from this, as Norway did so successfully. Reform UK will create a new win-win model of UK ownership of critical national infrastructure.\nCertain key utilities including parts of the energy market should be 50% in public ownership to reduce consumer costs and stop overseas ownership of our critical national infrastructure.\nThe other 50% would be owned by UK pension funds. This will enable a win-win situation, with consumers benefiting from lower prices, the taxpayer benefitting during good years and all benefiting from better management of private sector expertise brought in by the pension funds.\nThe Government’s current Net Zero plans are destroying British jobs , sending them overseas, especially to China and are leading to huge increases in domestic bills every year to pay to overseas-owned energy firms. This is both unacceptable and unnecessary.\nBe under no doubt, Westminster’s Net Zero makes us Net Poorer."
