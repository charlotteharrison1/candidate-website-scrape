It’s only a few years ago that Glossopdale School was found to be ‘Inadequate’ by Ofsted.\nRobert Largan MP, Councillor Jean Wharmby and Councillor Alex Dale visited the Hadfield based school recently in order to see the newly completed extension and to congratulate them on their successful Ofsted inspection.\nThe school was expanded, following a campaign by Councillor Wharmby, Robert Largan MP and local parents, which has created an extra 240 places for the area.\nGlossopdale is one of many High Peak schools to have seen a significant improvement in standards, following the reforms introduced by the Conservative Government. Under the last Labour Government in 2010, only 56 per cent of High Peak schools were rated ‘Good’ or ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted. This has now increased to 89 per cent.\nCommenting, Robert Largan, MP for High Peak, said:\nI want to congratulate Glossopdale School for their impressive achievements, improving the school. Headteacher Mrs Debbie McGloin, the teaching staff, governors parents and pupils all deserve huge credit for this great result.\nIt was good to see the completed school expansion, which has created an extra 240 local school places.

Since 2013, 2 million more disabled people have entered work, including 1.6 million since 2017 – overdelivering on the Government’s commitment to get one million more disabled people into work by 2027, five years ahead of target.\nThe Government is also continuing to expand employment support for people with disabilities through programmes including the £2.5 billion Back to Work Plan which includes reforms to help those with disabilities and health conditions, and changing the Work Capability Assessment to reflect the modern world of work and the opportunities available to disabled people. These measures will help to remove barriers facing disabled people.\nCommenting, Robert Largan, MP for High Peak, said:\nI am pleased that the Government is building on its strong track record of supporting disabled people by introducing the new Disability Action Plan, setting out 32 practical steps.\nThe Government is making the right long-term decision by continuing to help give opportunities for disabled people to get into work.\nCommenting, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work, Mims Davies MP, said:\nWe are building on this government’s really strong track record of supporting and delivering for disabled people by using their key feedback to deliver vital, everyday changes to their lives and we have listened to their asks and are truly determined to deliver on them.\nThis new wide ranging plan means disabled children can rightly enjoy the fun of the playground, disabled customers can use the services they’re entitled to and businesses who break laws around assistance dogs will be firmly held to account amongst other impactful changes.\nI look forward to seeing the immediate impact of the Disability Action Plan while we deliver on long-term reforms to make this country the most accessible and importantly equal place to live in the world – so everyone can live their lives to the full and thrive.",

That’s why improving local access to healthcare is a top priority of mine. I have long campaigned for a major new healthcare centre in the High Peak. I am working closely with Derbyshire Community Healthcare Services NHS Foundation on a bid for a new major healthcare centre in Buxton on the old water bottling site near the railway station.\nI am also backing plans to build new urgent care centres at Stepping Hill Hospital and Tameside Hospital, as well as campaigning for a new maternity unit at Tameside Hospital. Improving maternity services is an issue close to my heart.\nI helped deliver a new specialist men’s mental health unit at Tameside Hospital and I’m working with the local NHS to deliver an additional women’s mental health at Stepping Hill Hospital.\nFinally, I led the successful campaign to get the local mobile breast cancer screening unit reinstated to the High Peak. This unit is now back up and running, operated at 160% capacity of pre-Covid levels.",

That’s why I’m campaigning for improvements, particularly to train services.\nI have successfully campaigned to reinstate the full pre-Covid timetable to local rail services but Dove Holes is still left with an inadequate service.\nMany local people have also raised concerns about the facilities at Doves Holes railway station. In particular the ticket machine being located on the wrong platform and the lack of lights. This means that the station is plunged into darkness at night, leaving many feeling unsafe on their walk home.\nDove Holes has been left in the dark for too long. As such, I am campaigning to get lights installed at the station and invest in facilities at Dove Holes.\nIf we want Northern and Network Rail to listen to us, we need to demonstrate that there is strong demand for this locally. That’s why I have started a local petition, to show the strength of feeling in Dove Holes.\nPlease sign my petition below. Together, we can make Dove Holes a safer place to live.",
  "https_www_robertlargan_co_uk_/https_www_robertlargan_co_uk_news_new-independent-football-regulator-introduced-government/content_36.html": "The Government has introduced historic legislation to create a new Independent Football Regulator. This comes as part of the promise to put fans back at the heart of football, and protect our national game for generations to come.\nThis comes at a critical juncture for English football, following the attempted breakaway European Super League, and a series of high profile cases of clubs being financially mismanaged or collapsing entirely.\nThe legislation being introduced goes further than the Government’s manifesto commitment, establishing the new ‘Independent Football Regulator’ (IFR) as a standalone body - independent of both Government and the football authorities.\nThe body will be equipped with robust powers revolving around three core objectives: to improve financial sustainability of clubs, ensure financial resilience across the leagues, and to safeguard the heritage of English football.\nUnder the Football Governance Bill, new owners and directors will face stronger tests to stop clubs falling into the wrong hands, and face the possibility of being removed and struck off from owning football clubs if they are found to be unsuitable.\nThe Bill also includes new backstop powers around financial distributions between the Premier League, the English Football League (EFL) and National League. These powers mean that if the leagues fail to agree on a new deal on financial distributions, then the backstop can be triggered to ensure a settlement is reached.\nThis follows a number of issues in recent years including financial mismanagement, breakaway plans for the European Super League, and changes to club names, badges and colours against the wishes of fans.\nThat is why the Government are enshrining an ‘Independent Football Regulator’ in law, giving fans a voice in how their clubs are run and ensuring teams across the leagues are financially sustainable.\nCommenting, Robert Largan, MP for High Peak, said:\nThis is about protecting club heritage, which has a reach well beyond the football pitch. Football clubs are intrinsic to the history and fabric of so many towns and communities. For many, it’s a core part of the identity of their local area.\nAs the former Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Safe Standing in Football, this is something I really care about.\nI’m very pleased that the Government are pushing ahead with these new laws.",

This will provide specialist support for children with autism, learning difficulties, mobility difficulties, and more.\nSince coming into office, this Conservative Government has opened 108 new special schools, with a further 92 on the way, so that every child can access the right support at the right time and benefit from a world-class education.\nThis marks a tripling in previous levels of investment with a £2.6 billion package from 2022 to 2025. The Government is delivering 60,000 more special needs places since 2010 to ensure no parent has to fight for the right support for their children.\nThe Conservative Government is sticking to the plan to ensure all children, including those with SEND and AP, receive the best possible education.\nCommenting, Robert Largan, MP for High Peak, said:\nI have spoken with and taken up cases from a lot of parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities, and know just how important it is for them to get the right support.\nI am pleased to see that the Conservative Government is investing £14.5 million in Derbyshire, which will help deliver education that meets the needs of children with SEND.\nCommenting, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said:\nToday we are taking another step to ensure our education system provides all children with the very best start in life.\nWe are making sure no parent has to battle to get the right type of school to meet their needs, and improving the school estate so all children are taught in the best classrooms for generations to come.",

This means too many people are not getting the service they are paying for. I have raised this issue in Parliament many times, urging Ministers to speed up the rollout of gigabit-capable broadband, and boost mobile coverage to the hardest-to-reach places.\nProgress is being made. I have been out on-site with Openreach engineers to learn more about their local broadband network (which is used by providers like BT, Sky, Plusnet, and TalkTalk), and the challenges faced in rolling out full-fibre to the hardest to reach homes. I am pleased to report that Openreach has now included the High Peak in their plans to extend full-fibre. They have also announced the creation of 15 new locally based engineering jobs to help speed up the local rollout.\nThe Chancellor has also made a £5billion commitment to support the roll-out of gigabit-capable broadband to the hardest to reach areas of the UK.\nHowever, more can be done so that everyone in the High Peak can enjoy the best possible digital connections. I carried out a special survey of residents across the High Peak to identify the worst areas of broadband and mobile phone coverage. I am presenting the results of this comprehensive survey to both the Government and providers to help strengthen the case for investment in High Peak.",

It’s one of the key cornerstones of ‘Network North’ to improve journeys for all.\nOver the last 4 years, Robert has taken up 60,000 individual cases on behalf of local people. He has replied to 112,850 emails, as well as countless letters, phone calls, surgery appointments and doorstep conversations.\nIt is believed that this is the highest number of cases of any MP elected in 2019.\nRobert met with Dave Williamson to inspect the road junction after work was completed.\nLocal resident Dave Williamson said:\nI have been a resident in Hadfield for 10 years and Glossop for 47 years and am proud of our local area.\nI’ve raised a number of complaints about the state of the roads with Robert Largan MP. Robert has taken up all these issues and the kerbs on Norfolk Street and roads such as Ellison Street, High Street West, Station Road and Shaw Lane have all had repairs completed.\nRobert is a person who gets the job done and I am very grateful to him for his support!\nCommenting, Robert Largan, MP for High Peak, said:\nI am really proud to go the extra mile to help local people. Over the last 4 years, my office and I have been working hard and I’m proud to hit this 60,000 case milestone.\nI’m grateful to Dave for raising these potholes with me and I’m really glad that Derbyshire County Council have carried out the repair work.

Their daily activities include operational monitoring, and sampling tasks to assess water quality and identify opportunities for improvement.\nThe event will take place from 10am to 2pm outside the café in Pavilion Gardens in Buxton.\nThe event will offer the public a chance to learn more about the crucial work the River Rangers are doing to safeguard local rivers and enhance biodiversity. The team will also provide valuable information on how residents can contribute to river conservation efforts, such as avoiding the flushing of wipes or sanitary products that can harm river ecosystems.\nThis event is open to all members of the community.\nRobert Largan MP previously successfully campaigned to change the law to put a public duty on water companies to end sewage overflows being put into rivers and waterways.\nHe has previously volunteered with the River Rangers and has successfully campaigned for United Utilities to invest £12million into their sewage treatment works near Chapel-en-le-Frith to stop sewage ending up in rivers.\nCommenting, Robert Largan MP said:\nI am passionate about protecting our rivers and conserving our beautiful environment. I hope lots of local residents will join the River Rangers on Friday to learn more about how we can all do more to protect our rivers from pollution.",

She later worked in the Department of Social Security.\nRobert studied economics and politics at the University of Manchester, working behind the fish counter at Asda to help pay for his tuition. He then studied at night school while working full time, training to become a Chartered Accountant. He went on to have a successful career in finance, working as an Equity Capital Markets Manager at Deloitte.\nRobert describes himself as an “independent minded moderate” and is a member of the One Nation Caucus of Conservative MPs. When asked in an interview why he was a Conservative, he responded that they were the “least worst option.”\nRobert was elected the Conservative Member of Parliament for High Peak in 2019 and served until 2024.\nHe previously served as a member of the Transport Select Committee, having contributed to inquiries into various issues, including the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the aviation sector and the rollout and safety of smart motorways.\nRobert has also been a member of the Conservative Environmental Network and is a keen advocate for environmental and conservation causes. He also founded the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Peak District and was elected chair, with a focus on bringing green jobs to the region.\nOn 25 October 2022, Robert was appointed Assistant Government Whip assisting the Northern Ireland Office ministerial team and was later shuffled into the Treasury ministerial team.\nIn his spare time, Robert is a keen fell walker and can often be found in one of High Peak’s brilliant pubs watching football.",

The Peak District is a special place and we must conserve it for future generations.\nIn my very first question in Parliament after being elected, I called for the Government to strengthen our environmental protections. I have actively campaigned for the restoration of our local peat moors and I’m proud to have secured a significant increase in funding for this.\nIn addition, I established and chaired the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Peak District, bringing together MPs and conservationists. I was also a proud member of the Conservative Environmental Network, helping to develop policy to tackle climate change.\nThe reckless use of disposable barbecues is also a major concern for my constituents in the High Peak. It is wrong for visitors to the Peak District to use BBQs and leave their litter behind. Disposable BBQs have been an especially serious fire hazard in light of the recent dry and warm weather. Moorland is particularly susceptible to wildfires, given its dense undergrowth. Warm, dry weather exacerbates this tendency.\nThat’s why I introduced a Ten Minute Rule Bill titled ‘The Disposable Barbecues Bill’, which received its first reading on Wednesday 17 November. This Bill would prohibit the use of disposable barbecues on open moorland and give local authorities the power to regulate and potentially ban their sale.\nFollowing this, the Government announced that it would commission research to examine the role that barbecues, specifically disposable barbecues, play in wildfire incidents. This research will also be used to examine other flammable items, such as sky lanterns and portable stoves, that also have the potential to cause significant damage.\nI am also a strong advocate of protections for protecting greenfield sites. We need to build more homes but they must be built in the appropriate places and with the support of local people, not imposed by Whitehall.\nI am glad that reforms are being brought in to simplify our planning system and cut arbitrary red tape, while maintaining standards and protecting our greenfield sites. I am confident that greenfield sites will continue to have robust protections for years to come.\nUnder High Peak Borough Council’s Accelerated Housing Development Plan many sites across the borough including Gamesley Field, Roughfields and Hogshaw are currently under construction and planning permission has already been granted for even more houses to be built.\nI am very concerned about the scale of this development and the pressure this is putting on our infrastructure and public services. I sincerely hope the council listens to local people and rethink their ‘accelerated’ plans.",
  "https_www_robertlargan_co_uk_/https_www_robertlargan_co_uk_news_funding-secured-step-free-access-chinley-station/content_15.html": "Local residents are celebrating after Robert Largan successfully secured funding for step-free access at Chinley station.\nThe station, which currently lacks step-free access for both Manchester and Sheffield bound trains, will soon become accessible to all passengers, including those with disabilities or mobility issues.\nFor over 5 years, Robert Largan has been working with local residents and the Chinley & Buxworth Transport Group to campaign for step-free access at Chinley.\nMr Largan previously presented a petition in the House of Commons, held a series of meetings with the Rail Minister and brought the Levelling Up Minister to Chinley to make the case for funding.\nFollowing a comprehensive feasibility study by Network Rail, funded by S106 contributions from the Forge Manor development, the most viable option for providing step-free access was identified. The project will require a minimum of £3.2 million in capital funding.\nThis achievement is part of a broader improvement strategy for the local railway network, which recently saw a £145 million upgrade aimed at increasing capacity, improving reliability, and enabling a more frequent service. The upgrade will help reduce road congestion by decreasing the number of cars and HGVs. Additionally, the old Pacer trains have been replaced with longer, modern trains, and there are plans to electrify the line to reduce journey times by 20%.\nThe funding comes through the successful bid to the Government’s 'Access for All' fund.\nCommenting, Robert Largan said:\nI am thrilled that Chinley station’s bid has been successful. Thank you to the huge numbers of local people who signed my petition and well done to the amazing Chinley & Buxworth Transport Group who were instrumental in making this happen. This shows what we can achieve when we work together!",

The £4million expansion provides an extra 240 places on the site at Newshaw Lane in Hadfield.\nThe expansion is needed because the new school was built too small as the previous Council failed to factor in the increased demand and the new homes that were being built in the area. This has resulted in some local children being forced to go to school outside the area.\nI am really pleased that the Council has now listened to local parents and is going ahead with expansion. This is the result of a huge amount of hard work from a wide range of local people and I am proud to have helped play a small part in this victory for children and parents. I want to publicly thank all those who have worked to deliver this.\nOn policing, I welcome the announcement that Derbyshire Police has been bolstered by an additional 211 officers since the Government launched its major police recruitment drive. The addition of these new officers brings the total number of police across Derbyshire Constabulary up to 1,971.\nRecruitment is continuing and I am working to ensure that High Peak gets its fair share of the additional officers being recruited. For too long, Derbyshire Constabulary has overly focused on Derby and the south of the county, rather than areas like the High Peak and this imbalance needs correcting.\nI am also keen to increase engagement between the Police and local people. That’s why I have organised a series of Community Policing Forums, giving residents the chance to question local police officers and share their views on what policing priorities should be in their neighbourhood.",

I support reducing business rates for small business as well as preserving the unique character of our town centres.\nI am delighted that the Government have awarded £6.6 million to regenerate Buxton town centre as part of the Future High Streets Fund. I have enclosed a letter from the Minister for Regional Growth, detailing the investment that Buxton will receive.\nHigh Peak Borough Council have also signalled their intention to commit a further £4.2 million to the scheme, bringing the total funding for regeneration to over £10 million.\nThe regeneration scheme needs to offer more to attract families to visit the town centre. I also firmly believe that Buxton needs better public toilet facilities. Along with parliamentary colleagues, I successfully campaigned to change the law to make it cheaper to provide public toilets, by making toilets exempt from paying business rates.\nI also helped secure £7million to restore Glossop Town Hall and Glossop Market Hall, which will be vital in boosting Glossop high street too.\nI am also currently in dialogue with Councils, community organisations and retailers, to secure a future for struggling businesses throughout High Peak.",
  "https_www_robertlargan_co_uk_/https_www_robertlargan_co_uk_tintwistletoo/content_23.html": "I am very aware that the approved route of the A57 bypass only covers the first phase of the bypass around Mottram, and the Glossop Spur Road. So I am fighting for the key second phase of the bypass around Tintwistle and have repeatedly raised this with the Roads Minister.\nI am also working with local residents on proposal for a “Village Gateway” traffic calming scheme for Tintwistle. At my request, Highways England have already carried out a study which concluded that such measures are needed locally.\nBut I need your help. If we’re going to secure the extra funding needed to deliver the Village Gateway scheme and phase two of the bypass around Tintwistle, we need to demonstrate the strength of local support for the projects.\nSo I'm asking for you to show your support for the projects and sign my petition below, which I will be presenting to Parliament."
