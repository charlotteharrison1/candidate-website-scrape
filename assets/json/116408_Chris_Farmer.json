Reform UK will legislate to ban all ULEZs and ultra-low traffic zones. These amount to a tax on travel, especially for low-income drivers who drive older cars.\nStop the Ban on petrol and diesel vehicles. Reform will stop the insane ban on the production of petrol and diesel cars which is due to come into effect in 2030.\nWe will also stop the equally stupid legal requirement to manufacture and sell electric vehicles. (EVs) The Dangerously incompetent Welsh government is equipping its ambulance fleet with electric ambulances whose range will be minimal, and will not be able to operate effectively in exposed regions of the Welsh Hills and mountains. This insanity must stop! Reform UK will stop it.\nImprove Road Networks especially in the north. The north of England is the home of the industrial revolution which changed the world for Good. Reform will energise the north by improving the road networks which link the major northern cities. This will improve the efficiency of industry and facilitate the creation of wealth.\nHome Rule for critical national infrastructure and energy. Reform will launch a new model that brings half of each utility industry into public ownership. The other half will be owned by UK pension funds.\nIntegrated Transport Database. Often we see local roads dug up by the gas board for weeks on end, resurfaced, and then - two weeks later- they are dug up again by the water board! This is a sign of a fragmented system. so.... Reform will initiate an integrated transport database for councils, contractors, and utilities, which will ensure coordination of roadworks. This means fewer roadworks, less congestion, and more efficient travel.\nIntegrated Water Strategy. The UK is at risk of drinking water shortages. So Reform will initiate a program of building new reservoirs so that water can be stored and transferred to where it is needed when required.\nWe will also reduce the release of sewage into seas.\nSingle Infrastructure Funding Stream. Reform will merge the National Infrastructure Commission and the Infrastructure Bank to simplify the management of our systems.\nScrap Net Zero! We will immediately scrap all Net Zero-related objectives, which are completely unnecessary and are driven by ideology, not science!\nThis will release billions of pounds which can be spent more wisely.\nThese are Reform UK's infrastructure policies.\nPlease leave a comment Please share this information\nThank you.

And Faith and Reason are opposite modes of thought.\nFAITH is belief even in the absence of logical proof. REASON is belief Only in the presence of logical proof.\nAll religions rely on faith. Every religion in the world is based upon faith; But faith is not science. Faith is not reason. Faith is not logic. Faith is belief in the word of God, or in the truth of a sacred text, or in the truth of a religious leader, either living or dead. Faith cannot be proved in the same way that the laws of gravity can be proved.\nWhen two groups of people have opposing religious beliefs, there is no way of rationally resolving the problem. And no real negotiation is possible.\nThere are really only two ways to resolve conflicts between religious groups: segregation and violent conflict.\nSegregation Segregation means that the two religious groups live in separate areas which are separated by either a physical barrier or a non-physical boundary. We see these segregated populations all over the world, including within the UK. The Protestants and Catholics have been at war with each other for centuries, and they live in an unstable state with tensions always just under the surface. Because these differences are religious and based upon faith, there is no objective, rational, logical solution to the dispute.\nViolent conflict. Because there is no objective way of resolving a religious dispute, violent conflict is the means of last resort. Violence is the most primitive and fundamental form of resolving disputes. Kill Your Enemy is one way to solve your problems.\nSo religious wars are -by the very nature - intractable and not amenable to reason. There are many instances throughout history.\nChristians versus Muslims. There are centuries of hostilities between Christians and Muslims going all the way back to the crusades of 1053. The tensions are still there under the surface for many Christians and Muslims.\nShia Muslims versus Sunni. Within religions, different factions have fought each other for centuries.\nJews versus Muslims. The Palestinian-Israeli crisis has its roots in religion. Both claim that God is on their side and that the land they are fighting over has been promised to them by their respective gods. They believe they have a divine right to the land they are fighting over, and since neither can prove their case logically or rationally, then the dispute is intractable.\nDeep trouble, We have fallen into the horror of violent religious conflict. And religious wars are always the most barbaric because they they are fuelled by irrational fervour and a sense of religious righteousness.\nWhat is the solution? Although many people in the world have religious beliefs, deeply held and culturally embedded , everybody has also been endowed (by God?) with a rational faculty.\nEveryone is capable of reasoning. It doesn’t mean they do reason very well. Most people do not know the laws of logic, but we do have “common sense” logic. Aristotle defined humans as “the rational animal”, and the Arabs have a great respect for Aristotle.\nRational conflict management So our only hope is to appeal to the rational element of each individual mind and to the rational element of each individual group to see if we can find a rational, negotiated, logical solution to these problems, which are grounded in religious faith.\nForce must finish Sooner or later military force must give way to rational negotiation And the sooner we bring reason to bear, the sooner the killing stops.\nBut I fear that now reason has taken the backseat and force has come to the fore. Who knows what the next few months will bring in the hell that is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\nThe age of reason. We must return to the age of reason and use our rational minds, secular knowledge, and common sense logic to solve our problems.\nWe must “run on reason” and manage our violent emotions.

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_how-to-fix-the-cost-of-living-crisis/content_65.html": "How to Fix the Cost of Living Crisis\nSunday, 01 October 2023\nHow to Fix the Cost of Living Crisis The cost of living crisis, like every problem, has definite causes. If we identify the causes and remove them, then the problem disappears. The two causes of the cost of living crisis are both government policies: Quantitative easing, and Net Zero\nQuantitative Easing (Printing Money)\nQuantitative easing is when the government prints more money. Governments love to do this because it allows them to spend money that they don’t have. Governments have three ways to raise funds: tax, - borrowing, - and printing money. Taxes are visible and unpopular, - borrowing is expensive and unpopular, - quantitative easing is invisible to most people.\nQuantitative easing means that the government prints money and adds it to the existing supply, watering down the value of every pound. This decreases the purchasing power of every pound in your pocket so that £100 now does not buy as much as £100 used to buy in the past. We experience this as price increases. It’s not that the price is going up, but the value of your money is going down. So people blame the shops rather than the government which is causing it.\nQuantitative easing is a stealth tax on the value of your money, and it's harmful because it drives inflation. And inflation is a part of the cost of living crisis.\nSo, we would stop quantitative easing and replace it with proper fiscal disciplines.\nHigh Energy Costs We need energy for everything. Every product and every service has to be made and moved before it can be used. And energy costs money. The more energy costs, the more expensive everything becomes. The cost of energy is sky-high right now for two reasons: not enough supply -and net zero policy.\nNot Enough Energy Supply For decades, the British government has failed us in relation to energy supply. We have insufficient nuclear power stations. The most recent one that became operational was Sizewell B in Suffolk, which began generating electricity in 1995.\nConsequently, we have not kept up supply with demand. When demand outstrips supply prices rise, which is inflation ￼\nNet Zero Catastrophe A headlong rush to a net zero policy has meant the government is cutting back on tried and trusted, reliable, clean hydrocarbon energy sources in favour of economically unsustainable “sustainable” energy sources, such as wind turbines, heat pumps, solar panels, and batteries.\nIt is impossible to power a modern 21st-century economy with these so-called “green, sustainable energy sources.”\nThey’re not green. They’re not sustainable.\nThey only exist because of the subsidies given to them from the hydrocarbon energy industry. Without subsidies, the wind turbines wouldn’t exist.\nIt’s interesting to note that the government's recent offer of franchises to the energy-producing industry were not taken up because the industry itself knows that the economics do not support “sustainable energy” without massive funding from government.\nGovernment Funding Means Taxpayer Funding Whenever the government says it’s going to fund certain projects, it means that you are going to fund the government's projects.\nSo when the government takes money from you and gives it to the green energy lobby, you become poorer.\nYou become poor because taxes have gone up to a 70-year high, and you become poorer because the cost of energy has gone up to a all time high.\nAll of this combines to make you poorer because energy is at the root of all things.\nTo Sum Up We will fix the cost of living crisis by:\nStopping quantitative easing and replacing it with proper fiscal disciplines.\nCreating mass quantities of cheap energy using tried and trusted technologies (hydrocarbons plus nuclear, assisted with a small amount of “sustainables”).\n3, Abandoning net zero; it is an economic disaster with no benefit to anyone since the British contribution to CO2 levels is 1% or less of the whole\nThank you\nIf you like this, please share with your friends.

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_how-to-save-uk-economy/content_105.html": "How to Save UK Economy\nWednesday, 03 April 2024\nHow to Save UK Economy\nConservatives have trashed the economy; we are in a recession, public services and many councils are going bankrupt.\nConservative Government Has Failed Its own policies have caused the conditions for economic failure:\nOverspending All politicians like to spend other people's money because they have their own agenda and they like to “buy votes“ from sections of the population by throwing money at them.\nOverspending causes economic failure. Because politicians like to overspend, they commit the following policy errors:\nHigh Taxation We are suffering the highest taxation levels in a generation. High taxation takes money out of your pockets and puts it into the government's. That means you have less money to spend on you and your family; businesses have less money to invest in growth, and we lose our economic freedom as politicians decide how they will spend our money.\nPrinting Money Printing money (quantitative easing). In order to fund the excess spending, governments print money. The excess money reduces the value of every pound in the economy so its purchasing power is reduced. When your purchasing power is reduced, we perceive that as inflation. Politicians create inflation by quantitative easing (printing money).\nNet Zero Net zero is the single, biggest, idiotic, economic policy ever invented by mankind. It is an ideology, not a science. it is a tax on energy. And since every economy is powered by energy; when energy is expensive, everything is expensive.\nExpensive energy increases the cost of production, makes businesses inefficient, and increases inflation. So net zero is a terrific way to destroy an economy.\nFinancial Mismanagement Politicians waste money because they can! So, politicians send billions of pounds to Ukraine, they waste millions of pounds trying to send illegal refugees to Rwanda they give millions of pounds to France to stop the boats which are never stopped.\nThey waste billions on so-called “sustainable energy” which is completely unsustainable without massive, crippling costs imposed on the British public.\nThis is why our economy is in a mess.\nHow to Reform the UK Economy In order to kickstart the economy and put it back into Growth Mode we need to reverse the above policies.\n- Stop wasting money by sending billions of Tax Payer Pounds to foreign countries\n- Stop sending our money abroad to Ukraine and other places.\n- Create cheap, abundant energy by using hydrocarbons and nuclear.\n- Stop quantitative easing. Governments cannot print their way out of trouble\n- .Lower taxes. Let people and businesses keep their money to invest in economic growth and employment.\nReform UK We believe in the creative power of the British people. We do not believe that politicians should attempt to run everything and micromanage people's lives.\nWe believe in freedom. That’s economic freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of information, freedom to choose.\nThe economy will thrive only within the context of a free-market enterprise economy. Low taxes, low regulation, less government interference means more growth and employment.\nWe need Reform We must get the Conservatives and labour out of Westminster and we replaced them with politicians who Believe in British Economic growth\nPlease leave a comment Please share this post\nThank you Chris Farmer #ReformUK #gloucester",

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_net-zero-and-mass-immigration-are-killing-the-economy/content_8.html": "Net Zero and Mass Immigration are Killing the Economy\nMonday, 10 June 2024\nThe combined effects of net zero and mass immigration are destroying the country. Here’s how:\nMass Immigration\nLike all countries, we have only limited resources:\n- A limited number of houses\n- A limited number of schools\n- A limited number of doctors and nurses\n- A limited number of social services\n- Everything is limited\nWhen we have limited resources, it is necessary to limit the demand on those resources. Mass immigration imposes an unlimited demand on a set of limited resources. If we impose an unlimited demand on a set of limited resources, then those resources will be crushed under the weight of excessive demand.\nWhen the government opens its doors to everyone who is in need on planet Earth and offers an open invitation to people from all nations to come to Britain, where they will receive:\n- A house\n- Medical care\n- Dental care\n- Money\n- Social care\n- Education\nall at public expense, then every public resource, every public service will be crushed under the weight of demand.\nMass immigration has led to us importing over 2 million people in two years. The result of this is that all of our public services and all of our utilities are under massive strain and close to breaking point. Who pays the price? We do, the British people.\nIf You’re in a Hole, Stop Digging We have dug ourselves into a hole with mass immigration, and the first thing we must do is stop digging! We must severely limit the number of people entering the country so that we do not break every service we have.\nDavid Cameron's 10,000 Target When David Cameron was Prime Minister, he set the target limit of immigration at 10,000. Last year, we had over 1.2 million. We need to get back to 10,000.\nNet Zero is Destroying Britain Net zero is the second policy which is destroying Britain.\nThere is no mandate for net zero. The Conservative government gained its 80-seat majority on the promise of “Brexit.” The Conservative Party never mentioned net zero at all during the last election.\nHowever, when they got in, they failed to deliver Brexit properly and they implemented net zero with no mandate\nNobody asked for it. Nobody voted for it. And yet net zero is being imposed without mercy.\nNet Zero's Impact Net zero is a justification for an attack on the motorcar. They want us out of our cars and onto bicycles or electric vehicles. In 2030, the Labour government will outlaw the production of diesel and petrol motorcars. Can you imagine this country without diesel generators?\nWe will be back in the pre-industrial age.\nNet zero is an attack on agriculture. Net zero is being used to justify an attack on farming. They want to take 20% of arable land out of food production. The result of that will be higher food prices.\nNet zero is justification for an increase in energy costs. All of our energy costs have gone up because of net zero. You pay more for your gas, for your electricity, for your petrol, and for everything since everything that is produced requires energy, and when energy is expensive, everything we buy becomes more expensive.\nNet zero is an attack on freedom of travel. Net zero will soon be used to justify 15-minute cities where we will soon be “encouraged” to remain within sectors designated as a 15-minute city and you will be only allowed out on certain conditions and a certain number of times in a year before you are prevented from going out of your sector.\nDoes this sound like a free country to you?\nPurposeful Policy This is no accident. The government is in the process of destroying our freedoms and our economy in order to extract money from the pockets of the poor, to feed the greed of their corporate sponsors.\nReform UK is the Only Answer Fight back with Reform. If you want to fight back, retain your freedom, and save Britain, then we must:\n- Scrap net zero immediately ￼\n- Stop mass immigration immediately\nThese two are the most important aspects because they affect everything else.\nIf you agree, vote with me, Reform UK.\nChris Farmer\nGloucester",

This plan focuses on practicality, cost-effectiveness, and national interests. Here are the key points:\nScrap Net Zero and Related Subsidies Reform UK rejects the Net Zero target due to its immense cost. The estimated cost of achieving Net Zero in the UK is around £2 trillion. Reform UK's stance is that these funds could be better utilised elsewhere. By ditching Net Zero, the public sector could save approximately £20 billion annually over the next 25 years.\nEliminate Renewable Energy Subsidies Renewable energy subsidies cost the UK £10 billion annually. @Reform UK proposes equivalent taxes on these subsidies, arguing that renewables are not cheaper. The goal is to cut these subsidies, thereby saving significant tax payers money.\nPromote Cheap, Secure Energy Reform UK advocates for the use of domestic energy resources. This includes:\nNorth Sea Gas and Oil: Fast-tracking licences for exploration and extraction. Shale Gas: Granting licences for test sites for two years, followed by major production if safety is proven. The potential value of shale gas is hundreds of billions over 30 years. New Technology: Embracing clean nuclear energy with new small modular reactors built in Britain.\nKey Savings and Benefits Scrapping Net Zero: saves £20 billion per year.\nCutting Renewable Energy Subsidies: Saves £10 billion annually.\nUtilising Domestic Resources: Generates massive revenue and ensures energy security.\nReform UK's energy policy reduces taxes on energy harness domestic energy potential, and creates innovation in energy production.\nThese measures provide a secure and economically independent energy future for all of us in the UK.\nThank you Chris Farmer",

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_politicians-dont-believe-their-own-net-zero-rhetoric/content_57.html": "Politicians Don’t Believe Their Own Net Zero Rhetoric\nThursday, 28 September 2023\nPoliticians Don’t Believe Their Own Net Zero Rhetoric The fact that politicians have authorised the North Sea Rosebank oilfield, which will produce 300 million barrels of oil and other hydrocarbon fuels, proves beyond doubt that they don't believe their own climate catastrophe narrative.\nThe End of the World is Not Nigh If politicians truly believed that hydrocarbons were destroying the planet, they would ban their use and tell the British public that they'd have to return to the preindustrial age if they wanted human life to continue.\nHuman Life Requires Energy and CO2 Human life needs energy because every material product and service we rely on for a prosperous life requires it. For millennia, human existence depended on muscle power from animals or slaves. The invention of the steam engine, followed quickly by the internal combustion engine powered by hydrocarbons, liberated humans from bonfage of manual labour\nWithout hydrocarbons, we'd revert to the preindustrial slave-age, with millions dying from cold and starvation.\nHuman life depends on CO2. All life relies on CO2 because plants need it, and every living thing depends on plants.\nClimate Crisis Narrative is a Money Making Scheme Humans act in ways they believe will benefit them. The climate crisis narrative exists because those behind it profit from it.\nThey promote it, yet they don't adhere to its teachings. Politicians fervently spread climate catastrophe tales, but simultaneously live lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and they authorise new oil fields. They recognise our dependence on oil and its harmlessness to the environment.\nGlobal Warming/Climate Catastrophe is a $1 Trillion Industry The climate catastrophe narrative generates vast profits for those promoting it, creating a momentum that makes it hard for anyone to challenge, especially if it pays their wages.\nBut They Can’t Live On The Lie Reality forces governments and activists to continue using Carbon fuels, and they WILL persist in doing this.\nFrom 2050, and Beyond Net zero deadlines are deferred. As we approach these deadlines, they'll be postponed again because the underlying narrative is Not True!\nOnly Reality Is Real - For anyone doubting the climate change narrative, the British government's implied admission that hydrocarbon fuels are “safe and effective” should reassure you that the world is NOT ending in 20 years.\nThe Earth is 4.5 billion years old and there’s plenty of life in her yet.\nBack to a Better Future Net Zero ideology is a money making myth. It threatens us with economic catastrophe. Its a Ponzi scheme supported by dubious science and misleading computer models. We must abandon net zero and return to sustainable, reliable, affordable, safe and effective hydrocarbon energy production.\nEnergy is Life Energy is life and life is energy. The more energy we have, the better our lives will be.\nStop living in fear Let's dispel the fear, move forward with confidence, and make planet Earth a wonderfully warm and abundant home.\nIf you agree, please, share the news with everybody on the planet\nAnd follow my Facebook.\nChris, Farmer.

Children of this age are practically zero risk from “ The Bug”\nBy contrast, there is a known risk associated to the Vac Cleans. For the government and health service to recommend a higher risk in exchange for a lower risk is malpractice. It is bad government and bad medicine. At some point there will be consequences that must be paid for these decisions on Vac Cleans.\nChildren’s Climate anxiety Many young children are suffering from anxiety because they have been told by authority figures that the end of the world is nigh and that they will not live to see the end of the natural lifespan. This amounts to child psychological abuse. Committed upon them by the government and the greens There is no chance that the world will come to an end in 20 years due to CO2 in the atmosphere. To tell children so, is child abuse.\nTransgender ideology. Unbelievably, our children are being taught that biological facts of nature and genetic inheritance can be overridden simply by a childish whim. Children are being told by “teachers” that “some people are born into the wrong body”. The statement denotes nothing in reality. There is no such thing as a person being “born into the wrong body”. This again amounts to child abuse, and it is government sanctioned.\nSexualisation of children. In state schools, children as young as eight, have been shown explicit sexual material which discusses masturbation homosexual and transgender issues.\nSome lessons are nothing short of sexual grooming of minors and it’s being sanctioned by the government. This is a breach of safeguarding and an offence against the law.\nCritical racism theory. Critical race theory is explicitly racist. Critical race theory defines people, not by character or their behaviour, but rather by the colour of their skin.\nTo judge people by the colour of their skin is a blatant act of racism and this is now codified in “critical race theory” and is endorsed by “teachers“.\nFor teachers to be teaching racism under the guise of “critical race theory“ is the diametric opposite of a proper education. And it’s government sanctioned\nStudent Debt Over the years since Blair, both the government and education services have told students that their future prosperity requires a degree. As a result, almost 50% pursue degrees, saddling themselves with enormous debts that will likely never be paid off. Many end up pursuing \"junk\" degrees like media studies, and there's even one in magic!\nDebt trap, These loans carry interest rates of 7%, and the total student debt is now £205 billion. How can a young person begin their adult life burdened by such debt? It's profiteering, and it's government-sanctioned profiteering.\nFor our children’s sake Reform is Necessary\nChildren aged six months to 4 years, who are at virtual￼ly no risk from the bug, should not be given MR N.A. vac-cleans.\nChildren should be educated about the biological facts of nature: man + woman = children.\nTransvestites should not be giving lectures on sexuality.\nChildren aren't sexual beings until they arrive at puberty and should be protected from sexual predators.\nSome people who work with children are sexual predators.\nStudent debt is a curse.\nJunk degrees need to be curtailed.\nChildren and young adults, should be taught how to create new profitable, businesses, not magic tricks.\nThe government and authorities in education and medicine aren't serving our children as they should.\nOur children are our most valuable assets. They are currently being let down and the system requires urgent and radical reform.\nIf you agree, please share your thoughts, distribute this post to everyone you know, and follow my Facebook page.\nChris, Farmer.

This allows small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to retain more of their earnings, enabling reinvestment and growth. VAT Threshold Increase: The VAT threshold would be increased to £150,000, freeing small businesses from cumbersome VAT administration and reducing their tax liabilities. Energy Cost Reduction: By scrapping energy levies and Net Zero policies, Reform UK aims to slash energy bills, saving households and businesses significant amounts. Access to cheaper energy will alleviate operational costs for local businesses. Enhancing Opportunities for Growth\nEnterprise Zones: Establishment of SME enterprise zones in underdeveloped areas with tax incentives and support for new businesses. This would foster economic activity and job creation in these regions. Business Rates Abolition: For high street-based SMEs, business rates would be abolished. This measure aims to rejuvenate local high streets by reducing the fixed costs associated with physical storefronts. Support for Sole Traders: Abolition of IR35 rules to support self-employed individuals and sole traders, promoting entrepreneurial activities and flexible working arrangements. Fostering a Business-Friendly Environment\nRegulatory Simplification: Reform UK plans to simplify the tax code and reduce bureaucratic red tape, making it easier for businesses to navigate regulations and focus on growth. Planning System Reform: Fast-tracking planning and tax incentives for developing brownfield sites will encourage new housing and commercial projects, stimulating local economies and providing more spaces for business operations.

The politicians are representatives of the people. Politicians do not have any power other than the power that is granted (lent) to them by the public.\nSovereignty lies with the people, not with the sovereign, King Charles, nor with the House of Commons, nor with the House of Lords.\nThe purpose of MPs is to implement the will of the people. The purpose of MPs is NOT to align themselves with global entities, such as the WEF, and to IMPOSE the will of the WEF, the UN, the EU, the United Nations, or any other external group onto us.\nIf/when the politicians act on behalf of the WEF and impose their agenda onto the British people, then they have violated the social contract that we have with them. And this is what has happened and is happening.\nPoliticians have betrayed us. The politicians have signed up to an agenda written by the WEF, the IPCC, the EU, the UN, The World Bank, Big Pharma, Big Tech, big banking (big finance), and they are ignoring the will of the people.\nThere is No Mandate for Net Zero The most obvious expression of this violation of trust is the current obsession that the UK government has with implementing net zero policies onto the British people without discussion or a mandate.\nThe implications of net zero are profound and dangerous to the health and wealth of the British people.\nNet zero will impoverish us all. Net zero is based upon false information, false computer modelling, and false narratives.\nIt is regarded as a business opportunity for moneymen and politicians to profit at the expense of everybody else.\nWe- the British people - must reaffirm our power over politicians.\nWe must withdraw our consent, withdraw our cooperation, and replace it with resistance and non-compliance.\nWe must act.\nActive, Not Passive Many people are passive.

They operate as a tag team with a unified agenda based on open borders, high taxes, coercive governments, mass immigration, and net zero—none of which were chosen by the British people but all of which are being imposed by successive governments.\nUnintended consequences Conservative party immigration policies have produced unintended consequences MPs from both the Labour and Conservative parties have been shocked to receive death threats from sections of the immigrant community. Rishi Sunak stated that democracy is being lost to MOB rule; he is correct, and he is responsible. His implementation of open borders has led to the importation of violence onto the streets of Britain.\nOnly Reform UK has the solutions to the growing and multiplying problems created by the government.\nTo cut immigration, it is imperative to stop the continuous influx of people. Last year, 745,000 people entered the country, equivalent to the population of two cities the size of Bristol. This influx puts excessive strain on public services, roads, schools, and housing. It is crucial to reduce this burden and stabilise our public services. Stopping mass immigration is a priority.\nStop Net Zero Net zero serves as a justification for the destruction of British industry, economics, and farming. The steel industry has been sacrificed to net zero, resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs in Wales. Welsh farmers are protesting the demand to take arable of land out of production for \"greening\". Net zero also justifies high energy costs, which, when energy is expensive, makes everything expensive. Net Zero is an attack on the motorcar, leading to higher tax rates, smaller, narrower roads, and a general decline in living standards. Net zero is a catastrophe for the British economy and people and must be abolished immediately.\nEconomic reform is necessary to transition from a high-tax, high-regulation, low-productivity economy to one characterised by low taxes, low regulation, and high productivity.\nThis can be achieved by stimulating the creation of many small and medium-sized businesses, which have been crushed by the Conservatives in favour of multinational corporations.\nSupporting community businesses, with lower taxes, will incentivise work, and create more employment, and will offer products and services desired by the local community.\nReform of public services The current services are often inefficient, bloated, and focused on woke ideologies.\nThis trend must be reversed to create streamlined, efficient services that concentrate only on their core missions.\nFor example, the police should prioritise preventing and detecting crime over being woke, and the education service should focus on providing solid education in basic disciplines such as mathematics, English, science, history, and critical reasoning.\nThis country can be saved, and only Reform UK can save it.\nThe message must be shared with everyone, with eight months left before the next election.\nIt's time to change politics for good Please leave a comment….\nThank you Chris Farmer #ReformUK",

Net zero is the single most destructive economic policy ever invented because it increases the cost of energy.\nEnergy is essential for every product, service, home, and individual. When energy becomes expensive, everyone suffers and is pushed into poverty.\nThe Futility of Net Zero Net zero is futile because China’s increase in CO2 emissions in a single year is more than the whole of the UK’s annual output.\nIn 2022, the UK’s total carbon emissions were about 341 million tonnes of CO2.\nIn contrast, China’s emissions increased by around 600 million tonnes in 2023 alone.\nAnd this completely ignores comparable numbers from India, Pakistan and other developing nations around the world\nThis makes the UK’s efforts totally insignificant on the global scale.\nMassive Economic Destruction Instead of improving our economy and generating jobs, Net Zero destroys the economy.\nAlthough some jobs are created in the green energy sector, EVERY OTHER sector is decimated by the increased cost of energy.\nScrap net zero. Reform UK is the only party that opposes net zero and will create cheap, clean, sustainable energy based on tried and trusted technologies.\nCheap energy creates wealth Cheap energy means everybody is richer.

And the ones who are leaving are experienced and well trained, whilst the ones who are joining are obviously raw recruits.\nConsequently, the military is being degraded by Bad Political Decisions.\nIn addition, many veterans feel they have been abandoned by the politicians.

Defence has to be paid for, and we will increase the size and the capacity of our forces, ensuring that our military can always successfully fulfil their duties.\nIncrease Pay Reform UK will increase basic pay across our enforces in order to attract new recruits and retain the personnel we already have.\nNew Armed Forces Justice Bill Our servicemen are being hounded by lawyers who are bringing civil law and human rights cases against military personnel for actions that were taken decades ago under orders. This has led to many injustices for our retired military personnel. We will stop this injustice.\nNew Dedicated Ministerial Department for Veterans Our veterans need to be cared for, and at the moment, many are not. So, Reform UK will create a dedicated ministerial department to look after their best interests.\nRegenerate Britain’s Defence, By means of tax incentives we will encourage growth in the UK defence industry. Ideally, we want to be self-sufficient in military terms.\nReform Defence Procurement Defence procurement has been awful over recent years, and many millions of pounds have been wasted. We will launch a joint acquisition corps to ensure world-class defence procurement.\nEducation for Military Personnel Leaving the Service Working in the military is a unique context, and when people leave and join civilian life, they often feel ill-equipped. Reform UK will introduce free education, both during and after military service, which is vital to ensure a successful transition from military back into civilian life.\nDefence of the Nation is necessary to Keep Us Free.

No illegal and unlimited immigration is allowed. Here’s our six-point plan:\nDeclare a security emergency. Leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). Set up offshore processing for immigrants. No stay for illegal immigrants. Establish a new immigration office. Send boats back to France.\nStop the Cost of Living Crisis We must lower taxes and end quantitative easing. We will scrap net zero energy policies.\nSupport Small and Medium Businesses We will support over 1.2 million small and medium businesses by removing corporation tax. We will raise the minimum profit threshold to £100,000. We will reduce the corporation tax rate from 25% to 20%, and then to 15% from year five. The VAT threshold will be raised to £120,000. There will be no business rates for high street small and medium firms. We will reform the planning system and fast-track new housing and infrastructure projects, especially in the North and coastal areas.\nImprove NHS Funding and Efficiency We will ensure more doctors and nurses are available. All frontline NHS and social care staff will pay no basic rate tax for three years. This will help retain current staff and attract those who have left. We will use independent healthcare providers to cut waiting lists. There will be a 20% tax relief on private healthcare and insurance.\nReal Crime Prevention We need more police officers and common-sense policing. We will scrap all diversity, equality, and inclusion roles. We will reform the police complaints system to work for the law-abiding public. The College of Policing will be de-politicised. We will focus on crime prevention, discipline, public service, and fitness. New officers will take an entrance exam and complete a two-year probation period.\nImprove Roads and Transport We will stop the war on motorists. We will ban Ultra Low Emission Zones (ULEZ) and low traffic neighbourhoods. We will scrap bans on petrol and diesel cars and end requirements for electric cars. A national database will be set up for transport projects. We will fix and build roads.\nMore Housing and Controlled Immigration We will reform the planning system and fast-track development on brownfield sites. We will reduce mass migration to ease the strain on housing.\nMake Work Pay We will lift the income tax start point to £20,000 per year. This will free up to seven million people from paying income tax and save every worker almost £1,500 per year. This will help many return to work and escape the benefits trap. We will keep the basic tax rate at 20% and start the higher rate at £70,000. We will cut energy taxes to beat the cost of living crisis. We will scrap VAT on energy bills, lower fuel duty by 20p per litre, and remove environmental levies.\nBritish Sovereignty We will reject influence from the EU, WHO, UN, and WEF. We will leave the World Health Organisation (WHO) unless it reforms. We oppose the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).\nPreserve British Culture and Heritage We will replace the 2010 Equalities Act. The current act requires discrimination for ‘positive action’ and costs the economy billions. It destroys meritocracy, spreads division, and excludes some majority groups.

Some believe that this freedom implies they can use any words, at any time, about anything. However, that is not the true meaning of the term “freedom of speech” .\nThe law imposes limits on our speech and it always has. For instance:\nThe law has offences for using threatening words and behaviour, known as breach of the peace. Threats to kill are outlawed. Threats to commit criminal damage are not allowed. The law also outlaws threats to commit arson. There are many other limitations on speech in law\nFreedom of speech doesn’t mean one can say anything at any time to anyone.\nFreedom of speech is a political right. It allows a person to criticise the government or to make any political, moral, or religious statement they wish.\nFreedom of speech doesn’t authorise the use of abusive or threatening words.\nSadly, many people misunderstand what freedom of speech truly is. They think it's an open ticket to say anything they wish, even if it’s aggressive, rude, or threatening.\nThis is not the case and never has been.\nOn social media, we are sometimes subjected to other people using offensive language: Some use language online that they would never use face-to-face. On social media people are shielded from the social consequences of using aggressive and abusive language; so, from the comfort of their own home, they routinely abuse people online\nIf you're ever subjected to such language, my advice is to raise up your psychic shields and ignore them.\nDon't let them get you down!\nLife’s too short.\nPlease share this, and please follow my Facebook\nThank you\nChris Farmer.

Poor people cannot become rich by wealth redistribution Poor people can get rich by CREATING wealth-By starting small and medium size businesses\nOur plan includes tax reforms to make work more rewarding, encouraging more young people to enter and stay in the workforce.\nWe aim to create a vibrant enterprise environment for young wealth creators, ensuring they have the support and resources needed to succeed\nPolicies for Old People\nTriple Lock on Pensions\n- We commit to maintaining the triple lock on pensions, ensuring that pensions increase annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings, or a minimum of 2.5%.\n- This policy is crucial to protect the financial security of our older population, ensuring their pensions keep pace with the cost of living\nSocial Care\n- We will commence a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the social care system, aiming to create a sustainable and effective care plan.\n- Our focus is on collaboration between central government, local authorities, and social care providers to address the growing challenges in social care\nPolicies for Women\nAnti-Woke Ideology\n- We will oppose the woke ideology that attacks even the concept of women. Our politicians, including Keir Starmer, cannot or will not define what a woman is.\n- How can they protect women’s rights if they don’t know what a woman is? Reform UK will protect women’s rights from the attack launched upon them by woke ideology\nSafe Spaces for Women\n- We are committed to maintaining safe spaces for women against transgender men in places like shelters, prisons, and changing rooms.\n- Additionally, we will protect women's spaces from individuals coming from cultures that downgrade the status of women, ensuring these spaces remain safe and respectful.\nThese policies reflect our commitment at Reform UK to support and protect the diverse needs of young people, old people, and women in our society.\nBy addressing these key areas, we aim to create a more inclusive, fair, and prosperous UK.\nIf you agree Vote for Reform Uk Gloucester city Chris Farmer #ReformUK",

There is a strong—no, very strong—push to revert to the preindustrial age by eliminating hydrocarbon fuels, which power the vast majority of the 21st-century economy.\nIt's impossible to power an industrialised civilisation on wind turbines, heat pumps, and solar panels. Eliminating hydrocarbons would send us back two hundred years. The collapse in living standards would be unbearable because the destruction would be life threatening.\nThose who love the planet advocate a regression to a preindustrial age when poverty was the norm. So, we cannot go Net Zero backwards.\nWhat about the far right and far left?\nThe far left, pushes for ever greater state contrl of daily life and choices. State-run, command, and control societies mean that the government controls everything and you control nothing. The government dictates what you read, think, the medications you take, where you can go, and even if you can travel. We reject this authoritarian state, command and control approach. I'm not interested in Tony Blair's surveillance society, which is based upon a China's model.\nFar right? The WEF Corporate Governance model The far right WEF called \"stakeholder capitalism,\" which is really a corporate dictatorship. In this model, people—like you and me—are controlled by multinational corporations; big banks, big tech, big pharma, big oil, and media entities control finance, information, and physical resources. So, once again, we have no control over our own lives. If you have the \"wrong\" views, they'll shut you down. We've seen this happen with Nigel Farage.\nI reject far-left socialism, government dictatorship, and I reject far-right WEF WHO corporate dictatorship.\nI also reject going backwards to a preindustrial Age economy.\nForward Let’s move forward together. I believe that we should progress and reestablish England (Great Britain) as the country we were born to be.\nThat is, a country based upon four basic principles:\nFreedom: Freedom of speech, freedom to choose, freedom to travel, and freedom from coercion.\nEnterprise: A society based on the creation of millions of small to medium-sized businesses, which employ between one and 200 people and form the backbone of our economy, creating the wealth we all rely on.\nPublic Service: Excellent public services; NHS, police, education, and border controls, which can only be sustained within a productive, free-enterprise economy.\nSovereignty: Britain as a free, sovereign nation, sovereign secure borders, Sovereign nation independent from external pressures from entities like the EU, WEF, WHO, IPCC, World Bank, UN, etc.\nBritain is ready, willing, and able to take control of its actions without being told what to do by the likes of Klaus Schwab or anyone else.\nThe British people are sovereign; politicians are our servants. The British people don't take orders from politicians; politicians take orders from the British people.\nThis is the way forward. If you look at the picture, you'll see the path is clear: Towards A Land of Hope and Glory.\nA picture is worth 1000 words.

Business confidence is low, and all of this is due to flawed government policy over many years.\nIt has left the British economy in tatters, and urgent Reform is needed\nFree Enterprise Growth Economy Reform UK will transform the UK economy by releasing the creative and productive genius of the British people.\nGovernments do not make people rich; People make governments rich!\nWhen the government gets out of the way and lets business thrive, then we all win.\nHere is how Reform UK will transform the UK economy for good:\n- Support small, medium-sized businesses SMEs are 95% of all UK businesses. They employ the most people, pay the most taxes, and offer the greatest potential for economic growth.\nSo Reform UK will create “small enterprise zones” and will encourage the growth of 1 million new small and medium-sized businesses over the next few years.\nThis is how we will grow the economy and provide for full employment.\n- Free 1.2 million SMEs from corporation tax. The early years for any small business are the most dangerous. So Reform UK will maximise their chances of success by lifting millions of small and medium-sized businesses from the burden of corporation tax. We will lift the minimum profit threshold to £100K and reduce the corporation tax rate from 25% to 20%.\nThis will result in businesses having more money to invest in their own growth, which will, in turn, grow the economy and create more wealth unemployment\n- Simplify the ￼planning system. We will fast track new housing on Brownfield sites, which will boost building, especially in the north, and in coastal regeneration areas.\nLet's build our way to prosperity.\n- Reform the tax system. All businesses know that the tax system is a nightmare. At over 21,000 pages, the UK tax code is a minefield. By contrast, the Hong Kong tax code is under 500 pages.\nLet us simplify our tax system and make it more efficient.\n- Deliver on Brexit Benefits The Conservative government castrated Brexit, and we are getting very few of the benefits of leaving the EU because we are still mirroring EU legislation.\nReform UK scraps thousands of laws that are holding British business back and damaging our productivity. Currently UK/EU employment laws make it more costly to hire people, and when hiring people is more expensive, fewer people are hired.\n- Wealth-generating economy Before we can have brilliant public services, we must have a brilliant economy.\nCurrently, our economy is flat-lining, and that’s why the NHS, defence, and other public services are failing to cope.\nA high productivity, low tax, low regulation economy is our way to riches.\nIf you agree with this, vote for Reform UK.￼\nThank you very much\nPlease leave a comment\nChris Farmer #ReformUK",

The collapse of Britain has been caused by successive terrible governments, starting with Tony Blair, leading to our current incompetent incumbent, Rishi Sunak.\nTony Blair started the rot in this country by cosying himself up with big business and corrupting the civil service, House of Commons, and the way that government does business. A continual liar, Tony Blair marked the beginning of the end of British politics.\nGordon Brown continued the downward trend started by Tony Blair. However, Gordon Brown lacked the sophistication and magnetic charm that Tony Blair possessed, doing less damage than Blair, but he managed to sell off all our gold at knockdown prices.\nDavid Cameron continued the process of degrading Britain by subjugating ourselves to the European Union and other globalist organisations. A keen member of the WEF, David Cameron presented well- but he did Britain no favours.\nWe should also make an honorary mention of the boy wonder, Nick Clegg, David Cameron's mini-me. You may remember those debates between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage when Nigel Farage was warning us about the European Union's plans for a European army, which Nick Clegg said was a “dangerous lie“. Farage was right; Clegg was wrong.\nTheresa May was given the job of delivering Brexit. She affirmed “Brexit means Brexit,” but she didn’t mean a single word. She spent her tenure trying to figure out how to scupper Brexit and make it meaningless. \"Treason May\" was her nickname, and it was well earned.\nBoris Johnson, who was seen by many as the great hope for the Conservative Party and for Brexit, failed to deliver on his potential because of his innate character flaws; he often appeared as a bumbling fool and has a strong tendency to lie. Boris Johnson, although charismatic, lacks a moral compass and therefore failed to deliver on the promise he showed.\nLiz Truss was given a rough ride and was deselected not by the party but by the financial markets. They did not like her traditional Tory policies of cutting taxes and shrinking the size of government. So, they got rid of her and replaced her with …\nRishi Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs banker and puppet of the WEF and global markets. Rishi Sunak has absolutely no interest in helping to improve the lives of the working and middle classes of the UK and is instead intent on delivering a constrained Britain, from which the assets can be stripped and the WEF can \"build back better.\"\nThis sorry state. The United Kingdom has become what it is because its politicians have betrayed the British people.\nBut in a deeper sense, it is the British people themselves who must take some responsibility, for they have continued to vote for the same poisonous parties: Conservative and Labour.\nIt’s time for a change. If we want to reverse the decline and replace it with a progressive, wealth-creating, free economy and society based upon traditional British values, then we must stop voting Labour and Conservative and start voting for Reform UK.\nReform UK stands for the protection of individual rights, a high-growth economy, efficient public services, secure national borders, a strong military, and an independent sovereign state.\nReform UK stands for Britain at its best.\nIf you stand for Britain at its best, then stand with Reform UK.\nPlease leave a comment below.

( Extract of first few minutes)\n( Anne walks on stage to thunderous applause )\nShe says… “Have you had enough of this government? (Conference shouts Yes!)\nHave you had enough of endless talk with no action? (Yes!)\nHave you had enough of an opposition that changes its mind every two seconds, sending us all into a whirlwind of dizzying U-turns?\nIf you have reached your limit… if you truly yearn for change, then there's only one way to express that sentiment: To comprehensively reject our current system. (Applause]\nNow, Ben Habib has declared his intent to obliterate the Tories. But that's insufficient. We must also set our sights on Labour! [Cheers]\nIt's vital that we never lose sight of the threat Labour represent.\nTheir objective, hidden though it may be, is to draw us back into the EU through the back door Of course, they aren't directly advocating for a formal re-entry; that's an unrealistic ambition. But what could happen and what will happen under the leadership of Keir Starmer is a subtle alignment with Europe\nGradually, in the guise of closer cooperation we'd find ourselves deferring to EU regulations, letting them dictate our border policies.\nIn essence, we'd remain tethered to an institution the nation has comprehensively rejected. Let us not be complacent about the risks Labour represents.\nIf we hope to effect meaningful change, if we're determined to see genuine reform, then we must secure victories by siphoning votes from both conservatives and labour\nI think there's a small third party out there, but we don't need to worry about them.\nIn fact, if you conducted a vox pop among the population, you wouldn't find many people who recognize the name Ed Davis.\nWhat we have to do, and the message we have to take out, is really a very simple one:\nIf you want change; if you want things done differently; if you want to get our country back again; if you want Britain to be run by Britain and not by the EU or by anybody else; if those are the things that you want; if you want to get rid of the scourge of political correctness; if you want to control immigration; if you want our kids to have a proper education instead of critical race theory; if you want the NHS to actually do the job it was designed to do; if you want all those things, then there is no earthly point in voting for more of the same.\nThere is no point!￼\nThe very definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.\nSo, it is crucial that that message gets across. The whole weight on the push for reform, and the whole reason d’etre for Reform is reform.\nIt is change. It is to stop the direction that we are going in at the moment and create an entirely new direction, at the very center of which is freedom!\nAnd always, if you are to effect change, you rely on the courage of individuals. The courage to vote for something different, even if you are afraid.\nThe courage to stand for what you believe in, even if it involves risk.\nWe have virtually lost free speech in this country because people are afraid to exercise it.\nBut we need to encourage free speech. We need to define what is going wrong. We need to put parents in charge of what their children are taught.\nWe should not, in any circumstances, allow four-year-olds to be told that they can be a man or woman depending on what they want... ...and that they can change their mind if they want on a Wednesday afternoon.\nThat is not what we send our children to school for. We send our children to school to be taught what we cannot teach them ourselves.\nI couldn't teach physics or chemistry. And Rishi couldn’t teach Maths\nRishi proposals on maths has to be the craziest proposal yet: that children who are very, very clever in some subjects should have their chances of entering into a top university prejudiced because they don't happen to be very good at maths or English.\nAll my life, I have used arithmetic, and I have used the logic implicit in algebra, but never, since the age of 15, have I bothered with the square of the hypotenuse. [Laughter]\n...and Rishi needs to understand that diluting the curriculum, that diluting subjects, is not going to repair the education system. What will repair the education system is the end of grade inflation, rigor in education, and discipline in education.\nThese are the things we need to talk about…”\n(End of Quote)\nI hope you enjoyed this excerpt from Ann Widdecombe‘s wonderful speech\nPlease share it to your friends.

Keep Me Free!\nThursday, 05 October 2023\nDon’t Keep Me Safe. Keep Me Free! The primary purpose of government is to protect the individual rights and freedoms of the citizens it serves.\nPolitical Freedom is an Absolute. We are supposed to be living in a Free Society where each individual has unalienable rights and freedoms. In two world wars, Many sacrificed their lives to preserve and protect the freedoms that we are supposed to enjoy in this country.\nIn wartime, Governments purposefully, and rightly put people at extreme risk in order to protect individual freedoms of citizens. Governments put members of the armed forces into battle, and many die, in order to protect our national freedom.\nFreedom is first So it's clear that the primary purpose of government is NOT the avoidance of risk, but rather the protection of freedom.\nThis is the nature of true politics.\nNow we have a false politics that has inverted this true order\nModern, politicians attack freedoms, and they try to justify it under the banner of keeping us “safe.\"\nPoliticians have sacrificed free speech on the principle of keeping people “safe from hate speech”\nPoliticians have attacked individual rights and freedoms on the pretense of “Stay at home. Stay safe”.\nPoliticians have signed over UK sovereignty to the World Health Organisation, who is going to -apparently - keep us “safe” from the next deadly virus they have planned. (It’s due next year)\nPoliticians have also agreed that the WHO may take control of your life to “ keep you safe”from the climate crisis!!\nThey might even take control of you in order to “keep you safe” from a POTENTIAL crisis!\nWho decides what constitutes a “potential crisis”? The WHO, of course!\nWho will keep us safe from the WHO , WEF and power lusting politicians?\nPoliticians are intent on destroying the concept of freedom.\nI don’t trust them! I don’t trust politicians who claim that they intend to to lock us up, Lock Us down, take away freedoms, suppress speech, limit access to information, and tell us what drugs we must to take in order to partake in the privilege of living in their dystopian society.\nWe Are Born Free I would rather take the risk of living in a free society where people have free speech, where there is free enterprise, and where we have the freedom to choose whether to drive a car, eat meat, and take the latest “safe and effective” medication - or Not!\nThank You Rishi - But No! Politicians do not have the job of keeping us risk-free. Rishi Sunak has taken it upon himself to relieve people of the choice as to whether they want to accept the risk of smoking!\nEven if you’re a fully grown adult, you are not adult enough to make your own choices because Rishi Sunak and the other politicians reserve the right to infringe on your freedoms, and you will “Do as you are told.”\nI think NOT! This is bad politics. It’s authoritarian, it’s dystopian, it’s dangerous.\nIt’s too risky!!\nFreedom first A politician's job is to protect our individual freedoms, protect our borders, create an enterprise economy which generates sufficient wealth to fund fantastic public services.\nTheir job is to create conditions for successful living, and successful living implies RISK!\nLiving is risky.

The local government has TRIPLED the size of the foot & cycle path thus massively REDUCING the size of a very busy main road, which must carry many buses, lorries, cars, ambulances and fire-engines. On the new, extremely narrow roadway vehicles can barely pass each other without colliding; whilst the super-wide cycle lane remain conspicuously EMPTY! It’s madness. And dangerous. Because when emergency ambulances and fire engines need to pass, there is nowhere for traffic to turn to allow them through, since they are jammed together like sardines. It’s the result of idiotic government officials, mindlessly implementing the false ideologies of climate catastrophe and Net Zero Another brainless ideology is “Critical Race Theory” which teaches young children that racism is an inevitable part of society and that all white people are racist, which is, in itself, a racist statement Critical Race Theory institutionalises racism, and inevitably produce terrible results as children grow up to believe they are either oppressed or guilty of oppression. Critical Race Theory is self-contradictory racist propaganda and must be Terminated. Another Terrible ideology is Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) which claims that governments can never go bust because they always have the prerogative of printing more (fake ) digital money. Perhaps governments can't go bust, but a country certainly can; and the current UK government's current reckless overspending causes inflation which pushes people into poverty and business out of business Another idiotic ideology is A One World Government, to be overseen by the WEF, WHO, UN, World Bank, and other global institutions, This dark idea will result in the destruction of Nation States, democracy and our personal freedom. We see this happening; our freedoms have been attacked by our own Uk politicians many of whom are signed-up members of the WEF.

Enjoy!)\n“I wonder if anyone in this hall can recall a time when our country has been in such a dangerous place in peacetime. Some say that we've been here before. In the 1970s, we had unions strikes, soaring inflation, government debt, and an energy crisis. Politicians were managing our decline, and the same could certainly be said of today.\nBut something has changed. No matter how bad things got in the 70s, those who ruled us, for the most part, shared our values and beliefs. They believed in our way of life. Many Labour MPs had clawed their way out of the dockyards and coal mines where our grandfathers toiled. Many parliamentarians had fought through the worst storms of the world wars of the 20th century. But they shared a kinship and a love of our country, our culture, and our history.\nThose days are now long gone traded instead for a lust for power and money Stripped of values and purpose, MPs of both parties have been bought and sold. Loyal Conservative and Labour voters have been betrayed.\nThe institutions themselves are utterly broken. They are busily trying to solve the problem they call democracy. They want a world where unelected, unaccountable globalist institutions and power-hungry billionaires dictate our laws to us.\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is what every single one of us here is determined to stop.\nWe see rafts of legislation brought in without any debate or regard for what the people actually want or need. We only have to look at the energy bill or the online safety bill for an ever-expanding scope of power, which tells us what we cannot say or do without fine, seizure, or jail, all under the pretext of morality.\nIt's time for Britain to wake up. It's time for us to remind the British people who they really are because if we fail in this, then all else fails.\nAnd we start by telling the truth. It's not about hope or wishful thinking. It's about trusting ourselves, our values, our strengths, our history, and the ideas that have always built free, safe, healthy societies.\nWe know that no matter what, if we refer to these values, we can and will navigate our way through difficulties fairly, with a clear conscience, and effectively because we will take the right action.\nThese are the Reform UK values: freedom, choice, and opportunity.\nWe, as a party, will protect your freedoms, the British people's fundamental rights and freedoms - personal, economic, or otherwise. They give us the moral fabric of a nation which our ancestors fought to defend. Because freedom cannot be given by the state, it is our birthright. We are free, and we will protect that.\nWe must remember that we have the ability to create whatever we need – be it communities, services, products, industries, or wealth.\nThere is always more, and we champion opportunities. With these values of freedom, choice, and opportunity, we don't expect people to merely conform. We motivate them to inspect, choose, and act.\nThis transition moves us from being mere consumers to creators of our own destiny.\nInstead of a foreboding future, we offer a positive vision of empowerment and encouragement, aiming to return and firmly establish the power in the hands of the British people.\nAnd this power will stay with them through to the elections, and once we are in government; Our mission is rooted in these three principles: freedom, choice, and opportunity.\nWe start by spreading this message. If you have any doubt, just look around this hall. As Richard highlighted earlier, at our conference two years ago, there were just over 300 of us. Now, there are over four times that number, with supporters clustered in and around London rallying behind Reform.\nToday, our words reach millions. Hearts and minds across the nation are, perhaps unknowingly, eagerly awaiting this message.\nTo the countless individuals beyond these walls: Join us.\nWe are the only choice now, and our momentum is rapidly accelerating. In just two weeks, we face elections in Tamworth and Mid-Bedfordshire, with stellar candidates poised to represent us. We eagerly anticipate these elections, hopeful for landmark by-election results.\nAnd then, we march towards the general election, where we will field 600 candidates. For the first time in a generation, the British people will have the chance to cast their vote for a party that wholeheartedly believes in freedom, choice, opportunity, and the majesty of our great nation.\nThis is our mission, our solemn duty. As we embark on this journey, let's do so with humility and gratitude. Hold onto this vision daily. Discuss it, share it, and let it guide your responses to whatever actions this government takes next. Regardless of the narratives peddled by the media, lobbyists, or other governmental forces, we must stand steadfast in our convictions and values.\nLet's heed the words spoken not only by Margaret Thatcher but by many through the ages. Let us ensure our children will look back and rejoice, knowing we never abandoned the cause of freedom.\nIt's time to rise. By doing so, we will make Britain great again Thank you\n(I hope you enjoyed this extract of Paul’s fantastic speech)\nPlease share it and please follow my Facebook page.\nChris, Farmer. Reform Uk.

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_multiculturalism-destroys-cultures/content_130.html": "Multiculturalism Destroys Cultures\nThursday, 12 October 2023\nMulticulturalism Destroys Cultures Across planet Earth, there are many distinctive cultures which give identity and a sense of belonging to the people who live in them.\nThe keyword in the above sentence is \"distinctive.\"\nEvery culture is distinct from others. Each culture has distinguishing characteristics that make it different from other cultures, uniquely special, and which allow its members to identify with other members of the same culture. This mutual identification brings coherence, stability, and a sense of belonging and community to the members of that culture.\nWhat is Culture? A culture is a shared set of values, beliefs, language, customs, social norms, music, history, behaviours and institutions. These give identity to and distinguish it from other cultures which have their own set of beliefs, languages, history, and social norms.\nWestern Culture Western culture is unique because it had a transformative period called the Enlightenment and the Age of Reason, which saw the end of the Dark Ages where religious beliefs predominated. The dark ages was a time of great mysticism, a belief that the church and the king should rule over everyone else. There was no scientific progress. Science was outlawed, and scientists were threatened and some were burned at the stake (Bruno, 1600).\nThe Renaissance and the Age of Reason ended the Dark Ages and initiated Western culture, which is based upon science, reason, logic, individual rights, production, trade, freedom of the individual, democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom from tyrannical governments.\nBritish Culture Within Western culture, we have a subdivision of British culture, which is unique. British culture champions democracy, invention, production, trade, the rule of law, and civilisation. It is in Northern England that the industrial revolution started, which has transformed the whole planet and has bought us the technology that we enjoyed today. It is notable that Britain is the birthplace of modern Parliamentary democracy, and massive advances in science, particularly medicine, physics, and chemistry engineering. Britain was the first country to outlaw slavery in 1803, and its navy traveled the world enforcing its laws against slavery. British culture has stood the test of time and has made unique contributions to the rest of the world.\nAttacks on British Culture Multiculturalism is an attack on western culture and on British culture. It dilutes all cultures by blending them. By integrating vast numbers of people from various cultures into the same location, the original culture that occupied that space is watered down, weakened, and replaced by a homogenous mixture, which represents no specific culture.\nLondon is a Prime Example The London of the 1960s was vibrant, distinctive, creative, and the cultural and economic centre of the world. Everyone knew what a Londoner was. Even into the 1980s, Londoners had a distinctive identity (remember Del Boy and Rodney?).\nBut now, true Londoners are scarce. If you visit London now, you won't find any distinctive culture. All cultures reside in London. Nowadays, \"Londoner\" simply denotes \"a person who lives in London.\" In fact, Khan, the mayor of London, said that a white face on a poster did not truly represent London.\nLondon has lost its cultural identity. It's become a multicultural, indistinct, unidentifiable melting pot.\nWhen a culture represents everything, it stands for nothing.\nCultures are distinct. Cultures require unique, distinctive traits to exist, and multiculturalism eradicates these distinguishing characteristics.\nThe Disease is Spreading And what’s happened in London is happening all across the UK at various rates of speed. In other words, multiculturalism has the potential to destroy British culture\nThis is happening, not by accident, but on purpose\nMulticulturalism's Global Purpose The intent behind the destruction of individual cultures is deliberate, driven by organisations like the WEF which have goals of a OneWorld government.\nTo establish this, the WEF seeks to dissolve individual nation-states by eroding their unique identities .\nWestern culture is dissolving! It is happening all across Europe, We see The French, Italian, German and British cultures are facing unprecedented attacks by ever increasing numbers of infiltration from people of other, non-western cultures. The effect of this is the degradation western culture, which is based upon the age of reason and the tradition of Greek science.\nCulture is Societal Glue Western Culture is the glue that binds us, together providing a common identity and shared values. It's the very fabric of western society, and multiculturalism tears at its foundations.\nAs multiculturalism grows, societal tensions escalate as various factions within societies clash.\nStop multiculturalism, We must resist multiculturalism and champion western culture and in particular our own British culture.\nAs a prime example of Western values, British culture is distinctive unique and worth saving for our children to inherit.\nDo you agree with this?

Enjoy!)\n“I wonder if anyone in this hall can recall a time when our country has been in such a dangerous place in peacetime.\nSome say that we've been here before.\nIn …\nBut something has changed.\nNo matter how bad things got in the 70s, those who ruled us, for the most part, shared our values and beliefs.\nThey believed in our way of life.\nMany Labour MPs had clawed their way out of the dockyards and coal mines where our grandfathers toiled. Many parliamentarians had fought through the worst storms of the world wars of the 20th century. But they shared a kinship and a love of our country, our culture, and our history.\nThose days are now long gone\ntraded instead for a lust for power and money\nStripped of values and purpose, MPs of both parties have been bought and sold. Loyal Conservative and Labour voters have been betrayed.\nThe institutions themselves are utterly broken.\nThey are busily trying to solve the problem they call democracy.\nThey want a world where unelected, unaccountable globalist institutions and power-hungry billionaires dictate our laws to us.\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is what every single one of us here is determined to stop.\nWe see rafts of legislation brought in without any debate or regard for what the people actually want or need.\nWe only have to look at the energy bill or the online safety bill for an ever-expanding scope of power, which tells us what we cannot say or do without fine, seizure, or jail, all under the pretext of morality.\nIt's time for Britain to wake up.\nIt's time for us to remind the British people who they really are because if we fail in this, then all else fails.\nAnd we start by telling the truth.\nIt's not about hope or wishful thinking.\nIt's about trusting ourselves, our values, our strengths, our history, and the ideas that have always built free, safe, healthy societies.\nWe know that no matter what, if we refer to these values, we can and will navigate our way through difficulties fairly, with a clear conscience, and effectively because we will take the right action.\nThese are the Reform UK values:\nfreedom, choice, and opportunity.\nWe, as a party, will protect your freedoms, the British people's fundamental rights and freedoms - personal, economic, or otherwise. They give us the moral fabric of a nation which our ancestors fought to defend. Because freedom cannot be given by the state, it is our birthright. We are free, and we will protect that.\nWe must remember that we have the ability to create whatever we need – be it communities, services, products, industries, or wealth.\nThere is always more, and we champion opportunities. With these values of freedom, choice, and opportunity, we don't expect people to merely conform. We motivate them to inspect, choose, and act.\nThis transition moves us from being mere consumers to creators of our own destiny.\nInstead of a foreboding future, we offer a positive vision of empowerment and encouragement, aiming to return and firmly establish the power in the hands of the British people.\nAnd this power will stay with them through to the elections, and once we are in government; Our mission is rooted in these three principles: freedom, choice, and opportunity.\nWe start by spreading this message. If you have any doubt, just look around this hall. As Richard highlighted earlier, at our conference two years ago, there were just over 300 of us. Now, there are over four times that number, with supporters clustered in and around London rallying behind Reform.\nToday, our words reach millions. Hearts and minds across the nation are, perhaps unknowingly, eagerly awaiting this message.\nTo the countless individuals beyond these walls: Join us.\nWe are the only choice now, and our momentum is rapidly accelerating.\nIn just two weeks, we face elections in Tamworth and Mid-Bedfordshire, with stellar candidates poised to represent us. We eagerly anticipate these elections, hopeful for landmark by-election results.\nAnd then, we march towards the general election, where we will field 600 candidates. For the first time in a generation, the British people will have the chance to cast their vote for a party that wholeheartedly believes in freedom, choice, opportunity, and the majesty of our great nation.\nThis is our mission, our solemn duty.\nAs we embark on this journey, let's do so with humility and gratitude. Hold onto this vision daily.\nDiscuss it, share it, and let it guide your responses to whatever actions this government takes next.\nRegardless of the narratives peddled by the media, lobbyists, or other governmental forces, we must stand steadfast in our convictions and values.\nLet's heed the words spoken not only by Margaret Thatcher but by many through the ages.\nLet us ensure our children will look back and rejoice, knowing we never abandoned the cause of freedom.\nIt's time to rise. By doing so, we will make Britain great again\nThank you\n(I hope you enjoyed this extract of Paul’s fantastic speech)\nPlease share it and please follow my Facebook page.\nChris, Farmer.\nReform Uk.\nGloucester.\n#ReformUk\n#Gloucester",

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_high-tax-rates-are-bad---heres-why/content_50.html": "High Tax Rates Are Bad - Here’s Why…\nTuesday, 03 October 2023\nHigh Tax Rates Are Bad - Here’s Why… Our beloved Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt told us to expect high taxes for the foreseeable future. Like all socialists, Jeremy Hunt is damaging the economy with high tax rates.\nRecord high taxes, UK taxes have soared to a 70 year high and is 37% of national income. There are many painful consequences associated to high taxes; consequences for the economy, the democratic processes, and for iindividual people and their families.\nPainful Consequences of High Taxes:\nEconomic: High taxes are a deterrent for businesses and individuals to work harder and longer.\nWith less disposable income, consumer spending dwindles.\nReduced spending lead directly to slower economic growth, often resulting in decreased job opportunities and a stagnant economy.\nDemocratic: In a democracy we assume that when people earn money, it belongs to them first, not to the government. When high taxes are imposed, it challenges this core principle, suggesting that the government owns all the money; merely allowing us to retain a decreasing portion. This leads to overreach in governmental authority, eroding the trust between citizens and politicians.\nWhen people feel their rightful earnings are being excessively taxed it reduces their faith in the political system and its legitimacy.\nPsychological: On a personal level, when people see a big portion of their hard-earned money being taken by the government, it causes feelings of helplessness and unfairness. Over time, this reduces motivation, leading to decreased productivity and poor mental, well-being.\nThat’s why high tax rates are bad.\nNow let’s look at the Benefits of Reduced Tax Rates.\nEconomic: With a reduction in tax rates, both businesses and individuals have more room to invest and spend. The increased spend stimulates the economy.\nIf people keep the money they earn, they are more likely to work harder and longer thus stimulating the economy.\nThis increased financial activity invigorated the economy, leading to more business enterprise inventions innovations, and job opportunities.\nPolitical: A reduced tax system restored public faith in governmental systems. When people feel that they're being taxed fairly they are more likely to participate in and support politicians.\nPsychological: Reduced taxation can lessen the psychological strain of feeling financially overburdened. With more money in their pockets people experience a boost in morale, confidence, and general optimism for the future.\nReform UK is a low tax rate party. We Change politics for Good. To ensure a prosperous future, it's imperative that we embark on a path to progressively reduce taxes, systematically, methodically and over time.\nLow taxes should be pursued tandem with improving the efficiency of public services.\nBy stimulating the economy through lower tax rates , we not only boost financial activity and wealth creation, but paradoxically, with an expanding economy, even at these lower tax rates, we can have increased tax revenues, benefiting both individuals and the public sector\nJeremy Hunt is a corporate socialist and works for the WEF.\nHe needs to go!\nIf you like this post, would you please share it to all your friends.

Fear is a motivator and politicians are interested in fear because they use it to control people.\nSo they create and sustain Fear narratives:\nThe Fear of CO2 A massive amount of effort and propaganda has gone into the development of a fear of carbon dioxide. CO2 is Planet Earths single most beneficial gas because it sustains all plant and animal life, including human life.\nIf you look outside your window, you'll see no CO2 induced climate catastrophe because there isn't one.\n￼But the relentless propaganda, which claims that the world is coming to an end and it's YOUR fault, drives fear into the minds of many. And when people are fearful, they can be made to PAY MORE; give up their heating, their car and their freedoms in order to \"stay safe” and “save the planet”\nFear of Viruses: Planet Earth is awash with bacteria, spores, and viruses. They are facts of life. And yet now, people are paranoid that they're going to catch a disease by walking through the streets. So we see people, even now, riding bicycles wearing a face mask. Fear has gripped them because of the relentless state-sponsored terror, where people became afraid to pick up their mail for fear of catching a disease. And when people are fearful, they will hand over their money and freedoms, so that they can \"stay safe” and “save the NHS“\nFear of the Labour Party: For decades, people have voted out of fear of the opposing party. People vote Labour because they are afraid the Tories will get in. People vote Conservative for fear that Labour will get in. People don't vote for Good parties; they vote AGAINST terrible parties.\nFear politics is bad politics.\nGood Politics is Positive: Politics should inspire people! Politicians should offer a clear, rational, and positive program for a better future.\nPolitics should NOT be about staying at home, losing freedoms, paying more “protection money” to the government and avoiding risk.\nPolitics should be about living a rich life; strong, prosperous, and free.\nPolitics is about perfecting society and giving people the FREEDOM to live their lives according to their own values, to create and sustain a wealth-creating enterprise economy, generate state-of-the-art public services, secure the borders, and to provide a framework where politicians enact the orders given to them by the people.\nTrue Politics Is Optimistic: We must provide the British people with an optimistic program to replace the fear merchants that we currently have in the House of Commons.\nChange Politics For Good The Reform UK slogan \"change politics for good\" is the best there is.\nWe must be more than a protest group. Reform UK must provide a viable, clear, rational, positive vision for Britain, not governed by fear, but by \"rational optimism.\"\nRational Optimism: It is a politics based upon fundamental principles:\n1.Freedom of choice. 2.Enterprise economy. 3.

There is at least one advantage in being the last speaker, and that is, I know that you're here to listen to me!\nSo, when Richard said to me, \"Ben, will you be our Brexit spokesman?\" I thought, aren't people sick of Brexit? And Richard said, \"No, the arguments need to be made”. People may have been exhausted by Brexit in the 2019 general election, but we paid a price for that exhaustion because we gave an 80-seat majority to someone who promised to deliver Brexit and didn’t\nAt its heart, what is Brexit? Brexit is the United Kingdom taking its rightful place among 168 other countries in the world that are not members of the EU.\nIt is not a remarkable situation; it is the default situation for a country NOT to be a member of the EU.\"\n“But we are constantly told, and it seems our political class has bought this and perpetuated the myth, that the United Kingdom cannot survive outside the European Union: That the other 168 countries that we have now joined must be in a dire state not being members of the EU.\nAnd we, as Brexiteers, have made one classic mistake. The mistake is this: We have allowed Remainers and Rejoiners to force us to justify Brexit.\nWe don't have to justify Brexit. Brexit is what it means to be the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. What Remainers and Rejoiners have to prove is that we should go back into the European Union. But they make no case for the EU; they just threaten and insult us, telling us that we are stupid for voting for an independent country.\nI will agree with one thing that they say, and that is that the country has been badly managed. But that's got absolutely nothing to do with Brexit. What that has got to do with is a parliamentary party, the Conservative Parliamentary Party, which has an 80-seat majority. And instead of jettisoning the socialist entity that is the European Union, it's cozied up to it. It didn't ditch the Social Chapter of the EU; it didn't inculcate aspiration. It hasinculcated dependency. It didn't deregulate and cut taxes for growth; it just perpetuated wealth distribution. It even gave up part of the country, which is perhaps the biggest act of constitutional self-harm any of us have ever witnessed in our lifetime.\"\nBut Brexit is blameless. Brexit cannot fail because Brexit is us governing ourselves.\nSure, the Tory Party can fail, but you know what I want to do something to the Tory Party, and we ARE going to do it.\nWe're going to take back control. How is it that we somehow accept the settled argument that French boats can come into our waters, take whatever fish they want, completely un policed, and dredge up the seabed, destroying the wildlife and eco-environment — perhaps the most sustainable resources this country has — and we just sit back and do nothing?\nYet when it comes to illegal migrants that they bring to us, we're not allowed to send them back to the French shores.\nThey can send their boats in, take our fish, but we cannot send back the illegal migrants?\nThe politicians have given up on this country, and Labour is just as bad as the Conservatives.\nIf you want change, ladies and gentlemen, you don't argue against Brexit. Brexit has enabled us to effect change, and that change has to come by evicting the Tories and Labour from the House of Commons.\"\n\"I do like Zoella Braveman. I think she speaks with a tremendous amount of sense. She made an incredibly brave speech as a member of the cabinet, but she stops short of taking action.\nShe has diagnosed the problem, and that in itself is a good start, but we now need a solution. What is the solution to border control? What do we have to do to control our borders? What we don't do is wait for them to come here, so we have all the legal difficulties of deporting them.\nBorder control is a physical process!\nDo you Remember when we used to have a navy which would protect the United Kingdom? This is, as Zoella Braveman said, an assault on our nation. But we haven't deployed the navy. The Border Force is a glorified taxi service. They should all be sacked.\nThe Lifeboat service, the RNLI, is going into French waters, picking up people who are perfectly safe, putting people on their boats — thus affording them instant protection under our law — and then bringing them back to our shores where they are promptly paid 50,000 pounds a year per head.\nThat equates to the 40 million pounds we paid last year on housing and caring for migrants, for the 100,000 illegal migrants who came to the UK.\nAnd the problem is only going to get worse. So until Zoella understands what needs to be done, this is going to go on.\nWe need border control, not deportation!…\n(End of excerpt)\nI hope you enjoyed that short extract from Ben Habib’s wonderful speech.

The UK government, is now using the law as a weapon to attack and undermine the individual rights and freedoms of citizens, and to impose a command-and-control society.\nWeaponised Law The law is being used as a weapon to limit choices, impose ideological measures, and criminalise acts which, under proper circumstances, would never be considered criminal.\nLegal war being waged on citizens The British government is acting in accordance with international agencies such as the WEF, United Nations, and World Health Organisation, who are busy constructing a legal framework designed to concentrate all wealth and power into the hands of a small minority at the expense of the vast majority of people.\nFree Society (?) The law is designed to protect freedoms, and the basic principle is we are free to do anything we please and live according to our own values and choices, provided that our actions do not violate the rights of other people.\nBut now, normal, everyday things are being criminalised. Governments are using the law - not to protect individual rights and freedoms - but rather to limit rights, freedoms, and create injustice.\nIt's an injustice that the law permits and encourages a mass invasion of illegal immigrants into the country from France.\nIt’s an injustice that a woman praying quietly outside an abortion clinic is arrested.\nIt’s an injustice that the police are being used to intimidate speakers like Laurence Fox into silence.\nIt’s an injustice that the government is going to criminalise failure to submit to NET ZERO legislation.\nIt’s an injustice that the government is in the process of surrendering law-making in the UK to the WHO under the amendments of the new pandemic treaty and international health regulations.\nIt’s an injustice that Northern Ireland has been ceded to the EU.\nIt’s an injustice that many of the European Union laws governing Britain are still in place, even though we have “left the EU”\nLawfare is Warfare The only power a government has is to crack down on lawbreakers. The government is in the process of making normal free living, a criminal offence.\nIt will soon be against the law to build a motor car driven by diesel or petrol.\nIt will soon be against the law to violate the conditions of the \"15-minute city\".\nIt will soon be against the law to eat more meat than your allocated quota.\nIt will soon be a criminal offence to write “misinformation“ which will be defined as “anything which contradicts the government narrative”.\nStep by step, law by law, they are boxing us into a draconian, statist, authoritarian dictatorship run from the top down.\nWake Up People! Slowly, systematically, steadily, step-by-step, a legislative framework has been constructed which is designed to limit our choices, take our money, freedoms, and future.\nThis is the Great Reset. It is being implemented by the UK government using the law as a weapon against its own people.\nWestminster MPs are Complicit The MP in Westminster Parliament are busy passing laws that are designed to destroy freedom in Britain. It is part of a larger legislative net which has been cast over the world and includes every country from Australia to Canada, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and beyond.\nReform vs. Reset We are at a crossroads.

Governments make choices for us and they impose them on us.\nNet Zero In 2019, Net zero was never on the election manifesto. During the last election, everyone was talking about Brexit: “Get Brexit done.”\nAfter the election, net zero was imposed upon us without any mandate, without any discussion, and without any choice!\nNet zero is a justification for:\n- Electric cars being imposed upon us by law.\n- The banning of diesel and petrol-driven vehicles by 2030, which will cause a complete collapse of the UK economy.\nCan you imagine the construction industry operating without diesel generators? It can’t be done.\nNet zero justifies pouring billions into wind turbines and other “ sustainable energy“ sources - which force up energy costs and increases the costs to industry which makes everything more expensive; thus impoverishing us all.\nThe only people who get richer with net zero are the energy companies ! The money for NetZero is coming out of the pockets of the poor!\n- ULEZ and 20 mph speed limits, which are another attack on our freedom to travel.\nNet zero is the justification for agricultural policies where farmers are required by law to take 20% of agricultural land out of food production. This will cause an increase in food prices and will make us poorer\nHate Speech Laws Hate speech laws are coercive because they shut down vocalised opposition to the government narrative.\nMandated Vaccines Although pandemic memories are fading, mandated vaccines are important coercive measures because the government is now signing up to the WHO pandemic treaty, which will empower the WHO to mandate vaccines. Another coercive act.\nOutlaw Smoking Rishi Sunak's policy to outlaw smoking is another example of the coercive nature of government. I’m not a big believer in smoking, but I am a big believer that Sunak does not have the right to stop smoking if you want to.\nMilitary Conscription Military conscription is Rishi Sunak's latest abomination and overreach, meaning that they can literally take your children, give them a rifle, and send them into battle.\nNot by choice, but by law.\nMany argue that military service is good for young people. Maybe it is. But it should be done voluntarily, not by force of government.\nGovernment Coercive Force The purpose of a government is to protect us from coercive force, not to become the agency of coercive force.\nLabour Socialist Ideology If you think life is bad under the Tories, it will get infinitely worse under Labour, who are overtly statist.\nWhen state officials rule over us and control every aspect of our lives, then we are no longer living in a free country.\nFreedom First Freedom is the single most important concept in politics.\nMany people have died to preserve our freedom, and now we are in danger of signing over our freedoms to a globalist ideology implemented by the Conservative and Labour parties here in the UK.\nFight for Your Freedom In the coming weeks, we must fight for our freedom. Reform is the only party that is standing on the side of the individual versus the state.\nVote for Reform UK\nVote for me, Chris Farmer, Gloucester, #ReformUK Reform UK.",

So – why bother?\nValue your vote. I tell people that we must put more value on our vote because if we each abandon the struggle against the forces ranged against us, then we will lose by default.\nThere are literally tens of millions of people in the country who are desperate for change and yet are dispersed in small pockets, each thinking they are on their own and in the tiny minority.\nAll that needs to happen for a political revolution to occur is for all the individuals and couples, who sit at home worrying for the future and hoping that someone will come to save us, must realise that we are our own saviours.\nWe can save ourselves simply by voting.\nIf the millions who make up “the silent majority” gained the courage and the imagination to put their vote where their mouth is- then we could see a tsunami of change in favour of Reform UK, sufficient to obliterate the corrupted political establishment.\nValue your vote. We must encourage everyone who is unhappy with the current direction of the country to value their vote, and to put their cross next to the Reform candidates in their area.\nThat is all that is required to change politics for good and Save Britain.\nMinority groups stand together. It is an interesting contrast to note that Palestinians and other minority groups are much better than the native British at coordinating their supporters to take action.\nLondon protests. The huge numbers of Palestinian supporters, who take action and protest on the streets of London every week, show how a coordinated response has amazing political power.\nWords into action. If all the people who say they are unhappy about the direction of the country would take those words and turn them into simple actions, such as voting for the Reform party at the next election and helping us to campaign and encourage others to do the same, then we will see a tsunami of change.\nLet’s encourage our supporters to put more value on their vote and to become more confident that their voice really does count.\nLet us go forward together!\nPlease leave a comment\nChris Farmer #ReformUK #gloucester",

Whenever in debate with others, it's vital to listen carefully to the form of the question they're asking and to challenge the assumptions inherent within it.\nFor example, consider the question, “What gender do you identify as?\"\nThis question presumes that gender is fluid and can be chosen.\nHowever, in reality, gender is an inherent part of nature – just as intrinsic as height or eye color. It's a genetic trait, not subject to personal whim. Just as we can't change eye color or height with a mere wish, we can't simply wish away gender.\nThe idea that genetic traits and natural facts can be negated by individual or group wish or desire is prevalent today.\nBut facts are facts. The truth is that reality exists objectively. Facts stand whether or not we like them, accept them, or want them.\nReality is an objective absolute, It is not swayed by a person's whims, desires, hopes, wishes, or fears.\nThe primary role of the human mind is to identify facts as they truly are, not to invent them. Failing to recognise the truths of reality results in confused minds and upset emotions\nPerception Is Not Reality. Often, we hear politicians use the phrase. “perception is reality.\" This is not true! Perception is perception. Reality is reality - it stands independently.\nIt's possible to misperceive reality, to mistakenly see something that isn't there, or to overlook what is.\nPrimary purpose, The primary purpose of the human mind is to perceive reality as it really is. If it fails , it's not fulfilling its primary purpose.\nGender is an objective fact of biological reality. Those who try to override the truths of their biological inheritance by claiming they disagree with these facts or wish them to be different are fighting a losing battle.\nRejecting reality can only lead to confusion, mistakes, and mental distress.\nReality Is Real. We need a reality-based nation, one that forgoes fantasies that facts can be rewritten to our liking and that reality bends to our emotions.\nRejecting facts results in chaos. It's frequently said we live in a mad world, with politicians and universities losing touch with reality. This sentiment is true; especially when these institutions promote the notion that perception equates to reality and that we can dream up our own gender identities\nLet's Return to Common Sense. Common sense begins with the understanding that reality is consistent and facts don't change merely because we disagree with them.\nWe should identify facts, evaluate them rationally, and act accordingly.\nThis isn't a novel concept.\nCommon sense has been our guide for 3 million years.\nThe current \"woke\" culture is detached from this rationality. It's time to abandon such thinking and return to commonsense politics.\nChris Farmer. Reform Uk,\nPlease share and follow my Facebook. Thank you.\n#ReformUK #Gloucester",

The Conservatives crushed the economy with the following terrible policies:\n- Overspending The Glolden Rule of sound economics is “Spend Less than you earn, and invest the difference.” The Conservatives do the exact opposite: “Spend MORE than you earn and BORROW the difference.”\nWhenever government consistently spends more than it earns, it inevitably goes bankrupt.\nThe government has been consistently spending more than it “earned” and it wastes the money on funding foreign wars and on housing thousands of illegal immigrants in hotels and rented accommodation.\nMeanwhile, the economy burns.\nOver Borrowing As already noted, the government borrows massively. The government debt is now 98% of GDP, which incurs horrendous interest payments on government debts, which is money that cannot be spent on public services. It is expensive to be in debt! And the British government is in debt up to its eyeballs.\nOvertaxing In order to pay for its overspending and overborrowing, the government overtaxes the people.\nPoliticians like to take your money and spend it for you because they believe that your money is theirs.\nWe arevtaxed at the highest rates since World War II. When the government takes money out of people's pockets, they have less money to spend, and it robs them of their freedom to choose how to spend their own money. With less in people's pockets, the economy suffers,\nAnd people are impoverished.\n- Quantitative Easing In order to fund the excessive spending, the government “prints money” in the form of quantitative easing. Quantitative easing is the creation of money “ex nihilo,” which means “out of nothing.” But nothing can come from nothing, and so the value of the extra money being printed is stolen from the value of your savings.\nFor every additional pound printed, the value of the existing cash in the economy is reduced, so it loses its buying power, which we perceive as inflation.\nSo, government policy creates inflation, which impoverishes us all.\n- Net Zero And the biggest blunder that this incompetent government has made is to sign us up for net zero, which increases the cost of energy production.\nAnd since everything in the economy requires energy to produce or move, when energy becomes expensive, everything becomes expensive. Net Zero increases the cost of production, increases the cost of transportation, which destroys the chances of growth in the economy.\nSo consequently, we see no growth, and we are now in a recession. A recession which has been created wholly by government policy.\nHow to Save Britain. In order to solve a problem, we must identify its causes and remove them. So, in order to grow the economy, we reverse government policy and put in their opposites.\nReform UK will correct the errors and replace them with good economic habits.\nControl government spending The government must live within its economic means.\nStop overborrowing Borrowing increases costs which will be paid for by our children.

The new battle is for freedom against the corporate and political establishment. The recent fights that Farage has had with Coutts Bank illustrate that the corporate, political elites' new world order is based upon stifling freedom, controlling thought, and making false claims. Most major politicians are committed to the globalist concept; A one-world view headed by a one-world government. Their weapons of choice are fear, fraud, threat, lies and coercion. Modern politicians do not offer us visions of a strong, prosperous, and free society. Modern politicians offer us only threats and predictions of the end of the world. According to them, we must agree to surrender our money and our freedoms to the ruling elites, for only they are wise enough to save the planet, that we (you and me) are killing with our cars- whilst they fly in private jets. Politics shouldn’t be this way. True and good politics offers people a promise of an optimistic vision for a better future; a future where we are all strong, prosperous, and free. Proper politics is not based upon fear, founded on fake computer simulations, threats, and coercion. Proper politics is based upon reason, freedom, enterprise, and integrity. Have you noticed that reason and logic have been attacked over the last few years? Reason has been replaced with blatant irrationalism and negative emotions Have you noticed how freedom has been attacked? It has been replaced by lockdowns, mandates, and coercive threats. Have you noticed that integrity has been completely lacking in British politics? It’s been replaced by lies, distortions, and false claims It’s time to stop the rot. It’s time to vote for a party that believes in traditional British values: Freedom; Enterprise and Integrity The time to vote for a party who will make us all feel we are strong, prosperous, and free. This is what I believe in, and I hope you do too. If you do , please join me and vote for Reform UK Gloucester\n#thereformparty #coutts #NigelFarage #Brexit #gloucester",

( I.e Tax and Spend)\nOur approach focuses on empowering people and businesses to create NEW wealth, which in turn benefits society as a whole.\nHere are our 13 key policies aimed at generating growth economy:\nSupporting Young Entrepreneurs: Simplify the process of starting businesses and provide tax incentives for young entrepreneurs. This encourages innovation and new business ventures, driving economic growth from the ground up.\nTax Reforms to Make Work Pay: Lift the income tax starting threshold to £20,000 per year, ensuring that work is financially rewarding and reducing dependency on benefits. This policy will save each worker £1,500 annually and motivate more individuals to enter and remain in the workforce.\nEncouraging Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): Create SME Enterprise Zones in left-behind areas with a period of zero tax for new or existing businesses that are creating jobs. This policy will stimulate local economies and create job opportunities.\nCutting Red Tape Reform the planning system to fast-track development on brownfield sites and boost businesses, especially in coastal and northern regions. This will streamline processes and reduce unnecessary barriers to business growth. Abolishing Counterproductive Regulations:\n5.Abolish IR35 rules that hinder sole traders and contractors, allowing them to work more flexibly and efficiently. Simplifying the tax system to reduce burdens on businesses will further stimulate economic activity. Investing in Technical Skills and Education:\nIncrease help for technical courses and apprenticeships, ensuring young people gain PRACTICAL skills that are in economic demand. This will create a skilled workforce ready to contribute to a growing economy.\nAddressing Social Issues Through Economic Growth Reform UK is committed to addressing the underlying causes of social issues by fostering economic growth and creating wealth generation for all\nEnhancing Pension Security: Maintain the triple lock on pensions to protect the financial security of our older population, ensuring that pensions increase annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings, or a minimum of 2.5%.\nProtecting Women's Rights: Stand firmly against ideologies that undermine women’s rights and ensure safe spaces for women in shelters, prisons, and changing rooms. This policy promotes safety and equality in all public and private spaces.\n10 Scrapping Net Zero Policies: Remove costly Net Zero policies that increase energy bills and stifle economic growth. Instead, focus on practical, cost-effective environmental measures that do not burden households and businesses. Cutting Government Waste:\nImplement strict measures to reduce government waste, saving billions of pounds annually. These savings will be redirected to essential services and tax reductions, boosting the economy. Promoting Free Markets and Innovation:\nEncourage competition and innovation by reducing unnecessary regulations and supporting free-enterprise principles.\nChris Farmer Parliamentary Candidate, Reform UK",

Politics is not about left and right - it’s about right and wrong.\nWrong Track Who can deny that we have been on the wrong track for many years? The politicians have led this country to the brink of disaster because the legacy parties -Conservative Labour LibDem and Greens - have all been corrupted by big money from corporations; big Banks, big Tech, big Pharma.\nThey do not work for us; they work for global corporations. All of their policies are designed to take money from the pockets of the poor and give it to the already rich.\nNeed for Change We need to get decent people into the House of Commons.\nPeople who believe in the following fundamental truths:\n- Protection of Individual Freedoms and Rights\nThe primary purpose of any government is the protection of individual freedoms. We should be free from coercion. And when the government itself becomes the coercive agent, then we know that democracy is dying.\n- Free Enterprise Economy\nThe economy is built upon millions of small and medium-sized businesses; family businesses, local businesses that provide the community with products, services, and employment, and is the bedrock of society.\nWe should support small and medium-sized businesses and encourage their growth.\nThe current politicians do not care about small and medium-sized businesses because they have long been bought and paid for by global corporations. Indeed, the current politicians have done everything they can to destroy small and medium-sized businesses with high taxes, massive regulations, and lockdowns.\nThe aim is to transfer wealth to the multinational companies and to destroy their future competition.\nWe must promote and build the economy by developing millions of new small and medium-sized family businesses.\nThat means lower taxes, fewer regulations, and lots of support and encouragement for people to start their own businesses.\n- Brilliant Public Services Only within the context of a wealth-creating enterprise economy can we afford brilliant public services.\nWe have public services, but no one would say they are brilliant.\nWe spend £179 billion on the NHS, and yet we still can’t get to see a doctor and have to wait for an operation. Public services are expensive and bloated, snd inefficient They need to be more efficient so that when good money goes in, - good services come out.\n- Secure Sovereign Borders All countries have borders and those borders have to be defended. At the moment, our borders are undefended, and we have many thousands of people entering illegally; we have even more people entering legally.\nLast year, we had 1.2 million people enter the country, which is greater than the size of Bristol.\nIn order to cater to this number of people, we would have to build a Bristol every year.\nWe know that’s not going to happen, so where do the people go?\nThey go into the existing system and crush it. If there is an unlimited demand upon a limited resource, then that resource is crushed.\nNHS is being crushed by over-demand. The housing system is crushed. The education system is crushed. The road system is crushed, all because we are accepting too many people into the country too quickly.\nWe must immediately stop illegal immigration because it’s illegal.\nAnd we must limit legal immigration to manageable numbers.\nThe alternative is the collapse of public services.\n- Sovereign Nation Britain is an independent, free, sovereign nation. It does not need to take orders from the European Union, from the World Bank, from the United Nations, the WHO, and especially the WEF.\nThe World Economic Forum is a group of global corporations who have worked to pervert governments across the world, including our own, to transfer wealth from the pockets of the poor to the hands of the rich. The methods they use include the levers of government and perverted science in order to justify the fraud.\nBut Britain is a free, independent nation and should not have any association with globalist organisations such as the WEF, WHO, UN, or EU.\nLet’s Build a Better Future! If we implement the above five principles, then we will become a nation - strong, prosperous, and free.\nMost people do not feel strong prosperous or free because they have been betrayed by the legacy parties: Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, and Greens.\nIf you want to save your country, yourself, your family and your future, then vote for us.\nReform UK\nThank you Chris Farmer",

Politicians work based on orders given to them by the people.\nUK Government Now takes Its Orders From the WEF, the EU, and the WHO. Politicians have betrayed us because they no longer take their orders from the British people, but instead, they take their orders from entities such as the WEF, whose desire is to concentrate power and money into their hands.\nThe World Economic Forum It is a startling fact that Rishi Sunak,Keir Starmer, Sadiq Khan, King Charles are all committed members of the WEF. King Charles was the spokesperson for the WEF, he presented the \"Great Reset\" video where he personally endorsed the aspirations of Herr Klaus Schwarb\nThey Cannot Serve Two Masters If the Prime Minister, leader of the opposition, mayor of London, and the king are all serving the interests of the WEF, by definition, they are not serving the interests of the British people.\nThe WEF's agenda includes Net Zero, which is resulting in the progressive impoverishment of the British people and the collapse of the British economy.\nThe Whole House of Commons Not only are the heads of government supporters of the WEF, but all the evidence suggests that so are the vast majority of the House of Commons. They either agree with the WEF, or they are too passive and they do nothing to stop this nightmare agenda from playing out before our eyes.\nIt’s Time for Reform We need to reform the House of Commons. We need to reform the civil service and the BBC, all of whom are supportive of the WEF's catastrophic plans.\nThe People Must Take Back Their Power In the next general election, people have the opportunity to take back their power from the current crop of MPs. We must replace them with a new set of politicians who believe that the people are sovereign and the government should work for the British people.\nLast Chance Saloon The next election is our last chance to save the situation. The infiltration into our political systems is almost complete, and next year’s election will be the last chance the British people have to save our democracy.\nVote for Reform UK It’s not enough to NOT vote. Not voting empowers our enemies.\nWe must vote positively FOR Reform UK because it is only Reform UK that has explicitly ruled out any relationship with the WEF, European Union, and WHO.\nLet’s Change Politics for Good We’ve got one year to turn this around.\nPlease get out into the streets and make some noise.\nIf you happen to be near Gloucester city tomorrow, please join me at Gloucester cross 11 am.\nWould you please follow my Facebook and share this post to all your friends?\nThank you.

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_climate-science-is-climate-mythology/content_24.html": "Climate \"Science\" is Climate Mythology.\nTuesday, 25 July 2023\nI believe that the theory of climate change is the secularisation of Original Sin. It says that; to be human is to be bad, according to the climate lobby. That’s the first thing I’d like to say. The second thing is that the whole idea that CO2 drives climate is false. It is an example of the Single Cause Fallacy The single cause fallacy is to take a complex problem and reduce it down to a single cause. We know that the climate is a multifaceted agency and it’s not driven by CO2. It is driven by factors far more powerful than CO2, including the 11-year sunspot cycle. The fact that the moon's orbit is not circular but elliptical, so the gravitational pull at the liquid oceans affects the ocean currents. There are 12 major ocean currents. They are driving climate change, not CO2. The Coriolis effect, which is the fact that the earth is a globe spinning on its axis, causing turbulence in the oceans - that is the cause of climate change: not CO2 Volcanic activity - that is the cause of climate change. And the Earth is a nuclear reactor. The Earth’s mantel has uranium which generates massive heat, enough to heat the planet and turn solid rock into molten lava. That is the cause of climate change not CO2. CO2 may be a cause of climate change but it’s a minor cause of climate change, and the HUMAN part of that CO2 is a minor part of the whole; So to take the activities of human beings and claim that Human activity the cause of the so-called climate change catastrophe is an absolute travesty of science. It’s not climate science - it’s climate mythology. And the last thing I’d like to say is that there was a strategic change from the term “global warming” to the term “climate change”. That is NOT accidental. The climate change” concept is not a scientific concept because it does not make predictions. Climate change is such a broad concept it encompasses everything that happens. If it’s hotter, it’s climate change. If it’s colder, it’s climate change. If it’s wetter, it’s climate change. If it’s drier, it’s climate change. It makes NO predictions and therefore is not a scientific hypothesis. It is - what proper scientists call - a “void hypothesis.” In order to be scientific, a hypothesis has to be able to make predictions which may be tested against experience. The term “global warming” DOES make predictions and it has FAILED every prediction it has made. They cannot get their \"global warming\" concept to work, so they reduced it down to “climate change” which denotes nothing specific, and so is not a true scientific concept So on all these measures, we can say that the climate change concept is false.

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_electric-cars-are-not-green/content_80.html": "Electric Cars Are Not “Green”\nMonday, 02 October 2023\nElectric Cars Are Not “Green” The Governments push towards electric vehicles under the banner of net zero is wrong-headed because electric cars are not “Green”.\nHere's why:\nElectric Cars Depend on Power Stations: Electric cars run on electricity. This electricity doesn't just come out of thin air; it's generated in power stations.\nMost Power Stations Use Hydrocarbons or Nuclear: When we think of electric vehicles, we're told they are green and clean. However, the reality is their energy comes from power stations that rely on gas, oil, or nuclear energy. Burning gas and oil to power EVs releases carbon dioxide, the very gas EVs claim to avoid.\nEnergy Transfer Creates Energy Loss: Transmitting energy from power stations to EVs over long distances is hugely inefficient. Due to entropy, a principle in physics, whenever energy is moved from one place to another, much of it is lost. This means we're using more raw energy at the source to get a smaller amount of usable electricity to the car.\nElectric cars are inefficient because they're much heavier Due to their substantial batteries, EVs generally weigh more than standard vehicles . Given that force is a product of mass and acceleration, a heavier vehicle will require more energy to move. If we compare a 100-mile drive in a standard car to the same distance in an EV, the energy needed for the EV is much higher!\nEVs Use More Hydrocarbons than Internal Combustion Engines: If an heavier electric car uses more electricity from a coal, oil, or gas power plant, it cannot be considered “green”\nEVs are bad for the environment Just because something is branded good for the environment doesn't mean it is. The arguments for electric vehicles are false.\nModern cars powered by internal combustion engines are clean, safe, efficient, and proven to work. Standard engines are better for the environment than EVs\nThank you\nIf you like this post, please share with your friends and Follow my Facebook, The more the merrier!\nChris, Farmer.

Net zero forces everybody to pay many times more for their energy than they did a few years ago And since everybody needs energy to heat their homes, cook their food, make anything or transport it, then an attack on energy is an attack on our lifestyles.\nYour money has been siphoned off and fed to the energy suppliers and their “renewable energy” sibling industries, such as wind turbines, solar panels, and heat pumps - a multi-billion-pound industry based on lies and financed off the back of the working classes, middle classes, and business classes.\nNet zero is the single most effective wealth transfer tool ever created by the elite to enrich the wealthy at the expense of the poor.\n- Higher Taxes￼ The government has increased taxes so that we are now paying more tax than ever before in our lifetimes.\nWhenever the government wants to extend its power, it does so by putting its hand in your pocket and taking your money\nYou do not have any choice as to how it is spent, and instead politicians decide which of their friends in big business they will give your money to. Could be the pharmaceuticals, the banks, oil companies, or foreign governments in Ukraine and other places.\n- Mass Immigration of Cheap Labour One way to impoverish the British people is to depress their wages by importing thousands of workers, who will reduce the hourly rate of the working classes.\nSo long as the corporations can make better profits by reducing wages by means of imported labour, Sunak will continue to allow infinite numbers of people into the country, either legally or illegally, in order to keep his Paymasters happy.\n- Lies Lies and More Lies\nSo no matter how many times Sunak says he will “stop the boats,” we know that he will do it.\nIt’s just not on his agenda!\nThe Rich Get Richer Under the WEF Corporate world government plan, being implemented by British politicians, both in the House of Commons and in every council around the country, the continuing attack on our standard of living and the transference of money from the poor to the rich continues unabated.\nWEF Stooge Starmer And it will continue under Keir Starmer’s Labour Party, who have also been infiltrated by the WEF with Keir Starmer, being a self-confessed fan of the Davos club.\nHow to Defeat Our Enemies The way we defeat our political enemies is to vote them out of the House of Commons and to replace them with people who believe in Great Britain.\nReform UK Believes in Great Britain We believe that Britain is a sovereign nation and that politicians are public servants and agents of the British people, not of the globalist corporations; WEF; UN; EU; WHO; World Bank; corporate world government.\nGame On As the public slowly wakes up to the catastrophe that is befalling our nation as a result of trusting our corrupted politicians, we see Reform UK is rising in the polls and by the time we get to the general election later this year, the time will be ripe for a revolutionary change in British politics.\nReform UK MPs will transform the political landscape.\nPeople First Reform UK will put the people of the UK first and the interest of corporate globalists last.\nWe Will Take Back What We Have Lost\nIf you agree with this message, please let me know.\nPlease leave a comment What do you think of Sunak and his plan?\nThank you\nChris Farmer #ReformUK",

Reform UK does not agree ￼with high taxes Here’s why;\nHigh Tax Rates Reduces Disposable Income When taxes increase, individuals have less money left after paying taxes. This means less spending on goods, services, and investments, all of which hurts economic growth.\nDiscourages Investment Higher taxes on capital gains and dividends deter individual and institutional investors from investing. A decline in investment slows economic expansion and innovation.\nStifles Business Growth Elevated corporate taxes eat into a company's profits, leaving less for reinvestment or expansion. This hinders job creation and technological advancement.\nDecreases Consumer Spending With higher personal taxes, consumers cut back on spending, impacting businesses, especially those in the retail and service sectors.\nReduces Global Competitiveness Countries with lower taxes attract more foreign businesses and investments. Higher taxes deter investors making UK country less competitive on the global stage,\nInefficient Government Spending A larger tax revenue doesn't translate to efficient spending. The government wastes Billions !\nDiminishes Work Incentive If the majority of an individual's additional earnings from working harder or longer goes to taxes, they feel less motivated to put in the extra effort.\nCreates Uncertainty in the Market Talk of potential tax hikes lead to uncertainty among investors and businesses. Uncertainty stifles growth as people delay or reduce spending and investment.\nHinders Entrepreneurship Starting a new business is risky. Higher taxes reduce potential returns, discouraging budding entrepreneurs from pursuing innovative ideas or starting new businesses.\nWhile taxes are needed for funding public services, excessive tax rates have many negative effects on the economy, from individual spending habits to large-scale business operations.\nThat’s why Reform Uk advocates lower tax rates.\nIf you agree, please let me know.

In difficult times, the British would say, “Keep calm and carry on.” This mental toughness and endurance is what made Britain great.\nWoke Weakens Britain Woke culture is designed to weaken nations. In order to control populations you must first weaken them. It's hard to control a nation if the individuals comprising it feel strong, independent, educated, confident, and free. It's easier to destroy a nation if you can make each individual feel weak, uncertain, confused, and isolated.\nWoke culture weakens us in the following ways:\nWoke Weakens Masculinity Woke culture dislikes strong men. It attacks men with the concept of “toxic masculinity.” All the attributes associated with the male hero are derided as toxic. This critique of men's strength is purposeful and is designed to weaken them.\nWoke Dislikes Femininity Woke culture hates feminine women. Woke encourages men to dress as women, claim they are women, and enter women’s spaces such as changing rooms, toilets, and sporting events, thereby undermining women’s safe spaces and chances for success on the sporting field.\nWoke hates the Nuclear Family All societies are based on the traditional nuclear family of man + woman = children.\nWoke culture is revising the concept of the nuclear family and replacing it with “diversity,” in which a family could be any combination of individuals, regardless of gender or childbearing.\nWoke Culture Destroys Education Woke culture has reached a point where even intelligent people are confused about basic concepts like \"what is a woman.\"\nWoke culture weakens language, and since knowledge is conveyed through language, when words lose their meaning, it becomes impossible, to understand or gain knowledge. The muddling of key terms such as \"man,\" \"woman,\" \"vaccine,\" \"fair,\" and \"free\" disrupts clear thinking.\nWoke's destruction of language and free speech is part of a broader strategy. It's designed to sow confusion and make even the most intelligent people confused about the basics!\nWoke destroys public services It's reported that men in the East Midlands Ambulance Service can now receive a year off for their menopause-related issues. As men get older, their testosterone levels inevitably drop. This is a fact of life and a part of aging. However, woke culture allows men a year off on full pay to deal with menopausal symptoms.\nWhat Happened to 'Keep Calm and Carry On'?\nWoke culture is chipping away at the nation's cultural strength. Woke critiques masculinity, undermines femininity, undermines the nuclear family. And it is destroying our public services\nThis isn't accidental. It's an attack on Western culture, including Great Britain.\nWe Must Be Strong, Confident and Free! The people of Britain are strong, confident, and free, and we reject woke culture.\nWe want strong men, women, families and services. The way to achieve this is to reject woke.\nIf you agree with me, please let me know\nChris Farmer. Reform UK Gloucester\n#ReformUK #Gloucester",

If you want me to, later, I will (see the bottem if this post)\nIncreases in atmospheric CO2 do not cause global warming.\nThe reverse is true.\nWarming increases atmospheric CO2: because the oceans are enormous CO2 sinks, and when the oceans are warmed by the sun and the nuclear earths internal heat the oceans release their dissolved CO2 into the atmosphere.\nExactly as if you shook a bottle of fizzy water; it would release its dissolved CO2 into the atmosphere above the water.\nHeat is molecular agitation of the water molecules. When the Sun and earth heats oceans, the agitated water molecules throw out the dissolved carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\nSo there REALY IS a strong correlation between temperature and CO2, but the greens reverse the cause-and-effect relationship and get it wrong.\nGlobal warming CAUSES increased CO2 in the atmosphere.\nIt is not caused by CO2.\nAnd global warming is caused by multiple factors other than CO2.\nAn additional note, Of all the CO2 in the atmosphere, when added together, 33 out of 34 molecules are natural ( Non Human ) in origin.\nThe whole “CO2 causes global warming, which causes the end of the world” narrative is False.\nIt is fake science, motivated by a basic human desire to gain money and power.\nULEZ it’s not there to save the planet is there to make money.\nBuying and selling of carbon-credits is not there to save the planet; it is there to make money.\nCarbon credits is a multibillion dollar industry based upon the fiction that carbon dioxide is destroying the planet.\nThe reality is ; Carbon dioxide is the single, most important life-giving gas on planet Earth\nAll agencies which promote the climate catastrophe narrative earn their money, only in the presence of the climate catastrophe narrative !\nThey make billions of pounds profit from telling false narratives, twisting the evidence, and reversing cause-and-effect.\nScience has long abandoned its search for truth and replaced it with a search for cash.\n( This is not only true of “climate science“ but also of many other sciences too)\nAll through history, we know that people lie for money.\nMany climate scientists are in business to make money, and the way they do that is to sell climate catastrophe narratives to a scientifically uneducated population who are all too easily fooled into believing scary science fiction stories.\nIt takes only a little bit of research and a critical mind to see through the gaping gaps and the blatant contradictions of the greens, who tell us that we should reduce our “carbon footprint” while they themselves live lifestyles of the rich and famous!\nWhenever you see people acting in ways which blatantly contradict their stated beliefs - then you know that something fishy is going on.\nAll the greens, who spend their time telling us not to use carbon dioxide (which is the Earth's most vital gas for life), spend their time burning hhydrocarbon fuel by the ton.\nOn every level, climate science is fraudulent and easily disassembled.\nThat is my argument.\nIf you agree, please let me know.\nPlease share and follow my Facebook.\nChris Farmer.\nReform Uk.\nGloucester\n#gloucester #ReformParty #StopUlez\nAdditional notes\nFactors of climate change:\n- The Sun's enormous Energy: The SUN is main power source for our weather and climate.\n- Earth's Tilt & Path: Why we have seasons and ice ages.\n- Volcanoes: Big eruptions can cool the Earth by blocking out sunlight.\n- Ocean currents: They spread heat around and shape local weathers.\n- Water Vapor: A natural gas in the air that helps decide temperature.\n- Earth's Reflection: How much sunlight our Earth bounces back into space.\n- Natural CO2: Released from things like plants decaying or oceans.\n- Dust and Tiny Particles: Floating in the air, they can either cool or warm the Earth.\n- Clouds: They can trap heat or keep us cool, based on their type.\n- Natural seasonal Patterns:\n- Obviously The Four Seasons, or a cause of climate change.\n- Methane: A natural gas from places like swamps.\n- The Coriolis effect. Which describes the swirling of the atmosphere, and the oceans caused by the Earth spinning on its axis.\n- Nature's Land Shifts: Forests growing or natural soil changes.\n- Gravitational effects of the Moon we all know, the moon creates the tides and oceans, and even the rocks under our feet.\n- And nuclear energy. The Earth contains uranium, which continuously pours out billions of watts of heat sufficient to melt the rocks. The centre of the Earth is hotter the Sun!\n- Where do you think that heat goes?

Reform has a plan to Save Britain Reform UK Will Cut Taxes Reducing tax rates will motivate people to work harder because they keep more of their own money. Cutting tax rates increases tax revenue because with lower tax rates the economic pie grows bigger. We can't tax our way out of trouble. We must grow our way out of trouble. Lower tax rates, are the first step on the journey to Great Britain. Unleash Real Economic Growth We will raise the minimum tax threshold to £20,000. Reform UK will make work pay by allowing those at the lower end of the pay scale to keep more of their money. This incentivise work and stimulates economy. Scrap VAT on Energy Cheap energy is the key to improving people's lifestyles because everything depends on energy. When energy is expensive, everything is expensive. When energy is cheaper, life improves for everyone. Scrapping VAT on energy provides a tremendous boost to peoples lifestyle. Lower Fuel Duty by 20p per Litre Making fuel cheaper reduces transportation costs, which in turn makes everything cheaper because every product needs to reach the shops. Lowering transportation costs brings down the price of everything. Reform Will Help small, medium-sized businesses Exempting 1.2 million small and medium-sized businesses from Corporation Tax will stimulate the growth of thousands of these in wealth creating community businesses.

In particular, there are three ideologies that have made their way into our schools which have a devastating effect on young minds. These are:\n- Transgender ideologies,\n- Critical race theory, and\n- End of the world, climate catastrophe narratives. Transgender ideology is probably the most dangerous. It tells young children that the Natural Law can be overwritten by a person's thought process or arbitrary feelings; i.e., the facts of their genetics can be overridden by how they feel on a particular day. This ideology suggests that it is possible to bend Natural Law to one's will, and facts can be erased merely by a feeling. This is not rational and will do untold damage to children’s psychological , and intellectual development. If an adult person truly is transgender, and wants to “Transition” then that decision is made with a full understanding of its full meaning and consequences, which is impossible for children as young as 6 to 10 years of age. So, introducing transgender ideology to young children’s minds is worse than useless. It is dangerous. Critical (Racist) Theory is another dangerous ideology and it’s being taught in our schools. It states that racism is inherent in the minds of white people, which is itself a racist statement. It is impossible to correctly associate a personality trait with a person's skin colour. To allocate personality traits to certain skin colours is the essence of racism. And critical race theory is the systematisation of racist ideology in the classroom. This is extremely dangerous And the third ideology is the 'End of the world' climate crisis” narrative, which tells children that the world will come to an end within the next 20 to 30 years due to human activity. There are many children who are suffering from anxiety and worry because they honestly believe that theirs is the last generation which will be on this planet. In fact, I know many adults who believe the same thing, they’re petrified that the end of the world is nigh! The world is 4.5 billion years old and it will not stop in the next 20 years. End of the world' climate catastrophe narrative is another falsehood being foisted on our young children. School is no place for these political, economic, and social ideologies. School is a place for education, which means English, mathematics, history, science, and critical reasoning. We need to teach our children HOW to think, not WHAT to think. We need to teach our children critical reasoning so that they can discern -for themselves - truth from falsehood. The purpose of teaching is not to tell children that they can change their gender on a whim, or that racism is inevitable, or that the end of the world is nigh. We need to Reform Uk education so that they provide our children with firm foundational knowledge, not political social ideologies.

Labour will be worse than the Conservatives, and only Reform UK truly represents the working, middle, and professional classes.\nLabour does not represent the working classes. Conservatives do not represent the business classes. Only Reform UK represents both the working and business classes.\nHere is a quick rundown of how Reform UK will save Britain:\n- Stop Mass Immigration\nMass immigration has increased the population by over 2 million people in two years. This influx has broken public services, overwhelmed health services, crushed housing stock, and strained the education system. Only Reform UK will stop mass immigration. The other parties will encourage it.\n- Cure the Cost-of-Living Crisis Only Reform UK will cure the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping net zero. Net zero is the cause of our cost-of-living crisis because it attacks energy. Since energy is required to build or move anything, an increase in energy costs causes an increase in the cost of ￼everything.\nNet zero is the single most destructive economic policy ever devised It increases the cost of heating your home cooking your food growing your food or building and buying any product and service It justifies attacks on the motor car, hikes in diesel and petrol prices, banning petrol and diesel cars, 20 mph speed limits, 15-minute cities, and an attack on agriculture where 20% of arable land is taken out of food production, increasing food costs. Net zero is destroying our wealth and replacing it with poverty.\nLabour, Conservatives, Lib Dems, and Greens all support net zero. Only Reform UK can save the economy by scrapping net zero.\nLabours Ed Miliband costed net zero at £228 billion, all of which will come out of the pockets of the poor to feed the greed of the energy producers.\n- Save the NHS Only Reform UK will save the NHS. We have detailed written plans to make the NHS more efficient. The NHS costs us £179 billion each year, yet we still cannot see a GP, dentist, or get an ambulance quickly.\nThe NHS is failing not because of underfunding but due to inefficiency and…. Mass immigration has added 2 million people who need care, exacerbating NHS problems. Increased deaths and long-term sickness from the government's handling of COVID have put further strain on the NHS.\nReform UK has detailed policies on these issues to save the NHS for future generations.\n- Reform Public Services Our public services are infected by woke ideology and inefficiencies. The police and education services are particularly politicized. Police commanders implement woke ideologies and employ officers based on factors like skin color, gender, and sexuality instead of their ability. This is not how to choose police officers.\nThe education service teaches children they can change their gender by changing their minds and that the world will end due to a \"climate catastrophe.\"\nEducation should not be indoctrination!\n- Reform the UK This is just the tip of the iceberg of the reform that is desperately needed. Other areas include:\n- The transport system needs reform.\n- The housing system needs reform.\n- The social care system needs reform.\n- The benefits system needs reform.\n- The civil service needs reform.\n- The political system needs radical reform.\nThe only way to change Britain for good is to change politics for good. We must vote for Reform UK.\nIf you agree, vote for me ! Chris Farmer Reform UK Gloucester #ReformUK￼",

In political terms, fascism signifies an authoritarian, statist ideology where individual rights are subordinated to the state. In fascist regimes, a small group of government officials holds power over everyone else, resulting in the tyranny of the many by the few.\nThe Conservative and Labour parties have claimed more power over citizens, with individual rights being blatantly violated, especially during the Covid lockdowns, through increased taxation, and through coercive measures like mandated vaccines under the \"no jab, no job\" policy.\nBy contrast, Reform UK members vehemently oppose this growing governmental power. We are fighting fiercely for the freedom of individual citizens against the state's coercive power.\nOur opponents continually label us as far-right or fascists. These labels are fundamentally false. We stand in direct opposition to fascism by advocating for the protection of individual rights against government overreach.\nThose who attack Reform UK by calling us \"far-right\" or \"fascist\" clearly do not understand the meaning of the word fascist.

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_raising-the-national-minimum-wage-is-futile-/content_137.html": "Raising the National Minimum Wage Is Futile\nWednesday, 04 October 2023\nRaising the National Minimum Wage Is Futile The government often tries to \"end poverty\" by mandating an increase in the minimum wage, which employers must pay to their workers. This measure has been tried many times before and always fails for two clear reasons:\n- Increasing the cost of employment means less employment. Employers hire people when they judge the benefits of hiring ￼ them to be greater than the risk When the government mandates higher wages thus adding more risk to hiring, employers become more Reluctant\nMandating higher wages makes it harder for employers to take the risk of hiring new workers, ￼especially if they are young and inexperienced. So young, poor, unskilled and inexperienced people find it harder to get jobs.\n- The increased cost of employment leads to higher prices. When the cost of labor goes up, employers pass on this cost to customers through higher prices. This means everything gets more expensive, and the benefit of a higher hourly wage gets eaten up by these rising prices. So, the value of money goes down,as inflation reduces its power to buy things. Increasing people's hourly wages doesn't really help the poor.\nA Better Way The real way to end poverty is by training Equip people ￼with better knowledge and skills which they can bring to the market place for higher wages!\nInstead of telling employers to pay more per hour, the government should provide more training programs that teach people useful work skills. Skills they can use to earn higher wages in the market.\nPoliticians love quick fixes They like to announce a new quick fix policy to eliminate poverty. If increasing the minimum wage really worked, then it would’ve worked already! Since the idea has been tried many, many times. It never works for the reasons already listed\n￼The politicians keep doing it because they think It makes them look good.\nTraining and development Training and development is the right way forward. If the government truly wants to help people out of poverty, they should pour money into training poor people : help people to start their own business\nSole traders Small businesses have always been a good way out of poverty. Almost anyone can start their own business if they know how.\nStart a small business and soon you might hire family members, friends, and others in the community. This is how we rise from rags to riches.\nWe get rid of poverty by creating more wealth. And the way to do that is to start many small businesses that can grow over time.\nThis is a better way forward.\nIf you agree, please let me know Please share this post and follow my Facebook page\nChris, Farmer.\nReform Uk.

High tax rates strip people of their money and economic choices. We believe in lower tax rates, allowing people to retain their money and make their own buying decisions, which stimulates economic growth and incentivises work\nMore government regulations are bad; fewer government regulations are good. Over-regulation stifles efficiency, as government planners cannot possibly ￼understand the complexities of economic decisions made by millions. State planned economies have been tried in Russia, China, North Korea, Cuba, and other socialist communist countries; they always fail. We believe in less government ￼regulation to allow free people and market dynamics to drive economic growth through a free enterprise economy\nCrushing small businesses is bad; supporting small businesses is good. The Conservative Party's policies have crushed many small businesses. By lowering taxes and reducing regulations, Reform Uk will create a more business-friendly environment that encourages the growth of small and medium-sized businesses.\nUncontrolled illegal immigration is bad; strictly controlled immigration is good. The out of control flow of illegal immigration damages the economy, public services, and British culture. We introduce policies that ensure immigration is legal, limited, and tightly controlled.\nPromoting the sexualisation and gender confusion in schools is bad; protecting children from these trends is good. The trend towards early sexualisation and encouraging gender confusion among children is Sinful and harmful. Schools should safeguard children from these pernicious influences, focusing on education we will eliminate any attempts to sexualise our children or promote gender, dysmorphia\nIgnoring excess deaths and sickness post-rollout is bad; investigating ￼these health anomalies is good. The government's failure to examine the rise in deaths and illnesses following the vaccine rollout is a dereliction of duty. A thorough investigation is necessary for public health and safety Wrongdoers must be brought to justice\nAttacking internal combustion engines is bad; preserving the internal combustion engines is good. The move to ban diesel and petrol engines by 2030 under net zero plans threatens to obliterate the British economy since all products and services need to be transported. there is no viable alternative to petrol and diesel engines. EV are too expensive too heavy and too dangerous Maintaining energy from hydrocarbons and nuclear is crucial.\nUndermining farming and agriculture is bad; supporting agriculture and farmers is good. Government policies that force farmers to reduce productive land jeopardize food production, and farmers livelihoods. The net zero nutters want to eliminate 20% of farmland from production. This would increase the price of all foods and drive us all deeper into poverty, We advocate for the support of farmers and the elimination of net zero madness\nBias in police enforcement is bad; impartial law enforcement is good. The shift towards political correctness in policing detracts from the core mission of the prevention and detection of crime Law enforcement should be not be geared to favouring certain classes of people such as black lives matter, LGBT, or certain religious, factions . the police must police “without fear or favour” and should focus on preventing and detecting crime ! And Nothing else\nThe government serving their corporate paymasters, is bad; the government serving the people, including the working, middle, and business classes, is good. The government's alignment with corporate and global entities such as WEF. W H,O European Union, UN and other corporate entities. over Denise of UK citizens our nation, and its democracy\n￼ MPs who work for global corporations must be eliminated from the House of Commons, and replaced with Reform Uk MPs who will work for the British people.\nReform UK is committed to changing Bad politics for Good !\nIf you share my vision, please leave a comment with us in the comments.￼\nThank you Chris Farmer #ReformUK #gloucester",

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_the-hypocrisy-of-the-greens/content_21.html": "The Hypocrisy of the Greens\nTuesday, 17 October 2023\nThe Hypocrisy of the Greens People who don't practice what they preach are hypocrites. The Greens do not practice what they preach.\nWhat the Greens Preach The Greens say human use of hydrocarbon fuels is destroying the planet through climate change. They claim the only way to save the planet is to restrict people's use of hydrocarbons. They impose restrictions on hydrocarbon usage that may make our lives worse; colder, poorer, and shorter.\nBut Not for Them The Greens and their spokespeople don't live by the same standards they impose upon us. Those Greens, spokespersons, politicians, and businesspeople who work so hard to make you believe that the CO2 from your lifestyle is causing planetary destruction have no intention of reducing their own CO2.\nLifestyles of the Rich and Famous Green lobbyists, people like Barack Obama and David Attenborough love to fly thousands of miles in private jets. They live in luxury homes, have heated swimming pools, drive fast cars, and indulge in the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Their profit from spreading the climate catastrophe narrative makes them even richer, perhaps affording them a larger yacht or a faster plane. Meanwhile, they force you to pay an extra £12.50 to drive your old van into London. The hypocrisy is astounding.\nLies All the Way Down The climate catastrophe narrative is built on lie after lie.\nCatastrophic climate change is a lie. Climate change is natural. It's not catastrophic. Living on Earth means experiencing climate change. The idea that CO2 drives climate change is a lie. CO2 isn't dangerous to the planet; it's the most important gas for plant life. All life depends on plants which require CO2.\nCalling CO2 a pollutant is absurd. It's so ridiculous I can't believe I'm discussing it. A pollutant is a toxic substance harmful to life. CO2 is essential for life so it can't be called a toxin or pollutant.\nHuman CO2 is Responsible for Climate is a Lie. Most of the CO2 in the atmosphere is from natural sources. For every 34 CO2 molecules, only one is from human sources. The other 33 are natural.\nProfiting from Lies The Greens and catastrophe advocates are making money from their lies. The climate change and carbon credit industry, along with decarbonisation, is now a trillion dollar operation built on lies meant to amass wealth.\nThey Don't Practice What They Preach! People act according to their beliefs. It's clear that the Green lobby, flying in jets and living like the rich and famous, don't believe their own rhetoric. If they truly believed CO2 was the problem, they'd cut back on their own CO2-heavy lifestyles. But they dont - and never will - because they don’t believe their own words.\nIf they don't believe, not act on their own words, then neither should we!\nIt’s Time to Call Time We need to challenge the net zero narrative. CO2 is a life-giving gas. Climate change is natural. Humans aren't to blame and shouldn't have to pay millionaire Green lobbyists for the privilege of living.\nIf you agree, please let me know.\nChris, Farmer. Reform Uk. Gloucester. #ReformUK",

They have made themselves so unpopular with the marketplace and ordinary people that they will soon be expunged. Terminated. Not by the government, but by customers. And the court of public opinion. This is exactly how free-market capitalism works. If customers do not like what businesses are doing, then they take their money away from that business and the business collapses. If customers do like what a company does then they buy more of their products and services and the company grows. This is the true nature of free-market capitalism and it is the most democratic of all economic systems. However, there is a corrupt form of capitalism which I call crony capitalism, which is when big business and politicians get into bed with each other and they pay each other; big businesses fund political parties and then, in return, political parties hand over contracts to big businesses. This corrupted form of capitalism, called crony capitalism, should be rejected by every right-thinking person. Free-market capitalism, what I call community capitalism, is the source of all wealth in this country, which is made - not by politicians - but by the hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions of small to medium size businesses of all kinds, offering goods and services at reasonable prices to their customers. It is this form of capitalism which will generate the wealth, goods, and services which the rest of us rely on and which fund our public services. Government is not the source of wealth, Government expropriates wealth from the people and their businesses and the idea of politicians being paid by big businesses, like Pfizer, or Moderna, and then mandating people to take their products, is sickening and needs to be stopped. Free-market enterprise economy, what I like to call community capitalism, is how The People can raise themselves from rags to riches by hard work, enterprise and industry. It’s the way that my dad paid his way through life by starting a small business (he was a coal merchant in the days when people burned coal in the fireplaces). It is the way that I have made my way through life as a small business owner, And I’m proud to say that it’s the way my daughter is making her way through life as the proud owner of a small business. Production and trade is what made this country great. And production and trade is the way that we can get ourselves out of the economic mess that we’re in now. Let’s get the government out of the way, And let the natural ingenuity and creative genius of the British people lead the way... That’s how we make Britain Great.\n#gloucester #thereformparty #coutts #NigelFarage",
  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_media-twist-words-/content_129.html": "Media Twist Words\nFriday, 22 September 2023\nMedia Twist Words I have noticed a tendency in the media and in politics for the meanings of words to be twisted. They are often used as a means to confuse people rather than enlighten them.\nExamples Classifying CO2 as a pollutant. I often read statements that certain countries are “rpolluting the world with CO2” Calling CO2 a pollutant is a misuse of language, equivalent to a lie.\nA pollutant is a toxic chemical compound. CO2 is NOT a toxic chemical compound.\nIt is the fundamental life giving gas of the planet. To call CO2 a pollutant indicates that the writer is ignorant, dishonest, or both.\nFar right: I've noticed that politicians and media often label their opponents as \"far right.\" “Far right\" is a term synonymous with fascism and Nazism. To accuse somebody of being far right indicates they are sympathetic to fascism and Nazism. The press labels anyone who argues with the \"narrative\" as being far right. The Reform Party, Nigel Farage, and Marine Le Pen (the French political leader) are all accused of being “far right”. Labeling people as Far Right is an easy way to discredit them.\nCVD related deaths: Throughout the pandemic, we were being told of CVD related deaths. The relationship between CVD and death was time-based. Any death that occurred within 28 days of a positive test was classified as a \"CVD related death.\" If a person was run over by a bus, the death would be classified as a CVD related death.\nThis is an obviously fraudulent way of using language and building statistics to sustain a narrative.\nTrue science looks for CAUSALITY not tenuous \"relationships.\"\nLanguage is the tool of thought. When politicians, media and so-called scientists distort language, they distort thinking, and without clear thinking, their answers are wrong.\nWe demand precision. We must demand a higher standard from politicians, scientists, and others. Without clear, precise, accurate language, terrible mistakes will continue to be made. And many people will continue to be fooled.\nAccurate language, Only with clear, accurate, precise language, can we figure things out and move forward to a better world.\nThank you..

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_reform-grows-the-uk-economy/content_116.html": "Reform Grows The UK Economy\nMonday, 16 October 2023\nReform Grows The UK Economy. The conservative government is trashing the UK economy by spending more than it is earning.\nMany People Will Vote For High Spending Governments The public likes high public spending because they love good public services and and politicians are all too ready to make big expensive promises to “invest” (spend) money on those things they hope will be popular and thus win votes.\nBut Nothing in Life is Free. Everything has to be paid for. And so The UK government has been paying for its excessive spending by a terrible combination of\n- printing fake money,\n- borrowing more and\n- raising taxes ever higher\nBad Governments Print Fake Money (“quantitative easing\") quantitative easing is when the government prints money that it would like to have, but doesn’t. When the government is strapped for cash it tells the Bank of England to print more ( fake digital) money. But this money does not represent any additional production in the form of tangible, goods or services; Instead, it's simply empty money. In fact, they call it \"ex nihilo\", which means literally “out of nothing”\nNothing Comes From Nothing So the actual value of fake money is taken from the value of your savings.\nWhen the new fake money is mixed with the old money, the total money in circulation increases, and the value of each individual pound drops. We experience this as high inflation, which has a devastating effect on the economy and on the buying power of every individual citizen. Government induced Inflation makes us all poorer.\nBad governments Borrow More. Governments like to borrow to fund their spending promises and pet projects.\nBut borrowing has to be repaid with interest ! And the more the government borrows, the more interest it must pay; and that money comes out of your services Excessive borrowing is a great way for governments to go bust.\nBad Government s Like Higher Taxes. Governments raise taxes higher to generate income to pay for their pet projects and promises. But when taxes are too high, ( as they are now), the people become dispirited and lose their motivation to work since extra effort does not result in extra income, because any extra income is immediately taken by the government in extra taxes.\nSo raising taxes never brings in the revenue expected and has a depressing effect on the economy.\nThat’s just a few of the ways the government has messed up the economy and that’s why they cannot afford to spend the money on public services we would like.\nWhat’s the solution? The best way to fund public services and to increase the revenue of the government is to grow the economy!\nGood governments create SMEs The economy is mostly made up of small to medium-sized businesses. In the UK, there about 6 million SMEs They employ 61% of the workforce and are responsible for about 52% of the business turnover.\nCommunity businesses These community businesses are dotted throughout the land and represent the greatest economic potential that we have.\nUk Governments policies have Killed SMEs The government's policies of printing money, high taxes, and regulation have stifled and even killed off many small businesses. The government seems to be intent on destroying small to medium-sized businesses because they have fallen in love with the multinationals big pharma, big banks, big tech, et cetera. Politicians don’t care for the little guy in the High Street. Are politicians like to rub shoulders with the big boys. They neglect small businesses which represent our greatest economic asset\nLet’s Grow More Small Businesses. To improve the economy, and fund public services, a Reformed UK government would support, nurture, and grow millions of small businesses.\nMassive Potential If we increase the number of small to medium-sized businesses in the next 10 years, then we would lift ourselves out of rags and into riches.\nWealth creation, It would be easy to do; by encouraging many of our youth NOT to go to university but rather, to open small businesses in the local community.\nBritain’s Got Talent Our young people would take whatever skill, idea, natural talent, product, or service they have and turn it into a profitable wealth, creating business.\nReformed UK Government Would Help We would give preferential loans, training, and support to all people who want to start their own business. By doing that, a proportion of them will grow rapidly to become medium and then even large businesses.\nThe Economy is Organic. We should treat the economy like a garden where new plants are continually growing. Some plants don’t succeed, but most do, and some grow to be giant oak trees.\nGrow the Economy And Save the Economy. We must reform our economic ideas.\nQuit thinking about printing money. Quit thinking about raising taxes. Quit thinking about borrowing more.\nStart thinking about harnessing the creative genius of the British people.\nGreat Britain became great by production and trade. Great Britain became great not because of politicians but because of creative business production and trade\nIt was in Great Britain that the industrial revolution started, which transformed the lives of everybody on the planet. All the greatest engineering, technological, medical, and artistic breakthroughs originated in the UK.\nA Bright British Future This is where British business can make its mark again.

(\"I will Stop the boats\" means \" I will NOT stop the boats)\nPoliticians, media, and institutions have betrayed the people of Britain, they no longer represent the will nor the best interests of the british people.\nGovernment ministers and MPs are refusing to stand for parliament because they are receiving threats from the people whose lives they have ruined.\nThe Government has been captured and corrupted by a globalist WEF ideology.\nPoliticians have signed UK sovereignty over to the WHO pandemic treaty who -in May 2024- will have powers to lock us down and mandate vaccinations by force.\nUK industry still mirroring EU law in order to NOT be competitive with Europe ! Brexit betrayed!\nPeople unelected in positions of power: Rishi Sunak was put in power by the markets and not by the Conservative Party membership, David Cameron is in government and is not an MP.\nMPs are affiliated to WEF and Davos' Great Reset and Agenda 2030 which calls for the destruction of nation-states and personal wealth: \"You will own nothing.\"\nEconomic Mismanagement and Decline 9. We are now poorer than we were four years ago.\nUK economy is flatlining because all the conditions for a growing economy have been obliterated.\nHighest tax rates for 70 years means the goverment decides how it will spend YOUR money, leaving you with little or no economic freedom\nWage rates for local workers being depressed by mass immigration of cheap labor from outside.\nQuantitative easing means government prints money that devalues the buying power of our savings, which we perceive as inflation.\nSocial and Cultural Erosion 14. They are Destroying traditional family values. 15. Degrading Traditional British culture and subveriting it with \"multiculturalism\" 16. Degrading British history., making kids ashamed to be British. 17. A bizarre WOKE ideology that defines people primarily by their skin colour. 18. A Transgender ideology in schools that denies the existence of men and women and teaches there are 90 genders. 19. It is odd that all our political leaders are Non-White when our country is predominantly White Caucasian .\nPublic Services and Infrastructure Crisis 20. Systematically destroying our industry, small and medium-sized family businesses, agriculture and farming, food production, energy production. 21. Degrading and subverting the education service, the police service, the NHS. 22. Our road networks are in tatters and are being replaced by cycle tracks that are barely used. 23. Bloated expensive but inefficient public services. 24. Councils which spend money on diversity and inclusion officers but cannot house their homeless are increasing local taxes whilst cutting services. 25. Public services employing more people than ever but the level of service is worse.\nHousing and Immigration Issues 27. Housing is difficult to find due to rapidly raising population due to mass immigration. 28. Housing stock, and rental accommodation (handed over to illegal migrants at public expense).\nHealth and Welfare Concerns 29. Public health (with record numbers of excess deaths and people suffering long-term sickness). 30. Loss of mental well-being and people's optimism for a better future are at an all-time low. 31. Excess deaths are up 11% and the MPs don't want to discuss or even acknowledge it. 32. Long-term sickness absence is at highest levels since the rollout.\nMedia and Narrative Control 33. Media does not report news but rather disseminates narrative and buries alternatives. 34. BBC is increasing its charges and is completely dedicated to the promotion of a WOKE climate catastrophe anti-British narrative.\nEnvironmental and Food Security 36. Farmers are being paid by taxpayers to STOP growing food, which will lead to food shortages and poverty, and malnutrition. 37. Net zero ideology that demonises CO2 and claims it is a pollutant when it is the basis of all life on planet earth.\nRetail and Economic Infrastructure 38. Collapse of retail means most city centre shopping streets are dying.\nFinancial Control and Privacy Concerns 39. Digital currency means that bank and government will control wealth including all the money in your bank account. You will own nothing.\nScientific and Academic Integrity 40. Science perverted by money and a disregard for the scientific method of falsifiability.

The imposition of EV cars and the banning of Petrol and Diesel transport by 2030 will devastate the economy, destroy personal mobility and freedom to travel.\nGovernance and Regulatory Impact 42. House of Lords is occupied by vested interests, and remnants of Tony Blair's cronies. 43.

The cost of living crisis means that Uk families have had to economise. Reform will insist that Every public service manager across government must find savings without touching frontline services. Cut bureaucracy, improve procurement, eliminate unnecessary spending, and focus on delivering essentials. This will free up money for better front-end services.\n.2 Scrap Government Quangos There are over 600 government departments and “quangos.” These are organisations unaccountable to Parliament, and billions of pounds are spent on them every year. Some of them add no value to the public and could be easily scrapped. We can spend the money better.\n.3 Cut Red Tape The government badly botched Brexit, and as a result, we are still operating under many regulations emanating from the European Union. Reform UK will cut EU red tape and release us from the bondage of overregulation that costs the UK economy £143 billion since 2015.\nStop Paying Interest on Quantitative Easing Reserves This technical economic point would save us £40 billion per year.\nCut Foreign Aid by 50% We currently send £12.8 billion abroad to foreign nations, including China and India, both of whom have their own space programs! Charity begins at home, and we will spend more money on our own people before we spend it on foreign nations.\nReform UK will cut £91 billion per year off the government spend and simultaneously improve public services.\nThat’s the plan.\nIf you like the sound of that, please leave a comment.

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_reform-the-nhs/content_32.html": "Reform The NHS\nWednesday, 03 April 2024\nThe NHS is the most popular and the most expensive of all the public services. It employs 3.1 million people, and it costs over £136 billion per year. There are 19.2 million families in UK which means that each family pays about £7000 per year.\nAnd yet, we find it difficult to see a GP, or have an operation on time, and if we call an ambulance, it’s likely to take a long time. When abulances arrive at hospitals patients often lie in corridors for many hours. Some die.\nSo, something is wrong. It’s obvious that the Conservatives have failed.\nWe must Reform the NHS. Here are Reforms policies:\nCut bureaucracy and unnecessary management. There are many thousands of people who work in the NHS who have nothing to do with patient care. NHS spends £40m a year on 800 diversity and inclusion officers. That money could be spent on extra 1,200 nurses. Reform will reduce the number of non-essential staff and spend the money on patient care.\nSmarter Purchasing. The NHS often pays inflated prices for its pharmaceuticals, and other goods and services. In reality, NHS should be benefiting from economies of scale.\nA&E. The A&E service is overwhelmed because many people use A&E for minor ailments. Reform will start a campaign which puts emphasis on pharmacy first, GPs second, and A&E last. People should only go to A&E for Accidents or Emergencies!\nIncentivise staff to stay. Many trained staff leave the NHS early. This is a tremendous loss to the service. Reform UK will incentivise NHS and social care staff to stay by offering zero basic rate tax for three years.\nPatients Choice. Reform will introduce a new voucher scheme where patients can receive private treatments if they cannot see a GP within three days; or a consultant within three weeks; or receive their operation within nine weeks.\nMake more use of private healthcare and insurance. To relieve the pressure on the NHS, Reform UK will introduce 20% tax relief for those people who can afford to go private.\nNHS is the crown jewel of the public services But it is not perfect, and it needs Reform.\nThis is how we can Save the NHS\nPlease leave your comments.\nChris Farmer • Gloucester • Reform UK",

It is the Enemy that is weak because they are wrong.\nThe only reason the Enemy seems to be strong is because the vast majority of right-thinking people are doing nothing.\nThey've given up; due to a misguided belief that there's nothing they can do.\nThe Enemy is strong only in the presence of an inactive, disheartened, and fearful population.\nWhich is why our enemy spends so much time, money and effort scaring people. They believe in state-sponsored terror because a terrified population is easy to control.\nThe true power of people The moment that the public understands that it holds all the cards and is powerful beyond measure, then the small number of crazies who are running the show and who are driving this country into the ground, will be swept away like a Sandcastle on the beach.\nWrong is weak Whatever is wtong is weak. It is important to remember that anything which is wrong is inherently unstable and falls to pieces when you apply a pressure or residence. Which is why, ultimately, our enemies will fail.\nThe wrong always fails. Anything which is wrong won't work. To test that theory, try wiring up a plug wrong. Plug it in and you'll find that it won't work. Only if you wire up the plug right, will it work properly.\nLikewise, Only if you wire up a brain right, will it work properly.\nOnly if you govern a country right, will it work properly.\nInsanity fails. So all these insane, crazy ideas will, and must, ultimately fail. Their inherent contradictions and idiot practitioners will ensure their ultimate demise.\nBut on the way, much damage is done. In the act of failing, Crazies cause much damage. So its up to us to quickly and expertly expose and dismantle their arguments.\nWe must expose the wrong, the insane, crazy and even Evil elements in our society and we must replace them with the good, the rational, the logical, and the MORAL ideas that underpin all successful societies.\nThose ideas are:\nFreedom Enterprise Public service Creativity Productivity National Sovereignty Honesty. Rational optimism\nThese are the principles upon which this great nation was built.\nLet’s use the same principles again to make Britain Great.\nSo, take heart, my friend, and feel Strong!\nIt’s time to throw out the trash!\nIf you like this message, please share it to your friends.

  "https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_/https_www_chrisfarmerreform_com_blog_reform-uk-make-work-pay/content_20.html": "Reform UK : Make Work Pay\nWednesday, 19 June 2024\nThere are many people who do not work. They don’t work for three reasons:\n- Not Enough Jobs The economy is not growing because the government has destroyed every condition necessary for economic growth. They have destroyed growth with:\n- Net zero policies\n- High taxes\n- Heavy regulations\n- EU restrictions\n- Excessive red tape\nThe government has stifled the economy's growth potential by imposing too many constraints on businesses. This makes it almost impossible for them to grow. Consequently, there are fewer jobs available than there should be.\n- The Poverty Trap The benefit system has created a poverty trap where people find themselves worse off by working. This means that if they go to work and earn money, they end up with less in their pocket.\nAs a result, they stay on benefits indefinitely, living in poverty. The only way to break out of the poverty trap is to make work pay. We propose raising the tax threshold to £20,000 so that nobody pays any tax until they earn £20,000.\nThis would make work pay and encourage people to return to the workforce. In turn, they can add more value to themselves, their families, and their communities.\n- Dishonest Claimants Some people who could work don’t work because they are dishonest. They make fraudulent claims about ill health.\nFor instance, many more people have claimed they are unable to work due to \"mental issues.\" These mental issues are sometimes undefinable, unprovable, and indisputable.\nIt is too easy for people to say, \"I have anxiety, and therefore I cannot work,\" forcing the rest of society to pay their bills.\nThis loophole needs to be investigated and closed. We need face-to-face PIP (Personal Independence Payment) assessments to make it more difficult for people to feign disability.\nGrowth Economy Only with a growth economy can we afford brilliant public services. Therefore, to ensure everyone who should work does work, policies must make work rewarding and accessible.\nIf you agree with this, please let me know.
