  "https_www_sushilrapatwar_uk_/https_www_sushilrapatwar_uk_news_jewish-forum-sadiq-khan-and-susan-hall-hustings/content_13.html": "London Jewish Forum successfully hosted a London Mayoral hustings on 12th April, featuring representatives from various political parties. The invited candidates included representatives from the Liberal Democrat and Green parties, Susan Hall from the Conservative Party, and the incumbent Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, representing the Labour Party.\nThe event was well-organized, with diverse curated questions presented to the candidates. However, there was an interruption from a disruptive individual during the proceedings.\nDuring the hustings, Sadiq Khan primarily focused on attributing the capital's rising crime rates to central government policies and past decisions rather than providing concrete plans to address the issue. This approach was met with noticeable discontent from the audience. In contrast, Susan Hall offered more direct and specific solutions to tackle crime. The audience appeared to be a mix of Conservative and Labour supporters, with a few undecided attendees. Supporters from both sides expressed their sentiments through cheering and booing, depending on the speaker and their statements.\nSadiq Khan's responses often lacked clarity, with a tendency to avoid direct answers and shift blame. While he demonstrated confidence and stage presence, Susan Hall's content was deemed more substantive. However, she may benefit from enhancing her style and charisma to match Khan's stage presence.\nIn conclusion, the London Jewish Forum should be commended for organising an insightful and engaging hustings event. While the decision of the undecided attendees remains uncertain, there is evidently a growing sentiment for a change in leadership. For London to maintain its global standing, there appears to be a consensus that a change in mayoral leadership may be necessary.",

As a working professional, resident, and parent, I have been part of this vibrant community for nearly 20 years. I'm deeply invested in preserving this wonderful area as a safe place for families and a thriving place for business. I have a proven track record of leading and managing complex projects in business, and that will hold me in good stead when I champion solutions for problems faced by residents. I am confident that, by working together, we can achieve extraordinary outcomes for Brent West.\nTACKLING CRIME\nIn January 2023, Brent had the highest crime rate in London for possessing weapons. As a local resident and the father of a teenage daughter, this is not just a statistic to me; it's a call to action. I am deeply committed to the safety and future of all people. I will work tirelessly to secure our fair share of funding and police officers to combat crime in Brent, ensuring a safer community for everyone.\nSUPPORTING LOCAL BUSINESSES\nLocal and high-street businesses are the beating heart of our community. However, in Brent, parking has escalated into a major concern for local businesses. I am committed to working towards the introduction of a one-hour free parking policy to address this. This strategy has proven effective in stimulating growth in Conservative-led Harrow, and I am confident it will have a similar impact in Brent.\nYOUTH EMPOWERMENT\nBrent has 43,000 young people (15 to 24-year-olds). I will work extensively to empower them through technology and innovation hubs, arts and culture initiatives. I will also push for more apprenticeship and mental health well-being programs. Through such initiatives, I will work towards creating motivated, skilled, and positively engaged youth.\nPROMOTING DIGITAL SKILLS\nAs part of the nationwide levelling-up drive, some of our neighbouring boroughs have received millions in funding, but Brent hasn’t received its fair share. I will fight to secure funding for projects that can improve the lives of residents in Brent West.\nLEVELLING-UP BRENT\nAs part of the Conservative Government's Levelling-Up drive, Brent has recieved significant funding. Sushil will continue to fight for further funding from central Government to improve the lives of people living in Brent.\nCELEBRATING DIVERSITY\nBrent is the second most culturally diverse borough in the country. I propose holding a diversity month in Brent to bring all people together through art and culture. This will go a long way in maintaining peace in the community in these uncertain times.",

This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition.

Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation.

Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11.

  "https_www_sushilrapatwar_uk_/https_www_sushilrapatwar_uk_news_joy-and-importance-tree-plantation-heartwarming-community-effort/content_4.html": "There's an indescribable joy in planting a tree—it's like becoming a parent to a living being that grows, thrives, and gives back to the earth. And what could be more fulfilling than planting not just one, but 60 trees?\nOn a bright and sunny day, around 20 enthusiastic members of the community gathered at Barham Park in Brent for a tree plantation event organized by WCARA (Wembley Central & Alperton Residents Association). The atmosphere was filled with anticipation and excitement as we embarked on this meaningful journey to enhance our local environment.\nLeslie from Brent Council provided us with a safety demonstration and valuable instructions on planting saplings, especially in challenging conditions with resource-hungry grass. What initially seemed like a straightforward task quickly transformed into a strenuous, sweat-inducing exercise. But the beautiful weather and abundant sunshine made it all worthwhile, offering us a healthy dose of vitamin D and adding to the joy of the day.\nThe real magic, however, was in the camaraderie we shared. Working together, we formed a tight-knit community, united by a common purpose. Each sapling we planted—whether it was a Rowan, Silver Birch, or wild Cherry—represented a commitment to the future, a small step towards a greener and healthier environment.\nWhile we planted these trees with hope and optimism, we also acknowledged the challenges they might face. But even if only half of them reach adulthood, it will be a gratifying sight to see them grow, towering over us with grace and majesty. In our minds, we could almost hear them whispering their thanks, bending down as if in gratitude for the love and care we've showered upon them.\nThis tree plantation event was not just about planting trees; it was about community, unity, and making a tangible difference for our planet. As we watched the saplings take root, we felt a profound sense of satisfaction and hope for the future—a future where our children and grandchildren can enjoy the shade of these trees and benefit from the cleaner air they provide. Truly, the joy of tree plantation lies not just in the act itself but in the lasting impact it creates for generations to come.",
  "https_www_sushilrapatwar_uk_/https_www_sushilrapatwar_uk_about-sushil-rapatwar/content_2.html": "Passion, Belief & Integrity: Sushil Rapatwar\nSushil is a testament to unwavering integrity and a commitment to serving the people with steadfast passion and dedication. Born and raised in India, he learned the values of compassion, empathy, and community early on. These principles have been the cornerstone of his character and have shaped his journey into politics.\nFrom a young age, Sushil showed a keen interest in social justice and equality. He actively participated in community service initiatives, advocating for the underprivileged and marginalised. This early passion blossomed into a lifelong dedication to public service.\nAfter completing his engineering degree, Sushil embarked on a career focused on uplifting the lives of others. Whether through his work in leading cultural charity organisations in the UK, establishing business networking groups, leading cultural and social initiatives, helping older people through healthcare initiatives, running community radio, being a governor in the local primary school, or representing England abroad through his badminton umpiring, he consistently demonstrated a deep understanding of the challenges faced by ordinary citizens and a relentless drive to address them.\nSushil's entry into politics was a natural progression of his desire to effect meaningful change on a larger scale. As a community champion, he has consistently championed policies prioritising people's needs. His platform is built on principles of transparency, accountability, and inclusivity.\nOne of Sushil's most notable attributes is his ability to listen. He firmly believes that accurate representation begins with actively engaging with constituents, understanding their concerns, and advocating for their interests. Through resident association meetings, community forums, and one-on-one interactions, he ensures that every voice is heard and every opinion is valued.\nIn his vision for the future, Sushil sees a community where everyone can access quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.
