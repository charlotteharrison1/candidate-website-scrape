They will also be able to offer treatments, including antibiotics.\nNeil said:\n“I was the Minister responsible for drawing up this new scheme, which I think will bring big benefits to people in Harborough.\nThe government is investing £645 million in creating what is effectively a whole new NHS service. You will be able to walk into the overwhelming majority of pharmacists - more than 10,000 chemists in England. They will be able to do you a consultation, and be able to treat and prescribe medication for many less serious illnesses, all on the NHS. They are also trained to know when to refer on more serious conditions to a GP or hospital.\nI have been talking to local pharmacists about it - all newly qualified pharmacists new have prescribing powers, and they are keen to start providing more NHS services like this.\nThis new NHS scheme is a win-win-win: it will it more convenient to get treatment for minor illnesses, let pharmacists use the full range of their skills, and free up 30 million GP appointments for those who need them.\nPeople can find out what is available in which chemist by searching “NHS pharmacy finder” online, or by walking in to your nearest chemist if you don’t have internet access.”",

It was sad to see the damage, whether it was to businesses like the Italian Greyhound pub in Great Glen, or to people's homes.”\n“I am calling a meeting with the Environment Agency and the County Council, because lessons must be learned from the flooding we have just seen. There are parts of the road network that could be more resilient when it rains. For example, the Melton Road where it goes under the railway bridge gets flooded several times a year. In some cases there may be things that could be done by improving the drainage, for example under the railway bridge in Kibworth. In the longer term there may be things we can do to create more overflow areas and slow water flow areas of tributaries in the countryside, so that they can act like sponges, and reduce sudden flows of water which then cause problems in the centre of Market Harborough.”\n“It’s essential that the most up to date flood risk information is fed into the local councils plans for housing too. Harborough is planning to do its next local plan on a fast track basis, but it is essential that a thorough and up to date assessment of flood risks is part of it, so that we don’t end up with houses built on flood risk areas.”",

  "https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_/https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_news_mp-calls-local-plan-consultation-woefully-inadequate-few-residents-respond/content_10.html": "MP Neil O’Brien has described both Harborough and Oadby & Wigston Council’s recent Local Plan public consultations as ‘woefully inadequate’ and has called on both authorities to rerun the process.\nIn Oadby and Wigston, the Council is currently creating its next Local Plan, a lengthy document that guides where future development will be built in the borough. As part of this, the Council agreed to sign the Statement of Common Ground, which would see Oadby & Wigston accept additional houses from neighbouring Leicester. Since then, the new Labour Government has further increased the Council’s housing delivery target, even announcing that a new settlement will be built at Stretton Hall between Oadby and Great Glen.\nIn a recent revelation, the Council disclosed that only around 200 responses had been received during the public consultation out of a population of over 57,000.\nIn Harborough, councillors voted last year to approve a process that would see the Plan prepared in less than 18 months. In doing so, the Council agreed to sign the Statement of Common Ground, which would see Harborough accept thousands of additional homes from Leicester. Since then, the new Labour Government has further increased the Council’s housing delivery target, even going so far as to announce that a new settlement will be built at Stretton Hall between Great Glen and Oadby.\nIn this latest development, the Council stated that only 101 members of the public in the district responded to the public consultation out of a total population of over 97,000. Parish councils in the area have also complained about how the Council has consulted with the public.\nNeil said: “These latest figures, quietly released by the Oadby and Wigston Borough Council, show that only around 200 residents and organisations responded to the consultation, a measly 0.3% of the borough's population. This is hardly democratic. Only three in every thousand residents have replied, with most of the population unaware it was going on. The situation is worse in Harborough, with just 101 responses from 1% of the population.\n“Then there are complaints about how the consultation was run. As part of the consultation, in-person events were held where information about the Local Plan was supposed to be available to the public in an accessible, easy-to-understand format. However, I have heard complaints from several parish councils about how important paper documents were forgotten and left behind in the Council offices. They were also disappointed that the information presented at these events was complicated to understand. Despite earlier assurances that councillors from the Council’s leadership team would attend events, only one did so.\n“However, since this consultation was run, a lot has changed. We have had a new Labour government that has massively increased Oadby & Wigston’s housing target. In a recent government press release, they announced that a new town would be built at Stretton Hall. Nobody knows how this will affect the next Local Plan, not least the officials at the Council, who I am sure are desperately seeking answers from their counterparts in government.\n“I am calling for the Council to take stock and rerun the public consultation when things have become clearer. This will allow many more people to have their say on the next Local Plan. The last consultation was woefully inadequate, and it should be run again.”",

There are already about 30% more clinical staff in general practice in this constituency than there were in 2019. We already took the number of doctors in GP training from over 2,600 a year to a record 4,000 and are now growing the number to 6,000 a year – we are going to need to expand facilities so they have space to work in.\nIn the government’s recent Primary Care Plan we set out changes to planning rules so that more of the funds raised from new developments flow into investments in GP services. Drawing up this plan for Harborough will fit well with that and further improve our ability to ensure that new housing always leads to the extra GP provision that’s needed.\nLocal NHS leaders also agreed they will take actions to sort out the signs at St Luke’s and make it clear what is available there at what times, which is an issue I have been pressing them on for some time.\nAs the plan starts to get going we will be talking to as many local residents as possible about what they want to see happen locally.\nI’m also encouraged that there are plans for Leicestershire NHS to work more closely with Northamptonshire. Because Market Harborough is right on the border, we would particularly benefit from a more joined up approach.”",
  "https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_/https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_news_neil-obrien-slams-labour-decision-axe-winter-payments-pensioners/content_14.html": "MP Neil O’Brien has slammed the Labour Government's decision to axe winter fuel payments for thousands of pensioners in Harborough, Oadby, and Wigston. The Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, made the announcement last week, meaning that around ten million older people will lose between £100 and £300 every winter.\nIn the Harborough area, 93.9% of pensioners will no longer receive the money. The number of recipients will drop by 19,103—from 20,343 to just 1,240. In Oadby and Wigston, the number of recipients will fall by 90.5%, from 11,335 to 1,074 – a drop of 10,261 people. Since being introduced in 1997, the Winter Fuel Payment has been available to all pensioners. The older age charity Age UK estimates around two million struggling pensioners will suffer because of the change.\nNeil commented:\n“When I first heard this announcement, I was aghast. It is shocking that this payment is being taken away from so many people in their later years. Many people who receive these payments aren’t well off; they rely on that money every winter. Many are just over the threshold for Pension Credit, which is not a high threshold, so many people will now struggle because of this Labour announcement.\n“This is a political decision taken by Labour ministers, who only a few months ago were running a scaremongering campaign claiming we would get round of them and they would protect them. No wonder this total reversal of their position from just a couple of months back feels like a total betrayal to so many.\n“I have been inundated with emails and calls from worried and angry constituents. I will speak up for them in Parliament. Despite the challenges posed by such a large Labour majority, I am determined to fight our corner on this.\n“I am also concerned about pensioners who have high energy needs because of disability or illness or who live in energy-inefficient homes that cost more to heat. So many of them will be hit hard.\n“This is a terrible announcement for the pensioners in Harborough, Oadby & Wigston.”",
  "https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_/https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_news_neil-obrien-mp-todays-autumn-statement/content_27.html": "Neil O’Brien said:\n“I welcome the measures set out in today’s Autumn Statement. It will ensure economic stability, protect the NHS, and cut inflation.\nThe extra 6.6 billion over the next two years for the NHS, and the record increase in social care funding will help make it easier for people in Harborough, Oadby and Wigston to see their GP and cut waiting times. It will make sure older people are properly looked after. In total there is an 11 billion boost to schools and hospitals and I was glad to hear the Chancellor’s emphasis on proper technical education, not just universities.\nA lot of lower paid workers here will benefit from the huge increase in the National Living Wage, which will rise from £9.50 per hour to £10.42 per hour. That’s worth over £1,600 to a full-time worker.\nLots of people have been in touch about the pensions Triple Lock, and having made representations on this to other ministers I am pleased to see the state pension will be protected.\nOn energy, our current support measures are saving people a third off their bills, which is worth about £700 per household this winter. It’s good to hear that support will be continuing, with extra help for the poorest.\nWindfall taxes on energy companies are being extended and increased. It is quite right that firms that have made windfall profits through luck are asked to pay towards the cost of helping households will bills.\nPutin’s invasion of Ukraine boosted inflation right across the world, but the measures set out by the Chancellor today will ensure that debt will start to fall, the downturn will be shallower, and unemployment lower than originally predicted.\nI was glad to see the Chancellor announce the first government backed nuclear power plant for 30 years. That will help the UK to become more energy independent in future years and rely less on Putin.\nI thought Jeremy Hunt’s statement was professional, serious and right. He is right to focus on protecting the most vulnerable across Harborough, Oadby and Wigston while providing the long-term economic stability and growth that is vital for everyone.”",

As a result, almost no residents are aware of the process.\nNow we are coming into the final stages of the plan-making process and councillors have been shown maps of sites that council officials think are viable.\nSo we are getting into the real meat of deciding where all these extra houses are to go.\nSurely it is now time to publish these secret maps so that we can have a proper democratic debate about where they should go.\nWhy should only councillors be allowed to see these maps and not residents, who will be the ones who ultimately feel the effects of these decisions?\"",

But if enough local residents show they are concerned about this by signing the petition, I think we can get the council to stop and have a rethink.\nI believe this proposal is unfair. Harborough is already one of the fastest growing areas in the country, and has delivered homes much faster than the national average. Accepting Leicester’s overspill housing in addition would mean going even faster, outpacing the ability of local infrastructure to cope.\nLeicester accounts for more than a third of the population of the county (34.1%) but is only planning to take just over a fifth of the new houses (22.6%), instead making surrounding districts like Harborough take on its housing need. The city is not taking its fair share.\nInstead of sprawling outwards, Leicester should meet its own housing need through regeneration of the many brownfield and underused sites in the city. This would be better for the environment, and would mean less growth in commuting, fewer traffic jams, and less pollution.\nIt is fairer for the city to meet its own housing needs locally, rather than dump it onto surrounding districts. There is no legal requirement for Harborough District to agree to this increase.\nLeaflets allowing residents to sign up to the petition are being delivered to local homes, but people can also email [email protected] or write to 24 Nelson Street, Market Harborough.”",

After months of me lobbying and asking questions in the Commons, officials and Ministers they have agreed to my campaign to keep Spion Kop Bridge on Blaby Road open during the coming electrification works.\nDuring conversations I had at the start of this year they Network Rail agreed to work up an option to lower the tracks instead of shutting the bridge. At the time they were sceptical and I was told that would be more expensive than shutting the bridge.\nHowever, I have repeatedly warned ministers and officials in the strongest terms that shutting the bridge would cause traffic chaos in Wigston, South Wigston and the south of Leicester. There are no good alternatives nearby, and it is always very busy.\nIt’s great they have listened, as the decision to take the tracks lower rather than shut the bridge avoids a potential 12 month road closure, which would have been a nightmare.\nThey are going to do works on the parapets on the sides of the bridge because they are not high, and there will be 25,000 volt cables running just underneath. They will probably shut one lane for some weeks, but have said the road will stay open throughout.\nThe actual works could be between Summer and Autumn 2025, but those are provisional dates at the moment.\nThe electrification agreed under the last government is a good thing which will make the trains quieter, faster, cheaper and cleaner.

I got the law changed to make sure more of the profits created by development flow to the community, not just developers, and ensure that when new homes are built they always come with the infrastructure that's needed.\nI have helped people affected by cowboy developers, using Parliament to name and shame companies who have treated residents badly, and forcing them to make improvements.\nI have also given numerous speeches in Parliament on “Fleecehold” – and tried to help local people who have been ripped off by estate management companies. I am pressing at both the national and local level to get back to the better system where councils adopted shared spaces on new estates and developers contributed to their upkeep.\nWe do need to build more houses and I want to see a system that does all we can to achieve people’s consent to this, involving local residents and councillors, so local people are part of the process and not an afterthought.",

Even after inflation we increased spending by a fifth in real terms. For every two members of clinical staff there were in 2019, there are now three. In the 2019 election we promised 50 million extra GP appointments and we delivered that by 2023, meaning the average GP practice was doing 44 more appointments every working day than in 2019.\nOne of the reforms I helped launch was the new NHS Pharmacy First service. You can now get NHS treatment from your local pharmacy for a range of minor illnesses, including antibiotics if you need them. It is already being widely used here. The NHS estimates this will free up around 10 million GP appointments a year and it is being widely used here. Another big one I was involved in is the Long Term Plan for the NHS Workforce – this will double the number of places at medical school and grow the numbers going into General Practice by a further 50%.\nBut this isn’t enough, and I am continuing to press for investment to make it easier to access a GP here in Harborough, Oadby and Wigston.\nLeicester’s hospitals were allocated substantial new investments under the last Conservative government. The new A&E at LRI has already been delivered and has made a big difference. Work has started at Kettering General too. Funds were allocated to create a new dedicated maternity hospital and a specialist children's hospital at the Royal Infirmary. I want to ensure this project is successfully delivered.",
  "https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_/https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_news_mp-welcomes-ps500-million-extra-cash-councils/content_23.html": "Neil O’Brien, MP for Harborough, Oadby and Wigston has welcomed the announcement of £500 million extra funding for local government announced today.\nTaking into account this new funding, local government in England will see an increase in Core Spending Power of up to £4.5 billion next year, or 7.5% in cash terms, an above-inflation increase, with councils spending power rising from £60.2 billion in 2023-24 to up to £64.7 billion in 2024-25.\nNeil said:\n“I have been pressing for extra funding for local government, and I was one of 40 MPs who recently wrote to the Chancellor pressing for this to happen. So I am really pleased the government have listened.\nThe extra £500 million of funding from government will go towards social care. That is good news, as the growing number of older people needing care is one of the things that has put pressure on the budgets of places like Leicestershire, and county councils across the East Midlands.\nThis extra funding for care is on top of the £1 billion in additional funding announced at Autumn Statement 2022 and July 2023.\nThe other bit of good news is the that the Funding Guarantee has been increased to 4%, which means all councils will see a minimum increase in their Core Spending Power of 4%, before local decisions on council tax. That will particularly help district and borough councils like Harborough, and Oadby and Wigston.\nI have been repeatedly pressing for this to happen, including in a meeting with the Chancellor this morning. This isn’t the end of the story, and we still need a fundamental overhaul of local government funding formulas, but this is a big step in the right direction.”",

Shopmobility, based at Roman Way Community Centre, provides mobility aids to those with limited mobility to access shops and leisure facilities in Market Harborough. However, their future has been thrown into doubt as Leicestershire County Council, the Community Centre owner, has put the site up for sale.\nHarborough Council recently designated the Centre as an Asset of Community Value, which could delay the sale by a few months. Despite this, Shopmobility has been told to vacate its premises by the end of October. Without finding anywhere to go, the charity has started selling its stock, including some scooters. Neil has launched a public appeal for help on behalf of the charity to secure its long-term future. The appeal comes after Neil met with the leader of Leicestershire County Council to discuss finding a home for the charity.\nNeil said:\n“Time is ticking to secure the future for this well-used service. As it currently stands, if Shopmobility doesn’t find a home by the end of October, the service will have to fold. This will leave hundreds of people who rely on the service without access to mobility aids to help them get around town. That is just unthinkable.\n“Earlier this week, I met the County Council leader and told her how important the service is. She has promised to look at further options to secure the charity’s future. I am also appealing for help from the wider Harborough community. Is there anywhere else Shopmobility can be based locally? They would only need a small office, with space for a workshop around the town centre area.\n“It would be a massive loss to the town if this service were to fold. Shopmobility has been based here for years and years, helping all those with mobility issues. If anyone has any ideas about how to secure the charity’s future, then please get in touch with me.”",

Neil, who also serves as a health minister, said the investment will help to cut waiting lists and increase capacity at the hospital.\nThis is part of a £250 million investment that will deliver 900 new hospital beds across England to help treat patients more quickly this winter. This funding has been awarded to NHS trusts to relieve pressures and help cut waiting times.\nThis investment is part of the NHS Urgent and Emergency Care Recovery Plan, published in January, which set out plans to provide over 5,000 additional permanent, fully staffed hospital beds in total, with the NHS on track to deliver this by winter. The new 56 beds at Glenfield are part of this commitment.\nThese measures will support the NHS’s recovery from the pandemic, and ensure that patients receive the care they need, when they need it. Alongside this, the NHS Long-Term Workforce Plan will put the NHS on a sustainable footing by delivering the biggest training expansion in NHS history and recruiting and retaining hundreds of thousands more staff over the next 15 years.\nCommenting, Neil said: “Winter is often a challenging time for the NHS, so this investment will allow health services locally to get ahead of pressures whilst also creating a sustainable NHS fit for the future. The 56 additional beds will increase hospital capacity locally and help cut waiting lists.\n“Creating additional hospital capacity will support staff to provide the best possible care and treat patients more quickly, helping us to improve waiting times - one of the government’s top five priorities.\n“Both as a local MP and a health minister I often hear from patients who have had to wait for lengthy periods for the care they need. These 56 new beds will make a real difference for those who require hospital care in Harborough, Oadby and Wigston.”",
  "https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_/https_www_neilobrien_org_uk_news_local-mp-spearheads-new-law-stop-young-people-starting-smoking/content_8.html": "Harborough MP Neil O’Brien is spearheading the government’s plan to stop young people starting smoking and vaping.\nThe MP, who is also Minister for Public Health, is this week launching a consultation on the government’s proposals on vaping and smoking.\nThe Prime Minister recently announced that a new law will see those born on or after 1 January 2009 – who are currently 14 - not allowed to buy cigarettes.\nThe government is also consulting ahead of a new law to clamp down on youth vaping, which is growing dramatically.\nNeil O’Brien said:\n“When I visit local schools and talk to young people in the constituency it is clear that they are concerned about the rapid growth of vaping among young people. Teachers are warning me that growing numbers of children are vaping, and consuming so much nicotine that they are distracted at school or not sleeping well.\nA few months ago I announced a new enforcement squad to tackle those who are selling vapes to children, and that squad is now starting to get up and running. But it is clear that we also need to take action to stop these firms targeting kids. So many vapes are being sold with cartoon packaging, bright colours and flavours like bubblegum that it is obvious that they are targeting children . At the moment there are no controls on how they are sold either, so any sort of shop can stick a pack of vapes on their checkout, even sweetie shops. So we are consulting on controlling flavours, packaging and how they are sold.\nOne factor that has really driven children vaping is the growth in really cheap, disposable vapes made in China. They are also an environmental issues – the battery and electronics are thrown away after a single use and they are causing an increasing number of bin fires. So we will look to control the growth of disposable vapes in particular.\nWhile smoking has fallen a lot since the 1970s, still nearly one in eight people aged 18-24 smoke. We know that four out of five people who smoke take it up before they are 20, and then they get hooked for life. About three quarters of smokers want to quit and wish they had never smoked, but it is really addictive and hard to quit once you are hooked. It takes the average smoking quitter on average 30 attempts to quit.\nSadly, 64,000 people a year still die from smoking. It causes around 1 in 4 of all UK cancer deaths, but what people don’t always know is that it massively increases health problems in all areas: smoking increases the risk of stillbirths, strokes, heart attacks and also the risk of dementia.\nWe aren’t going to criminalise smoking at any age. But the key is to stop young people getting hooked. So we are going to change the law so that children born on or after 1 January 2009 will never be able to be legally sold cigarettes. This will mean effectively raising the age of sale by one year each year for this generation, to prevent them and future generations from ever taking up smoking in the first place. We have two children and no parent wants their child to start smoking.\nTo help people who already smoke we are doubling funding of local stop smoking services, and to stop cigarettes being sold to children we are strengthening enforcement activity with new funding and new powers to fine rogue retailers.”"
