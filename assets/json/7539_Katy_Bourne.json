  "https_www_katybourne_com_/https_www_katybourne_com_news_immediate-justice-successfully-dealing-antisocial-behaviour-sussex/content_23.html": "Our Sussex Immediate Justice (IJ) pilot is working and we now have 319 referrals to date.\nThe programme sees offenders of antisocial behaviour (ASB) make visible and meaningful amends to individuals, communities or organisations harmed by their actions and gives victims of ASB a say in how their offender does this. Our IJ Taskforce works with a multitude of partners across the county who refer people into the scheme, including Red Snapper Managed Services (RSMS) who facilitate adult referrals in East and West Sussex.\nSpeaking about her continued support for the programme, Sussex Police & Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said: “When I first heard about Immediate Justice, I implored the previous Government to make Sussex one of their 'Trailblazer Pilot' areas. Diverting offenders away from court and providing interventions to teach them about the effects of their actions is paramount to the success of the scheme. I have watched our Taskforce grow and embed IJ into our communities and, working with Sussex Police, I am proud to say that our model is proving highly successful.\n“Antisocial behaviour is a crime which should never be taken lightly or seen as ‘low level’. It can have long-lasting, negative effects on its victims and our well-loved neighbourhood spaces. Ensuring that offenders of ASB make amends visibl, not only deters them from committing the same crime again but gives victims the assurance that they will be listened to and taken seriously.”\nWest Sussex has seen 21 referrals in September alone, with East Grinstead and Horsham Town Centre benefitting from reparative activity.\nEAST GRINSTEAD (see picture)\nAn individual was caught in possession of cannabis and referred to Immediate Justice to complete reparative activity and was asked to help move wooden pallets in order to build the East Grinstead Bonfire for later in the year. The individual arrived promptly for their reparative session and engaged positively with the task and other residents working on the build.\nThe activity was very labour-intensive, transporting heavy pallets across a field in the rain and the individual felt a great sense of pride at the end of the activity seeing the work they’d contributed to the build. They also expressed an interest in returning to East Grinstead for the bonfire event as they felt proud of being part of the team to build it.\nThe bonfire took place on 19th October and was a great success. East Grinstead Bonfire Chairman, Terry Deadman said: “The main aims of East Grinstead Community Bonfire as a group of volunteers is to supply a free annual event to the community of East Grinstead, fundraise to support at least two different small local charities in our area and try to bring additional business to our local traders.\n“When we were contacted by Immediate Justice, we read that their aims are to offer unpaid work in the community as a form of reparation and as this could be by helping local community groups, we felt it was a great opportunity for us to offer our assistance. “The person we had to help us move the 500 pallets, which were used to build our bonfire, along with his supervisor, really got involved, he was a great help to us on the day.\n“He should feel really proud of what he helped us to achieve, in the short time we had available, in appalling weather. He was a willing worker and our event was a great success, which was enjoyed by a huge number of people from the community of East Grinstead.”\nHORSHAM (see pictures)\nHorsham Town Centre has seen benefits from the Sussex Immediate Justice programme after reparative activity took place in the Forum car park and at Horsham Youth Club.\nThe Forum - An individual who committed a public order offence received a Conditional Caution requiring them to complete twelve hours of reparative activity. The case was referred to Horsham District Council and to Red Snapper Managed Services, who specialise in intervention services, to organise the clean-up of the Forum car park, a well-used asset within the town centre and Horsham Youth Club. The individual spent six hours clearing scuffs and dirt from walkways and pavements whilst also removing debris from other areas making a positive difference to the space.\nHorsham Parking Manager, Rob Leet said: \"We’re grateful to the Immediate Justice team for their hard work at The Forum car park in Horsham. Their efforts have delivered excellent, visible results, helping to keep Horsham town centre clean and welcoming for everyone. We look forward to working with them again in the future.”\nThe supervisor from RSMS overseeing the activity reflected on the activity: \"Working alongside the individual was a pleasure, he was compliant helpful and worked hard. The area of carpark we cleaned had not been touched in years and by cleaning this up, we made the area safer (no litter rubbish or slippery surface) to walk on and a lot more presentable to the public.\"\nHorsham Youth Club - They then spent a further six hours at the Youth Club clearing leaves from the club’s outdoor space, which includes a basketball court. The individual was compliant throughout and worked hard to clear leaves and moss across the space. His supervisor highlighted that he was friendly, cooperative and put his maximum effort into the activity.\nRSMS Immediate Justice Operations Manager for Sussex, Lilly Waters said: \"To meet the reparative goals of Immediate Justice, Red Snapper have made close partnerships with local authorities and councils, allowing them the opportunity to provide us specific locations within districts across Sussex that need attention. Working directly with communities continues to allow us to demonstrate swift, visible and victim focused action through the Immediate Justice Scheme, not only providing positive outcomes for communities and victims of ASB but supporting offenders to feel a sense of belonging and purpose which are core contributors to the prevention and diversion from further offending.\"",

I now look forward to Roadways having the same success and an improved partnership-working approach with Sussex Police to achieve this. Whether its road workers, refuse collectors, retail staff or emergency service staff – no one should feel unsafe at work.\nA representative from Roadways said: \"Highway workers are not just part of the scenery on our roads—they are dedicated to making travel safer and smoother for everyone.\n!These skilled professionals work tirelessly in challenging conditions to repair, maintain, and improve our roads.

The young person’s parent or guardian is also offered sessions.\nThe programme covers a wide variety of topics and is tailored to the young person’s needs and experiences. The sessions can focus on: education looking at what online grooming and sextortion is; how to use apps safely; exploring where messages may end up; talking about what privacy means and the implications of sharing photos, as well as discussing online content, contact and conduct.\nSpecialist caseworkers also discuss with children and young people how to make reports and the types of scenarios when they may need to use reporting tools. The aim of the sessions is to understand how a child or young person is feeling about their experiences and provide education and learning tools through various activities, videos and conversations.\nSussex Police & Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said: “Technology plays a role in everyday life and we cannot prevent young people from being online. Programmes like Project SOLAH are vital in ensuring we teach children essential skills on how to navigate the internet and social media apps safely as well as how to spot any red flags, behaviour or any requests that make them feel uncomfortable.\n“The previous Government made great strides to pass the Online Safety Bill and it’s important that further pressure is maintained so that companies ensure their platforms are safe and secure for children. We must not give criminals a master key to our homes and the lives of our young people.”\nYMCA DownsLink Group ‘What is Sexual Exploitation’ (WiSE) project manager Harriet Nixon said: “We have seen the continued increase of online grooming within our work with Sussex Police on the SOLAH project. This includes an increase of primary aged school children and young people with multiple needs.\n“The impact on children and young people groomed online is significant. In can lead to self-harm, suicide ideation and have negative impact on mental health and wellbeing.\n“Our WiSE work is vital. We support children, young people and their families to understand the risks online and we create safety plans. Importantly, we give them a space to understand their experiences through a non-judgemental trauma-informed lens to process what happened for them.\n“Our specialist Advanced Child Sexual Exploitation Practitioners (ACSEP) trained team continues to deliver child led sessions using psychoeducational tools to safely explore the online world.”\nBarnardo’s Assistant Director of Sussex Children's Services, Amanda Storie said: “Being a victim of child sexual abuse has devastating, life-long consequences. Children are spending more and more time online, where they can be targeted by abusers, often acting anonymously and posing as young people.\n“Project SOLAH provides vital support from specialised practitioners around using the internet and social media safely, including spotting the signs of online grooming and exploitation, and discusses what healthy relationships look like.\n“Some of the young people who’ve benefitted from the project told us that the sessions increased their awareness of the potential risks online, and taught them how to be more alert, but also increased their confidence in knowing how to navigate the online world safely.”\n“Social media companies need to be much more proactive in their attempts to tackle child sexual abuse on their platforms. The Online Safety Act will improve protections, but children cannot be left at risk in the meantime. That’s why we are asking tech companies to introduce stronger safety measures as a matter of urgency.”",

The week provides an opportunity to highlight how specialist stalking services can work with the healthcare sector to recognise victims of stalking and ensure they access the support they need– whether they be patients or members of staff themselves.\nAny fixated and unwanted behaviour can be classed as stalking. If someone’s behaviour is making you uncomfortable, scared or threatened, report it to the police.\nPolice & Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said: “Stalking is a calculated crime carried out by people wanting to manipulate, control and instil fear in their victims. It is often complex and continues for a long period of time before the victim reports to the police so, without robust and meaningful intervention, a perpetrator’s fixated and relentless behaviour often causes devastation.\n“It has always been clear to me that, if you don’t understand something, you cannot tackle it effectively which is why, in 2019, I commissioned a report led by experts that outlined how to further improve Sussex’s response to stalking. The next year, Sussex Police successfully secured the very first Stalking Protection Orders in the country.\n“Later that year, I was delighted to secure nearly £100,000 from the Government to establish a pioneering intervention programme to change stalking behaviour. The initiative was the first of its kind locally and nationally, with perpetrators of stalking participating in twelve, intensive one-to-one sessions where their cases were forensically dissected and future focus placed on maintaining non-offending behaviour.\n“Today, the programme continues to deliver outstanding results. In the last year, of the 15 participants who completed the intensive programme, 90% of the perpetrators have committed no further stalking-related offences.\n“In Sussex, we are also lucky to have a dedicated advocacy service called Veritas Justice. They offer so much more than just a support service and are often described by victims and survivors as a lifeline. It is my privilege to be able to financially support the amazing team at Veritas and their work, alongside the ongoing and diligent efforts of Sussex Police, means that stalking is taken very seriously in our county.”",

  "https_www_katybourne_com_/https_www_katybourne_com_news_nobody-left-behind-sussex-hosts-its-biggest-domestic-abuse-conference/content_24.html": "I was delighted to host Sussex's largest-ever conference on tackling Domestic Abuse with partners from Victim Support and West Sussex County Council’s Domestic Abuse Team at The Amex in Brighton last week. The theme for the conference was ‘Nobody Left Behind’.\nThe 300+ attendees included service providers, survivors and those wanting to learn more about how to provide support to domestic abuse victims. The large attendance made this the biggest event focusing on domestic abuse ever held in our county.\nIt was my privilege to open the conference, highlighting the sheer volume of providers working across the county to end domestic abuse and support those affected by it. I explained how my role works to support provisions already in place and to help fund new ones where needed.\nI announced that, for the year ahead, I would be funding additional training to support child victims of domestic abuse with neurodiverse needs, especially as this had been identified as a gap in our current service provision.\nI will also be looking to further support providers who have been impacted by National Insurance increases - more on this to follow soon.\nAttendees also heard from Faye Mills May, Sussex Domestic Abuse Partnership Board Manager, regarding the new, soon-to-be-launched pan-Sussex Domestic Abuse Strategy, emphasising that victims' voices had been at the heart of its re-development.\nThe variety of speakers at the event demonstrated the different forms that domestic abuse can take:\nMark Brooks OBE led a discussion about the work of ManKind Initiative, supporting male victims of domestic abuse. Mr Brooks’s talk focused on how male support could be improved and societies’ views on gender-based domestic abuse. He highlighted the excellent work being delivered by the dedicated male IDVA’s in Sussex - employed by Victim Support and funded by PCC Bourne.\nFrank Mullane MBE spoke about his work and how providers need to assist survivors to reach ‘self-actualisation’ and make choices for themselves when navigating life post-abuse. Frank set up Advocacy After Fatal Domestic Abuse in 2008, following the murders of his sister Julia and nephew William in 2003. Frank helped ensure Domestic Homicide Reviews (DHRs) became law and led the development of the Home Office DHR Guidance.\nLaToya Ridge, Deputy Service Director Victim Support, spoke about marginalised groups and the importance of learning and understanding nuances that can help their survival journey. The presentation focused on Black women, who are disproportionately affected by domestic homicide and how abusers use control tactics within the LGBTQ+ and disabled community. LaToya was keen on ensuring that providers are questioning whether their service caters well enough for these groups.\nLuke Kendall started the afternoon discussing the DRIVE project - a Respect, SafeLives and Social Finance collaboration for high-risk/harm perpetrators of domestic abuse which was first pioneered in Sussex in conjunction with my office. Luke is an accredited IDVA, Independent DHR Chair and a Forensic Psychology postgraduate who has published a paper on the prevalence of suicide within domestic abuse perpetrator cohorts.\nDuring the afternoon of the conference, there was also a focus on the NSPCC Domestic Abuse Recovering Together programme, commonly known as DART, which is run by My Sisters House in Sussex. Through video form, two young girls who had participated in the DART Programme, spoke about their experience of the process with their mothers. Both highlighted that the programme provided them with a safe space, a place to learn to speak their truth and to bond with their mum after undergoing an incredibly traumatic time in their life.\nAfter this, a survivor of domestic abuse and member of the Sussex Voices of Lived Experience Board, spoke about their experience as a non-binary, wheelchair user and the barriers they faced due to lack of specific help which led to their escape from domestic abuse being even more harrowing and damaging.\nThe final item of the day was a panel of professionals, survivors and service providers and the audience was encouraged to ask any questions and open up conversations for learning and improvement.\nWest Sussex High Sheriff Mrs Philippa Gogarty then closed the day, thanking all delegates and participants for their dedication, bravery and passion to ending domestic abuse. Reflecting on her own awareness of domestic abuse and available help in Sussex, Mrs Gogarty encouraged everyone to continue learning, always. This was supported by the day encouraging everyone in the room to reflect, listen, learn and collaborate.\nSpeaking about the event, Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said: “It was a real privilege to welcome everyone to today’s conference and to help support the event financially. It brought together a huge number of individuals from across Sussex and beyond, all focussed on the same cause – ending domestic abuse, sharing good practice and supporting survivors. I am so very grateful to all involved for their time, efforts and resource in bringing such a successful event to completion.\n“In Sussex, we are lucky to have a wealth of service providers and charities working around the clock to help those in their deepest hour of need. However, as today’s event has shown, we can and must always strive to do more. I am optimistic that the day will ignite a spark of change to further improve the care and support that survivors of domestic abuse so desperately require.”\nSidonia Porteous, Operations Manager at Victim Support Sussex said:\n“It was brilliant to see so many local partners come along to discuss how we can work together to tackle domestic abuse. We received fascinating talks from local experts and heard directly from a domestic abuse survivor, who generously spoke about their challenges navigating the criminal justice system. Delivering effective support to domestic abuse victims in Sussex requires collaboration between charities, health workers and criminal justice agencies. The conference was another huge step towards improving joint working and boosting education and understanding about domestic abuse in Sussex.”\nJim Bartlett- Head of Community Safety and Wellbeing said:\n“At West Sussex County Council, we continue to prioritise the provision of life saving and life changing services to survivors of domestic abuse and their children, both directly through our own services, and via our diverse specialist providers.\nI was honoured to join the team at the Sussex wide Domestic Abuse Conference where we spent the day listening to subject matter experts and survivors share their knowledge, experience and insight on how we can work together to ensure that Sussex is a safe place for everyone, and a place where they are certain, that if needed, the right services are available to help.\nWe heard that Domestic Abuse is a national emergency, but that together we can and will strive to end Domestic abuse, for good, ensuring that nobody is left behind’\nWest Sussex High Sheriff, Philippa Gogarty reflected on her educational journey of understanding regarding domestic abuse in Sussex:\n“When I took up office in April last year I thought I had a handle on the issues facing our communities in Sussex. I did not. I admit that most of what I thought I knew was incorrect. I was shocked that reports of Domestic Abuse in West Sussex were up by 97% on the previous year and it is one of the main reasons the police will attend an incident. I wonder if we have ever fully acknowledged the true scale of the problem and rather than having a full debate we tend to minimise and excuse behaviours that are intolerable unfair and unsafe.”",

It facilitates the sharing of intelligence to gain a clearer picture of those who are behind the increase in retail crime.\nOpal’s team receives referrals from police forces and retailers and builds intelligence packages, mapping out offending across the country and providing investigative support to bring the highest harm offenders to justice. A package will then be collated and shared with the most appropriate police force to progress the investigation and take action against offenders.\n92 referrals from retailers and organisations have been accepted and taken on by the team, impacting on more than 62 businesses. Positive identification has been made of 228 previously unknown offenders, supporting the re-opening of previously closed investigations and new lines of enquiry.\nThe team has also identified 70 vehicles being used in organised retail crime and affected 28 property seizures, including 14 vehicles. 32 court outcomes have resulted from the 93 arrests made, with prison sentences totalling over 19 years. Five individuals have been deported.\nThe upcoming publication of Opal’s Organised Retail Crime Threat Assessment will provide a detailed insight to the scale of offending and the increasingly sophisticated nature of the groups involved in shop thefts. The assessment aims to further support policing and retailers in understanding the situation and the most effective ways to tackle this crime wave.\nSussex Police & Crime Commissioner and APCC Joint Lead on Business and Retail Crime, Katy Bourne OBE, said:\n\"After speaking with national retailers who were suffering aggressive assaults on their staff, extensive loss of stock and damage to property, it was clear that we needed a stronger relationship between businesses and police if we stood any chance of tackling the organised crime gangs responsible for blighting our high streets.\n“With the support of the country’s top retailers, I spearheaded the Pegasus Partnership to work with Opal, the national policing unit responsible for tackling serious acquisitive crime. I’m delighted to see the disruptive impact this intelligence-sharing partnership is already having on those organised crime gangs.\n“We must now maintain the momentum in order to keep the public safe, which is why I welcome the £5 million funding boost from the government for the Pegasus Partnership, allowing us to drive forward our urgent work.”\nChief Constable Amanda Blakeman is National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for acquisitive crime. She said:\n“We know that organised criminality has a significant impact on retail crime with offenders targeting multiple force areas and multiple retailers in the hope of going under the radar. Our centralised unit means we can build a detailed picture of offending across borders so there is quite literally nowhere for these individuals and groups to hide.\n“Our work can be as light touch as putting CCTV images through the Police National Database to identify an individual or as extensive as building a detailed intelligence package of offending across multiple areas and retailers but either way, it’s proving extremely effective.\n“It’s like a jigsaw puzzle and we bring together all the pieces to be able to take down those causing the greatest damage to businesses and communities.\n“By working closely with retailers and organisations, like Business Crime Reduction Partnerships, we’re able to support them in gathering intelligence and submitting referrals so we can be even more effective in identifying offenders. Our colleagues in local police forces then do a fantastic job in progressing the investigation, making arrests and bringing charges. It’s a real team effort and we look forward to seeing it progress even further over the next few months.”\nMinister for Crime and Policing, Dame Diana Johnson said:\n“These are promising initial results. Smart, data led policing working with business will be vital to turn the tide on current unacceptable record levels of shop theft.\n“But we know we need to go much further. This is why we’ve committed £5 million over the next three years to continue this specialist work and last week I hosted the first Retail Crime Forum to further drive collaboration between the police and retailers.\n“Retail crime blights our communities and high streets. We are determined to crackdown on this crime through stronger laws and more neighbourhood policing on our streets.”\nResults from the Opal Organised Retail Crime team since 1 May include:\n- 93 arrests from 28 different organised crime groups\n- Responsible/linked to £4,060,942.87 of loss\n- 228 offenders have been identified – ie. Opal was able to link offender/s to an incident where a suspect had previously not been known. Whether through the facial recognition database on the Police National Database or other routes.\n- 70 vehicles have been identified linked to shop theft offending\n- 90 pieces of intelligence either developed by Opal around ORC or intelligence received from retailers - then submitted into policing\n- 194 collaborations and coordinations – where Opal has brought together police forces and/or retailers in a joint approach to disrupt an organised crime group.\n- 32 court outcomes related to shop theft offenders\n- A total of 19 years in prison sentences for those who have already been through the courts (more to follow)\n- 5 offenders deported\n- 28 items of property seized including 14 vehicles.",

  "https_www_katybourne_com_/https_www_katybourne_com_news_sussex-pcc-wins-national-award-again-outstanding-independent-custody-visiting-scheme/content_21.html": "The Office of the Sussex Police & Crime Commissioner has been recognised nationally for the outstanding quality of its independent custody visiting scheme.\nUnder this scheme, trained volunteers (Independent Custody Visitors or ICVs) make regular unannounced visits to police custody suites to check on the rights, entitlements, wellbeing and dignity of the detainees held there. Their findings are reported to the Police and Crime Commissioners and Police Authorities who hold Chief Constables to account.\nThe Independent Custody Visiting Association (ICVA) - the national membership organisation that supports, leads and represents these schemes - has developed a quality assurance framework to assess how well schemes comply with the code of practice that governs custody visiting.\nThis is the second time that schemes have been assessed under the framework and have been able to gain quality assurance awards to recognise the value of their work. Sussex’s ICV scheme was presented with a Platinum quality assurance award by ICVA on Wednesday 29 November, at a ceremony in Birmingham.\nSussex Police & Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said: “This is the second time our ICV scheme has been awarded the highest standard of accreditation.\n“Our volunteers, led by our ICV Manager, truly go above and beyond, dedicating hours of their time upholding the rights and dignity of those held in custody, who are often at their most vulnerable. This year, not only have they demonstrated top marks against the quality assurance framework but have also been fundamental in developing new national recommendations to further the well-being of detainees.\n“ICV’s do an outstanding job of monitoring an essential but often unseen side of policing.\nDame Anne Owers, Chair of ICVA, said: \"Independent custody visiting schemes ensure that the public have oversight of a high pressure and often hidden area of policing. These awards demonstrate how local schemes use volunteer feedback to make change and ensure that police custody is safe and dignified for all.”\nSherry Ralph, Chief Executive at ICVA said: “The quality assurance framework represents a significant amount of additional work to ensure that independent custody visiting is regularly reviewed, improvements are made where they are needed and excellent practice is shared. I congratulate schemes on their accomplishments and thank them for their commitment.\"\nSussex’s ICV scheme Manager, Claire Taylor said: “I am extremely proud of our Independent Custody Visitors. This achievement would not have been possible without their unbreakable commitment, skills and expertise in visiting and independently monitoring police custody. I am grateful to PCC Katy Bourne for recognising the value of the accreditation and assistance to the Scheme, together with the steadfast support of Sussex Police Custody Department and the Independent Custody Visiting Association.\n“Working together, we have secured a number of important local and national improvements to the care, dignity and well-being of vulnerable detainees. We continue to work hard to maintain these standards and secure further improvements to make police custody a better place for vulnerable members of our community.”",

Once applied to tools and equipment, the indelible liquid dries clear, cannot be scratched off and can only be identified through UV lights and specialist microscopes. Each tool or piece of equipment is then marked in a secure register so that, if theft occurs, police are able to identify the goods as stolen and reunite them with the owner.\nThe kits can mark up to 50 pieces of equipment and usually cost around £60 each. However with the funding from PCC Katy Bourne and the NFU, Sussex Police’s Rural Crime Team will be distributing the kits free of charge to farmers throughout the county. They will also supply and install signage, deterring thieves from entering the land and letting them know that the farm’s equipment and vehicles have been protectively marked.\nWhere these specialist kits have been deployed in other parts of the country, police forces and SelectaDNA report some great successes. In North Yorkshire, there was a 91% reduction in theft and burglary offences from 1,500 farms which had been given SelectaDNA kits (compared to the same period in 2023) and in Sussex, an earlier trial of the kits in Rother saw a 52.9% reduction in burglary.\nSpeaking about funding the kits, Sussex Police & Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said: “Stolen machinery and vehicles are not easy or cheap to replace and thefts can mean that farmers are unable to plant, harvest and maintain crops and manage livestock. With rural crime costing the UK over £50 million a year, it was clear we needed to do more to protect Sussex farmers.\n“Having previously commissioned a limited rollout of the kits in East Sussex with positive results, I am glad to be able to do this on a much larger scale, working closely with the NFU and Sussex Police’s dedicated Rural Crime Team. It is proven that marking and signage has a deterrent effect as it not only improves the chances of farmers being re-united with their stolen property but also increases the odds of criminals actually being convicted.\n“In the coming months, I look forward to hearing how many farms across our county have been given SelectaDNA kits for free and I will work closely with the Chief Constable to scrutinize statistics of rural theft in Sussex. Hopefully, with this modern, forensic equipment marking technology, we will see greater reductions in rural crime.”\nManaging Director, Selectamark Security Systems plc said: “This is such an important initiative, given the pressures on UK farmers these days.\n“By marking vital equipment and displaying the warning signage, SelectaDNA is proven to work as an extremely effective theft deterrent. This exciting project is a brilliant example of partnership working, with Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner, Sussex Police, NFU and SelectaDNA coming together to drive rural crime out of Sussex.”\nNFU West Sussex Chair Andrew Strong, who farms near Haywards Heath, said: “Equipment theft continues to be a big problem for farmers and growers across Sussex, and across the country, so a scheme like this is very much-needed.\n“The reduction in theft and burglary in north Yorkshire, as a result of using these specialist kits, is hugely impressive. We were very impressed by what we saw at the demonstration of the specialist kits with Sussex Police last week and feel confident this will make a real impact.\n“We are extremely grateful to Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne and her team for their very generous funding towards this. The NFU and the farming community has a very positive relationship with the PCC and Sussex Police’s Rural Crime Team and this is another great example of us all working together. We are happy to continue support projects like this and do all we can to tackle rural crime.”\nSussex Police Rural Crime Team lead, Detective Superintendent Jon Robeson, said: \"Crime within our rural and farming communities remains a priority for Sussex Police. Our dedicated Rural Crime Team are committed to making our rural communities a hostile environment for criminals, and will continue to pursue such offenders and ensure a visible policing presence to deter them.\n“These marking kits are a vital tactical option and enable our team to support farmers in marking property, which reduces the attractiveness to thieves and increases the chance of recovery and prosecution if stolen. In other areas where these have been employed, they have led to significant reductions in burglaries.”\nIf you work within the farming and agricultural sector and would like to express interest in tools and equipment marking kits, you can contact the Sussex Rural Crime Team by emailing: [email protected]",
  "https_www_katybourne_com_/https_www_katybourne_com_news_katy-good-morning-britain-discussing-governments-bogus-promise-more-police-officers/content_19.html": "Smoke and mirrors over extra police numbers\nI was interviewed on Good Morning Britain to speak about today’s announcement by the Government to restore public confidence in policing.\nWhilst any uplift in numbers is to be welcomed, let’s be clear, Labour's election manifesto promised 13,000 extra “police” and the public rightly expected this to mean police officers. In reality, police forces will only be getting a handful of police officers - and for Sussex this means just 43 more.\nThis is because only 3,000 of the 13,000 promised will actually be police officers. The other 10,000 “extra police” will be a mix of PCSOs (with no warranted powers) Special Constables (volunteers who work 16 hours per month) and staff who have been redesignated from other duties.\nWhilst PCSOs and Special Constables bring great benefits and play a valid part in modern policing, I am sure I am not alone in finding this news disappointing as we were led to believe the 13,000 would all be police officers.\nThe Government’s funding settlement for policing leaves forces nationally with a £118million gap this year. Here in Sussex, despite a stringent efficiency programme, we still have £5million of savings to find because we receive the fifth lowest funding per head of population with local taxpayers paying the seventh lowest police precept in their council tax bills. Police forces are also struggling to balance their books because of the Chancellor’s increase in National Insurance costs, despite manifesto pledges not to raise taxes. Our Sussex-based victims’ services are also facing these unwelcome additional National Insurance rises which is why I have stepped in to cover the increase for the coming year.\nThe previous Conservative Government’s Uplift programme to deliver 20,000 more police officers did just that and helped me to deliver record numbers of police officers for Sussex. Thanks to that extra money, we now have 739 additional police officers, making our county one of the safest in England and Wales with more police officers in over a decade.\nThis Government sweet talked voters with exaggerations about police and community safety that will leave a bitter after taste when the uplift in visible policing turns out to be smoke and mirrors and yet another bogus Labour promise."
