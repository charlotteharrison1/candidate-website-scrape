After 14 years of Conservative rule that has left families financially strained and the nation more vulnerable, it’s time to turn the page. We have the chance to rebuild Britain to serve the interests of working people and restore two key principles: that politics should put public service above self-interest, and that hard work should give everyone a fair chance to succeed.\nPreviously, I have served as a councilor for six years delivering high-quality public services that support the most vulnerable and working hard to deliver real life chances to everyone in the borough. As the MP for Barking constituents, you will always be my number one priority. I’m here to work with local people to get things done and be your local voice for Barking. I will stand up for you in Parliament and champion local issues that matter most to you, from tackling antisocial behaviour to securing more NHS appointments.\nUnder the new Labour government, change has begun— from fixing our foundations to rebuilding Britain. I will fight for you and deliver for our Barking community.\nAs your Labour MP for Barking, I will be your voice in Parliament and fight for the change we need\nThanks to Keir Starmer, Labour is back in the service of working people. I have been lucky enough to earn your vote and be your Member of Parliament and proud to be in the service of Barking.\nI want us to build a better future for Barking after the Conservatives have run our country into the ground.- everyone from local business owners to pensioners are feeling the impact of this.\nThe county needs change and Labour has a plan to deliver it.\nWe will get Britain building again, delivering the homes we so desperately need.\nWe will get our NHS back on its feet, cutting waiting times and ending the scramble residents are seeing for GP appointments.\nWe will create a publicly-owned clean power company to cut your energy bills.\nWe will take back our streets, with 13,000 more neighbourhood police and PCSOs, and we will break down the barriers to opportunity for all in Barking.\nOur plan is fully funded, fully costed, and in motion.\nGot a question, want more information or need help with a local issue?
