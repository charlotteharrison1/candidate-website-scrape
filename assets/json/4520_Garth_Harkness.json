The motion, supported by Liberal Democrat Councillors, called for the government’s recently-published proposals to radically reform the planning process to be scrapped.\nConservative Councillor Graham Sheldon spoke, and voted, against the motion arguing that: “The once in a generation reforms will lay the foundations for a brighter future for Oldham and Saddleworth”, but his enthusiasm is not shared by Conservative Councillors elsewhere.\nA recent survey by Savanta Comres of Conservative Councillors across the country found 61% opposed to the government’s proposals, contained in a White Paper called Planning for the Future. This majority believe the proposals will make planning less democratic as elected members and members of the public will largely be excluded from the planning process, with decisions being handed over to unelected planning officers and developers being given more freedom to build as they wish, rather than as the public wants.\nCouncillor Sheldon also argued that the proposals in the White Paper will ensure that: “Green spaces will be protected for future generations”, but this is also a conviction out of step with his party colleagues. 70% of Conservative Councillors surveyed by Savanta Comres wanted to see an increase in the land allocated to Green Belt. The Planning for the Future proposals would diminish green space provision as unprotected farm land and open land would be made available for future development.\nSaddleworth North Liberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness said: “Once again, the Saddleworth Conservatives have shown their support for both planning democracy and the Green Belt is fickle. In the debate, Liberal Democrat Councillors spoke and voted against the proposals.\n“Planning for the Future will clearly lead to less planning democracy, less security for our precious green spaces, less social and affordable housing, and poorer housing standards. It is not planning ‘red tape’ that is preventing the building out of development sites with the new homes that we need. There is already planning permission for developments amounting to one million houses. It is greedy developers who are sitting on land, land-banking their sites, in the hope that house prices will go up”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Council agreed to write to the Secretary of State expressing their strong reservations at the proposed planning changes which will remove any the need for planning permission for extensions and conservatories. A technical consultation process has just begun and the Parish Council will now be outlining their opposition to the proposals as part of the consultation process. Oldham Council passed a similar motion at their meeting on 7th November 2012.\nCllr Garth Harkness proposing the motion said:-\n“I think this plan is ill thought through. The proposal will only be in force for a short time but the consequences will be seen for many years to come. This contradicts the whole idea of having local communities having more of a say in their area. The numbers also do not add up. There are around 400 thousand homes that have been given planning permission yet remain unbuilt by developers. We need more affordable housing yet many planning permissions remain undeveloped and this policy does nothing to attempt to address this.”\nCllr Mike Buckley, seconded adding:\n“The proposals put our heritage at risk. There would be no protection for ill thought through and inappropriate schemes. It will put the appearance and character of our villages and historic buildings seriously at risk. There always needs to be an element of scrutiny and review in any development that affects the appearance of a building. The present rules work well. If a proposal respects the character of a building, the character of the surrounding area and the amenity of neighbours it gets permission. The proposals are misguided – it’s not the planning rules that are holding back the building industry it’s the state of the economy.”\nExtending permitted development rights for homeowners and businesses: Technical consultation\nCloses 5pm 24th December 2012 –Can be found here:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/extending-permitted-development-rights-for-homeowners-and-businesses-technical-consultation\nLeave a Reply",

If you’re disabled and you have a vehicle, then you need to be able to access it easily.”\nSaddleworth West and Lees candidate Mark Kenyon has repeatedly called for the Council to look at providing advisory parking bays, which provide a much more cost-effective way to indicate that disabled parking is required.\nHe said: “When we raised this with the Council at first, they claimed that the bays were illegal – which they had to acknowledge was incorrect when we showed them that the Parliamentary reports allowing them, and even that several boroughs across Greater Manchester were already using them.\n“This could be cheaper and simpler for the Council to implement – done well it would be a win all round, for the Council and for residents with disabilities who need better access to their cars.”\nCouncillor Harkness concluded: “Council officials have committed to assessing all outstanding applications by next month and consulting with the Labour Cabinet Member to get a clear indication of their spending priorities. After failing to provide a disabled parking bay for three years, I hope that will now see the importance of this.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group certainly wish to see more power and more revenue being devolved from Whitehall to local town halls so this is a big step in the right direction.\n“At the last Council meeting in October, I expressed my support for devolution and offered my full support to the Council Leader in achieving it.\n“The plan will devolve real powers to a new Greater Manchester Authority, led by an elected Mayor, allowing significant improvements to our infrastructure, the creation of more efficient and joined up public transport network and thousands of new homes to be built, whilst creating many more, much needed businesses and local jobs.\n“There is no doubt this will all have a positive impact on Oldham’s economy as one of the ten beneficiary authorities.\n“Another spin-off benefit will be amalgamation of the powers and responsibilities of the Police and Crime Commissioner, a post that has never been popular and the loss of which will not be lamented.\n“However the new Mayor will only be elected in 2017, after a delay of almost two and a half years and after a General Election, with all the uncertainties that this brings for the future. In the interim an appointed Mayor will take charge of a vast budget.\n“It is of course early days, but I am concerned that as yet there appears to be no concrete proposals in place to scrutinise the actions of the appointed Mayor or of the ten local authority Leaders who will sit in judgement on her or him.\n“There have been major past concerns about the accountability of the Police and Crime Commissioner to the public. I would certainly want the Greater Manchester Combined Authority to look at how the Mayor and new authority will be properly accountable to both elected members and the wider electorate.\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats will be looking to ensure that once worked up future governance arrangements balance operational efficiency with public transparency”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Now there is nothing wrong with supporting jobseekers with disabilities to find meaningful and fulfilling employment that is appropriate for them, taking account of their medical conditions, but this support must be accessed voluntarily and it should be adequately funded.”\n“Under these proposals, disabled jobseekers will continue to be subjected to the discredited and reviled Work Capability Assessment and many, despite being plainly sick, will be forced to look for work for which they are incapable. The Employment Related Service Association, which represents organisations offering employment support to disabled jobseekers, has also identified that funding for support will drop to less than £130 million next year.”\nThe Employment Related Service Association recently published a report which identified that the Government’s new Work and Health Programme will deliver support to less disabled jobseekers – down from 300,000 between 2012 and 2015 to 160,000 from 2017 to 2020 – with less funding – down from £750 million in 2013/14 to less than £130 million next year.\nCouncillor Harkness believes that local authorities and local charities are better placed to deliver support services to disabled people:\n“Councils and charities operate on the ground in communities where local disabled people live and local businesses operate. The Liberal Democrats believe that there should be a role for Oldham Council and our charity sector, especially with employment support and training being devolved to Greater Manchester level.”\n“The new Health and Work Programme should provide a stronger role for local authorities and local charities to deliver responsive and value-for-money services to suit local needs and requirements, and to work with local businesses to provide employment on an flexible and accessible basis, and to encourage and support disabled claimants to help them secure work experience placements and employment opportunities in which they have a genuine interest and to which they are suited.”\nCouncillor Harkness is especially hostile to the continued use of the Work Capability Assessment. He added:\n“Our view is simply that the hated Work Capability Assessment must be scrapped. It should be replaced by one that is based on realistic world-of-work tests of capability and functionality, and that takes proper account of medical conditions which fluctuate, mental illnesses, learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities and conditions on the autism spectrum.”\n“Local authorities should be invited to carry out assessments or be responsible for contracting out this function to others. These assessments need to be carried out in a humane and caring manner, with those being assessed being treated with dignity and understanding.”\n“It is also crazy that at present contractors who carry out assessments are not routinely required to contact doctors and other medical professionals caring for the person being assessed to collect relevant evidence. This would mean that more assessment decisions can be right first time, avoiding reconsideration and appeal costs, and more importantly significantly reducing the stress caused to claimants under the present system.”\n“And finally there need to be safeguards enshrined in law so that vulnerable claimants are not sanctioned when they fail to comply with the requirements of the assessment process simply because they cannot understand or engage with them.”\nThe Green Paper is open to responses on the consultation until February 2017.\nCouncillor Harkness said: “The Oldham Council Liberal Democrat Group will soon be making a robust and comprehensive response to this consultation.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is particularly scandalous when these residents are children, elderly people and the vulnerable.\n“As a body, Oldham Council has a legal duty to look after public health and the Liberal Democrats believe that the council should take a lead on this issue by establishing a comprehensive plan of action – a recipe if you will – to address food poverty and insecurity in our borough.”\nThe amendment is backed by Councillor Julia Turner, Liberal Democrat, Crompton.\nCllr Turner added:\n“At various times in the past Liberal Democrats have suggested these ideas to members of the Labour Administration, either in full Council or in letters to senior Councillors. Once again we have come up with some common-sense ideas to support those in need which will make a huge difference in our poorer communities. We are not saying that these will solve all of the problems, but they will be a big help.\n“We now need to act to ensure that not one of our residents goes hungry and we must do it now – the time for talk is over.\n“As this is a non-party political issue, I hope that the amendment will receive cross-party support”.\nThe amendment calls for an action plan specifically to:\nEstablish breakfast clubs in every school and academy in the borough where there is a need for one\nEstablish school holiday food clubs across the borough where there is a need\nEstablish more community cafes, where people in need can access cheap and nutritious meals; community shops, where they can buy good quality surplus food cheaply; and community kitchens, where they can cook their own food rather than having to choose at home whether to use fuel to heat or eat\nWork with N-Power to bring their Fuel Voucher scheme to Oldham\nHost a workshop for schools, academies, faith groups and voluntary sector partners at which organisations offering financial, food and in-kind support can be invited to make presentations to and network with prospective local partners\nEngage with local food retailers to access more of the surplus food that is currently thrown away\nPromote the take up of Healthy Start Vouchers to eligible residents\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Arrangements have been made to hand over the Petition to FirstBus this week at their First Manchester Oldham Headquarters at Wallshaw Street.\nRetired Liberak Democrat Councillor Richard Knowles organised the Greenfield Bus Petition with help from Councillor John McCann, many local residents and local shopkeepers after requests for First Manchester to reinstate the twice hourly service were ignored.\nRichard Knowles, who has lived in Greenfield for over 30 years, says\n“An hourly bus service to Oldham is completely unacceptable. First Bus and Transport for Greater Manchester fail to understand that Greenfield is Saddleworth’s largest village in population but has the worst bus service. Uppermill enjoys three direct daytime buses an hour to Oldham, whilst Diggle and Delph have two per hour and Grotton six per hour.”\nFirstBus are ignoring Greenfield again when they undertake their Saddleworth Bus Consultation later this month based in Uppermill, Delph and Lees.\n“First Bus could easily reinstate Greenfield’s half hourly bus service either by extending one of the Grotton buses or turning back the 180 Bus in Oldham rather than Manchester.”\n1 Comment\nNot to be pedantic or anything, but I would just like to highlight the fact that they in fact enhanced the frequency of the 180-184 between Grotton and Oldham/Manchester to every 7-8 minutes around last Christmas time/just after – therefore the frequency of buses at Grotton is in fact 9 buses per hour (which includes 180/184 and the subsidised Stotts 343). This is further enhanced massively at peak times with extra FirstGroup journeys on the 343 and X84. There is one quite simple negotiative tactic for the Greenfield frequency, though I dare not say it due to not having my own sufficient evidence as to what effect it would have on two other routes in the areas.",

Council minutes have since recorded that the matter is ‘in progress’. After almost two years of waiting for a meeting, Councillor Sykes’ patience has worn thin and he is concerned that time for further meaningful debate on the issue is fast running out.\nCommenting Councillor Sykes said: “The Greater Manchester Spatial Framework will, aside from Coronavirus, have one of the greatest impact of any issue on Oldham and its people, and this impact will be felt for twenty – thirty years. Under the current plans of Labour’s Greater Manchester Mayor and the Leaders of the ten Greater Manchester local authorities, thousands of new homes will be built across the Oldham Borough over two decades.”\n“Many of the Borough’s residents were rightly up-in-arms about the proposals to build most of these new homes on our precious and irreplaceable Green Belt, and Oldham’s Liberal Democrat Councillors joined them on protest marches and by objecting strongly in writing in response to every consultation and by raising questions in Full Council. I now feel it is time for Oldham’s Labour Administration to bring the latest proposals before the elected members who represent the people, and it must be at a one-item Council meeting as this is such an important issue there should be time for proper debate without the distraction of other business.”\nThe letter from Councillor Sykes to the Leader of Oldham Council, Councillor Sean Fielding, is shown below.\n22 July 2020\nCouncillor Sean Fielding, Leader of Oldham Borough Council\nDear Sean Fielding,\nRe: Meeting to discuss Greater Manchester Spatial Framework\nI am writing to you to follow up on my question to you at the full meeting of Oldham Council on 12th September 2018 requesting that a special meeting of the Council be convened with a one-off agenda item to discuss the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework.\nIn your response, you indicated that you were mindful to have an extraordinary meeting with this single item agenda and I would request that this be in addition to the agreed meeting cycle.\nIn ‘Update on Actions’ at last Council (page 133) there was a short note to say this was ‘in progress’ with Constitutional Services.\nI hope that we are not being left behind, and I would appreciate it if you could give me an indication of when this meeting will be held?\nWill it be in the current municipal year or in the 2021/22 Council meeting cycle?\nAre there any provisional dates under consideration which you can share?\nAs always, happy to discuss before a formal response is sent.\nYours sincerely,\nHoward Sykes\nThe question Councillor Sykes asked the Leader in Full Council on 12 September 2018 is shown below\nMr Mayor, my first question tonight relates to a future decision which will be one of the most momentous in its impact on many of our Borough’s residents over the next two plus decades.\nNamely the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) – the adoption of a 20-year housing and industrial land use development plan for Greater Manchester.\nThe revised proposals have been some time coming, but I understand that they will now be available for so called public consultation in October.\nI also understand that a decision has recently been made by the ten Labour Council leaders and the Mayor of Greater Manchester who have decided that the ultimate decision to adopt, or not to adopt the final plans, will rest solely with them.\nThere will be NO requirement to bring the plan to a full meeting of each of the ten Councils for debate and a full vote on formal adoption by all councillors.\nThis is a complete reversal of democracy.\nMembers will recall that many of our residents were outraged when the initial plans to build thousands of new homes on Green Belt land in Shaw, Crompton, Saddleworth, Royton and Chadderton were first unveiled.\nLiberal Democrat colleagues, I and members from the seats opposite, joined them in opposing the proposals when responding to the consultation or attending demonstrations in Tandle Hill Country Park and in Albert Square.\nMr Mayor, public sentiment is still the same across Greater Manchester – NO to building new homes on our Green Belt and YES to local Councillors as the people’s representatives ultimately making the decision where new homes are built.\nWard members are elected to lead, but also to represent the constituents and the communities we serve. How can we do this if we are denied the final vote on the plan?\nIf we get this wrong, it will represent a disaster for our communities and for our Green Belt. Yet the ten Labour Council Leaders and GM Mayor are saying ‘leave it to us, we know what is best for you’.\nIt is simply not right that such an important decision can be taken by so few people.\nIt is certainly not what I and many others envisaged but perhaps it is a sign of things to come with so called devolution to Greater Manchester.\nMr Mayor, I would like to ask the Leader tonight, whether despite this backroom deal, he will still be doing the honourable thing by bringing the final plan back to a meeting of the full Council for debate and adoption.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

(Presently this is capped at 75% of a bill for Band A payers).\nThis is line with the one of the recommendations made by Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Democrat Group, Cllr Howard Sykes, in a letter to Borough Treasurer Steven Mair in October of this year.\nCllr Sykes said: “The Liberal Democrats have always believed that the original discount scheme was not generous enough. It was based on what we felt was an overly pessimistic projected collection rate of only 50%.”\n“Whilst the increase from 75% to 80% is modest, to the poorest Council Tax payers every penny saved will make a big difference so the Liberal Democrats are happy to endorse this.”\nThe Liberal Democrats now hope that the level of support for the poorest will increase further in line with increased collection rates.\n“We would support further increases in line with improvements in the collection rate, added Cllr Sykes, “so long as the overall scheme remains affordable.”\nHowever, disappointingly, the report’s recommendations do not include establishing a discretionary hardship fund rather like that of other Greater Manchester Councils, as suggested by the Lib Dems.\nCllr Sykes said: “The hardship fund was one of a set of practical measures that the Oldham Liberal Democrats proposed to the Council to support the poorest citizens of our borough, particularly those who are disabled or other vulnerable. Gratifyingly, after talking with us, the Labour Administration has taken up many of our suggestions – but in this particular case they have chosen not to do so”.\n“The hardship fund would have been used to support first time Council Tax payers in arrears who are making some payment, yet face, because of exceptional circumstances, undue hardship in discharging their total debt. Liberal Democrats wanted particularly to target this help to claimants with disabilities and long-term debilitating health conditions.”\nCllr Sykes added: “I suggested to the Leader at September Council that the bumper Manchester Airport Group dividend could have be used to support the establishment of this fund – but Labour have chosen not to do so. So my overall verdict of the performance of the Administration on this issue is – making progress but could do better”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

As a ward councillor, I receive many complaints as do my Liberal Democrat colleagues in Shaw and Crompton. Not only is dog mess a disgusting eyesore, but it also represents a health hazard. Children can be blinded by contact with it. Fortunately, most dog owners are responsible and do clean up after their pets, but a small minority unfortunately do not.”\nCouncillor Gloster’s motion is seconded by Liberal Democrat Crompton Councillor Dave Murphy, who proposed a similar motion to Council in 2014. He said: “Following our last motion, the Council introduced a boroughwide Public Space Protection Order, which covers dog fouling, but unfortunately chose not to adopt any new technology to help detect and apprehend offenders. We hope now that the technology is proven that it will now be possible to take a fresh look at tackling this problem.”\nThe motion calls for awareness raising and education to be undertaken to change the behaviour of errant owners and to encourage them to micro-chip their pets so they can quickly be reunited if their pets become lost. However ultimately the Liberal Democrats also recognise that there is the need for a robust enforcement regime.\nCouncillor Gloster added: “Unfortunately there is sometimes the need for a stick when the carrot is insufficient. We would like to see technology introduced so members of the public can report offenders using their smart phones in real time and we want to see the Council imposing the highest on-the-spot fine of £100 on offenders that is permissible under a Public Space Protection Order.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Land can be allocated for residential, industrial, protected open space etc. The majority of the particular one you refer to is currently designated for industrial use. I have seen a number of times when it is applied to be changed to residential by the owner. The council propose to keep this one the same and allocate some others to be for residential use. If land is allocated for industrial then it makes it difficult to stop an industrial development.\nGarth – Thank you for the response",

This is the sort of action you would expect in one party states like North Korea not in English local government\nProposals mean in effect that almost all of the time slot will be monopolised by Labour members\nThe Leader of the Opposition and of the Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council, Councillor Howard Sykes MBE, has attacked the Labour Administration for its proposals to radically alter the Council’s constitution to stifle debate in the Council Chamber.\nIn the proposals to Wednesday’s Annual Council meeting, Labour want to reduce the number of Council meetings in the year at which questions and motions can be tabled by one and to then further reduce the number of questions that members of the opposition parties can ask.\nCommenting Cllr Sykes said: “These proposals are not good for local democracy in Oldham.”\n“In seeking to reduce the number of opportunities where members of the opposition can question the actions of Labour Cabinet members, the public will be left with the impression that Labour is scared of debate and they will ask why?”\n“Perhaps Labour Cabinet members doubt their ability to respond effectively to questions from the floor of the Chamber, or perhaps they have something to hide, but there is no question that given their numbers (45 out of 60) it is always their will as the current majority party that shall prevail.”\n“Surely in a vibrant and healthy democracy, we should be encouraging members of the opposition to have their say in the Chamber and they should have the right to expect proper, considered answers to their questions from the Leader and Cabinet members.”\nUnder the proposals, Cllr Sykes as Main Opposition Leader will see the number of questions that he can ask the Council Leader fall from three to two at each Council, a 33% reduction. Also both the Conservative and UKiP group lose their right to ask a question and theory have to ‘share the right’ to ask one question between them.\n“With such a large majority and control of the Council agenda why reduce the amount the current pitiful time allowed to the opposition even further,” stated Cllr Sykes. “This is the sort of action you would expect in one party states like North Korea not in English local government.”\nCllr Sykes added: “This time slot is time well spent. In the past, there has been significant accord on many issues between myself and the Council Leader Cllr McMahon and in recent Councils, I have raised a number of innovative proposals that the Administration is now investigating, such as establishing a Community Shop to help low-income households source high quality food at low prices, alongside help to find employment, to exploring the geothermic power beneath our feet as a renewable energy source.”\n“The problem I encounter in the run up to each Council is not finding three good-quality questions to ask the Leader, but making a choice of which three of the many sensible and considered questions I have to hand to take into the Chamber.”\nLabour’s other proposal to take other questions on a “politically balanced basis” also do not sit well with Cllr Sykes.\nHe said: “Labour backbenchers have exclusive access to their own Cabinet members in internal group meetings or in their Cabinet Office. Councillors from other parties have neither. The Council Chamber often still remains the best and only place for opposition members to raise issues that are of concern to their constituents, particularly where previous attempts to engage officers or Cabinet members have met with little or no response.”\n“These proposals mean in effect that almost all of the time slot will be monopolised by Labour members with at most one, or perhaps two, questions available to members of the opposition. For the smaller groups on the Council, Conservative (2), UKiP (2) and Independent (1) this means they will be lucky if they ever get to ask a question. Previously ward questions were taken on an alternating basis and this was a sensible arrangement.”\nCllr Sykes stressed that his viewpoint was not just driven by expediency:\n“As a Liberal Democrat, I strongly believe that it is important for all democratically elected representatives to have the opportunity to raise issues in the Council Chamber. I feel particularly sorry that the Conservatives and UKIP as minor opposition parties are being even more short-changed by these proposals”.\nCllr Sykes has tabled amendments to the proposals to retain the existing arrangements.\n1 Comment\nPrevent spending money on tree treatment if the tree is\nin a disorder where it might proceed to stay without the threat.",

This is to aid vulnerable children and protect local education. The National Education Union (NEU) Councillors Network has written a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson for local councillors to sign up to.\nSchools have been underfunded and struggling and the Covid-19 world has increased that mounting pressure. The signed letter has several key demands noted here:\n1. Assurance that families will be eligible for free school meals (FSM) will be given food vouchers during summer holidays.\n2. Government to work with local authorities to protect vulnerable children.\n3. Supporting calls from the teaching profession that schools be reopened when it is safe to do so, for both staff and students.\n4. Local authorities be given a role in coordinating with schools, trade unions and the DfE on a safe end to school closures.\nCouncillor Sykes says: “This letter of support, has been backed by thousands of councillors from all parties and non, hopefully it will send a strong message to central government. I am pleased that all Liberal Democrat Councillors on Oldham Council have signed it.”\nENDS/…\nNotes:\nLetter to Gavin Williamson\nDear Gavin Williamson MP,\nAs local councillors, we are writing to raise concerns in relation to current school closures.\nThe first issue is our concern about the impact school closures are having on disadvantaged students and their families.\nStudents eligible for free school meals (FSM) have had mixed experiences when applying for the Government’s voucher scheme, with some unable to access vouchers to which they are entitled. We would like your assurances that all families with children eligible for FSM will receive vouchers for the full period of school closure, including school holidays. This may need to be in retrospect for families who have not yet been able to access their vouchers.\nWe would ask that the Department for Education (DfE) continues to work with local authorities who are at the forefront of supporting families facing unprecedented food insecurity in the current climate.\nAs you will know, holiday hunger is an issue for many families, and we would like your assurances that families eligible for FSM will be given food vouchers to sustain them during the summer holidays. We believe that this should become a permanent fixture within our school system, so no child need go hungry during the school holidays again.\nWe also have concerns about support for vulnerable children and the increased calls to domestic violence helplines nationally. We would ask that the Government continue to work with local authorities and schools to ensure vulnerable children do not ‘slip through the net’ and the necessary financial support is available to councils to support families fleeing domestic violence.\nFinally, we are concerned by the current speculation on the end to school closures. We find current speculation unhelpful but would like to support the calls from the teaching profession that schools only be reopened when it is safe to do so, for both teachers and students.\nWe also ask that local authorities be given a role in coordinating with schools, trade unions and the DfE on a safe end to school closures.\nWe hope that the Government will continue to collaborate closely with local councils to support families and schools as we weather the current crisis and its aftermath. This will require an end to austerity and a new, long-term, funding settlement for local authorities and schools, to ensure they are best equipped going forward.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Fewer children falling behind means less disruption in class and a better education for everyone”\nCommenting further, Liberal Democrat Schools Minister, David Laws said:\n“We are already seeing across the country how the Pupil Premium is making a difference to children’s lives. Extra tuition, better IT resources and closer work with parents are all examples of how the Pupil Premium is being used to support the most disadvantaged pupils and benefit all their classmates too.\n“That’s why I’m so pleased that, next year, we’ll be extending the Pupil Premium to another half a million children, and increasing the money that schools get to £900 per pupil.\n“This means that, as a result of Liberal Democrats in the Coalition Government, more children will get a better start in life.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

All of these trees have a positive effect on the health and well-being of the people who live, work and visit our borough. I am sure that many residents would wish to do all that they can to preserve the beauty and majesty of the trees in their neighbourhood.”\n“In other local authorities, tree warden schemes have been established so that residents can help preserve, and enhance, the woodland in their locality. Tree wardens are not expected to be experts – only enthusiasts – and there is an expectation that training and support will be made available from Council staff so that they can become progressively more skilled in their role.”\nCllr Harkness added: “In our borough, we already have members of Friends of Parks, Moors and green spaces groups who meet as a network hosted by Voluntary Action Oldham; these dedicated individuals represent a potential source of volunteers.”\nCllr Harkness is backed in his call by Crompton Liberal Democrat Cllr Diane Williamson.\nCommenting, Cllr Williamson said: “Following previous Liberal Democrat calls for more allotments and growing spaces in our borough, Oldham Council now has a Get Oldham Growing Strategy with more funds available for tree planting and a newly-appointed Tree Planting project officer. We can see the potential of tree wardens in supporting the work of this officer.”\n“A tree warden scheme not only embodies our Council’s co-operative principle, but it would also provide worthwhile voluntary work to a great many people and help support our Forest Schools initiative.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The government has passed a Localism Act whose purpose is to pass down decision taking to local people as far as is possible. You may not have heard much about it yet but it will become important and any community which is not able to come together and voice their opinions will tend to lose out. We are your elected councillors and are concerned that in Austerlands we don’t seem to have any organisation to talk with.\nEach year each borough councillor if given a small sum to spend on projects that will provide a lasting benefit for the ward they represent. This year we have decided to support the four existing community associations in this ward by giving them each a donation of £500 which they can spend as they wish. The only condition is that the association has to represent everybody who lives in the area and that there are no annual membership fees.\nNow, We want to encourage the setting up of a new community association for Austerlands and have arranged for an inaugural meeting to take place at 8.00pm at Austerlands Cricket Club on Tuesday 16h April.\nWe have the parish council and district partnership which are very important but community associations can create a further structure for a working partnership with local councillors and enable communities to feed into the district partnerships and parish councils.\nParticularly with the difficult economic climate, of local council cutback a good partnership with councillors and community groups is essential.

We wanted a concessionary fare would make steps forward to improve accessibility in many areas and in remote areas such as places in Saddleworth , transport costs for such groups can be a real issue.\nLabour abstained on our motion at this month’s council meeting to go further for concessions on metrolink and to train champions to get the support used widely.\nWe should not jeopardise all the efforts that have seen unemployment fall and more people in work than ever before by cutting funding to education for 18 year olds.

A lot is being done to tackle young people’s difficulties early but we should not let them down at the last hurdle.\nLiberal Democrats have anchored the government in the centre ground and are determined to protect the most vulnerable. You should tackle an issue early that is why Liberal Democrats ensured that there are free nursery places available for the most vulnerable and that every infant child will receive a free school meal.\nThe Liberal Democrat Pupil Premium ensures that schools receive extra funding for the most vulnerable students and also the catch up premium to help those who are behind at the start of secondary school. All met with little enthusiasm from Labour and Conservatives.\nYou can’t trust Conservatives to be fair. We know the Conservatives want to stop housing benefits for under 25s and consider stopping JSA for young people too. It is depressing when you hear the Labour MP Rachel Reeves saying that Labour would be tougher on welfare than the Tories and are also considering such a policy so you can’t trust Labour either.\nI understand that those at 18 who fail to get a c in English or maths or those with learning difficulties or disabilities. So there is some protection.\nI am not reassured however this will be enough and fear that those who need the extra support to achieve the qualifications they need will end up leaving without the skills to be successful in the work place.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is disappointing that genuine concerns are dismissed in such an insulting way.”\nCouncillor Sam Al-Hamdani added: “I hear about 20mph speed limits from residents more often than almost any other topic; speeding traffic is not only a safety issue, there is a need to reduce damage to parked cars and walls.

They propose to expand the Saddleworth rambler service (356) to cover some of the shortfall but it will see some areas lose bus services and a reduced service for more.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness, Liberal Democrat Councillor for Saddleworth North said\n“Saddleworth have already experienced cuts in bus services to Dobcross, Diggle and Greenfield recently with First bus unwilling to engage with local members and local people. Cutting early morning services and evening services is not satisfactory at all. These proposals will see yet more cuts to services and no guarantees over reliability and capacity to cope.\n“During the consultation for the Greater Manchester Transport Strategy 2020 Saddleworth & Lees District Executive in partnership with Saddleworth Parish council submitted a detailed account of the local transport needs and this proposal does the opposite. It will result in more isolation for the elderly and families without a car who rely on these buses. “\nTransport for Greater Manchester have been consulting on a franchise scheme where they said Buses can be improved and Greater Manchester now has a chance to they say, “do buses differently”.\nMick Scholes , Local Liberal Democrat campaigner for Saddleworth South said:\n“It is with disbelief that there has been a consultation by Labour controlled Transport for Greater Mancheser over having a Greater Manchester Franchise scheme because areas like Saddleworth suffer under the commercial model, yet it is the same organisation which is suggesting that we isolate even more people in Saaddleworth. People use these services to get to work, school or college and the expected lack of reliability and reduction in service will make this extremely difficult for local people.”\nThe proposed cuts have serious implications for residents living on Saddleworth estates away from main roads.\nThe following areas will have no bus service in the future: (national guidelines are that reasonably active people should be able to walk up to 400 metres to/from a bus stop – no mention of hills)\n* Palin Wood Road Delph – up to 700 metres up a steep hill to nearest bus\n* Church Road and Wellmeadow Lane, Uppermill – up to 640 metres up a steep hill to nearest bus\n* Station Road and Grove Road, Uppermill – up to 500 metres up a hill to nearest bus\n* High Grove Road & Church Road, Friezland – up to 500 metres up a steep hill to nearest bus\n* Shaw Hall Bank Road, Friezland – not even mentioned in the officer’s report\nIn the evenings the Greenfield – Denshaw service is reduced from hourly to two hourly; Denshaw to Oldham remains hourly.\nLeave a Reply",

It will be interesting to see if Labour’s commitment to abolishing this for social tenants, should they take office in 2015, will be extended to private tenants. Would they reverse it also? – I doubt it.\nI have no problem with the principle of only paying housing benefit sufficient to cover the housing needs of a tenant, rather than a ‘spare room subsidy’, but I do have major issues with the implementation. It is not fair for some to live in social houses that are bigger than they need whilst others are left in overcrowded accommodation. However, until more one-bed homes for social rent are built and become available, it seems to me also unfair to penalise social tenants falling into arrears when there is no-where suitable for them to move to.\nThe Liberal Democrats at their recent conference criticised the implementation and lack of available alternate accommodation. The party also called for social tenants not to be penalised where there was no alternative accommodation as well as a review of the policy. In the meantime, the Labour-controlled Council can do something though. At July’s Council, the Lib Dems proposed an amendment to a Labour motion on this issue outlining a set of practical measures to support social tenants affected by changes in housing benefit. These included reinstating the downsizing scheme that this Labour council recently abolished, supporting social tenants who wish to take on lodgers, establishing a hardship fund and, and supporting disabled people to take up entitlements to extra bedrooms and Discretionary Housing Payments. Unfortunately Labour chose to vote en-bloc against our proposals – making it all too clear that locally they want to use this issue as a political tool\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

My colleague Cllr Mark Alcock and I proposed an amendment which aimed to address some of the issues of implementation.\nOf course there are problems with some groups who will be adversely affected and so the council have a duty to support them. Labour have chosen not to.\nLet us not forget that they will also have the added burden now and have to pay 25% of their council tax because of this administration’s policy.\nIn Stockport for example, the Discretionary Housing Payment being used to meet the financial shortfall whilst people look for alternatives and this shows the generous approach that council takes where for example they have no minimum payment on council tax unlike here were everyone has to pay 25% regardless of their situation. In Oldham, Labour have so far decided to reject such a proposal. They have also rejected other proposals by Oldham Liberal Democrats.\nBelow is a letter from my colleague Mark Alcock:\nThe Liberal Democrats on Oldham council reacted to the Labour’s spare room subsidy motion at the full council meeting on 17th July 2013 with suggestions to make the implementation fairer and to protect the most vulnerable in Oldham Borough. It is with great regret that the Labour administration chose to vote against these measures that would help the most vulnerable in our society.\nThe size criteria sees the reduction in housing benefits for extra bedrooms, introduced by Labour in 2008 for the private sector, to be included in the social housing sector. There has been no commitment for Labour to overturn this as indeed acknowledged by Labour council leader that they (Labour) would not reverse any of the cuts made by the coalition if they win the next general election.\nThe Liberal Democrat group recently published a 12-point plan to help support the most vulnerable in light of the changes and they have said that this principle should be applied to this motion. They would support the most vulnerable through the changes with the spare room subsidy.\nThere are some protected groups already such as some disabled groups, pensioners and armed forces personnel but we need to do more. An example is that our 12-point plan the Lib Dems have urged Labour to actively take up, this will help those disabled people adversely effected by this.”\nWe could take practical steps such as Vetting and match up tenants who can property share or who wish to take in a lodger, or Ensure that under-occupiers have appropriate additional priority on the waiting list for a smaller more appropriate sized home for them.\nUsing the Discretionary Housing Payment when those outside the exemptions have a genuine case not to downsize and set up a hardship fund for vulnerable tenants like they do in Lib Dem controlled Stockport and be sympathetic to individual cases. We should also meet the financial shortfall whilst tenants look for an alternative smaller home.\nThe Liberal Democrat group agreed to the principle of a spare room subsidy but were critical of it’s implementation and this is why we have suggested practical steps. It is a pitty that Oldham’s Labour group pn mass chose to vote against such proposals, missing another chance to help the most vunerable residents in Oldham. Another case of Labour first, Oldham and it’s residents second.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

These pleas have been ignored and therefore we will redouble our efforts in opposing these plans that will concrete over and change the character of our Borough and especially Shaw and Crompton.\nTo the Liberal Democrat Group and many of our constituents, these plans represent a massive and inequitable land grab in Royton, Shaw and Crompton with the devastation of our local Green Belt and OPOL (Other Protected Open Land).\nIt is proposed that new properties will be built at Cowlishaw; in the Beal Valley; Rushcroft; the Whitfield Farm area over towards Newhey; and around Gravel Hole and Low Crompton.\nAdjacent sites at Broadbent Moss (Oldham), Hanging Chadder (Oldham) and land East and West of the A627M (Rochdale and Oldham) if developed would also see a significant erosion of the Green Belt land in the so called ‘Northern Gateway’.\nIt is the view of the Liberal Democrat Group that there is no justification for the construction of a large number of properties (or indeed any properties) on Green Belt or OPOL before new homes are first built on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted and upon the many derelict and unloved sites in our town centres and districts.\nFurthermore it is our view that conversions should take place so empty mills and factories can be used for housing (buildings and/or sites); as can land marked for industrial/commercial use; and bring the large number of empty homes back into use.\nAll this should be done before any consideration is given to future development on Green Belt or OPOL and this development for Oldham should, in our view, be apportioned better in the Metropolitan Borough rather than disproportionately in Royton, Shaw and Crompton as at present.\nOur existing motorways are frequently constrained by high levels of congestion resulting in unacceptable journey times and additional traffic jams on feeder and local roads. The projected growth of industrial warehousing, office space and new homes will require monumental investment in transport infrastructure. It is of paramount importance to ensure that the transport infrastructure is in place before other building takes place.\nAll the sites identified, especially those in Royton, Shaw and Crompton are devoid of good vehicular access and there is no obvious way to make the necessary improvements.\nCowlishaw has no acceptable roads leading into the proposed site. The topography around the Whitfield Farm area makes it difficult to envisage an elegant solution to site access. Similarly the Beal Valley site is currently served only by a narrow road and the desire to facilitate access to this site by enhancing links to Shaw and Crompton Metrolink Station seem incredulous; the only current access, via Beal Lane, is saturated with existing traffic and HGV movements to and from existing businesses which are large National/European distribution centres.\nThe increase in population will necessitate provision of additional services. The GMSF does not appear to adequately address available funding to deliver on these requirements.\nIn Shaw and Crompton, the necessary infrastructure to support even our existing population is lacking. We have primary schools that are already overcrowded or full; a secondary school that is falling apart; a dilapidated Health Centre that is near cardiac arrest; no swimming facilities or dry leisure provision; precious few youth facilities and no municipal tip.\nUnder the proposals, 3,000 homes will be built in Royton, Shaw and Crompton for growing families. These new residents will need more primary and secondary school places; more GPs and dentists; leisure and shopping facilities; and new highways and more buses and trams to get them there.\nNow doesn’t Oldham Council’s decision to close and not replace the Crompton Swimming Pool and Gym look a little short-sighted given the number of new young residents that will need to learn to swim and the number of adults that will want to keep fit.\nAn important vision of the GMSF is that Greater Manchester becomes as well known for the quality of its environment as for its economic success. Green Belt plays a role in this but there are important green spaces, parks, rivers and canals in the heart of our urban communities which are equally valuable. The protection and enhancement of our blue and green infrastructure is a central theme of the strategy.\nIn view of the above aspiration it is difficult to understand why the specific green sites in Royton, Shaw and Crompton have been proposed. There has been a lack of balance in the review and failure to give necessary weight to environmental and quality of life issues.\nThe vast majority of sites are notably attractive open spaces that provide pleasure, relaxation, and health benefits to local residents as well as our wider community. The sites include public footpaths enjoyed by many dog-walkers, ramblers and walking groups. Many of the Public Rights of Way are important to the historic Shaw and Crompton ‘Beating of the Bounds’ and Crompton Circuit walks. These locations also provide one of the few opportunities for people to undertake horse riding in safety which is particularly of concern for young and inexperienced riders.\nThese sites are further enhanced by a diverse range of flora and fauna and importantly provide those ‘green lung’ areas which minimise urban sprawl between built up conurbations.\nTwo of the sites include small but nevertheless important rivers within their boundaries; the Rivers Irk and Beal (Cowlishaw and Beal Valley respectively) help to prevent flooding and are attractive features of the two sites.\nAdditionally the Cowlishaw site is renowned for upwell of numerous local springs and given to serious flooding. The area has deep unstable subsoil that will require significant pilings leading to excessive construction costs.\nCowlishaw and Beal Valley also contain Sites of Biological Importance and these must be retained.\nIn regards to Saddleworth there is only one Strategic Site in the Spatial Plan, Robert Fletcher’s in the Greenfield valley, which has long been seen as needing a strategic view and plan to avoid piecemeal development. Indeed Saddleworth Parish Council presented an outline plan for the valley some years ago and has done so again in response to the spatial proposals.\nThe plan proposes some 175 houses and 10-15 ‘lodges’ which one assumes, given past happenings, would become houses. These houses given the lack of public transport or facilities and the preference for high value housing would do nothing to lessen the need for affordable housing in the area.\nThe topography and lack of transport links and the high value of local scenery makes other large sites hard to find in Saddleworth especially given the presence of the Peak National Park there.\nSaddleworth is, however, very vulnerable to the number of other smaller sites, some of them astoundingly unsuitable, offered for development in addition to those in this strategic framework.\nThe Green Belt and open spaces within Oldham are areas of pleasant natural beauty that make us unique in Greater Manchester.\nThe Oldham Council Liberal Democrat Group firmly believes that our precious Green Spaces should be protected.\nThe Group strongly advocates that no building on Green Belt or OPOL be undertaken until developments are first undertaken on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted, and upon the many derelict and unloved sites in our town centres and districts; and also after the conversion of mills and factories into housing use and after every empty home has been brought back into use.\nOnly when all of these things have been done should we then; and only then; consider developing any part of our precious Green Belt.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Contrary to the comments in the letters page recently by an independent councillor I’d asked for these discussions in public about two and a half years ago and have met with officers and the cabinet member on a number of occasions relating to these highways issues and the cabinet member for highways is one who when it matters does collaboration and engagement. Positive engagement usually produces better results and I would urge people to approach the issue in this manner. I am glad that there were many valid points raised at the meeting and I expect they will be discussed in great detail in Oldham. We now need a sensible traffic management system. I have suggested that there is enforceable access only through Dobcross centre and to address the parking issues on Dobcross New Road as is being discussed with parking on Huddersfield Road in Diggle. I have also suggested that enhancing the turning circle on Wool Road rather than proposed drop off points opposite the Navigation Inn could help alleviate the rat run through Dobcross. In Diggle it needs to be clear that students can walk in from any drop off points safely and buses can get through without getting stuck at the thinner parts of the road. The residents effected by parking restrictions need to be able to access off road parking but any restrictions need to be enforced from day one. I would urge residents to engage with suggestions when any formal highways options are proposed so that the issues are addressed properly and we still get a new secondary school in Saddleworth\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

He contacted TfGM five months ago when the bus stop (and shelter) was moved from it’s original position next to the builders site because of safety fears where it was now felt it was too close to a bend. The bus stop movement means that no shelter can be accommodated but need to be moved further up the road without the bus shelter. It was positioned incorrectly five months ago on the footpath next to the red brick industrial building used by Durr furniture.\nCouncillor Harkness said “This site is completely inadequate, the old position was set back but where it is now is far too narrow. It is quite a vulnerable position. People can’t wait for buses and use the footpath at the same time because people cannot step back anywhere. As a school governor I know that mothers with prams sometimes have to walk in the road. This is not acceptable and Transport for Greater Manchester have already acknowledged that it was placed in this position with error.”\nA further consultation took place and the bus stop was proposed to be placed further up the road past the building.\nCouncillor Harkness said “ I am very disappointed with the whole process and the lack of updates from Transport for Greater Manchester. It seems quite straightforward. A site was found it was placed in the wrong position so needs moving to where it is supposed to go. It should not take so long for this to happen . I can’t understand why what seems a simple error cannot be rectified quickly. The one across the road has been done but this one has not. I hope we can get a resolution soon.\nHe added “It seem to be half falling down when I passed it today so maybe divine intervention is what we have to rely on”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Liberal Democrat Councillors submit three motions to every Council meeting, on a very wide range of issues.\n“It is said that imitation is the highest form of flattery. The Conservative motion called on Oldham Council to develop a Local Plan for the Borough and for house building to take place on Brownfield sites and through the conversion of redundant mills, shops and offices into housing. These were exactly the aspirations that the Liberal Democrats included in a motion that we took to Council in March 2017, when we called for withdrawal from the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework almost four years ago.”\nAt the March 2017 Council meeting, the majority Labour Group proposed an amendment which removed the Liberal Democrat demand for Oldham to leave the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework, in favour of developing a Local Plan for the Borough. However, the amended motion did retain the following paragraph written by the Liberal Democrats, which was adopted as Council policy:\n‘Council firmly believes that new housing development should first take place on brownfield or derelict sites, on sites with existing planning permission; and by converting long-term empty mills, shops and offices into homes; and that existing long-term empty homes should also be brought back into use, before any consideration is given to allocating green-belt or other protected open land for housing’.\nIn their amendment to tonight’s motion, Councillors Harkness and Al-Hamdani proposed this policy be reaffirmed, and they also sought changes to make the motion more accurate and focused.\nCouncillor Sam Al-Hamdani explained: “Garth and I were happy to oblige in making some wording changes which, as you would expect in a first motion, left a lot to be desired. We wanted to ensure that blame for this environmental disaster was appropriately assigned to Labour’s Greater Manchester Mayor, the nine remaining local authorities in Greater Manchester still on board with GMSF, eight of which are Labour, but one of which, Bolton, is Conservative-controlled, but also to the Conservative Government itself.\n“For the facts are that it is the Conservative Government that has imposed the requirement to build an unrealistic number of new homes upon Oldham and the other nine local authorities in Greater Manchester, it is the Conservative Government that is failing to put pressure on developers to build out housing on sites that already have planning permission, and it is the Conservative Government that is failing to provide sufficient finance to enable the remediation of more Brownfield sites to enable housing development to take place.”\nCouncillor Harkness concluded: “It is good that after almost four years the Conservative Group now seems finally to be backing the Liberal Democrats with a motion to change the Council’s policy in favour of a Local Plan for our Borough, but, if they really want to make a difference, I would suggest that rather than virtue-signalling they lobby their own Government Ministers to abandon this madness, and allow us to work with local people to develop the right plan for Saddleworth and Oldham”.\nThe original motion proposed by the Liberal Democrats in March 2017 read:\nCouncil 22 March 2017 – Notice of Opposition Business\nMotion 1 – Withdrawal from the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework\nThis Council notes that:\n· all councils are required by government to have a Local Plan which identifies land for housing, offices and industry;\n· the proposed Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) is one approach to fulfilling this requirement; however other local authorities have fulfilled this requirement by developing their own Local Plan;\n· the GMSF is a twenty year plan, requiring a third more housing land to be identified than would be required by typical fifteen year Local Plans produced by many other local authorities, and is based upon pre-Brexit growth assumptions over such a long period, which cannot be verified;\n· the GMSF proposals include significant releases of green-belt in the Borough of Oldham, particularly in Shaw, Crompton, Chadderton, Royton and Saddleworth;\nCouncil further notes that:\n· these early proposals were developed without sufficient involvement of residents or ward members;\n· many residents and local politicians, particularly in Shaw, Crompton, Chadderton, Royton and Saddleworth, are strongly opposed to many of these proposals;\nCouncil firmly believes that new housing development should first take place on brownfield or derelict sites, on sites with existing planning permission; and by converting long-term empty mills, shops and offices into homes; and that existing long-term empty homes should also be brought back into use, before any consideration is given to allocating green-belt or other protected open land for housing.\nConsequently, Council condemns the current GMSF proposals as they fail to identify such sites that are available for development and are instead predicated upon developing new housing on green-belt land in the Borough of Oldham.\nCouncil therefore resolves to:\n1. Formally withdraw from the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework process and make arrangements to ensure that the GMSF does not apply to the Borough of Oldham;\n2. Pursue Oldham’s own local plan. This should be a fifteen year Local Plan for the Borough which identifies that new housing development should first take place on brownfield or derelict sites, on sites with existing planning permission; and by converting long-term empty mills, shops and offices into homes; and that existing long-term empty homes should also be brought back into use, before any consideration is given to allocating green-belt or other protected open land for housing.\n3. Make arrangements to comply with the duty to cooperate with other planning authorities;\n4. Review existing development plan documents and build in a review process every five years;\nProposed by Seconded by\nCouncillor Howard Sykes MBE Councillor Dave Murphy\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The vision projects a population growth of 294,800 and 199,700 additional jobs across Greater Manchester.\nThe consultation document provides insufficient analysis of how these deductions for population and economic growth have been made and therefore is devoid of justification for the additional land demands. Further specific clarification of the rationale would be welcome and is desperately needed.\nThe plan requires 690,000 m2 industrial and warehousing space and 13,700 homes in the Oldham Borough. Of these 13,700 homes approximately 3,000 will be located on sites in Royton, Shaw and Crompton and other vast tracts of land (Green Belt) are designated for industrial development.\nTo the Liberal Democrat Group and to many of our constituents, these plans represent a massive and inequitable land grab in Royton, Shaw and Crompton with the devastation of our local Green Belt and OPOL (Other Protected Open Land).\nIt is proposed that new properties will be built at Cowlishaw; in the Beal Valley; Rushcroft; the Whitfield Farm area over towards Newhey; and around Gravel Hole and Low Crompton.\nAdjacent sites at Broadbent Moss (Oldham), Hanging Chadder (Oldham) and land East and West of the A627M (Rochdale and Oldham) if developed would also see a significant erosion of the Green Belt land in the so called ‘Northern Gateway’.\nIt is the view of the Liberal Democrat Group that there is no justification for the construction of a large number of properties (or indeed any properties) on Green Belt or OPOL before new homes are first built on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted and upon the many derelict and unloved sites in our town centres and districts.\nIt is unfortunate that the consultation document does not identify the many such sites that are available across the Borough other than those that currently sit outside Oldham’s Local Development Framework (formerly the Unitary Development Plan).\nFurthermore it is our view that conversions should take place so empty mills and factories can be used for housing (buildings and/or sites); as can land marked for industrial/commercial use; and bring the large number of empty homes back into use.\nAll this should be done before any consideration is given to future development on Green Belt or OPOL and this development for Oldham should, in our view, be apportioned better in the Metropolitan Borough rather than disproportionately in Royton, Shaw and Crompton as at present.\nThe draft GMSF readily identifies the need for a very significant investment in transport infrastructure. Improved transport is a critical obstacle to be overcome to ensure the success of the expansion desired in the GMSF. Many of the strategic allocations are sited near our motorway corridors, ostensibly to take advantage of existing networks.\nHowever, our existing motorways are frequently constrained by high levels of congestion resulting in unacceptable journey times and additional traffic jams on feeder and local roads. The projected growth of industrial warehousing, office space and new homes will require monumental investment in transport infrastructure. It is of paramount importance to ensure that the transport infrastructure is in place before other building takes place.\nAll the sites identified, especially those in Royton, Shaw and Crompton are devoid of good vehicular access and there is no obvious way to make the necessary improvements.\nCowlishaw has no acceptable roads leading into the proposed site. The topography around the Whitfield Farm area makes it difficult to envisage an elegant solution to site access. Similarly the Beal Valley site is currently served only by a narrow road and the desire to facilitate access to this site by enhancing links to Shaw and Crompton Metrolink Station seem incredulous; the only current access, via Beal Lane, is saturated with existing traffic and HGV movements to and from existing businesses which are large National/European distribution centres.\nThe increase in population will necessitate provision of additional services. The GMSF does not appear to adequately address available funding to deliver on these requirements.\nIn Shaw and Crompton, the necessary infrastructure to support even our existing population is lacking. We have primary schools that are already overcrowded or full; a secondary school that is falling apart; a dilapidated Health Centre that is near cardiac arrest; no swimming facilities or dry leisure provision; precious few youth facilities and no municipal tip.\nUnder the proposals, 3,000 homes will be built in Royton, Shaw and Crompton for growing families. These new residents will need more primary and secondary school places; more GPs and dentists; leisure and shopping facilities; and new highways and more buses and trams to get them there.\nNow doesn’t Oldham Council’s decision to close and not replace the Crompton Swimming Pool and Gym look a little short-sighted given the number of new young residents that will need to learn to swim and the number of adults that will want to keep fit.\nAn important vision of the GMSF is that Greater Manchester becomes as well known for the quality of its environment as for its economic success. Green Belt plays a role in this but there are important green spaces, parks, rivers and canals in the heart of our urban communities which are equally valuable. The protection and enhancement of our blue and green infrastructure is a central theme of the strategy.\nIn view of the above aspiration it is difficult to understand why the specific green sites in Royton, Shaw and Crompton have been proposed. There has been a lack of balance in the review and failure to give necessary weight to environmental and quality of life issues.\nThe vast majority of sites are notably attractive open spaces that provide pleasure, relaxation, and health benefits to local residents as well as our wider community. The sites include public footpaths enjoyed by many dog-walkers, ramblers and walking groups. Many of the Public Rights of Way are important to the historic Shaw and Crompton ‘Beating of the Bounds’ and Crompton Circuit walks. These locations also provide one of the few opportunities for people to undertake horse riding in safely which is particularly of concern for young and inexperienced riders.\nThese sites are further enhanced by a diverse range of flora and fauna and importantly provide those ‘green lung’ areas which minimise urban sprawl between built up conurbations.\nTwo of the sites include small but nevertheless important rivers within their boundaries; the Rivers Irk and Beal (Cowlishaw and Beal Valley respectively) help to prevent flooding and are attractive features of the two sites.\nAdditionally the Cowlishaw site is renowned for upwell of numerous local springs and given to serious flooding. The area has deep unstable subsoil that will require significant pilings leading to excessive construction costs.\nCowlishaw and Beal Valley also contain Sites of Biological Importance and these must be retained.\nIn regards to Saddleworth there is only one Strategic Site in the Spatial Plan, Robert Fletcher’s in the Greenfield valley, which has long been seen as needing a strategic view and plan to avoid piecemeal development. Indeed Saddleworth Parish Council presented an outline plan for the valley some years ago and has done so again in response to the spatial proposals.\nThe plan proposes some 120 houses and 100 ‘lodges’ which one assumes, given past happenings, would become houses for some 220 residences. These houses given the lack of public transport or facilities and the preference for high value housing would do nothing to lessen the need for affordable housing in the area.\nThe topography and lack of transport links and the high value of local scenery makes other large sites hard to find in Saddleworth especially given the presence of the Peak National Park there.\nSaddleworth is, however, very vulnerable to the number of other smaller sites, some of them astoundingly unsuitable, offered for development in addition to those in this strategic framework.\nThe Green Belt and open spaces within Oldham are areas of pleasant natural beauty that make us unique in Greater Manchester.\nThe Oldham Council Liberal Democrat Group firmly believes that our precious Green Spaces should be protected.\nThe Group strongly advocates that no building on Green Belt or OPOL be undertaken until developments are first undertaken on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted, and upon the many derelict and unloved sites in our town centres and districts; and also after the conversion of mills and factories into housing use and after every empty home has been brought back into use.\nOnly when all of these things have been done should we then, and only then, consider developing any part of our precious Green Belt.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Councillor Sykes also represents Oldham Council on the Transport for Greater Manchester committee.\nAccording to Passenger Transport, in 2012/13 the division had a £101 million turnover and made £3.5 million profit. However, by 2017/18 revenues had fallen to £86m, and the Manchester operation made a loss of £5.8m. National media reports suggest the business could be sold for as little as £20 million with vehicles sold to one or more competing operators, along with depots at Bolton, Bury and Oldham.\nCommenting, Councillor Sykes said: “The consistent feedback received from my constituents, who are reliant on First Bus services, is often poor. First Bus fares are high compared to some other transport operators, such as Manchester Community Transport and Metrolink. First Bus services are also often unreliable compared to these same operators, particularly after 6pm. The 59-bus ‘service’ which runs from Manchester to Rushcroft through my ward is a case in point. It is a service in name only as the bus often fails to show or is significantly behind schedule.”\nCouncillor Sykes added: “First Bus have not yet confirmed if they are putting the Manchester business up for sale, but, if they are, it is real pity that local authorities were denied the chance to establish new bus companies under the recent Bus Services Act as this would have provided an ideal opportunity to bring back an Oldham Corporation bus company.”\n“However, the Greater Manchester Mayor and Transport for Greater Manchester should work to ensure that the purchaser, or purchasers, who take on these services are committed to providing a first-class service for bus passengers, which is customer-focused, reliable, safe and affordable, and provides continuity of employment for First Manchester drivers and staff.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is part of an ongoing Liberal Democrat campaign to raise the dangers of poor road surfaces with the current Labour Administration and to call for a change in policy so damage can be repaired if it is dangerous.\nThe Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Councillor Chris Gloster, is proposing the motion: “This issue is of great concern to Liberal Democrat Councillors on Oldham Council. My Shaw colleague, Group Leader Councillor Howard Sykes, has written to the Council Deputy Leader about this and my Crompton colleague, Councillor Dave Murphy, raised it as a question at last Council. We are just not satisfied by the lack of action so have decided to bring our proposals for proper debate at full Council. Put simply, we want the Council to be able to repair any road surface that is dangerous, not just those roads where surface erosion is at least forty millimetres deep. At the moment the Council just says no if the holes are less than 40mm.”\nGovernment guidance issued to all local authorities in November 2016 states that Councils must ‘investigate’ instances where road surfaces have been eroded by at least 40mm, but there is no legal requirement placed upon Councils even then to repair them promptly. In Oldham, the current Labour Administration policy is to only consider potholes deeper than 40mm to be eligible for repair. By way of constant, the threshold for the repair of pavements is lower at 25mm.\nCouncillor Gloster explained why this is problematic: “One practical issue is that many roads in my own district of Shaw and Crompton do not even have a top surface that is 40mm thick; they can be worn away to the cobbles and present a real danger to cyclists and motorists, but as the ‘threshold’ can never be reached no action is taken. This cannot be fair or right.”\nThe Liberal Democrats want the Council to ensure that any road surface that becomes hazardous can be repaired. Councillor Gloster added: “I fully appreciate roads will still have to be prioritised and not all will be able to be repaired with the resources the council has, but we should look to address the danger that any worn road surface represents to the public, and not simply operate to some arbitrary ‘threshold’.”\nThe motion is being seconded by Councillor Gloster’s colleague, Saddleworth Liberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness, who said: “Another issue addressed in our motion is the lack of real finance made available to local government from central government for road repairs. This present government talks a lot about the additional resources given from time-to-time to local authorities to tackle the backlog, but this is never enough and it is always too late.”\n“The Local Government Association, which represents Councils of all political persuasions across the country, has estimated that there is a £9 billion backlog of repairs on Britain’s roads. We want the government to give local authorities some of the Road Fuel Duty that is raised so we can get on with the job of making our roads fit-for-purpose.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This represents a direct attack on everyday workers who go out to work come rain or shine to provide for their families, and this will dishearten them when we should be giving them a helping hand. Everyone sensible knows we need to balance the books but this should be not be done on the backs of the working poor – especially at a time George Osborne is handing tax breaks to millionaires”.\nIn April of this year David Cameron was asked if tax credits would be cut after the election. He said No Michael Gove was asked in an interview if tax credits would be cut he said no\nWe see six months later that we were lied to. The whole rhetoric they are using around their cuts is welfare is by giving examples of a minority who abuse the system. Those individuals should be tackled not demonise people who need some extra support. The tax credit cuts effect the working poor. They are morally wrong and a disincentive to work The prime minister uses the rise in the tax threshold as an excuse. People not having to pay tax until they earn more is obviously a good thing and is something the Liberal Democrats had to fight for. It is good they are keeping this. That is not an excuse to penalize people who are trying to work and now around 16,400 families who live in the borough of Oldham will lose out under Conservative plans to cut tax credits. Families will see their entitlement reduced on average by £1,350 per year, as part of the Government’s proposals.\nAn estimated loss to local families and the Oldham economy of over £22 million.These are ideological cuts and they do not have to take £12 billion from the poorest and working people. There may be opportunities for some savings there need a leg up very hard.\nWe need collective opposition to challenge what is now clearly going to be a heartless government. By working together to fight for the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Now unchecked by the Lib Dems in coalition, the Conservatives are showing themselves to be a party dead set on balancing the books on the backs of the vulnerable and poor.\nLabour run away on tax credits\nDuring the welfare bill in parliament we saw the mass of abstention from Labour of 184 on the welfare bill in the House of Commons including the MP for Failsworth.\nThe Labour councillors did not want to support this amendment which highlighted this fact and so did not support this amendment in Oldham\nLiberal Democrats in the House of Lords put forward a motion that would mean that the tax credit cuts would be abandoned. Obviously the Tory peers did not support the motion, neither did the Labour peers and therefore the motion failed. The Lords did approve a delay and a review. I welcome this although the Liberal Democrats wanted the tax credit cuts to be shelved completely\nI hope we can move forward and as a council contribute to the debate by showing our joint opposition to the tax credit cuts Cutting tax credits is morally and economically wrong too.\nThe Government do not have to take from the poorest families in the country. They are choosing to do so and at the same time as giving tax breaks to millionaires. Who are not be asked to pay a penny more.

We look East as well as West and see the future as bright, with lots of local jobs and new business enterprises.\nWe don’t like bossy officialdom and will fight to preserve local services and our way of life. Without Liberal Democrat Councillors, Oldham would be a one party Borough, a very, very, dangerous situation.”\nAlan works incredibly hard and puts in many hours service to ensure that Saddleworth has a voice and gets the best deal possible. He scrutinises and questions Labour very thoroughly and are always keen to offer solutions as a way forward.\nAlan is a community champion a few examples of things he has been involved in recently are:\nChris Davies is our LOCAL MEP. He lives in Greenfield and was the MP for the area before becoming our MEP. He understands Saddleworth and is the ONLY local candidate for the European Parliament.\nHe is delivering for Saddleworth by helping to protect the jobs that rely on our trade with the EU and by achieving victories for our environment.\nThis year Chris won the MEP of the Year award for the environment category. Others may talk about the environment but Chris takes action and improves our laws.\nAll the indications are that it will be really close for Chris this time so please don’t leave it to others to make the time to vote for him, they may be leaving it to you!\nLeave a Reply",

I want to pay tribute to our Saddleworth and Lees District team, officers in the public health department at Oldham council and fellow councillors for also passing a motion to make Oldham council more resilient in helping people suffering a cardiac arrest. Working together we have moved the odds in our area of surviving a cardiac arrest.

People are given vouchers and some organisations put a price on items so that anyone can come in and perhaps buy items and all funds go back into the scheme.”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said: “The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group has previously proposed motions to take action on food poverty, fuel poverty, water poverty, and period poverty. Now we are turning our spotlight on clothing poverty.\n“We have only in the last week seen Boohoo involved in claims of exploitation and unsafe working practices. This follows a Sunday Times report claiming workers at a Leicester factory were paid £3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus.\n“In November 2019, a survey on the Greater Manchester textile and garment industry that included 182 companies operating across the region, also found evidence that workers were being paid as little as £3-4 an hour.”\nNo Labour councillors or Conservative councillors decided to speak on the motion. All Labour councillors voted against the motion. One Conservative voted for the motion, one against and two did not vote.\nCouncillor Diane Williamson said:\n“The Labour administration did not even deem it to be worthy of someone to explain why they would not support this motion; I would take on any comments about what was in the motion, but there was deafening silence and they voted against it.\nSo why are they voting against tackling sweatshops, supporting low-paid workers and setting up an organisation to support those in need?”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said: “Of course, we do not always agree, and I have had motions that have not passed before. In this case I am genuinely baffled. I cannot understand why Labour councillors did not want to address poverty or modern slavery. They all chose to vote against this and not one decided to request to speak. That probably gives an indication of what they think about these important issues.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Elected members are told to follow the same channels and get the same lack of response. Members are now having to put in freedom of information requests, which is a shameful indictment on this council’s transparency and accountability”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness also adds that the situation has got worse recently\n“We were told when the new Labour coalition took over the council we would have more collaborative working. We have seen less. Opposition councillors are banned from certain parts of the building and often don’t get access to information or answers. We find out the Chief Executive is going to Tameside through the press. This is just an example of arrogance of the leadership to exclude elected members”.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness called for a review on council communications at Oldham council on 11th September 2024 and suggested some remedies for the way of working which included each department having a dedicated member’s email enquiry inbox and it should be monitored by a senior officer who triages work to the appropriate member of staff. There should be a guaranteed response time for initial findings and timeframes on future actions.\nDespite chasing he is yet to receive a response.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added “It is ironic that the point about not getting responses has not had a response. There has been swarms of senior officers leave Oldham Council. There is a toxic nature to full council meetings. All have a responsibility to act with respect.

Liberal Democrats in Oldham would like to see disabled people exempted from many of the provisions of welfare reform, as pensioners have, and we will lobby Government to make this so .\nHowever, whatever the rights and wrongs of welfare reform, the reality is that it is here to stay in one form or other as any Government in power will need to address the ever spiralling benefits bill. One of my concerns is that, in the rush to prepare for the introduction of welfare reform, agencies and officers may have paid insufficient attention to the needs of the disabled. Oldham is a pilot authority for welfare reform – by establishing best practice here we can set a standard for other authorities introducing welfare reform from October.\nThe Liberal Democrat Group has issued a policy paper to Councillor Jabbar, Cabinet Member for Finance, and the Labour Administration outlining 12 practical measures that the authority should adopt to support disabled people in our borough faced with welfare reform.I hope that, after a period of reflection, we will have the opportunity to meet with them to discuss the document and identify how we can take these measures forward. This bi-partisan approach is identical to that which we have taken as a party in supporting the Administration on a number of issues, most recently the campaign to combat loan sharks”.\nA Summary of the Liberal Democrat 12-Point Plan follows –.

Previous papers issued in confidence to senior members of opposition parties had suggested that some £2.3m of further savings options would balance next year’s budget.\nLiberal Democrat Leader of the Opposition Cllr Howard Sykes said, “This would be the largest rise in our Council Tax since Labour was last in power in Oldham. Their infamous ‘Bunch of Fives’ unleashed three successive years of 5% rises from 2005 to 2007. They thought it was a clever pun, but the reality left Oldham reeling, with the second highest council tax in the country, and for the second-worst services to boot. They are back to their bad old ways.“\nCllr Lynne Thompson, Liberal Democrat finance spokesperson, said, “This is a shocking slap in the face for the borough’s residents. Doesn’t this Labour administration ever remember whose money it is? A council tax hike like this should be unthinkable without full consultation with the public. I have suspected they were thinking of a rise, but they have fluffed and changed the subject whenever I have challenged. How devious!”\n2 Comments\nThis rise is unfair on the hard working people of Oldham. It’s clear that the books have again not been balanced correctly and Labour as usual, respond by throwing more of other peoples cash into the bottomless pit. As a 30 odd year old about to start a family in the area, I will not be voting Labour again in future, they just can’t be trusted. Oldham runs the risk of being labelled ‘Rip off Oldham’.\nIts funny how posts on here get taken down when constructive comments are added explaining how lib dems are just as bad as labour in oldham with both parties taking council tax payers for fools.\nAll people i know without exception, even diehard lib dem and labour fans of the past are telling me they will be voting ukip in the next elections. Its the only option to give our kids (whatever colour of their skin) any chance of getting a job at all.\nLook at oldham and see what a mess its in.

My colleague Cllr Mark Alcock and I proposed an amendment which aimed to address some of the issues of implementation.\nOf course there are problems with some groups who will be adversely affected and so the council have a duty to support them. Labour have chosen not to.\nLet us not forget that they will also have the added burden now and have to pay 25% of their council tax because of this administration’s policy.\nIn Stockport for example, the Discretionary Housing Payment being used to meet the financial shortfall whilst people look for alternatives and this shows the generous approach that council takes where for example they have no minimum payment on council tax unlike here were everyone has to pay 25% regardless of their situation. In Oldham, Labour have so far decided to reject such a proposal. They have also rejected other proposals by Oldham Liberal Democrats.\nBelow is a letter from my colleague Mark Alcock:\nThe Liberal Democrats on Oldham council reacted to the Labour’s spare room subsidy motion at the full council meeting on 17th July 2013 with suggestions to make the implementation fairer and to protect the most vulnerable in Oldham Borough. It is with great regret that the Labour administration chose to vote against these measures that would help the most vulnerable in our society.\nThe size criteria sees the reduction in housing benefits for extra bedrooms, introduced by Labour in 2008 for the private sector, to be included in the social housing sector. There has been no commitment for Labour to overturn this as indeed acknowledged by Labour council leader that they (Labour) would not reverse any of the cuts made by the coalition if they win the next general election.\nThe Liberal Democrat group recently published a 12-point plan to help support the most vulnerable in light of the changes and they have said that this principle should be applied to this motion. They would support the most vulnerable through the changes with the spare room subsidy.\nThere are some protected groups already such as some disabled groups, pensioners and armed forces personnel but we need to do more. An example is that our 12-point plan the Lib Dems have urged Labour to actively take up, this will help those disabled people adversely effected by this.”\nWe could take practical steps such as Vetting and match up tenants who can property share or who wish to take in a lodger, or Ensure that under-occupiers have appropriate additional priority on the waiting list for a smaller more appropriate sized home for them.\nUsing the Discretionary Housing Payment when those outside the exemptions have a genuine case not to downsize and set up a hardship fund for vulnerable tenants like they do in Lib Dem controlled Stockport and be sympathetic to individual cases. We should also meet the financial shortfall whilst tenants look for an alternative smaller home.\nThe Liberal Democrat group agreed to the principle of a spare room subsidy but were critical of it’s implementation and this is why we have suggested practical steps. It is a pitty that Oldham’s Labour group pn mass chose to vote against such proposals, missing another chance to help the most vunerable residents in Oldham.

Large projects that have occurred and are pending will help towards a bid to the NHS”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added\n“ We of course expect that there would be a desire to use the site for some housing too.

We would invest over £36 million more into Oldham’s schools and colleges, and triple the early years pupil premium (which helps the most deprived children).\nHealth and social care: A penny on income tax invest an additional £25 million across Oldham and develop a long term plan for integrating health and social care. I have been an advocate for mental health services and am pleased the Liberal Democrats would increase budgets to mental health care.\nGreen Spaces: The Liberal Democrats are the only party taking the fight against the vandalism of our green spaces.

The current situation is disappointing and the plans for a diversion could see the footbridge permanently closed.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said\n“Whilst it is good that this is being kept on the agenda and a right of way would be brought back in I am concerned that this would mean that the prospect of opening the bridge is looking slim now and it is the owners responsibility to make this safe. There is a case of buyer beware on this one. It would be very sad if we cannot get this bridge back into use.”\nThe response from Oldham Council:\n”we are considering a DMMO for the path leading to the footbridge, however you are also aware that this bridge is currently closed as it is unsafe. We have consulted with various groups and also the structures experts at Unity partnership,\nWe think that the route should be taken further down to the shared road bridge. Not an ideal situation but the costs to repair the footbridge would stretch any landowner/authority.\nWe need to do some investigations as to the current situation for the original DMMO and hopefully with the assistance of the Ramblers group and other parties we can move this matter on.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Jenny Harrison and Cllr. Shoab Akhtar who serve as Labour Cabinet Members in the relevant policy areas of social care and employment asking for their support in finding suitable premises and offering these free of charge to MIND as our contribution to bringing this worthwhile endeavour to Oldham.”\nCllr. Harkness added: “At any one time, one in three people of working age in the UK is likely to be experiencing some kind of mental distress or mental health problem. This can often affect their ability to work.\n“One in 100 working age adults exhibit symptoms of a serious mental health condition such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Whilst these may have some impact upon the person’s ability to work, the stigma and discrimination experienced is often a greater barrier.\n“Where someone remains out of work it is more likely that their mental health will deteriorate and the cycle of unemployment will continue. In contrast, employment has been found to be good for mental health and well-being, and there is no evidence that work is harmful to the mental health of people with serious conditions.\n“We need to do all that we can as a Council to support our residents who have mental health conditions to have the chance to improve their well-being, increase their confidence and find employment. Bringing a MIND training academy to Oldham at minimal cost to the Council will be a very worthwhile investment”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

They propose to expand the Saddleworth rambler service (356) to cover some of the shortfall but it will see some areas lose bus services and a reduced service for more.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness, Liberal Democrat Councillor for Saddleworth North said\n“Saddleworth have already experienced cuts in bus services to Dobcross, Diggle and Greenfield recently with First bus unwilling to engage with local members and local people. Cutting early morning services and evening services is not satisfactory at all. These proposals will see yet more cuts to services and no guarantees over reliability and capacity to cope.\n“During the consultation for the Greater Manchester Transport Strategy 2020 Saddleworth & Lees District Executive in partnership with Saddleworth Parish council submitted a detailed account of the local transport needs and this proposal does the opposite. It will result in more isolation for the elderly and families without a car who rely on these buses. “\nTransport for Greater Manchester have been consulting on a franchise scheme where they said Buses can be improved and Greater Manchester now has a chance to they say, “do buses differently”.\nMick Scholes , Local Liberal Democrat campaigner for Saddleworth South said:\n“It is with disbelief that there has been a consultation by Labour controlled Transport for Greater Mancheser over having a Greater Manchester Franchise scheme because areas like Saddleworth suffer under the commercial model, yet it is the same organisation which is suggesting that we isolate even more people in Saaddleworth. People use these services to get to work, school or college and the expected lack of reliability and reduction in service will make this extremely difficult for local people.”\nThe proposed cuts have serious implications for residents living on Saddleworth estates away from main roads.\nThe following areas will have no bus service in the future: (national guidelines are that reasonably active people should be able to walk up to 400 metres to/from a bus stop – no mention of hills)\n* Palin Wood Road Delph – up to 700 metres up a steep hill to nearest bus\n* Church Road and Wellmeadow Lane, Uppermill – up to 640 metres up a steep hill to nearest bus\n* Station Road and Grove Road, Uppermill – up to 500 metres up a hill to nearest bus\n* High Grove Road & Church Road, Friezland – up to 500 metres up a steep hill to nearest bus\n* Shaw Hall Bank Road, Friezland – not even mentioned in the officer’s report\nIn the evenings the Greenfield – Denshaw service is reduced from hourly to two hourly; Denshaw to Oldham remains hourly.\nLeave a Reply",

Irresponsible people are constantly dumping rubbish along our highways and in our beauty spots.”\n“In my view, things have gone downhill since the introduction of three weekly bin collections by this Labour Administration. Council officers work hard to investigate instances of fly-tipping and to prosecute offenders when they can, but sometimes the task seems overwhelming.”\n“I have been investigating what works in other Boroughs and from my investigations I have come up with a few suggestions for innovative ideas that are working elsewhere in Britain that I hope could be implemented here in Oldham. I am looking forward to hearing back from Councillor Brownridge about whether the Labour Administration will take up some or all of these suggestions to respond more effectively to the challenge of fly-tipping.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The group have support from Councillors; 3 local M.Ps whose areas include the line and from the Chair of the European Parliament Transport Committee, an M.E.P. whose constituency is in the Northwest of England.\nThe group were told they should be clear about what they wanted once electrification is completed in 2018. Currently interim plans by the transport authorities include all trains going to Piccadilly rather than Victoria during the period 2016-18 when work along the line for electrification will be most disruptive. The group say the concentration of shopping in Manchester, for instance, is nearer to Victoria and this plan is wrong. A recent poll of passengers from Greenfield supported this view with over 400 signing a petition collected in little over a fortnight.\nThe group also indicated they wanted the current peak hour services maintained; an half-hourly service all day; better weekend and evening services. They concede that with half-hourly services ideally one train could go to Piccadilly and one to Victoria giving passengers a choice. Lastly the group are working on a timetable which could see 2 per hour services evenly spaced at half-hourly intervals as near as possible.\nMark Ashmore Chair of the Group and resident of Greenfield said: ‘We had a most amicable meeting where the Transport Authorities clearly indicated they wanted to work with us to improve the service in a way which was consistent with passengers’ views. It has been agreed we shall meet with them again in June.’\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The current building has major problems and has been judged by education officials to no longer be fit for purpose..\nLib Dem Parliamentary candidate for Oldham East and Saddleworth Richard Marbrow said, “Now that the decision has been made, it is time for everyone to get behind the new school and to work to solve any problems residents will now face.”\n“Oldham council needs to be open and honest about what will happen to the Uppermill site and the council should start working now with residents in Diggle to ensure their concerns about traffic, environmental concerns, noise and building work related disruption are tackled.”\n“Along with Alan Belmore & John McCann in Saddleworth South, Derek Heffernan & Garth Harkness in Saddleworth North and Stephen Barrow & Val Sedgwick in Saddleworth West and Lees, I will now work with local residents to make sure the new school is a success and that any problems caused by the new building are minimised.”\nCllr Derek Heffernan said, “The council needs to work hard with residents of Diggle to make sure that the new school does not damage the village. That means working to make sure traffic is properly managed, that the planning process mitigates reasonable concerns and that the new school provides facilities that benefit residents.”\nAlan Belmore said, “Council plans for the Uppermill site need to be disclosed as soon as possible. If there is to be housing, it must be affordable housing for local families and not executive mansions to boost council tax income for the council.”\nStephen Barrow said, “Many people with young families in Grotton, Springhead and Lees want to see good teaching transferred into modern, excellent facilities where teachers are free to teach without worrying about the electrics or state of the building.”\nThe Liberal Democrats have also challenged Labour and the Saddleworth Independents Party to come clean about their position.\nRichard Marbrow said, “I expect more fudge and a lack of clarity from Debbie Abrahams MP. She needs to engage with this process and make clear that she supports this building or she needs to state that she is willing to put the new building at risk. The future of education in Saddleworth is too important for her to concentrate more on picking up votes than making a decision.”\n“The Independents Party need to be clear if they want a new school for Saddleworth and Lees kids or not. They have already caused concerns with their behaviour and they need to think about the future of Saddleworth and its children.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is to reduce the potential number of visitors expected. Check before you travel.\nCheck the recycleforgreatermanchester.com website for more details.\nHow will it work?\nSUEZ have reorganised the layout of the recycling centres and introduced social distancing measures. Only a limited number of cars (up to 5) will be allowed on site at any one time with a one in, one out policy. For each parking bay, there will be a container to place bags of general waste in. There will be no other recycling containers available. Residents should leave the site as quickly as possible to allow the next car in.\nHighways officers and traffic marshals will patrol the roads surrounding the recycling centres to guide the public. Traffic management such as cones, traffic signs, diversions and one way systems will be implemented to help the flow of traffic. Please check your local council website for updates on diversions.\nIf the queue becomes too long, residents may be turned away and asked to return at a later time.\nWhen and why did the sites close?\nAll GMCA Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs) closed on 24th March in order to comply with Government guidance on essential reasons to leave the house during the initial 3 week lock down period. GMCA was not unique in taking this approach to HWRCs, the position nationally was that most recycling centres were closed pending review of the lockdown restrictions.\nWhy are centres only reopening now? What’s changed?\nDefra guidance around opening up the recycling centres has changed and we recognise that many of us are producing more waste whilst spending time at home, so to ease pressure on the council bin collections, it was agreed by the GMCA and the 9 councils to open some of the recycling centres for general waste only.\nHow many sites will open?\n16 out of 20 sites will open but this is not business as usual so please check opening hours before you travel (not all sites are open 7 days a week) and ask yourself if this journey is essential. https://recycleforgreatermanchester.com/\nWhat can I take to the recycling centre?\nOnly general waste/rubbish in bin bags that you can’t fit in your household bin such as nappies, plastic packaging, polystyrene and other household waste (small bulky waste) that can’t be recycled.\nWhat about other recycling and garden waste?\nPlease store recycling and garden waste at home until we can offer this service. By only offering containers for general waste, we can get people through the sites quicker and there is no need for anyone to walk about the site coming into contact with other visitors.\nSome of the recycling re-processors that we send the recycling to (wood, electricals etc) are not open.\nLooking Forward\nWe will review the situation along with Government guidance and in time may be able to provide other containers for recycling.\nWe need the cooperation of the public to make this work – please don’t go unless you really need to.\nCheck the last number on your number plate and this is when you can go:\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

When the Liberal Democrat Administration was in power from 2008 to 2011 money was found and properly budgeted to keep drains clear and avoid many of these problems. Unfortunately the Labour Administration since 2011 has seen fit to remove this money from the budget and rely on reactive gully clearing instead of proactive; only do something after the event. Prevention is always better than cure and a proper policy in place would have prevented much of this misery for the residents of Delph, Diggle, Uppermill, Greenfield and Grotton.\nWhen this option was included in our Budget amendment in 2015 Labour, Tory, and Independent Councillors, including Cllr Nicola Kirkham voted against it. Now we have hand-wringing from all sides. A policy of clearing all drains only once a year is never going to work where some areas are clearly urban with little problem and some areas rural with drainage from hills and fields.\nA clearly thought out plan by the Council is needed taking into account all known factors. Look at our Budget proposals for the last 2-3 years. The Liberal Democrat Opposition would have spent more on these preventative measures because we recognised the current dangers which have come about because of the heavy rainfall.

I have been liaising with Oldham council who have been working with United Utilities and the Environment Agency to look at a more joint approach to deal with the flooding issues.\nI asked another question at full council to try to get the Woolpack pitch issue sorted as many people have become very frustrated. The damaged culvert at the Woolpack has now been repaired. There is to be sealing and some other work to take place over the spring and it is anticipated that the Woolpack pitch will be up and running again by August 2015.\nLikewise, frustration is rife on the flooding issue at Churchfiedls. A CCTV survey was carried out at the site and the external third party investigations have concluded that the cause of this flooding is a United Utilities (UU) clean water pipe installed by a UU contractor. The contractor laid their water main through an existing surface water culvert causing an obstruction that has effectively reduced the hydraulic capacity of it by substantially impeding the flow of water. This has resulted in water overflowing from the culvert during times of heavy rainfall, ultimately resulting in the flooding that is occurring in Churchfields and at Dobcross New Road. Now that the problem has been identified a joint urgent meeting has been arranged to try to find a solution.\nWe managed to save the Dobcross sorting office towards the end of last year. There is a review taking place again and we should finds out if it is under threat shortly. We had a great response last time so watch this space if we need to take action quickly\nKind Regards\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

When Labour removed District Executive funding, he claimed that it was “scaremongering” by the Liberal Democrats to suggest that that would no longer be funded. Last night he turned round and said that there was no central funding. Instead it would have to come out of Councillors’ funds – resulting in around £8,000 less available for projects in Saddleworth and Lees.\nCouncillor Harkness asked the meeting if the Council would make up for the £15,000 of support for the Band Contest that had been provided through District Executive funding, and on the support for the Dove Stone Marshalls which had been temporarily provided by Local Councillors in the absence of central funding, as had been suggested by the Labour leadership at the previous meeting.\nCouncillor Harkness said:\n“It hasn’t taken long for Labour to go back on their promises that these changes would not affect the Band Contest and Dove Stone marshals. Saddleworth’s Councillors have a track record of providing for projects in Saddleworth – the failures in the District Executive funding model came in Labour-run areas where funds were not used to help the community. It’s embarrassing to see Sean Fielding a former band member suggest that the Councillors need to do more. Maybe if the self indulgent “borough life” magazine or fact finding trips were abolished they could find the money to support the greatest free show on earth ”\n“Labour has cut funding to Saddleworth, and gone back on their reassurances at the very next meeting. We’ve done the maths, and if the local councillors have to make good on the council’s promises, that virtually halves the money we have to spend in the community.\nCouncillor Sam Al-Hamdani continued:\n4 Comments”I have been a councillor now for two months, and I already have a number of residents who need support. To find that half of my budget has been taken up with making good on funding that Oldham Council said would be taken care of is bad enough. To find the leader of the Council seemingly suggesting that it is our somehow fault is almost laughable.”\n“Having found such great support for the community in Saddleworth West and Lees, I want to be able to put back into the community. Being able to fund local projects is the very least that I should be able to do, and it is incredibly frustrating to find Oldham Council removing my ability to do so. I am sure Saddleworth councillors will continue to support the band contest as they always have. Many band contests are already struggling even with Councillor contributions and the District contributions. Labour council have ignored the call for help so clearly are happy to risk a long tradition disappearing. ”\nAbsolutely disgusting.\nAlready the bands them selves raise funds and then not to get the support will be the undoing for the council\nThis event attracts bands and visitors from across the globe .\nHalf wits in charge again .\nTypical of OMBC all they want from Saddleworth is the higher rates and to give nothing back to the residents. We are just a cash cow for the rest of Oldham.\nWhat about the Social Return on Investment ( which is the buzz phrase these days) or does the local authority on use that methodology for its pet projects\nSaddleworth it’s said is ‘‘The Jewel in the Crown’ for Oldham – If they pull the funding for our Traditional Whit Friday & the much needed Dovestone Marshalling scheme they’re surely going to be the FOOL’S in the area of Saddleworth’s crown – Come on O.M.B.C do the right thing.",

Over the last year, the number of people in work has increased by 378,000 to a record breaking 29.95 million.\nCommenting, Cllr Howard Sykes, Leader of the Opposition and of the Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council, said:\n“This is another encouraging sign that both the national and the local economy is recovering.”\n“Britain now has a whopping 30 million people in work. Liberal Democrats are determined as a party to build a stronger economy and a fairer society that allows everyone to get on in life – and having access to a job is a key component in full participation as an active citizen. “\n“In government, the Liberal Democrats have so far helped private businesses create more than a million private sector jobs – and we continue to campaign nationally for a million more.”\nMeanwhile, figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions show that in Oldham in October 5,739 people were unemployed and claiming job seekers allowance, a fall of 2,317 since the start of 2013.\nCllr Diane Williamson, Shadow Cabinet Member for Education, Skills and Employment added:\nLeave a comment“Oldham’s figures reflect the national picture with unemployment figures in our borough continuing to fall. However there is no room for complacency – every one of these 5,739 claimants still represents an individual without an opportunity to earn a wage.

Now we are turning our spotlight on clothing poverty. As the Covid-19 Lockdown begins to be lifted, we need to look again at ways that we can Build Britain Better. Two of our priorities must be finding ways to tackle climate change and finding ways to address poverty and social injustices in our society.”\n“Clothing waste is just criminal when we have so many of our citizens in need. We want to create a virtuous circle by putting the two together – taking the clothes that people don’t want and matching them up to those who need them. And by doing so we will reduce the number of clothes that hang unloved in wardrobes or are simply dumped. Its common-sense really and there are some good projects from around the country that we can learn from to help us do so.”\nNot only does clothing over-production eat up natural resources it results in the financial exploitation of workers in the clothing industry.\nCouncillor Diane Williamson, who is seconding the motion, said:\n“We need to identify how the Council and politicians can best support workers in the clothing sector at risk of exploitation. Many of these exploited workers are women producing garments on low-pay and under pressure in their own homes. Tackling the exploitation of clothing workers should be a priority as part of our collective effort to tackle poverty in our Borough.\nIt is for these reasons that the Oldham Liberal Democrats are bringing a motion to the 15th July 2020 Council meeting.

This move would cut income tax for 30 million workers and be worth £400 per year to a typical basic rate taxpayer.\nRichard Marbrow said:\n“Because of the Liberal Democrats in Government, 81,400 workers in Oldham have benefited from the increase in the personal allowance to £10,500, with over 10,000 lifted out of taxation altogether”.\n“It was on the front page of the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto and we have fought to keep it on the agenda at every Budget. By April next year we will have delivered a tax cut to over 26 million people worth £800 a year to a typical basic rate taxpayer and taken over 3 million out of tax altogether. The Liberal Democrats are the only party in British politics with a long-term commitment to cutting taxes for the working people of Britain. We’ve delivered the largest programme of tax cuts for a generation over the last four years, despite all of the other financial pressures.\nPensioners have not benefitted from the previous increases in the personal allowance, but the increase to £12,500 will benefit more than 6m pensioners.\nAnd in a new proposal announced today, Liberal Democrats will seek to raise the amount people can earn before paying National Insurance once the personal income tax allowance has reached £12,500.”\nSaddleworth Councillor Garth Harkness, Shadow Cabinet Member for Employment and Skills added:\nLeave a commentThe Oldham Liberal Democrats proposed a motion to Council in April of this year supporting the call by the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference to raise personal allowances for £12,500. We want all the major political parties to take a similar stand to that of the Liberal Democrats so that hard-working Britons keep more of the money that they work hard to earn.\n“This commitment is great news and on top of this, announcement that the claimant count is now down to almost 1 million, and more people are in work, the 21st monthly drop in unemployment. Oldham continues to follow this trend too. Youth employment is also improving but more needs to be done.

Government already has a definition of fuel poverty, and we believe that this should be possible for food poverty. By establishing a definition, it will be possible to monitor it and establish progress in eliminating it;\n· Reduce poverty by enhancing the national minimum wage and by reducing the burden of taxation on low-income working families, to speed up payments made to claimants, and to ensure that benefits are sufficient to provide them with an adequate and nutritious diet;\n· Safeguard programmes such as Healthy Start Vouchers, Free School Meals and Meals on Wheels and to extend these to reach all who are eligible;\n· Support the establishment of breakfast clubs in all schools where there is a need;\n· Support school holiday food provision in deprived communities to combat the increasing occurrence of hunger amongst poor families when free school meals are unavailable;\n· Increase the amount of surplus food redistributed through Fare Share and similar organisations to support the commendable efforts of local food banks and other community-based food agencies providing food parcels or hot meals to those in need. At present 98% of this food goes to landfill or is burned.\n· Establish one of twelve pilot projects proposed by the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Food in Oldham. These pilots would draw together private, voluntary and public expertise to test the ‘Feeding Britain’ approach identified by the inquiry. Oldham has several extremely deprived electoral wards that would benefit from being a pilot area.\nFood poverty is an important issue for Oldham’s Liberal Democrats. As the Councillors stated to the Prime Minister “if you commit your Government to take the action that we outline in this letter that we will do all that we can to support you in making food poverty in Britain a thing of the past”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Our rural communities have different priorities to Oldham. An example of this is Saddleworth swimming pool and leisure centre. The profits from the centre are currently funding other grandiose schemes.\nWe need a strong Liberal Democrat presence to fight for fairness and push for more decisions to be made locally. I will stand up for Saddleworth and ensure we are fighting Labour to get fairness for our communities.\nThe parish council is evolving and equipping itself to take on more powers from Oldham. People like myself,who understand the problems faced by our villages can make more of the decisions that effect us.\nWe know that when Labour run the council we lose out here in Saddleworth as we see projects priorities changed, resources reallocated or whatever they want to call it the fact is that we lose out. When the Lib Dems ran the council they got the finances sorted and began to tackle our highways problem. When I found out that the Labour administration were abandoning major repair projects in Saddleworth to fund pet projects elsewhere I felt let down. It is outrageous that twice as much is being invested in Chadderton and nearly five times more is being invested in Oldham West for local projects than Saddleworth.\nIt is a battle between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Voting Conservatives just helps Labour. Please vote Liberal Democrat-the only alternative to Labour.\nA strong Lib Dems team are the only ones capable of fighting Labour and get fairness for Saddleworth. There is every chance that there could be no Conservatives left on the borough council. The Lib Dems have a good team who work together and put pressure on as a group in the right places and this can make a difference. I believe in fairness and am asking for your vote on 3rd May so that we can take the fight to Labour and get a fair deal for Saddleworth.\nI want Saddleworth to be treated properly by Oldham and not be brushed aside. We are starved of funds in Saddleworh. I know that Saddleworth is very different than Oldham and needs to be managed differently. We need a strong Liberal Democrat presence to push for more from the borough and for more decisions to be made locally. Lib Dems believe in fairness and that is why I am standing as a Liberal Democrat\nThe Labour representatives have done nothing to fight for improvements in Saddleworth\nI want better roads, better health provisions such as getting the diabetic service back and I want to see a new facility in Delph.

This is particularly scandalous when these residents are children, elderly people and the vulnerable.\n“As a body, Oldham Council has a legal duty to look after public health and the Liberal Democrats believe that the council should take a lead on this issue by establishing a comprehensive plan of action – a recipe if you will – to address food poverty and insecurity in our borough.”\nThe amendment is backed by Councillor Julia Turner, Liberal Democrat, Crompton.\nCllr Turner added:\n“At various times in the past Liberal Democrats have suggested these ideas to members of the Labour Administration, either in full Council or in letters to senior Councillors. Once again we have come up with some common-sense ideas to support those in need which will make a huge difference in our poorer communities.

Much of this waste goes to landfill, more sadly still some of it ends up in our oceans.”\n“I think all of us will have been shocked by the recent images on our televisions and on social media of the world’s oceans being smothered by discarded plastic and sea birds and mammals choking on this detritus,” added Councillor Murphy.\n“In 2016, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimated that by weight there could be more plastic in our oceans than fish. Columbia University has estimated that these plastics stay in our environment for up to 600 million years. Imagine that an item you might use for six minutes polluting our environment for six hundred million years. And it doesn’t lie dormant – plastic contaminates the food chain. Plastic is consumed by fish and fish is consumed by us,” he stated.\n“As human beings, let us use our supposedly higher intelligence to take collective responsibility for the stewardship of this planet and the plants and animals which inhabit it. The Liberal Democrats believe passionately that one single thing that we can all do as part of this shared responsibility is to choose not to use and discard single-use plastic items, such as plastic drinking straws or picnic utensils, in our daily lives,” claimed Councillor Murphy.\nThe motion is being seconded by Liberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness.

More needs to be done on this.\nI respect that such a down pour means some flash floods are inevitable however, this seems to be getting worse. It does seem that the verges and blocked gullies are part of the issue. The scale at Churchfields resembled a river and residents had been flooded out. The Swan in Dobcross was also forced to close again.\nOnly One team now is available to cover the whole of the Metropolitan Borough. I was out for much of the evening as a consequence of the problems caused by the downpour this evening. There were homes flooded and it was great to see several members of the community assisted in clearing up.\nI was pleased with my dealings with the staff and management for their intervention. I requested a team to come in the evening which they did. They then arrived the next day to address some of issues on Churchfields.\nOther areas such as Delph New Road , Woods Lane, Ridings Court experienced difficulties. Part was due to the huge downpour but known problems have not been resolved making the situation much worse.\nI call on the council to get a regular maintenance programme and where appropriate work with United Utilities to address the known problems. The flood risk can then be reduced.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

These are sensible and humane modifications to an unpopular (and in its current form unworkable) piece of legislation. They are demands that Liberal Democrat party members made at their last conference and that Liberal Democrat Councillors and activists have repeatedly called for locally.\nIf Labour is as incensed as Ms Abrahams that “the hated ‘bedroom tax’ has caused hardship to hundreds of thousands” then why did none of the five Labour MPs also selected in the Private Members Ballot this year table a similar motion on this issue?\nAnd why is it that our local Labour MP, Michael Meacher, did not do so last year when selected in the ballot??\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

He contacted TfGM five months ago when the bus stop (and shelter) was moved from it’s original position next to the builders site because of safety fears where it was now felt it was too close to a bend. The bus stop movement means that no shelter can be accommodated but need to be moved further up the road without the bus shelter. It was positioned incorrectly five months ago on the footpath next to the red brick industrial building used by Durr furniture.\nCouncillor Harkness said “This site is completely inadequate, the old position was set back but where it is now is far too narrow. It is quite a vulnerable position. People can’t wait for buses and use the footpath at the same time because people cannot step back anywhere. As a school governor I know that mothers with prams sometimes have to walk in the road. This is not acceptable and Transport for Greater Manchester have already acknowledged that it was placed in this position with error.”\nA further consultation took place and the bus stop was proposed to be placed further up the road past the building.\nCouncillor Harkness said “ I am very disappointed with the whole process and the lack of updates from Transport for Greater Manchester. It seems quite straightforward. A site was found it was placed in the wrong position so needs moving to where it is supposed to go. It should not take so long for this to happen . I can’t understand why what seems a simple error cannot be rectified quickly. The one across the road has been done but this one has not. I hope we can get a resolution soon.\nHe added “It seem to be half falling down when I passed it today so maybe divine intervention is what we have to rely on”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

As a ward councillor, I receive many complaints as do my Liberal Democrat colleagues in Shaw and Crompton. Not only is dog mess a disgusting eyesore, but it also represents a health hazard. Children can be blinded by contact with it. Fortunately, most dog owners are responsible and do clean up after their pets, but a small minority unfortunately do not.”\nCouncillor Gloster’s motion is seconded by Liberal Democrat Crompton Councillor Dave Murphy, who proposed a similar motion to Council in 2014. He said: “Following our last motion, the Council introduced a boroughwide Public Space Protection Order, which covers dog fouling, but unfortunately chose not to adopt any new technology to help detect and apprehend offenders. We hope now that the technology is proven that it will now be possible to take a fresh look at tackling this problem.”\nThe motion calls for awareness raising and education to be undertaken to change the behaviour of errant owners and to encourage them to micro-chip their pets so they can quickly be reunited if their pets become lost. However ultimately the Liberal Democrats also recognise that there is the need for a robust enforcement regime.\nCouncillor Gloster added: “Unfortunately there is sometimes the need for a stick when the carrot is insufficient. We would like to see technology introduced so members of the public can report offenders using their smart phones in real time and we want to see the Council imposing the highest on-the-spot fine of £100 on offenders that is permissible under a Public Space Protection Order.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Liberal Democrats would ring fence the NHS budget in the next parliament. There is a need for further funding in the NHS that is why I support the Liberal Democrat commitment to meet the extra £8 billion that the NHS chief thinks is needed to plug the gap by 2020. This is four times more than Conservatives are proposing and over twice as much as Labour are proposing.\nI support the Liberal Democrat commitment to a mental health research budget of £50 million by 2020. I firmly believe in the Lib Dem plan to end stigma attached to mental health and the commitment to put more money into mental health such as the £1.25 billion boost for children’s mental health. A situation whereby 3 in 10 children in a class can be suffering mental health issues is something that needs to be tackled fast.\nI am a firm believer that the NHS is free at the point of use and we need to ensure that we protect the future of the NHS. I agree it is vital that the NHS is universal and needs to be protected. I would never want to see the NHS be privatised and have a system whereby the haves get quality treatment and the have not’s get nothing.\nLiberal Democrat ministers have pushed for reassurances from the EU that TTIP will have no effect on the powers of the NHS at a local level.\nA letter from EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom received by Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable specifically mentions the case of the NHS in Britain as an example of the rights of member states that are over and above TTIP.\nThe letter categorically states that under TTIP, “member states do not have to open public health services to competition from private providers, nor do they have to outsource services to private providers\nLiberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable has been absolutely clear at all times that we will protect the NHS as a top priority. Local GPs – who we put in charge of commissioning services – will continue to decide what is best for patients.\nThere may be a role for the private sector in the NHS but I am opposed, as is my party of privatisation of the NHS and will always fight for it to be free at the point of use.\nI would resist any attempts by other parties to privatise the NHS. For example, Liberal Democrats have stopped the Conservatives’ privatisation plans and we reversed Labour’s policy of allowing private companies to ‘cherry pick’ lucrative NHS contracts and get special favours. The Labour Government paid private companies £250 million for operations they didn’t perform and in Government, Liberal Democrats have made sure that can never happen again.\nYou can support the Lib Dem campaign to safeguard the NHS at http://www.libdems.org.uk/\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Recent frackingactivities on the Fylde Coast have demonstrated that there are public health issues with fracking activities, such operations involve many vehicle movements, ground disturbances that have led to earth tremors, and the real danger that frackingcould lead to the pollution of local water supplies. It is only right that where such operations are contemplated that local people and their elected Councillors are able to properly consider them under established planning procedures.”\nHe added: “And this is not simply about fracking. There is a danger that the government could decide that other contentious planning issues, such as building new nuclear power plants or housing on the green belt, could be considered at national level, denying local people and local Councillors any say in what goes on in their area. At the end of the day they are the people who have to live with the consequences. This goes completely against the grain of localism, which is about divesting power to local communities, and it is fundamentally undemocratic, and this is why as Liberal Democrats we are opposed to these changes.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is following recent damage in Dobcross due to HGV vehicles and a campaign by local residents\nLiberal Democrats want Dobcross to be one of the first places to benefit from campaigns for 20mph zones in local centres. Councillor Garth Harkness presented a motion to the March 2019 council meeting about tackling speeding. As a result, a working group is considering proposals. This followed the Liberal Democrats’ previous attempts for a borough wide 20mph speed limit on residential roads being rejected.\nMeanwhile, Dobcross residents have raised a petition, aimed at 20mph limits and signs to keep damaging lorries out, and the press has lent excellent support.\nNow, Garth has followed it up with a question to the November council meeting, backing local residents and calling for a 20 mph zone in Dobcross to be trialled and then hopefully rolled out further. Carrying on from his proposals for action to tackle the HGV issues in Saddleworth, he has now called for better signage Garth said, “With all this momentum, I am optimistic of success.”\nThe response from the cabinet member is as follows:\nThe current situation is as follows:\nLorry Watch should only be carried out in areas that have Environmental weight restrictions in place; however, these are relatively expensive to introduce due to the need to illuminate signs around a cordon and are difficult to resource and enforce by the Police as schemes must be able to both accommodate legitimate delivery access but deter all other HGV’s.\nInitial consideration in Dobcross suggests that safely positioning and siting of the required signs may be an issue due to some of the routes not having footways or footways being of substandard width.\nLorry watch isn’t currently in progress in Delph as some signing issues need rectifying at a cost currently being identified by Traffic Officers.\nRegarding the introduction of a 20mph Speeds limit strategy for villages in the Saddleworth area. This is something that is currently being considered by traffic engineers and a request for funding from a future year’s Capital Programme is being pursued.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The investigation is due to finish hearings into the systematic exploitation of children by organised networks on October 29.\nThe Liberal Democrat group on Oldham Council initially wrote to the Investigation to ask whether or not it would actively engage with the investigation in Oldham. They were told that it was looking at six other areas across the UK which had been chosen to represent a range of sizes, demographics and institutional practices, and it had not seen that it was necessary to liaise with the Oldham investigation.\nThe Liberal Democrats responded to confirm that the investigation currently taking place in Oldham is looking at the same areas as the IICSA investigation, and requesting they ensured that any outcomes were communicated to the Council, so that any conclusions that applied could be implemented quickly and effectively.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Sam Al-Hamdani said: “As the Home Office-sponsored investigation chose not to look at cases such as those in Rochdale and Oldham directly, it is vital that we do still see outcomes that will help shape our Councils’ and communities’ response to these types of crimes.\n“It is crucial that the Council learns lessons not just from the local investigation, but also from any institutional failings that have been found across the UK,” he continued. “We must ensure that survivors know that they can come forward in confidence, be heard, and know that they will be properly investigated. Our institutions must not repeat any previous mistakes.”\nA separate investigation into effective leadership of child protection is due to hold its hearings in December, and again, any findings must be communicated directly to the Council to ensure that best practice can be taken forward.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats on Oldham Council Howard Sykes MBE added: “We have written to the Chief Executive of the Council to ensure that they are looking to incorporate the findings of the Home Office investigation into their own practices. The independent investigation currently taking place will no doubt deliver a number of ways in which we need to improve, but it is vital that we do not stop there. We must listen to this investigation, to charities who work in this sector, and most importantly, to the survivors of sexual violence, to ensure that they get the support they need, and the perpetrators of such crimes receive the punishment they deserve.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is undertaken by an army of keen volunteers. But it just in one place – the centre of Oldham.\n“We have many districts within our borough and the range of activities available other than what the Council provides is extremely varied. In Shaw and Crompton there are many activities but these are mainly uniformed services – ie beavers, brownies and scouts. These activities do not appeal to everyone, so a Youth Centre is a hub for other activities. But we believe that our Youth Centre in Shaw will close” said Councillor Diane Williamson, Shadow Cabinet Member for Education and Safeguarding.\nIt does appear that youth services are expendable but this should not be the case; we need to invest in our youth service not cut it.\nCllr Williamson added: “The provision of a youth service may not be statutory but at least at present it engages with young people within districts and some of the problems the communities encounter can be combated by those youth workers who are going to lose their jobs. They are the ones that build up relationships with sometimes vulnerable young people and engage with them about the negatives of their behaviour etc.\n“When this provision goes we are going to lose all those relationships. A lot of our young people will not go to Mahdlo because they just cannot get to it. So where will they go. Hang about on the streets and then be accused of causing all sorts of problems?\n“We must not forget that the young people of our borough are our future and if we treat them with dignity and respect, rather than cutting something that helps construct positive relationships between people and communities, then perhaps they will continue to live in and build our borough, rather than move away at the earliest opportunity.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Britain may be in the fast lane in terms of job creation and unemployment is falling, but we need to ensure that people who may need a little more help are not left behind.\n“That is why we are building on our motion at the last council which sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for disabled people and carers who want to seek employment.\n“As part of its offer to Get Oldham Working, the Liberal Democrat Group wants to see Oldham Council offer specialist support and better access to technology to people with dyslexia in their quest for work and to support our employees so they can excel in their jobs”.\nFellow Saddleworth Lib Dem councillor, Derek Heffernan, who is seconding the motion, said\n“As a school governor I see first-hand the benefits that the Pupil Premium, introduced by the Liberal Democrats in Government, has provided in supporting the most vulnerable. At school and college young people can get extra support to ensure they can be just as successful as their peers, if not more so. The support seems to stop after the young people leave education”.\n“We need to work with the Dyslexia Foundation to establish specialist courses for those with dyslexia, the advisors who support them, and local employers.\n“The motion also asks the Council to investigate installing voice recognition software on computers in public libraries and the Link Centre, and to urge Job Centre Plus to do the same at the Oldham Job Centre as part of their digital rollout. Such software packages cost very little but can be invaluable to jobseekers with dyslexia”.\nCllr Harkness added\nLeave a comment“Dyslexia is a recognised disability and without reasonable adjustments it can be a huge barrier to gain employment or remain employed. With reasonable adjustments and appropriate support people can succeed with dyslexia.\n“Once more the Liberal Democrat Group is bringing a motion to Council that contains practical ideas to help more people in our borough get working.\n“Lastly we want to look to the future and ensure we mark Dyslexia Awareness Week (5th to 11th October 2015) with suitable events to raise awareness amongst the public and employers and to promote this provision”.\nLeave a Reply",

I now intend to work hard for both my ward and indeed the whole of Saddleworth. I believe that the Parish needs to modernise as we are using standing orders established in 1974. The expected changes through the localism bill should enable the council to have a bigger say in the development of our area with devolved powers for dealing with planning and housing. The localism bill will give us a great opportunity to develop Saddleworth in a way that protects its heritage.\nThe District Partnership has shown how different people can work together for a common aim namely improving the area. I think that this needs to continue and I aim to play a big part in developing the District Partnership. I think we should be working together not only in the council but with other organisations also.\nIn the past committees have always been agreed before the annual meeting and 42% of committee positions were offered to conservatives and independents. (They make up 40% of the council) before the meeting. It was therefore disappointing that the committees are yet to be decided. I hope we can move forward and work together in a professional manner.\nTwo of the main issues in Springhead and Grotton involve the Cooper Street Quarry and the Grotton Hotel proposed developments. I have already been involved in the public meetings on these issues. The public opinion is obvious and I will continue to campaign on them. I am working hard to improve the roads etc. I have had many pot holes filled; graffiti sorted etc and am hopeful of some resurfacing work on Old Mill Lane.

This way of working which supports the proposed arrangement will also allow Waste Management to maintain safe working procedures observing social distancing guidance as the crews will continue to work to two, rather than three in a vehicle cabin.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

That is why in our amendment we want to support everything that can be done during the committee stages to make as many changes as possible to improve things but also to write to Labour and Liberal Democrat leaders to ask that they would repeal such legislation in the future. That way workers’ rights may be knocked down for now but we will get them back again. The changes are ideologically driven, not evidence based and counterproductive.\nThe motion is seconded by Liberal Democrat Leader and Leader of the Opposition Councillor Howard Sykes MBE, who said “The Liberal Democrats stopped this happening in the last government like the Snoopers Charter, profit making schools and inheritance tax cuts for millionaires. We now need to work together to stop them introducing the draconian measures that are being brought in to address a problem that does not exist relating to trade unions.

I have been working for some time on the flooding issues. The council have carried out work in the area and United Utilities have already carried out work around The Square in Dobcross . Some issues have been tackled by opening culverts, clearing grids, redirecting water etc. Causes for the flooding relating to the Woolpack pitch are progressing finally.

One of the concerns for parents was the 7.30 am. service being withdrawn in particular for school and college students. Transport for Greater Manchester have agreed to fill the gap during term time the 558 service which currently serves Delph/ Uppermill to Blue Coat school will serve Diggle and also serve Dobcross. The service will leave Diggle at 7.30am and arrive at Blue Coat school at 8.30am (More details will emerge soon) .\nWe understand that this service will be public and so will be open for people to use it for college too. Children are encouraged to use register for the IGO pass http://igo.tfgm.com/\nThe return service will be a yellow bus (Y23) so can only be used by students who hold a yellow school bus pass details : http://www.tfgm.com/buses/yellowschoolbus/Pages/default.aspx. This would leave Blue Coat school at 15.35 and return by 16.00.\nThis is good news and will alleviate problems for some. It has been an excellent example of working together across political persuasions and with residents to get a positive result. It is pleasing that Transport for Greater Manchester and First have listened and responded to genuine concerns to mitigate some of the concerns.\nThere is an issue with the turning circle in Diggle and the Saddleworth North Oldham borough Councillors aim to work together to lobby Oldham council into addressing these issues. We expect that this service will begin in September for term time.\nSome will still be disappointed. The decision to axe services is a commercial decision. My request to re-route the Huddersfield service through Dobcross has currently been discounted. The bus company are concerned with the safety of double decker’s going through Dobcross and inconsiderate parking causing considerable difficulties. The suggestion of enhancing the 353/4 service to serve Diggle will be looked at as part of a review. I will continue to work to push for improvements and reinstatement of the bus service and push for an integrated transport system.\nRegards\nGarth\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

When Labour removed District Executive funding, he claimed that it was “scaremongering” by the Liberal Democrats to suggest that that would no longer be funded. Last night he turned round and said that there was no central funding. Instead it would have to come out of Councillors’ funds – resulting in around £8,000 less available for projects in Saddleworth and Lees.\nCouncillor Harkness asked the meeting if the Council would make up for the £15,000 of support for the Band Contest that had been provided through District Executive funding, and on the support for the Dove Stone Marshalls which had been temporarily provided by Local Councillors in the absence of central funding, as had been suggested by the Labour leadership at the previous meeting.\nCouncillor Harkness said:\n“It hasn’t taken long for Labour to go back on their promises that these changes would not affect the Band Contest and Dove Stone marshals. Saddleworth’s Councillors have a track record of providing for projects in Saddleworth – the failures in the District Executive funding model came in Labour-run areas where funds were not used to help the community. It’s embarrassing to see Sean Fielding a former band member suggest that the Councillors need to do more. Maybe if the self indulgent “borough life” magazine or fact finding trips were abolished they could find the money to support the greatest free show on earth ”\n“Labour has cut funding to Saddleworth, and gone back on their reassurances at the very next meeting. We’ve done the maths, and if the local councillors have to make good on the council’s promises, that virtually halves the money we have to spend in the community.\nCouncillor Sam Al-Hamdani continued:\n4 Comments”I have been a councillor now for two months, and I already have a number of residents who need support. To find that half of my budget has been taken up with making good on funding that Oldham Council said would be taken care of is bad enough. To find the leader of the Council seemingly suggesting that it is our somehow fault is almost laughable.”\n“Having found such great support for the community in Saddleworth West and Lees, I want to be able to put back into the community. Being able to fund local projects is the very least that I should be able to do, and it is incredibly frustrating to find Oldham Council removing my ability to do so. I am sure Saddleworth councillors will continue to support the band contest as they always have. Many band contests are already struggling even with Councillor contributions and the District contributions. Labour council have ignored the call for help so clearly are happy to risk a long tradition disappearing. ”\nAbsolutely disgusting.\nAlready the bands them selves raise funds and then not to get the support will be the undoing for the council\nThis event attracts bands and visitors from across the globe .\nHalf wits in charge again .\nTypical of OMBC all they want from Saddleworth is the higher rates and to give nothing back to the residents. We are just a cash cow for the rest of Oldham.\nWhat about the Social Return on Investment ( which is the buzz phrase these days) or does the local authority on use that methodology for its pet projects\nSaddleworth it’s said is ‘‘The Jewel in the Crown’ for Oldham – If they pull the funding for our Traditional Whit Friday & the much needed Dovestone Marshalling scheme they’re surely going to be the FOOL’S in the area of Saddleworth’s crown – Come on O.M.B.C do the right thing.",

It is estimated that this ruling alone could free up to 125,000 employees to seek work with other employers”.\nBusinesses and trades unions will also draw up a code of fair practice and employees will also be given more information about their rights.\nCllr Harkness commented:\nLeave a comment“The changes follow from a public consultation that the Business Secretary conducted early this year.\nCouncillors had the opportunity to submit their own recommendations to the consultation after my colleague, the Leader of the Opposition, Cllr Howard Sykes, suggested at the February Council meeting that a special session be convened for this purpose.\nThe cross-party panel strongly supported a change to abolish ‘exclusivity clauses’, to create a fair code of practice and to make employees more aware of their rights, so it is especially pleasing that the Government has taken these recommendations on board – which shows that they were listening”.\nLeave a Reply",

Under the coalition government the electrification of the Leeds to Manchester route had been agreed and the reports indicated that it would be self-financing. So it beggars belief that they pause this project at the same time as investing further in rail infrastructure in the south.\nSo we see investment per head of population in transport at £2731 per head in London, £792 per head in the South East & just £134 per head in the North West. So 20 times more is invested in London than the north west. The Chancellor talked about this before the election to cynically attempt to show that they care about the North.\nElectric trains are also much more environmentally friendly. We should not be relying on deasil trains in the long run. They don’t in the south so why should we?\nIt is right that as a council we should lobby government to get the best for our borough regardless of who proposes a motion.

Government figures published in December 2020 also show that 5,421 households were on Oldham Council’s housing waiting list.\nCouncillor Howard Sykes MBE said: “Homes which remain empty for a long period of time are often neglected and fall into disrepair, leading to an area becoming blighted and driving down neighbouring property prices. At a time when families on the Council waiting list are in desperate need of a property to make their home, it is scandalous that we have so many empty homes that could be put to good use. If we bring empty homes back into use, it will also mean that there will be less pressure to build new homes on our irreplaceable Green Belt.\n“One of the ways that we can incentivise absentee owners to let or sell properties they leave empty for long-periods is to levy an increased Council Tax on them, as we are permitted to do by law.

The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group is calling on the Labour Administration to take urgent action to meet the recommendations outlined in the report.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness, Shadow Cabinet Member for Employment and Skills and an Autism Spectrum Disorder lead teacher at a Manchester school, said:\n“Although the inspectors found some good practice and some motivated staff, it is clear from this report that there is a serious disconnect between what should be happening to meet the accepted standards of good practice and what is all-too-often happening on the ground and in our classrooms in Oldham.\n“A child or young person with SEN, such as autism, and/or disabilities has just as much right to expect an excellent education as any other pupil. The inspectors refer to the many children and young people with these conditions who possess a ‘stunning conviction and a humbling humility about the work they do to improve the lives of their peers’. It is unforgiveable and it is shameful if we as a Council and as an education authority continue to fail them in this way, and this failure must stop.”\nThe condemnatory report called for a Written Statement of Action to be produced because of ‘significant areas of weakness in the local area’s practice’.\nCouncillor Harkness added:\n“We have had a long standing problem in Oldham in providing the best start for our children and young people with additional needs. As someone who works in specialist Autism Spectrum Disorder provision myself and who works closely with the Local Authority in Manchester on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities I know how important it is to provide the right support to these youngsters.”\nYet the report says that: ‘Oldham is one of the worst-achieving areas nationally for educational achievement for this group of children. This prevalent poor achievement is exacerbated by high levels of fixed-term exclusions and persistent absences from school for children and young people who have SEN and/or disabilities.’\nThe report also highlights that school transport is flawed and that ‘children and young people wait too long for the needs to be identified.’\nCouncillor Harkness said:\n“This is simply unacceptable. We are leaving these children behind, abandoning them educationally. By not properly accessing the needs of these children, and the support that they need, at an early enough stage – sometimes not until they move from primary to secondary school – we are making it more likely that they will underperform at school. By excluding them and tolerating poor attendance, we are exacerbating this problem, and by having a school transport system that is not up to the challenge we make it harder to encourage parents to send their children to school in the first place.\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group’s score on the performance of the Labour Administration based on the findings of this report is an F – for Failure. This is not just about ‘could do better’, this is about ‘must do better’ and now, because this Council has spent a fortune on the Oldham Education Commission but it continues to let our most vulnerable young people down.\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats want to see every child and young person in our Borough achieve as much as they possibly can in education and in life so that they can fulfil their true potential. As always we are willing to work with the Labour Administration if they genuinely want to work with us in achieving this laudable objective.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The investigation is due to finish hearings into the systematic exploitation of children by organised networks on October 29.\nThe Liberal Democrat group on Oldham Council initially wrote to the Investigation to ask whether or not it would actively engage with the investigation in Oldham. They were told that it was looking at six other areas across the UK which had been chosen to represent a range of sizes, demographics and institutional practices, and it had not seen that it was necessary to liaise with the Oldham investigation.\nThe Liberal Democrats responded to confirm that the investigation currently taking place in Oldham is looking at the same areas as the IICSA investigation, and requesting they ensured that any outcomes were communicated to the Council, so that any conclusions that applied could be implemented quickly and effectively.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Sam Al-Hamdani said: “As the Home Office-sponsored investigation chose not to look at cases such as those in Rochdale and Oldham directly, it is vital that we do still see outcomes that will help shape our Councils’ and communities’ response to these types of crimes.\n“It is crucial that the Council learns lessons not just from the local investigation, but also from any institutional failings that have been found across the UK,” he continued. “We must ensure that survivors know that they can come forward in confidence, be heard, and know that they will be properly investigated. Our institutions must not repeat any previous mistakes.”\nA separate investigation into effective leadership of child protection is due to hold its hearings in December, and again, any findings must be communicated directly to the Council to ensure that best practice can be taken forward.\nLeader of the Liberal Democrats on Oldham Council Howard Sykes MBE added: “We have written to the Chief Executive of the Council to ensure that they are looking to incorporate the findings of the Home Office investigation into their own practices. The independent investigation currently taking place will no doubt deliver a number of ways in which we need to improve, but it is vital that we do not stop there. We must listen to this investigation, to charities who work in this sector, and most importantly, to the survivors of sexual violence, to ensure that they get the support they need, and the perpetrators of such crimes receive the punishment they deserve.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Now we are turning our spotlight on clothing poverty. As the Covid-19 Lockdown begins to be lifted, we need to look again at ways that we can Build Britain Better. Two of our priorities must be finding ways to tackle climate change and finding ways to address poverty and social injustices in our society.”\n“Clothing waste is just criminal when we have so many of our citizens in need. We want to create a virtuous circle by putting the two together – taking the clothes that people don’t want and matching them up to those who need them. And by doing so we will reduce the number of clothes that hang unloved in wardrobes or are simply dumped. Its common-sense really and there are some good projects from around the country that we can learn from to help us do so.”\nNot only does clothing over-production eat up natural resources it results in the financial exploitation of workers in the clothing industry.\nCouncillor Diane Williamson, who is seconding the motion, said:\n“We need to identify how the Council and politicians can best support workers in the clothing sector at risk of exploitation. Many of these exploited workers are women producing garments on low-pay and under pressure in their own homes. Tackling the exploitation of clothing workers should be a priority as part of our collective effort to tackle poverty in our Borough.\nIt is for these reasons that the Oldham Liberal Democrats are bringing a motion to the 15th July 2020 Council meeting.

This was approved on the 12th September in the minutes from the July Council meeting.\nGuidance from the Department of Education states that 10% of 5-16 year olds suffer from ill mental health. On top of that, another 15% of that cohort were at risk of developing mental health issues. I write to you as a reminder, as I fear that Oldham Borough Council is at risk of not addressing these burgeoning problems.\nThe motion detailed already exemplary work that Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) do in Oldham Borough. But what is needed is continual and considerable upward development in this sector.\nCouncil voted unanimously to ask the lead cabinet members to work with the Health and Well Being Board to determine how the aspirations laid out in the motion can become reality. A report was promised with a 12-month deadline to detail Oldham Council’s findings and action on this. Since the deadline, we have missed three Full Council meetings where a report could have been given and will have failed to meet the 12 month deadline by five months.\nIt interests me greatly to know if this report had been realised within the 12-month timeframe for delivery?

This would support first time Council Tax payers who face exceptional hardship in paying their bill. “The hardship fund is one of a set of practical measures that the Oldham Liberal Democrats have proposed to support our poorest citizens, especially those who are disabled or otherwise vulnerable. Some of these measures have subsequently been taken up by the Labour Administration – and I hope that this idea will also be adopted.\n“The bumper Manchester Airport Group dividend could be used to support the establishment of this fund – and I would welcome the chance to have a dialogue with the Leader of the Council as I requested at September’s Council meeting.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I have raised issues with EON on many occasions and still have concerns over the lack of progress with regards to conservation areas, despite the best efforts, I must say from Oldham council.\nThe street lights we are getting are significantly better and provide better light coverage. When they are placed in the correct position. The increased flexibility in control of these new columns means that it could provide us with an important efficiency and environmental saving.\nWe are already used to driving on the motorway now with street lights turned completely off.Recent research has suggested that three quarters of councils have already dimmed street lighting or turned them off altogether.\nAn example of Sugar Lane in Dobcross from Wool Road up to the village. It is like a flood lit football pitch and there is virtually nothing on there so it seems completely pointless to light it at the 100% level.\nIf you reduce the level by 50% and stand under the column then you would notice no difference in lighting levels. I would argue that the lighting coverage would still be significantly better than the orange glow lighting.\nPlaces like Cornwall have already been using street lighting dimming. They introduced an invest to save project whereby streetlights dim, by 50% from midnight to 5.30am and allowed a saving of a third in energy output. By the last financial year, Cornwall was saving 6.4 million KWH of electricity just by dimming street lights. This has made Cornwall a world leader in carbon reduction and also adds to a tidy financial saving for their taxpayers.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I have always been clear from day one that I want a new school wherever the Education Funding Agency saw it as appropriate .\nIt has been clear for some time that place was Diggle. There has been a lot of strong feeling about this and at times I have been met with abuse.

I have to say that the scrutiny, process and attention to detail with regards to the recent Saddleworth school application has been excellent”\n“Some people will not be happy with the outcome and there has been a lot of contention. We now need to make it work for everyone and deliver the new school”\nGood news for our children. I just worry that the new school could be prone to flooding and a monstrous housing estate on the old site will ruin the feel of Uppermill. Let’s hope all goes well and planners and councillors are practical and sympathetic to all the building works.",

In our motion, we also expressed our belief that the National Living Wage “should be the minimum pay rate for all employees”.\nNationally the Liberal Democrats are campaigning on the streets and in Government to create one million more jobs to boost the record number of 30 million Britons in employment, and we are also fighting hard to make sure that these pay a decent wage.\nThis is why Lib Dem Business Secretary, Dr Vince Cable, will increase the National Minimum Wage in October to £6.50 per hour, a rate above inflation, and why Dr Cable plans similar inflation-busting increases in the years to come.\nAnd this is why the Liberal Democrats have secured in increase in the personal tax allowance so that the first £10,000 per annum is now earned tax free.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

One of the concerns for parents was the 7.30 am. service being withdrawn in particular for school and college students. Transport for Greater Manchester have agreed to fill the gap during term time the 558 service which currently serves Delph/ Uppermill to Blue Coat school will serve Diggle and also serve Dobcross. The service will leave Diggle at 7.30am and arrive at Blue Coat school at 8.30am (More details will emerge soon) .\nWe understand that this service will be public and so will be open for people to use it for college too. Children are encouraged to use register for the IGO pass http://igo.tfgm.com/\nThe return service will be a yellow bus (Y23) so can only be used by students who hold a yellow school bus pass details : http://www.tfgm.com/buses/yellowschoolbus/Pages/default.aspx. This would leave Blue Coat school at 15.35 and return by 16.00.\nThis is good news and will alleviate problems for some. It has been an excellent example of working together across political persuasions and with residents to get a positive result. It is pleasing that Transport for Greater Manchester and First have listened and responded to genuine concerns to mitigate some of the concerns.\nThere is an issue with the turning circle in Diggle and the Saddleworth North Oldham borough Councillors aim to work together to lobby Oldham council into addressing these issues. We expect that this service will begin in September for term time.\nSome will still be disappointed. The decision to axe services is a commercial decision. My request to re-route the Huddersfield service through Dobcross has currently been discounted. The bus company are concerned with the safety of double decker’s going through Dobcross and inconsiderate parking causing considerable difficulties. The suggestion of enhancing the 353/4 service to serve Diggle will be looked at as part of a review. I will continue to work to push for improvements and reinstatement of the bus service and push for an integrated transport system.\nRegards\nGarth\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

By way of example, research conducted by Action on Smoking and Health and Cancer Research UK shows that, following reductions to the Public Health Grant in 2015, 2016, and 2017, stop smoking services were cut in 39%, 59% and 50% of local authorities respectively year-on-year. Now, 4 in 10 local authorities are not able to offer a stop smoking service for all smokers in their area.\nCommenting Councillor Gloster said: “Oldham is a borough with a high incidence of poor health. Many of our residents suffer from long-term health conditions and many others are at risk of developing such diseases as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, diabetes, CPD and cancer, often because of a poor diet or poor life style choices. Taking funds away from prevention services that prevent ill health is a false economy. Smoking, obesity and alcohol account for 80,000, 30,000 and 7,000 early deaths each year respectively; and smoking remains the single biggest cause of preventable cancer.”\nThe Liberal Democrats want to see increased and sustained Government funding for public health to address health inequalities in deprived boroughs like Oldham, but the present Government is instead proposing to cut existing funding and make Councils rely on business rates\nCouncillor Gloster added: “The Government is looking to phase out the Public Health Grant by 2020/21 and to replace this with funding via business rates retention. This might work in a local authority area with low rates of long-term ill-health and a very vibrant local economy, but in an economically-deprived borough like Oldham it is unlikely to stack up and this will mean that poorly people will suffer as they will no longer have access to the vital health services that they need. We want to see Oldham Council support the Cancer Research UK campaign for the Public Health Grant to be restored.”\nCouncillor Harkness said\n“Replacing a grant with business rates retention means that areas of most need , like Oldham are disproportionately affected. We will not raise enough in business rates to compensate. We all know that in Health and Social care is early help . I’ve mentioned in this chamber before about mental health for example and the consequences of ignoring the early cases and by only dealing with issues when they become high level is far more costly when the issues may ve been tackled earlier , in the community and cheaper .The same applies to all public health “\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In common with other electricity distribution companies, we cannot guarantee a continuous, uninterrupted supply of electricity, as there are too many factors outside our control which prevent us from achieving this.\nWe appreciate the frustration supply interruptions cause to our customers and accept the particular problems experienced by residents of Dobcross, Saddleworth and Grotton in recent months.\n“In your email you mention the electricity fault in Dobcross on 1 April 2014 where a generator providing temporary supply ran out of fuel. I have investigated this matter and have found that the supply interruption was the result of problems with our equipment in the Sugar Lane substation. Our engineers attached a generator in way of a temporary restoration until a permanent repair could be completed several days later. Throughout the course of the repair our engineers had to constantly refill the generator to ensure supplies remained on. On one occasion the generator ran out of fuel sooner than expected, resulting in a number of properties loosing electricity supply for a short period of time.\nA permanent repair was carried out at 14:21 on 7 April 2014, at this time we were able to transfer all the affected customers back onto the mains electrical supply and remove the generator.\nLeave a Reply",

This is why we welcome and are backing the Deal Devo campaign.”\nThe Oldham Liberal Democrat Group has been calling for fair transport funding for the region to close the gap between London and Greater Manchester, and is opposed to further Police and local authority funding cuts and the government proposals to close both of the borough’s courthouses.\nCllr Sykes added: “Devolution represents an exciting opportunity for local authorities across Greater Manchester to work together to transform the lives of the region’s residents and to make service improvements that reflect local needs and that create local jobs. But it will not work if Government money does not follow the transfer of power, and we will not accept any attempt by Government to merely pass on responsibility for carrying out difficult cuts.”\nThe Oldham Liberal Democrats are firmly committed to seeing transparency in the work of the new Combined Authority – where all the Greater Manchester councils work together using the devolved powers and budget.\n“It isn’t enough just to tell people what’s going on. The new Combined Authority will be assuming responsibility for a massive devolved budget amounting to many billions of pounds and will be taking on board new areas of work affecting the lives of millions of people.”\n“The Liberal Democrats do not believe in telling people what we will do and then doing it for them. We want to actively involve Greater Manchester residents in making the decisions that affect their lives and in shaping the services that their taxes pay for.

More than once I noticed that the snow sign by Tesco on Huddersfield Road was indicating that the A62 was blocked after the road had re-opened.\nWith this in mind, can I ask the Cabinet Member if she will please ensure that a system is put in place so that warning signs reflect the actual status? And can she also look at what communication we have with the Highways Agency with regards to the use of diversion routes in the event of a motorway closure? Do we need to look at closing roads earlier to reduce the risk of people being stranded?\nAlso we had the situation where Lower Turf Lane, Scouthead was seemingly removed from the list of highways to be gritted. It had only recently been reinstated.\nThe gritters come down Huddersfield Road spreading and turn on to Lower Turf Lane. They travel about 300 metres not spreading and then continue onto Cooper Street again spreading grit.\nThat short, steep downhill stretch gets very icy and dangerous. Children going to the two schools, Springhead Infants and Knowsley Junior, aged from risings fives to eleven plus, and elderly people use it. For a short distance there is no pavement. Pedestrians are at the mercy of vehicles. Can this short stretch be included again on the gritting runs?”\nLeave a Reply",

To do this during recess when some councillors are on holiday is poor form. The process was put to us as “opportunities to save money” .Residents need to be able to get to the primary gritting routes so even if a bin is placed on a primary gritting route then side streets might use that bin If this is now being retracted then I welcome this but it needs to be an actual listening exercise and not a pause and plough on with the original plan.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor for Saddleworth North, Garth Harkness, has hit out at the council for their plan to remove some of some of the grit bins in Saddleworth. It will put the public at risk, he says.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “Saddleworth residents rely on grit bins during the winter months and this plan disproportionately affects our villages. I am not sure council leaders who live in other areas understand how difficult it can be to get to work on a snowy winter morning.”\nThe council plans to remove several grit bins in Delph, two in Diggle and one in Denshaw. It claims that some are on gritting routes and others are not used enough.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “They use figures for a mild winter, which is not appropriate. Many residents in Saddleworth need to dig themselves out and they really need more grit bins to service housing areas, not fewer. People have to get to the primary gritting routes to use them.\n“This is Oldham Council’s cynical attempt to blame local councillors for Labour cuts\nby demanding they pay for bins they say are essential.”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added “They are trying to put more and more things onto local councillors. We have very little funding and it is for things like community projects that matter to residents.”\n“I of course am opposing these cuts”, said Councillor Harkness. “Road safety is not an optional add-on.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In an attempt to ensure that traffic can flow freely along this stretch of road, temporary parking restrictions on both sides of the road will be in operation between Doctor Lane and Higher Turf / Lower Turf Lane.

The UK was the fastest growing major advanced economy of the G7 leading nations last year. The UK economy grew by 2.6% in 2014, its best performance since 2007.\nEd was previously quoted, again by Hansard, on 12th October 2011: ‘We were also told that public sector job cuts would be more than outweighed by the rise in private sector jobs…It has been a complete fantasy’.\nUnfortunately for Ed, it is him that lives in a fantasy. At the end of 2014, 1.85 million more people were in work than when Labour left office; an average of 1,000 extra people in employment every single day over the last 5 years. Employment is now at its highest ever level with record numbers of women in work.\nAll thanks to the Liberal Democrats in office . More needs to be done but don’t let Labour wreck our economy or the Tories ideologically target the most vulnerable.

The campaign by the charity Crohn’s and Colitis UK encourages venues with such toilets to install special signage with the logo ‘Not every disability is visible’.\nCrompton Councillor Louie Hamblett, who is the Shadow Cabinet Member for Health and Social Care, is raising this issue in a motion to the next meeting of the full Council (September 9). He said: “This motion is timely. The requirement to wear face coverings in shops and on public transport has started to raise public awareness that people can be exempted from their use because of a hidden disability. Accessible toilets, often opened using a RADAR key, are also sometimes needed by people who have a hidden disability. This campaign is around raising public awareness of that fact to help stop stigma and discrimination, and inappropriate challenges by staff, against those who have ‘invisible illnesses’, such as Crohn’s Disease.”\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats want the Council to ensure that the accessible toilets in our buildings all have this signage and that our onsite staff all receive appropriate training. We would also like to see retailers and leisure outlets across our borough encouraged to do the same.”\nThe motion also calls on the Council to install a Changing Places toilet in any new large Council building that opens to the public, and for new and existing Changing Places toilets to be properly sign-posted. The Government has legislated to make such toilets compulsory from next year.\nShaw Councillor Hazel Gloster, who is backing the motion, said: “The new legal requirement to provide Changing Places toilets to enable people with invisible disabilities to use purpose-built facilities affording them proper privacy and dignity is very welcome and long overdue. As a local authority with a duty to serve the public we have a responsibility to ensure that we properly plan for their provision in any of our new buildings. It is completely unacceptable that people with severe disabilities must sometimes wait hours to be able to access an appropriate toilet that meets their needs”.\nThe motion to the full meeting of Oldham Council (September 9) reads:\nNot every Disability is Visible\nThis Council notes that:\nCouncil resolves to:\nProposed by: Councillor Louie Hamblett\nSeconded by: Councillor Hazel Gloster\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This year we have decided to support the four existing community associations in this ward by giving them each a donation of £500 which they can spend as they wish. The only condition is that the association has to represent everybody who lives in the area and that there are no annual membership fees.\nNow, We want to encourage the setting up of a new community association for Austerlands and have arranged for an inaugural meeting to take place at 8.00pm at Austerlands Cricket Club on Tuesday 16h April.\nWe have the parish council and district partnership which are very important but community associations can create a further structure for a working partnership with local councillors and enable communities to feed into the district partnerships and parish councils.\nParticularly with the difficult economic climate, of local council cutback a good partnership with councillors and community groups is essential.

The physical closure will be between nos. 24 and 27, a distance of approximately 22 metres (24 yards).\nTraffic lights\nWith regards to using temporary traffic signals as opposed to a full road closure on Stoneswood Road, unfortunately this will not be possible. The narrowness of the road at the reconstruction location and the plant necessary to carry out the Works mean that a full road closure is necessary. To attempt to carry out the Works using temporary traffic signals would make the working area so restrictive that it would be dangerous for both the site operatives and for members of the public.\nClash with resurfacing?\nThe original plan was to do the repairs from 16th July 2018. This would clash with the resurfacing work due to start on 23rd July for The Sound and High Street. They are looking at delaying the start date of this work and once a date is confirmed this will be communicated. The proposed duration of the works is 12 weeks.\nParking?\nThe only residents whose parking arrangements will be directly affected by the Works will be those who live at nos. 24, 27 and 29. All other residents will still be able to access their driveways (if they have them) and on-street parking will not be affected. Those affected should have already been written to.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

  "http_garthharkness_mycouncillor_org_uk_/http_garthharkness_mycouncillor_org_uk_2013_11_21_frequently-asked-question-proposed-new-saddleworth-school/content_1301.html": "Liberal Democrat Councillor for Saddleworth North Ward on Oldham Council Learn more\nby Garth Harkness on 21 November, 2013\nFunding\nThe new School would be delivered as part of the Coalition Government Priority School Building Programme (PSBP) which is a Government-managed programme set up to address the needs of the schools most in need of urgent repair. Through the PSBP, 261 schools will be rebuilt or have their needs met. The first school will be completed in 2014 and all schools will be delivered by 2017. Saddleworth School is one of seven schools included within ‘North West 3 capital batch’.\nInterserve Projects Services have been appointed as the selected construction panel member for the £52 million contract for the North West 3 capital batch which includes 7 schools located at;\n– Flowery Field Primary, Tameside\n– Saddleworth School, Oldham\n– Elton High School, Bury\n– Gorton Mount Primary, Manchester\n– Stanley Grove Primary, Manchester\n– Mesne Lea Primary, Salford\n– Broadoak Primary, Tameside\nWith the exception of Saddleworth School and Gorton Mount School, all replacement Schools would be developed on the sites of the existing Schools.\nThe construction of the School is being managed by the Education Funding Agency (EFA). A project team for each batch has been appointed by the EFA.\nDelivering works through the PSPB Capital Programme is undertaken by the ‘batching’ of schools as a package of works. Generally, schools within the batch will be in different local authorities and a batch will typically contain between 5 and 7 schools. The batching of schools limits the number of individual procurement exercises that need to take place, thus making the programme more cost effective and with a quicker build programme.\nBatches of schools are procured using the EFA managed Contractors Framework. This is a Framework Contract procured by the Department for Education under the EU Procurement Regulations. All contractors on the Framework are invited to tender for each batch of schools and, after an initial submission, are shortlisted to two contractors. Those shortlisted contractors then develop detailed proposals for one of the schemes in the batch, chosen as the ‘Sample Scheme’. In the case of the North West 3 Capital Batch, the Sample Scheme was Flowery Field Primary School.\nA Contractor is selected for the entire batch based on the following criteria;\nThe EFA manage the £52m contract across the whole North West batch of schools. Consequently, whilst the exact funding for Saddleworth School is not fixed, it is likely that a budget in the region of £17m would be available.\nThe details of the works to be completed at each school and the associated funding will be determined as part of a feasibility study undertaken by the EFA. The EFA will work with applicants and schools to develop the proposals to address the condition need. This will require searches to be undertaken (for example to determine whether there are any planning constraints on the site), surveys to be undertaken (for example to determine ground conditions), plans to be drawn up and specification for works to be prepared. The EFA will be seeking to determine the option offering the best value for money to the public purse. In the case of Saddleworth School, this feasibility work is currently underway.\nThe EFA will fund the construction of the new school on the site. Additional works that might be required outside of the site (i.e. highway improvements etc.) would be the Council’s responsibility, along with any costs associated with land acquisition, etc.\nSite Location\n6. Would a replacement school on the Saddleworth School site been considered?\nUnder the BSF programme, Halliday Meecham, the Council’s Technical Advisors, sketched two options for 1350 pupils that did fit on the site. However, in 2008 Halliday Meecham recommended not reusing the existing site due to the constrained nature of the existing access road and the likely operational disruption to the School during the construction works. As a result, the Council’s preferred location for the BSF School was on the frontage of the WH Shaws site.\nUnder the PSPB, whilst 15 sites were considered, the Council and School preferred the land at the rear part of the former WH Shaw site. After appraising this area, the EFA advised that the rear of the site would incur additional costs compared with the frontage plot and therefore, the frontage was chosen as the preferred option on the basis that it represented the most affordable and deliverable option\nNevertheless, as part of its Feasibility Review, the EFA has considered the development of the school on the existing site and have confirmed that this option would exceed the EFA funding envelope and would lead to significant and sustained disruption to the school during the construction process.\nSince being advised that funding under the PSBP programme had been secured in January 2013, the Council considered 15 sites which included the existing Saddleworth School site and the former WH Shaw Pallet site which was the preferred site under the 2008 Building Schools for the Future scheme.\nWhilst the EFA does not determine which site should be chosen, with matters of Saddleworth school location being determined by the Local Authority in consultation with the school themselves, the EFA has a finite amount of funding available, which is a strong factor that must be considered as part of any site selection process, as it may limit the number of sites that are available. The preferred site also has to be approved by the EFA at the feasibility stage and is assessed against strict deliverability criteria.\nIn 2008, when the Council initially looked at developing a replacement Saddleworth School under the Building Schools for the Future initiative, its advisors under this scheme – Halliday Meecham – concluded that re-using the existing site was not deliverable.\nThe EFA have confirmed that it is not uncommon for projects in the PSPB to;\n– Be built on the existing site.\n– Be built on the existing playing fields and for the sports facilities to be rebuilt after the demolition of the current school building.\n– Utilise temporary accommodation while the work is being delivered.\nHowever, all schools are assessed on an individual basis and the constrained nature of the Uppermill site means that this approach is not considered to be a cost effective and deliverable solution in the case of Saddleworth School.\nA new 1500 place school would fit on the existing School site, indeed the initial Halliday Meecham work sketched two options that did fit on the site. However, in 2008 the option of reusing the site was dismissed by the Council’s advisors due to the constrained nature of the existing access road and the likely disruption to the School during the construction works.\nWork carried out subsequently by the EFA has confirmed that the development of the existing site would be above the EFA funding envelope and, in addition, would lead to significant and sustained disruption to the School.\nThe Council have received a plan from a local architect showing a potential option of how the existing site could be re-used in support of the new school. The School’s Technical Group are considering this and whether or not this presents a more affordable scheme in comparison with that previously prepared and costed by the EFA’s Technical Advisors.\nBoth the Council and School are committed to delivering the best solution for the area within the EFA’s affordability envelope.\nThe existing Saddleworth School site measures 11 acres. This includes the area either side of the existing School drive, i.e. Pickhill Brook which is largely unusable due to its challenging topography. The site at the former WH Shaw site would provide a minimum of 13.31 acres.\nThe EFA has not specified a minimum size for an overall site area.\nThe Council considered a total of 15 sites which were all appraised based on timescales, deliverability, cost, legal, planning, highways and engineering risk. Having completed this process, the only option was part of the former WH Shaw site.\nIf the Council have advised that there was essentially one option, this would have impacted on the Council’s negotiating position and the Authority were keen to obtain the best commercial deal.\nHeads of terms were finally agreed on 16 October 2013, the same day that the site was officially announced at a public meeting.\nBuilding the school at the rear of the site will incur additional costs compared to developing on the frontage. The EFA has therefore adopted the most affordable and deliverable option within the funding available.\n14. Are buildings being developed in the Green Belt?\nAt a public event on the 16 October 2013 when the Council initially presented the “EFA Control Option”, it was made clear that this was not a final design and does not necessarily represent what would ultimately be built on the site.\nA Control Option is used by the EFA to determine whether it is feasible to build a school on a particular site, taking account results of surveys and searches and site constraints. The final and detailed design of the school however, will be developed by the appointed contractor, Interserve.\nThe current “Control Option” sites a Sports Hall / sports pitches on the Green Belt land. This is not contrary to Green Belt planning policy. Residents who are concerned at the current proposals would have the opportunity to comment accordingly once a planning application has been made, but the EFA is hopeful that the final plans will allay the majority of known concerns.\nThe whole of the WH Shaw Pallet site, which includes the land that would be retained by the developer, measures 25.42 acres of which, 9.53 acres (or 38%) is located within the Green Belt.\nNo. Whilst informally used for grazing purposes, the areas of land are zoned for industrial and business development in the Local Development Framework. The plots are not within the Green Belt and therefore, if the School was not developed on this area of land, there would be little to prevent the land being developed for industrial sheds for example, which would only compound the highway and visual issues raised by residents.\nAccess\nThe Control Option scheme has been prepared by the EFA to illustrate how a 1500 place school could be accommodated on the preferred site and therefore does not show all the works that would be carried out in the area and does not necessarily represent the final design solution.\nIn suggesting the use of part of the former WH Shaw Pallet site, it is recognised that there is a need to improve accessibility. Officers have met with representatives from the Highways Authority and a series of works have been suggested that will help mitigate the impact of the School and improve traffic flow for all Diggle residents. Details of these works will be announced once consultation with key stakeholders has taken place but could involve, introducing parking restrictions, the expansion of existing parking laybys on Standedge Road to provide an early drop off, widening the carriageway along parts of Huddersfield Road, widening pedestrian footpaths along parts of Huddersfield Road to ensure that pupils can continue to walk safely from the neighbouring villages and early drop off points and the introduction of a School Zone to ensure that the carriageway widening does not result in traffic increasing their speed. This would be in addition to the parent drop off, bus turnaround etc., which would be included within the site curtilage.\nThe Council currently holds slightly historic information which was obtained in 2008 when the Council originally considered the use of the site under the Building Schools for the Future programme.\nThe planning applicant would have to update this information prior to the submission. This updated survey work would also take into account the planned highway improvement works that would be carried out by the Council in advance of the School becoming operational.\nIn addition to a Traffic Survey, it is likely that a planning applicant would also need to include a Travel Plan which shows how children would access the School. The Travel Plan would also look at ways in which green and sustainable travel methods could be encouraged to mitigate the amount of traffic generated from the development proposal.\nIt is anticipated that the Council will need to invest an additional contribution to deliver the School proposals on any site. However, in respect to the costs of funding works for the School to stay on the existing site, this is likely to be significant. Even if the funding of temporary accommodation etc. was to be resolved, traffic disruption during the build and potential health and safety issues of trying to balance construction traffic, school traffic and pupil access along a lengthy but narrow school drive would be challenging.\nThe Council is looking to acquire part of the former WH Shaw Pallet site by way of a landswap using the existing Saddleworth School site. The terms are in the process of being independently verified by the District Valuer but, due to the inequality of value in the Council’s favour, by proceeding with the swap, the Council would receive a capital receipt that would be used to help fund the highway improvement works at Diggle.\nThe existing owner of the former WH Shaw site would acquire the existing Saddleworth School site once it is vacated. The developer would be responsible for demolishing the property and then hopes, subject to obtaining planning approval, to build a scheme of aspirational, family sized houses on the site. This is consistent with how the Council would want to see the site developed.\nDesign\nThe EFA has prepared a ‘Control Option’. This detailed design would then be submitted by Interserve as planning applicant on behalf of the Secretary of State.\nInterserve have not yet commenced the detailed design of the school. However, both parties can hold discussions with the build contractor following the feasibility review to provide their views on the current proposals and seek alterations that do not increase the overall cost or reduce the specification.\nA Technical Group has been setup which comprises Ward and Parish Councillors, Council officers, representatives from the School and members of the public who have offered to provide professional input and assistance. This group will look to work with the build contractor and Council to ensure that the best solution is delivered.\nThe final design solution isn’t known although, the Control Option does show a building which takes account of the topography of the site, with a two storey building at the frontage, with a three storey building to the rear of the site (nearest the Brook).\nThe impact of the new building on the setting of the Listed Building will be a planning consideration and something that the applicant would need to address through effective discussions with English Heritage who are likely to be a consultee to the application.\nThe School are keen to allow the local community to use the facilities onsite. In order to allow this, it is likely that any sports pitches would need to have floodlighting. If this is the case, it is likely that a planning condition would limit the opening hours of the pitches to protect the nearby houses against any noise and light pollution.\nThe EFA are unlikely to pay for floodlights and therefore, if appropriate, it is likely that the Council would have to contribute to this cost.\nFlood Risk\nIn January 2010, Oldham Council commissioned JBA Consulting to produce a Hybrid Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. The report advises that, “the Diggle Brook flows through the Diggle School site; however, the risk from this small watercourse is estimated to be low. The sequential approach to development layout should be applied within the site so that the most vulnerable development is located away from the watercourse. Flood depths are predicted to be shallow and flood hazard is considered to be low. Where flood depths are up to 0.6m, this risk can be managed by appropriate access, egress, flood warning and emergency planning procedures.”\nThe report continues to say that “whilst the actual risk to Diggle School from Diggle Brook is low, the residual risk from the Huddersfield Canal is more significant, as it lies on higher ground to the east of the site. This residual risk could potentially cause the greater flood hazard to the school, which is in the Canal Hazard Zone. Subject to the findings of more detailed Flood Risk Assessments, these development sites should manage this residual risk by appropriate access, egress, emergency planning procedures and finished floor levels which incorporate a freeboard allowance for the risk from the canal.”\nA Flood Risk Assessment will therefore be completed and submitted as part of any future planning application. This may mean that further flood protection or remedial measures are needed to mitigate the impact on the School.\nIn respect to the development and associated hardstanding, the impact of run off can be effectively managed through appropriate drainage systems. The Hybrid SFRA report itself acknowledged that “all development proposals should look at opportunities to incorporate SUDS to reduce the risk of surface water flooding (Sustainability Appraisal indicator). Surface water run-off from these sites should not increase as a result of development and not discharge into the combined sewer system.”\nIf it is agreed that the offer of funding is rejected, then the School will have to remain in its current dated and poor condition facilities. Options would be limited and on a worst case scenario, if the property continues to deteriorate, the school could be closed, with pupils travelling to nearby Schools inside and outside of the Borough instead.\nThe Council and School are not aware of other funding schemes that might become available in future years.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Through the PSBP, 261 schools will be rebuilt or have their needs met. The first school will be completed in 2014 and all schools will be delivered by 2017. Saddleworth School is one of seven schools included within ‘North West 3 capital batch’.\nInterserve Projects Services have been appointed as the selected construction panel member for the £52 million contract for the North West 3 capital batch which includes 7 schools located at;\n– Flowery Field Primary, Tameside\n– Saddleworth School, Oldham\n– Elton High School, Bury\n– Gorton Mount Primary, Manchester\n– Stanley Grove Primary, Manchester\n– Mesne Lea Primary, Salford\n– Broadoak Primary, Tameside\nWith the exception of Saddleworth School and Gorton Mount School, all replacement Schools would be developed on the sites of the existing Schools.\nThe construction of the School is being managed by the Education Funding Agency (EFA). A project team for each batch has been appointed by the EFA.\nDelivering works through the PSPB Capital Programme is undertaken by the ‘batching’ of schools as a package of works. Generally, schools within the batch will be in different local authorities and a batch will typically contain between 5 and 7 schools. The batching of schools limits the number of individual procurement exercises that need to take place, thus making the programme more cost effective and with a quicker build programme.\nBatches of schools are procured using the EFA managed Contractors Framework. This is a Framework Contract procured by the Department for Education under the EU Procurement Regulations. All contractors on the Framework are invited to tender for each batch of schools and, after an initial submission, are shortlisted to two contractors. Those shortlisted contractors then develop detailed proposals for one of the schemes in the batch, chosen as the ‘Sample Scheme’. In the case of the North West 3 Capital Batch, the Sample Scheme was Flowery Field Primary School.\nA Contractor is selected for the entire batch based on the following criteria;\nThe EFA manage the £52m contract across the whole North West batch of schools. Consequently, whilst the exact funding for Saddleworth School is not fixed, it is likely that a budget in the region of £17m would be available.\nThe details of the works to be completed at each school and the associated funding will be determined as part of a feasibility study undertaken by the EFA. The EFA will work with applicants and schools to develop the proposals to address the condition need. This will require searches to be undertaken (for example to determine whether there are any planning constraints on the site), surveys to be undertaken (for example to determine ground conditions), plans to be drawn up and specification for works to be prepared. The EFA will be seeking to determine the option offering the best value for money to the public purse. In the case of Saddleworth School, this feasibility work is currently underway.\nThe EFA will fund the construction of the new school on the site. Additional works that might be required outside of the site (i.e. highway improvements etc.) would be the Council’s responsibility, along with any costs associated with land acquisition, etc.\nSite Location\n6. Would a replacement school on the Saddleworth School site been considered?\nUnder the BSF programme, Halliday Meecham, the Council’s Technical Advisors, sketched two options for 1350 pupils that did fit on the site. However, in 2008 Halliday Meecham recommended not reusing the existing site due to the constrained nature of the existing access road and the likely operational disruption to the School during the construction works. As a result, the Council’s preferred location for the BSF School was on the frontage of the WH Shaws site.\nUnder the PSPB, whilst 15 sites were considered, the Council and School preferred the land at the rear part of the former WH Shaw site. After appraising this area, the EFA advised that the rear of the site would incur additional costs compared with the frontage plot and therefore, the frontage was chosen as the preferred option on the basis that it represented the most affordable and deliverable option\nNevertheless, as part of its Feasibility Review, the EFA has considered the development of the school on the existing site and have confirmed that this option would exceed the EFA funding envelope and would lead to significant and sustained disruption to the school during the construction process.\nSince being advised that funding under the PSBP programme had been secured in January 2013, the Council considered 15 sites which included the existing Saddleworth School site and the former WH Shaw Pallet site which was the preferred site under the 2008 Building Schools for the Future scheme.\nWhilst the EFA does not determine which site should be chosen, with matters of Saddleworth school location being determined by the Local Authority in consultation with the school themselves, the EFA has a finite amount of funding available, which is a strong factor that must be considered as part of any site selection process, as it may limit the number of sites that are available. The preferred site also has to be approved by the EFA at the feasibility stage and is assessed against strict deliverability criteria.\nIn 2008, when the Council initially looked at developing a replacement Saddleworth School under the Building Schools for the Future initiative, its advisors under this scheme – Halliday Meecham – concluded that re-using the existing site was not deliverable.\nThe EFA have confirmed that it is not uncommon for projects in the PSPB to;\n– Be built on the existing site.\n– Be built on the existing playing fields and for the sports facilities to be rebuilt after the demolition of the current school building.\n– Utilise temporary accommodation while the work is being delivered.\nHowever, all schools are assessed on an individual basis and the constrained nature of the Uppermill site means that this approach is not considered to be a cost effective and deliverable solution in the case of Saddleworth School.\nA new 1500 place school would fit on the existing School site, indeed the initial Halliday Meecham work sketched two options that did fit on the site. However, in 2008 the option of reusing the site was dismissed by the Council’s advisors due to the constrained nature of the existing access road and the likely disruption to the School during the construction works.\nWork carried out subsequently by the EFA has confirmed that the development of the existing site would be above the EFA funding envelope and, in addition, would lead to significant and sustained disruption to the School.\nThe Council have received a plan from a local architect showing a potential option of how the existing site could be re-used in support of the new school. The School’s Technical Group are considering this and whether or not this presents a more affordable scheme in comparison with that previously prepared and costed by the EFA’s Technical Advisors.\nBoth the Council and School are committed to delivering the best solution for the area within the EFA’s affordability envelope.\nThe existing Saddleworth School site measures 11 acres. This includes the area either side of the existing School drive, i.e. Pickhill Brook which is largely unusable due to its challenging topography. The site at the former WH Shaw site would provide a minimum of 13.31 acres.\nThe EFA has not specified a minimum size for an overall site area.\nThe Council considered a total of 15 sites which were all appraised based on timescales, deliverability, cost, legal, planning, highways and engineering risk. Having completed this process, the only option was part of the former WH Shaw site.\nIf the Council have advised that there was essentially one option, this would have impacted on the Council’s negotiating position and the Authority were keen to obtain the best commercial deal.\nHeads of terms were finally agreed on 16 October 2013, the same day that the site was officially announced at a public meeting.\nBuilding the school at the rear of the site will incur additional costs compared to developing on the frontage. The EFA has therefore adopted the most affordable and deliverable option within the funding available.\n14. Are buildings being developed in the Green Belt?\nAt a public event on the 16 October 2013 when the Council initially presented the “EFA Control Option”, it was made clear that this was not a final design and does not necessarily represent what would ultimately be built on the site.\nA Control Option is used by the EFA to determine whether it is feasible to build a school on a particular site, taking account results of surveys and searches and site constraints. The final and detailed design of the school however, will be developed by the appointed contractor, Interserve.\nThe current “Control Option” sites a Sports Hall / sports pitches on the Green Belt land. This is not contrary to Green Belt planning policy. Residents who are concerned at the current proposals would have the opportunity to comment accordingly once a planning application has been made, but the EFA is hopeful that the final plans will allay the majority of known concerns.\nThe whole of the WH Shaw Pallet site, which includes the land that would be retained by the developer, measures 25.42 acres of which, 9.53 acres (or 38%) is located within the Green Belt.\nNo. Whilst informally used for grazing purposes, the areas of land are zoned for industrial and business development in the Local Development Framework. The plots are not within the Green Belt and therefore, if the School was not developed on this area of land, there would be little to prevent the land being developed for industrial sheds for example, which would only compound the highway and visual issues raised by residents.\nAccess\nThe Control Option scheme has been prepared by the EFA to illustrate how a 1500 place school could be accommodated on the preferred site and therefore does not show all the works that would be carried out in the area and does not necessarily represent the final design solution.\nIn suggesting the use of part of the former WH Shaw Pallet site, it is recognised that there is a need to improve accessibility. Officers have met with representatives from the Highways Authority and a series of works have been suggested that will help mitigate the impact of the School and improve traffic flow for all Diggle residents. Details of these works will be announced once consultation with key stakeholders has taken place but could involve, introducing parking restrictions, the expansion of existing parking laybys on Standedge Road to provide an early drop off, widening the carriageway along parts of Huddersfield Road, widening pedestrian footpaths along parts of Huddersfield Road to ensure that pupils can continue to walk safely from the neighbouring villages and early drop off points and the introduction of a School Zone to ensure that the carriageway widening does not result in traffic increasing their speed. This would be in addition to the parent drop off, bus turnaround etc., which would be included within the site curtilage.\nThe Council currently holds slightly historic information which was obtained in 2008 when the Council originally considered the use of the site under the Building Schools for the Future programme.\nThe planning applicant would have to update this information prior to the submission. This updated survey work would also take into account the planned highway improvement works that would be carried out by the Council in advance of the School becoming operational.\nIn addition to a Traffic Survey, it is likely that a planning applicant would also need to include a Travel Plan which shows how children would access the School. The Travel Plan would also look at ways in which green and sustainable travel methods could be encouraged to mitigate the amount of traffic generated from the development proposal.\nIt is anticipated that the Council will need to invest an additional contribution to deliver the School proposals on any site. However, in respect to the costs of funding works for the School to stay on the existing site, this is likely to be significant. Even if the funding of temporary accommodation etc. was to be resolved, traffic disruption during the build and potential health and safety issues of trying to balance construction traffic, school traffic and pupil access along a lengthy but narrow school drive would be challenging.\nThe Council is looking to acquire part of the former WH Shaw Pallet site by way of a landswap using the existing Saddleworth School site. The terms are in the process of being independently verified by the District Valuer but, due to the inequality of value in the Council’s favour, by proceeding with the swap, the Council would receive a capital receipt that would be used to help fund the highway improvement works at Diggle.\nThe existing owner of the former WH Shaw site would acquire the existing Saddleworth School site once it is vacated. The developer would be responsible for demolishing the property and then hopes, subject to obtaining planning approval, to build a scheme of aspirational, family sized houses on the site. This is consistent with how the Council would want to see the site developed.\nDesign\nThe EFA has prepared a ‘Control Option’. This detailed design would then be submitted by Interserve as planning applicant on behalf of the Secretary of State.\nInterserve have not yet commenced the detailed design of the school. However, both parties can hold discussions with the build contractor following the feasibility review to provide their views on the current proposals and seek alterations that do not increase the overall cost or reduce the specification.\nA Technical Group has been setup which comprises Ward and Parish Councillors, Council officers, representatives from the School and members of the public who have offered to provide professional input and assistance. This group will look to work with the build contractor and Council to ensure that the best solution is delivered.\nThe final design solution isn’t known although, the Control Option does show a building which takes account of the topography of the site, with a two storey building at the frontage, with a three storey building to the rear of the site (nearest the Brook).\nThe impact of the new building on the setting of the Listed Building will be a planning consideration and something that the applicant would need to address through effective discussions with English Heritage who are likely to be a consultee to the application.\nThe School are keen to allow the local community to use the facilities onsite. In order to allow this, it is likely that any sports pitches would need to have floodlighting. If this is the case, it is likely that a planning condition would limit the opening hours of the pitches to protect the nearby houses against any noise and light pollution.\nThe EFA are unlikely to pay for floodlights and therefore, if appropriate, it is likely that the Council would have to contribute to this cost.\nFlood Risk\nIn January 2010, Oldham Council commissioned JBA Consulting to produce a Hybrid Strategic Flood Risk Assessment. The report advises that, “the Diggle Brook flows through the Diggle School site; however, the risk from this small watercourse is estimated to be low. The sequential approach to development layout should be applied within the site so that the most vulnerable development is located away from the watercourse. Flood depths are predicted to be shallow and flood hazard is considered to be low. Where flood depths are up to 0.6m, this risk can be managed by appropriate access, egress, flood warning and emergency planning procedures.”\nThe report continues to say that “whilst the actual risk to Diggle School from Diggle Brook is low, the residual risk from the Huddersfield Canal is more significant, as it lies on higher ground to the east of the site. This residual risk could potentially cause the greater flood hazard to the school, which is in the Canal Hazard Zone. Subject to the findings of more detailed Flood Risk Assessments, these development sites should manage this residual risk by appropriate access, egress, emergency planning procedures and finished floor levels which incorporate a freeboard allowance for the risk from the canal.”\nA Flood Risk Assessment will therefore be completed and submitted as part of any future planning application. This may mean that further flood protection or remedial measures are needed to mitigate the impact on the School.\nIn respect to the development and associated hardstanding, the impact of run off can be effectively managed through appropriate drainage systems. The Hybrid SFRA report itself acknowledged that “all development proposals should look at opportunities to incorporate SUDS to reduce the risk of surface water flooding (Sustainability Appraisal indicator). Surface water run-off from these sites should not increase as a result of development and not discharge into the combined sewer system.”\nIf it is agreed that the offer of funding is rejected, then the School will have to remain in its current dated and poor condition facilities. Options would be limited and on a worst case scenario, if the property continues to deteriorate, the school could be closed, with pupils travelling to nearby Schools inside and outside of the Borough instead.\nThe Council and School are not aware of other funding schemes that might become available in future years.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Government figures published in December 2020 also show that 5,421 households were on Oldham Council’s housing waiting list.\nCouncillor Howard Sykes MBE said: “Homes which remain empty for a long period of time are often neglected and fall into disrepair, leading to an area becoming blighted and driving down neighbouring property prices. At a time when families on the Council waiting list are in desperate need of a property to make their home, it is scandalous that we have so many empty homes that could be put to good use. If we bring empty homes back into use, it will also mean that there will be less pressure to build new homes on our irreplaceable Green Belt.\n“One of the ways that we can incentivise absentee owners to let or sell properties they leave empty for long-periods is to levy an increased Council Tax on them, as we are permitted to do by law. This is an option we would like to see Oldham Council look at in the budget for the next financial year\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I don’t understand why that doesn’t apply when it comes to spending on shopping centres.”\nThe £68.3 million spending is in addition to the original purchase price for the centre, which was more than £10 million.\nCouncillor Al-Hamdani continued: “Regeneration of the town centre is vital. We need to have ambitious plans for Oldham. But the Labour Council hasn’t even finished its consultation on what to do with the Spindles, and yet it has already budgeted for the work it is going to do. It sounds more like Spendles than Spindles to me.\n“They say they have provided ‘more detail’ to the Towns Fund on its plans for the Spindles, in order to try and ensure that they get that funding. Where has that detail come from, and does it allow for the public’s response to the consultation? Or is that consultation just a sham and they already decided what they are doing.\n“The whole discussion seems riddled with inconsistencies. They are saying we can spend money on the Spindles while children are hungry, but we can’t spend it on health centres – health centres that were in the Labour’s Budget last year, but they have axed this year.\n“It just leaves the Liberal Democrats asking more and more questions about how this Council is spending, or choosing not to spend, taxpayers’ money.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The current GP practice building is out-dated and cramped and at the top of a steep hill which many less able or elderly people must find hard to access.

The Oldham Liberal Democrats are tabling a resolution about this matter to 6 November Council Meeting. This is a call to change the current operator and demand the Government act.\nCouncillor Sykes MBE says: “It is a great shame that Northern Rail have failed to resolve a huge raft of issues. There are always two sides to every story, but customers are constantly reminded that Northern Rail dodges responsibility and provides a sloppy service. The fact they have now admitted Pacer Trains will still be running in 2020 when they promised they would not is the final nail in their coffin for me.”\nNorth West Members of Parliament and Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham also want to remove the franchise from the current operators.\nNorthern recently introduced further penalty fare routes across the network. Councillor Hazel Gloster who is seconding the motion in November said the additional penalty routes are an insult to rail users.\nCouncillor Gloster stated: “The quality of service has never been poorer. They need to get their service right before they think about adding extra charges to the public. It is simply unacceptable and it’s another reminder that the government need to step in and resolve this rail crisis.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

There are 2 million more people in private sector jobs, fewer unemployed young people, long term unemployment is falling and we have more women in work than ever before. In Oldham unemployment continues to fall too\nAs a Liberal Democrat, these figures reaffirm my belief that the party was right to offer to join a Coalition Government back in 2010. We were willing to join such a Government to make common cause in the interests of Britain with either of the two main. Labour were not interested in a coalition (knowing the difficult decisions needed)\nOur critics still say that it was a betrayal.

Liberal Democrat Councillors submit three motions to every Council meeting, on a very wide range of issues.\n“It is said that imitation is the highest form of flattery. The Conservative motion called on Oldham Council to develop a Local Plan for the Borough and for house building to take place on Brownfield sites and through the conversion of redundant mills, shops and offices into housing. These were exactly the aspirations that the Liberal Democrats included in a motion that we took to Council in March 2017, when we called for withdrawal from the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework almost four years ago.”\nAt the March 2017 Council meeting, the majority Labour Group proposed an amendment which removed the Liberal Democrat demand for Oldham to leave the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework, in favour of developing a Local Plan for the Borough. However, the amended motion did retain the following paragraph written by the Liberal Democrats, which was adopted as Council policy:\n‘Council firmly believes that new housing development should first take place on brownfield or derelict sites, on sites with existing planning permission; and by converting long-term empty mills, shops and offices into homes; and that existing long-term empty homes should also be brought back into use, before any consideration is given to allocating green-belt or other protected open land for housing’.\nIn their amendment to tonight’s motion, Councillors Harkness and Al-Hamdani proposed this policy be reaffirmed, and they also sought changes to make the motion more accurate and focused.\nCouncillor Sam Al-Hamdani explained: “Garth and I were happy to oblige in making some wording changes which, as you would expect in a first motion, left a lot to be desired. We wanted to ensure that blame for this environmental disaster was appropriately assigned to Labour’s Greater Manchester Mayor, the nine remaining local authorities in Greater Manchester still on board with GMSF, eight of which are Labour, but one of which, Bolton, is Conservative-controlled, but also to the Conservative Government itself.\n“For the facts are that it is the Conservative Government that has imposed the requirement to build an unrealistic number of new homes upon Oldham and the other nine local authorities in Greater Manchester, it is the Conservative Government that is failing to put pressure on developers to build out housing on sites that already have planning permission, and it is the Conservative Government that is failing to provide sufficient finance to enable the remediation of more Brownfield sites to enable housing development to take place.”\nCouncillor Harkness concluded: “It is good that after almost four years the Conservative Group now seems finally to be backing the Liberal Democrats with a motion to change the Council’s policy in favour of a Local Plan for our Borough, but, if they really want to make a difference, I would suggest that rather than virtue-signalling they lobby their own Government Ministers to abandon this madness, and allow us to work with local people to develop the right plan for Saddleworth and Oldham”.\nThe original motion proposed by the Liberal Democrats in March 2017 read:\nCouncil 22 March 2017 – Notice of Opposition Business\nMotion 1 – Withdrawal from the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework\nThis Council notes that:\n· all councils are required by government to have a Local Plan which identifies land for housing, offices and industry;\n· the proposed Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) is one approach to fulfilling this requirement; however other local authorities have fulfilled this requirement by developing their own Local Plan;\n· the GMSF is a twenty year plan, requiring a third more housing land to be identified than would be required by typical fifteen year Local Plans produced by many other local authorities, and is based upon pre-Brexit growth assumptions over such a long period, which cannot be verified;\n· the GMSF proposals include significant releases of green-belt in the Borough of Oldham, particularly in Shaw, Crompton, Chadderton, Royton and Saddleworth;\nCouncil further notes that:\n· these early proposals were developed without sufficient involvement of residents or ward members;\n· many residents and local politicians, particularly in Shaw, Crompton, Chadderton, Royton and Saddleworth, are strongly opposed to many of these proposals;\nCouncil firmly believes that new housing development should first take place on brownfield or derelict sites, on sites with existing planning permission; and by converting long-term empty mills, shops and offices into homes; and that existing long-term empty homes should also be brought back into use, before any consideration is given to allocating green-belt or other protected open land for housing.\nConsequently, Council condemns the current GMSF proposals as they fail to identify such sites that are available for development and are instead predicated upon developing new housing on green-belt land in the Borough of Oldham.\nCouncil therefore resolves to:\n1. Formally withdraw from the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework process and make arrangements to ensure that the GMSF does not apply to the Borough of Oldham;\n2. Pursue Oldham’s own local plan. This should be a fifteen year Local Plan for the Borough which identifies that new housing development should first take place on brownfield or derelict sites, on sites with existing planning permission; and by converting long-term empty mills, shops and offices into homes; and that existing long-term empty homes should also be brought back into use, before any consideration is given to allocating green-belt or other protected open land for housing.\n3. Make arrangements to comply with the duty to cooperate with other planning authorities;\n4. Review existing development plan documents and build in a review process every five years;\nProposed by Seconded by\nCouncillor Howard Sykes MBE Councillor Dave Murphy\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In the UK, however, due to Ed Balls and his Labour colleagues we are in a worse situation than many other countries.

This financialmismanagement was left with the Liberal Democrats to clear up.\nFor three years now Ed Balls and Labour have talked down the economy, opposing every cut made by the Coalition to put public finances back into proper order, and have offered no alternatives. Tellingly they will not commit to reversing any cuts. Bankrupt of ideas and presenting no alternatives, that’s New Labour. The only policy we’ve heard from them is the mansion tax- ohand that’s a Lib Dem one. They won’t even say that they would commit to that in a manifesto.\nNow we have seen unemployment fall recently and a growth of the economy by 0.6% for two quarters now so we are slowly moving along the right path. So it is looking like Ed Balls is wrong. The Liberal Democrats have helped deliver a million private sector jobs andmore apprenticeships than ever before. To make sure he stays wrong we now need to deliver a million more jobs and apprenticeships to ensure we have a stronger economy. We need more apprenticeships for young people and more investment in manufacturing to give everyone a fair chance to get on. At least locally Labour and the Liberal Democrats are trying to get Oldham working- nationally from Labour we hear nothing.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Oldham and Saddleworth Liberal Democrat Councillors want to see Oldham Council at the forefront of the fight to protect our nation’s remaining irreplaceable legacy of ancient woodlands and ancient and veteran trees.\nSaddleworth West and Lees Councillor Sam Al-Hamdani will be proposing a motion at the next full meeting of Oldham Council (16 December 2020) calling for more protection for these trees: “In Oldham, we are all well aware of the threat of development hanging over our natural landscape with plans to build a significant number of new homes on our Green Belt. Whilst other elements of our physical landscape may have been worked and managed by humankind over the centuries, ancient woodlands and veteran trees have stood undefiled”.\n“Despite what may happen in the future, ancient woodlands and veteran trees must remain as irreducible symbols of our past. We can learn from them, we can love them, and as elected members and as a local authority, we must do all that we can to protect them”.\nSaddleworth North Councillor Garth Harkness is backing his Liberal Democrat colleague. Commenting he added: “The government’s National Planning Policy Framework has put planning protection for ancient woodlands and ancient and veteran trees on a par with the protection afforded to historic buildings, like palaces and castles, demonstrating that their loss to our nation would be too high a price to pay whatever the development”.\n“The Liberal Democrats hope that our new Local Plan will mirror the best practice of other local authorities and the excellent guidance from the Woodland Trust to ensure that ancient woodlands and ancient and veteran trees in this borough are comprehensively protected for our future generations to enjoy”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The professionalism of the meeting was that bad that it descended into a shambles, with members of the public not knowing what how the committee voted” said Councillor Garth Harkness.\nCouncillor Diane Williamson added “We have lodged a formal complaint on the grounds of unfairness and procedural impropriety due to the poor leadership of the meeting and decisions made that maybe constitutionally questionable and therefore legally questionable”.\nDear Carolyn and Sean\nOn Monday 1 July we attended the extraordinary Planning Committee to consider the following planning applications:\nPA/342008/18 Land at Hodge Clough Road\nPA/342030/18 Land at Pearly Bank\nPA/343269/19 Land at Knowls Lane\nMembers of the public and ward Councillors came to listen to the debates on the various applications and also to speak in support of refusal for all three applications. Members of the committee then asked questions to the speakers, ward Councillors and planning officers.\nIt was at this point the meeting descended into a shambles due to the inexperience of the chair and vice-chair.\nHodge Clough Road – we tried to put forward a proposal for refusal on Hodge Clough Road and the chair appeared to not know how to take the proposal forward. He asked for those in favour of refusal and we put our hands up. Then he says all those for the development, which is a clear breach of the constitution because he did not ask members to vote on approving the refusal put forward. He then ask for the approval of the planning application, without getting the refusal voted properly. He declares the application refused and the members of the public cheer. Lots of hasty conversations were had about it; incorrect numbers were given to the public on who voted how and on what proposal. The legal officer then declared that there was no decision made. A Councillor proposed it and the chair instructs someone to second it. The chair changed his vote and a member of public asked him what had changed his mind. Then he got the vote calculation incorrect then says the correct one; the head of planning confirms the correct result.\nKnowles Lane – It became extremely unclear as to what Councillors were voting for and members of public at one stage clearly did not know or understand what was going because some of the comments made. Thee chair tried proposing and seconding himself. The Vice-chair then asks if members want to put forward a proposal to approve it which appeared to put pressure on members to put forward a proposal to approve.

All I want is a decent facility, where our children can work, which is not a 100 years old and sadly no longer suitable for today’s type of education and which doesn’t cost a lot of money to sustain.\nI believe that many people still believe the misinformation and doubtful financial figures being put about by the Save Diggle Action Group (SDAG) and Cllr Mike Buckley.\nI would like to take this opportunity to answer many of their objections and suggestions.\nThere are three bodies involved in the Priority Schools Building Programme (PSBP) for the new school: The EFA, OMBC and the school. However the former two are the main players with the school acting as an advisory body.\nI strongly believe that residents should know the exact reasons why it is not possible to build on the existing Uppermill site. I will try to outline the main ones.\nFirstly the land on which the SDAG plan shows the new school to be built is what is called ‘made land’ i.e. it is not the original surface. In this case it is the spoil from earlier development of the site or elsewhere. Thus it is highly likely that the new building would have to be ‘piled’ – at very considerable cost – not allowed for in the SDAG figures.\nThe proposed road leading up to the new school building would also need to be piled to prevent it slipping into the adjoining Pickhill Brook – again not allowed for in the SDAG figures.\nBecause the school would be built on reclaimed land it is also extremely likely that the land and foundations would have to be protected against gas emissions, with methane barriers etc. – again not allowed for in the SDAG scheme.\nThe SDAG scheme suggests the removal of a classroom block – originally stated as 6 classrooms but it isn’t – it is 10 classrooms, plus toilets and offices. Worse still, the majority are specialist Art and Technology rooms – far larger than general classrooms. The existing rooms contain cookers, sinks and specialist benching.\nThe scheme suggests putting temporary classrooms on the site of the existing Multi Use Games Area (Muga) and grassed area alongside the linear path. Both areas are used daily for PE lessons. If this were the case we would be short of places to teach PE. The costs of large ‘prefabs’ would be much greater than the SDAG suggestion. In addition they would need a significant power supply as two rooms are for Food Technology and have ovens, washers, fridges etc. and as the school supply is already overloaded, and given the building site would also need power, there would need to be a separate supply going back to the nearest substation. Again costs not accounted for in the SDAG scheme.\nIt is also suggested that significant savings could be made by retaining the existing sports hall. Again this would be far from ideal as the building needs considerable money spending on it as it leaks – not only from above but also from below. It would also stick out into the suggested playing field!\nWhilst any building work was underway the school drive would have to serve both the builders and pupils – clearly a very challenging and dangerous situation to manage. One way to combat this would be to construct a second access– again at considerable cost not accounted for in the SDAG scheme.\nAs the Uppermill site is worth more than that at Diggle the Authority would receive the cash difference – money that it has guaranteed to spend on the new school and a sum which would not be available if the original site was to be used.\nThere are other minor matters but it is clear from the above that financially it is not possible to use the Uppermill site given the modest budget available. One final point concerns the time window within which the new school would have to be completed. It is estimated by the EFA that it would take an extra 8 months to do the building in Uppermill which would mean that it could not be completed in the required time scale.\nWith regard to the potential problems relating to the Diggle site. Firstly the Council have made it clear the Diggle site is 18% bigger than the Uppermill one.\nThe first concern which people have is the fact that at present the parked cars and the ‘pinch’ point at the start of Huddersfield Road cause problems for people trying to get in and out of the Village. This could be very simply cured by stopping cars parking on the Road (but also providing a car park behind the houses for displaced cars) and by widening the road at the pinch point and this is exactly what the Council are proposing.\nSecondly people fear the problems caused by parents dropping off their children at the entrance to the school (already a major concern at the present site). This will be dealt with by means of a ‘school safety zone’ where stopping is forbidden and could be enforced by the camera car.\nThe current control option shows all buses will load and unload on the school site and parents will be able to drive in and drop off their children thus leaving the main road free of obstructions.\nThe school has a technical group working to provide the best possible outcome both visually and educationally. This is made up mainly of local people who have volunteered to be part of the group and who have not been “handpicked” as stated by SDAG. The group have education, the children and the village as a main concern and many have experience of working in construction or design. Already they have managed to persuade the EFA to have a two story building facing the main road rather than a three storey and will continue to work for the best possible outcome.\nI understand the reasons behind SDAG wishing to block the application and I have no problem in them stating their case but they must tell the truth and not blow problems out of proportion and accept that their scheme to build in Uppermill is not viable.\nIf SDAG manage to hold up the planning process we will inevitably lose our chance of having a new school – one which may never come again in the foreseeable future and this would be a disaster for the area. Should the present school have to close because the building is judged to be inadequate or unsafe, our children would have to travel to other parts of Oldham and beyond for their education. Is this what SDAG really want?\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

We are sure that you too share these concerns.\nA recent Cabinet report; ‘Welfare Reform: Food Poverty and Food Banks’ presented to last Council highlighted that Oldham has an estimated 24,700 people in food poverty (or 10.7% of the population) and estimated that 4,600 accessed the borough’s food bank network.\nWith a new Tory Government no longer checked by the Liberal Democrats in coalition, we face the frightening prospect that poorer households across the borough will face great hardship over the next five years as welfare reform bites.\nWe fear this will have a big impact on peoples’ nutrition.

The Council agreed to write to the Secretary of State expressing their strong reservations at the proposed planning changes which will remove any the need for planning permission for extensions and conservatories. A technical consultation process has just begun and the Parish Council will now be outlining their opposition to the proposals as part of the consultation process. Oldham Council passed a similar motion at their meeting on 7th November 2012.\nCllr Garth Harkness proposing the motion said:-\n“I think this plan is ill thought through. The proposal will only be in force for a short time but the consequences will be seen for many years to come. This contradicts the whole idea of having local communities having more of a say in their area. The numbers also do not add up. There are around 400 thousand homes that have been given planning permission yet remain unbuilt by developers. We need more affordable housing yet many planning permissions remain undeveloped and this policy does nothing to attempt to address this.”\nCllr Mike Buckley, seconded adding:\n“The proposals put our heritage at risk. There would be no protection for ill thought through and inappropriate schemes. It will put the appearance and character of our villages and historic buildings seriously at risk. There always needs to be an element of scrutiny and review in any development that affects the appearance of a building. The present rules work well. If a proposal respects the character of a building, the character of the surrounding area and the amenity of neighbours it gets permission. The proposals are misguided – it’s not the planning rules that are holding back the building industry it’s the state of the economy.”\nExtending permitted development rights for homeowners and businesses: Technical consultation\nCloses 5pm 24th December 2012 –Can be found here:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/extending-permitted-development-rights-for-homeowners-and-businesses-technical-consultation\nLeave a Reply",

I initially had a meeting with United Utilities and Unity partnership (Oldham Council) officers in Dobcross relating to flooding issues and how a joint project could be put together to reduce the flood risk in the Saddleworth villages. Following further such meetings with Oldham council I feel that we are making progress on addressing some of the flooding issues\nYou will be aware that a joint project between the Environment Agency, United Utilities and Oldham council (via Unity Partnership) to address the issues of flooding and flooding risk along the River Tame and Diggle Brook. You will be aware that I arranged the first public consultation meeting for Thursday 20th June 2013 in Uppermill. This was to enable all partners to explain their role in the project and provide an opportunity for residents to ask questions and provide input into the in initial stages of the project. You will also be aware that a pre meeting was arranged for Tuesday 18th partners to discuss the public meeting.\nMany residents and businesses in Saddleworth have had first-hand experience of flooding and it’s effect in the last twelve months. As a result there is some anxiety. It can be difficult to know who to turn to for help. It is very positive that there is a joint partnership now to work together to find solutions. This joint working will increase the probability of success in bidding for funding to tackle the many issues. In order to be successful it is important that residents and business are able to feed in their local knowledge of the issues in order to provide a strong case.\nIt was therefore extremely disappointing that there was no representative from United Utilities at the pre-meeting or the public meeting. This compared to four from the Environment Agency, myself and two from Oldham Council. The non-attendance from United Utilities had a clear negative impact on the meeting and was in danger of overshadowing the positive progress that has been made.\nThe perception from some in the audience was that nothing had changed and there was an ineffective partnership. I do not subscribe to this view because I feel considerable progress has been made in a joint agenda to reduce the risk of flooding in Saddleworth.\nIn order to achieve the objectives I feel it is extremely important to take on the views of the local people because they have the examples that will strengthen the case. This project is a good news story and we need to work together to ensure that we achieve the desired outcome.\nI look forward to your response.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The council still preferred the longer restriction, arguing that it would allow overnight parking.\n“Most people don’t leave their house at 6am and pupils don’t arrive at school then, so I challenged it and am pleased that the Traffic Regulation Order Panel decided to make this accommodation. It is disappointing that my Labour and Conservative colleagues in Saddleworth North let this go by default.”\nCllr Harkness added, “The traffic management of Huddersfield Road in Diggle has understandably brought about much anxiety amongst residents. As many views are polar opposites it is impossible to accommodate everything and I understand that some people will not be happy with the outcome.\n“The process has been going on for about 8 years. I remember a number of village consultation events quite some time ago and the proposals have been amended many times.\n“The turning circle, extra car park and parking spaces at the back of some of the houses on Huddersfield Road are all concessions we have pushed for, so I do feel efforts have been made to accommodate concerns as much as possible .\n“We need a new school and my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I decided long ago that it was better to work for the safest and least disruptive solution for pupils and residents, not stand on the sidelines and carp, as some local representatives have done.”\nThe Traffic Regulation Order Panel is a cross-party group of councillors who scrutinise proposals for schemes such as this, to ensure that they are in the best interests of the borough’s residents.

Indeed the words by Saddleworth school head boy, Joe Wheeler stating “The construction of the new school should not be a battle between the villages. We should all be in unison to allow the children of tomorrow every single opportunity to flourish within their education” shows some wise shoulders and great leadership that we could all learn from.\nIn moving forward we all have to work together to ensure we get a new secondary school.\nWe are sure you know that my priority has always been to ensure that we get a new secondary school in Saddleworth and have always worked constructively with the council and other partners to achieve this. After all this time, We do not want to see the worst case scenario of the Diggle site being occupied by industrial units (as per it’s site designation), funding being pulled and us eventually having no secondary school in Saddleworth. We believe we need to be open and transparent to get the best outcome for our young people.\nIn a Manchester Evening News they report that “The court heard the council accepted that redeveloping the school on its existing site, whilst a more expensive option, would be “viable and affordable”. When the phrase was repeated in the Oldham Evening Chronicle it prompted us to write this letter. The implication of this statement suggests that the Education Funding Agency would provide even more funding to cover the significant costs of building in Uppermill and presumably financially supporting the decant of students to alternative accommodation during the process. This contradicts every single briefing I and my colleagues have ever received from Oldham council and others.\nIf we have learnt anything from this process it is that the silence will be filled with inaccuracies. I am therefore asking that the comments be addressed head on. We need to be in possession of the facts. If it is apparent that councillors have been misled then I would call for a full investigation and if appropriate, disciplinary action to be taken. If the accusations are false then such reporting should be condemned and Oldham council need to put the record straight.\nWe are more than willing to work with you to ensure that we get a new school for Saddleworth. Other schools funded in this programme are now built, occupied and providing the facilities we want for our young people. This has gone on too long and we need to get the best for our young people.\nYours Sincerely,\nCllr Garth Harkness,\nCllr Derek Heffernan\nCllr John McCann\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It’s about two and a half years later than I’d suggested we should be discussing these options,but we are where we are and having spoken with a number of residents about this issue, there is clearly work to be done\nLong standing Liberal Democrat Councillor, Derek Heffernan urged the council not to let penny pinching get in the way He said “We need a sensible traffic management system. Decisions about this should’ve been made in 2004 we need to now make sure that the best solution to address the traffic concerns in Diggle and Dobcross are looked at thoroughly and residents concerns are taken on board”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added “In Diggle it needs to be clear that students can walk in from any drop off points safely and buses can get through without getting stuck at the thinner parts of the road. The residents effected by parking restrictions need to be able to access off road parking but any restrictions need to be enforced from day one.\nHe also raised concerns about the impact on Dobcross\n“I do feel that the option which includes a drop-off point opposite The Navigation would cause a number of problems because being on that side of the road it could encourage Dobcross being a run through. Enhancing the turning circle further down may be a better solution”\nHe added “We do not want the village of Dobcross being a cut through and the council need to look at options to address this. Suggestions such as enhancing off-street parking on Dobcross New Road or enforceable access only around Woods Lane and The Square are things that need to be looked at in much more detail”\nThe Liberal Democrat councillors re-iterated their support for a new school Councillor Harkness said “A better option for a school was the Tesco site in Greenfield and that’s what Liberal Democrats campaigned for in 2008 when the Uppermill site was proving unviable then. This scheme, with less money has involved us pushing for the rear of the Diggle site”\nHe added “We have said throughout that we want a new school and would support the decision for a new school made by the funding agency report. When it was clear that Uppermill was not viable we lobbied for the rear of the Diggle site rather than the front. The issue now is that they address the access and traffic issues as a matter of urgency so that we still get a new secondary school in Saddleworth\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Previously four in ten pupils living in a poorer household were not eligible for free school meals, yet shockingly for many this meal might represent their only hot meal in the day.\n“But not only are school meals helping to meet the nutritional needs of our children, they have proven educational benefits too. Previous studies have shown that a child who is properly fed will concentrate more, behave better and study harder.\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats now want to see free school meals extended to all primary age pupils as an investment in our children’s future”.\nSeconding the motion, Lib Dem Cllr Diane Williamson added:\nLeave a comment“I am proud to say that the Liberal Democrats at their party conference agreed that our policy should be to support extending universal free school meals to all pupils aged 8 to 11.\n“This was the recommendation made to the last Government in the School Food Plan by experts John Vincent and Henry Dimbleby, but it has yet to be implemented.\n“We hope that, at Council, colleagues from every party will agree to take back to their respective political groups in the Local Government Association a call from Oldham that free school meals should be extended to all primary school children.

The current building has major problems and has been judged by education officials to no longer be fit for purpose..\nLib Dem Parliamentary candidate for Oldham East and Saddleworth Richard Marbrow said, “Now that the decision has been made, it is time for everyone to get behind the new school and to work to solve any problems residents will now face.”\n“Oldham council needs to be open and honest about what will happen to the Uppermill site and the council should start working now with residents in Diggle to ensure their concerns about traffic, environmental concerns, noise and building work related disruption are tackled.”\n“Along with Alan Belmore & John McCann in Saddleworth South, Derek Heffernan & Garth Harkness in Saddleworth North and Stephen Barrow & Val Sedgwick in Saddleworth West and Lees, I will now work with local residents to make sure the new school is a success and that any problems caused by the new building are minimised.”\nCllr Derek Heffernan said, “The council needs to work hard with residents of Diggle to make sure that the new school does not damage the village. That means working to make sure traffic is properly managed, that the planning process mitigates reasonable concerns and that the new school provides facilities that benefit residents.”\nAlan Belmore said, “Council plans for the Uppermill site need to be disclosed as soon as possible. If there is to be housing, it must be affordable housing for local families and not executive mansions to boost council tax income for the council.”\nStephen Barrow said, “Many people with young families in Grotton, Springhead and Lees want to see good teaching transferred into modern, excellent facilities where teachers are free to teach without worrying about the electrics or state of the building.”\nThe Liberal Democrats have also challenged Labour and the Saddleworth Independents Party to come clean about their position.\nRichard Marbrow said, “I expect more fudge and a lack of clarity from Debbie Abrahams MP. She needs to engage with this process and make clear that she supports this building or she needs to state that she is willing to put the new building at risk. The future of education in Saddleworth is too important for her to concentrate more on picking up votes than making a decision.”\n“The Independents Party need to be clear if they want a new school for Saddleworth and Lees kids or not.

The recent lockdown measures have again shown how vital it is for everyone to have local green spaces, and the benefits these places have on mental and physical health. Whether a local park, playing field, the open countryside, or just a little corner of greenery, access and enjoyment is important to all, especially those in poorer households and areas, who usually have less green space nearby – some of the people we must protect the most.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness said:\n“I am very pleased that my campaigning with local people to restore the bridges around Diggle, Dobcross and Uppermill has worked, and we will soon be able to return to what have been very popular routes around our villages. What could be better than walking – for our health and for the environment?”\n“The recent removal of a bridge carrying the bridleway over Church Road in Uppermill is something we shall be keeping our eye on,” said local campaigner Mick Scholes. “We understand money is very tight, and the council is quite rightly looking for outside funding to help, but one of the other local paths between Spring St and Bridge St was closed several years ago, and locals are still campaigning for it to be re-opened – we need to keep these issue alive to see progress.”\nParish and Borough Councillor Sam Al-Hamdani added:\n“The fight to keep Thornley Brook & Ashbrook Valley as a local green space for the benefit for all goes on, and now even more of the open space in Springhead and Grotton is threatened by the proposed development at Stonebreaks. The community has come together to fight these applications, and I have been proud to do whatever I can to support them.\n“The Knowls Lane planning meeting was a shambles, and it is unsurprising to see that a judicial review has been granted for next month. The works of residents in establishing the Ancient Woodland on the Knowls Lane site will hopefully help make the difference.”\n“Fundraising for the cost of the lawyers the community needs to fight the developers is ongoing, and all donations are welcome via the website www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-our-valleys/” said Sam.\nAnd all three Liberal Democrats voiced concern over the idea of closing Dovestone. The recent one-off “spike” in visitor numbers due to the relaxing of lockdown measures should not result in a knee-jerk reaction that is to the detriment of all.\n“In April last year I called for enforcement and hefty £1000 fines for BBQs and this was shortly followed by support from Saddleworth Parish Council and councillors with a call to action. Whilst I would like to see penalties being more than the current £100 I was very pleased for Saddleworth when the Public Spaces Prevention Order that I had asked for was created for Dovestone, but it needs enforcing, and that is the key to keeping the area open to all. We need a police presence on sunny summer days to boost the much-appreciated volunteer effort.” said Garth Harkness.\nMick Scholes added:\n“I have been dealing, face-to-face, with anti-social behaviour at Dovestone for years, and it is a very small minority who cause trouble – and the anti-social behaviour comes from across the spectrum of society. Those who suggest that somehow it is ‘outsiders’ coming into the area that are the root of the problem, or that trouble is only caused by young people do not know what they are talking about. Some of the worst abuse I have experienced is from middle-aged men from Saddleworth who don’t accept that the rules apply to them.”\nLeave a comment“The problems at Dovestone are not a recent thing, and I understand people’s concerns,” said Councillor Al-Hamdani. “We have the tools in place to make progress, and we want to keep the area open. To help that, we need to ensure that the rules are applied fairly, and to everyone. Recent events should not be an excuse for closing a much-used local area, an action that would have a disproportionate effect on those in poorer areas and for households who don’t have access to their own garden. These people need a green space, and we must do what needs to be done to deliver that.”\nLeave a Reply",

Enhancing the standard of others would need to be paid for as it is “like for like” Outside the conservation area there is no choice, it is the silver poles. I would like to see more flexibility with this but in the conservation areas there needs to be a choice. This choice has to be the local people.

This is of some inconvenience to residents on the outskirts of Delph and Scouthead. It is with regret that the council have chosen to suspend gritting around this area due to the closure of the road. It is also disappointing that this has been done without consultation with local councillors. Will the cabinet look again at supporting these residents and reinstating the gritting in the area so that they do not become isolated”\nCouncillor Ateeque Ur-Rehman agreed to look again at this, involve local councillors and see if the gritting routes can be reinstated\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Coalition Government has just announced a massive inquiry into the way the Big Six energy companies operate.\nThe inquiry has been promised by Liberal Democrat energy minister Ed Davey MP and is in direct response to public campaigns about increasing fuel costs at a time when the profits of energy companies are ever on the up.\nThe Government’s energy regulator (Ofgem) has now been instructed by the Minister to launch the biggest ever investigation into the energy market, which may lead to some of these massive companies being broken up to create more competition and so reduce consumer prices.\nThe Liberal Democrats are committed to a fairer society – and this includes being fair over access to energy. In government, we have encouraged competition and created simpler tariffs in the energy market creating competition and making it easier for consumers to switch suppliers. We have also sought to address fuel poverty by providing Warm Homes discounts and free insulation and boilers for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe Big Six rose to prominence during the last Labour Government when a failed regulatory regime led to these huge energy companies dictating prices.\nIn 2000, there were three generating companies and 14 suppliers – 17 companies – and after Labour’s reforms there was the Big Six.\nAnd who was one of the Labour ministers under whose watch this happened – why none other than Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, now Labour leader Ed Miliband MP.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The motion will be seconded by Shadow cabinet member for education and Shaw Councillor, Hazel Gloster\nCouncillor Garth Harkness has been working with MIND to improve mental health understanding in Saddleworth along with financing mental health courses for residents in Saddleworth and young people of the Saddeworth youth committee to increase awareness, identify warning signs and promote self-resilience.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “I have been working on mental health in my own school around mental health strategy and policy. The problem is huge all staff need training, there needs to be mental health first aiders in schools with clear guidelines for staff and a designated mental health lead . Approximately 10% of 5-16 year-olds have a clinically diagnosed mental health disorder. A further 15% of 5-16 year-olds have problems that put them at risk of developing mental health problems.”\nShaw Councillor Hazel Gloster said “We need to ensure all schools promote resilience, mindfulness and positive mental health along with skills to manage social and emotional difficulties to be taught in the curriculum. The government have talked about mental health but they still don’t back it enough and kids don’t get enough help until it is way down the line. Early help is the key”\n“Recent calls from government have called for more work to be done on supporting young people with mental health difficulties and also possibly include this in future inspection regimes.”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added I welcome the work done by the Health and Wellbeing board and the employment of a mental health school advisor but I know waiting times for adults with mental health difficulties are bad enough but they are horrendous for children!

More than once I noticed that the snow sign by Tesco on Huddersfield Road was indicating that the A62 was blocked after the road had re-opened.\nWith this in mind, can I ask the Cabinet Member if she will please ensure that a system is put in place so that warning signs reflect the actual status? And can she also look at what communication we have with the Highways Agency with regards to the use of diversion routes in the event of a motorway closure? Do we need to look at closing roads earlier to reduce the risk of people being stranded?\nAlso we had the situation where Lower Turf Lane, Scouthead was seemingly removed from the list of highways to be gritted. It had only recently been reinstated.\nThe gritters come down Huddersfield Road spreading and turn on to Lower Turf Lane. They travel about 300 metres not spreading and then continue onto Cooper Street again spreading grit.\nThat short, steep downhill stretch gets very icy and dangerous. Children going to the two schools, Springhead Infants and Knowsley Junior, aged from risings fives to eleven plus, and elderly people use it. For a short distance there is no pavement. Pedestrians are at the mercy of vehicles. Can this short stretch be included again on the gritting runs?”\nLeave a Reply",

Also common is disturbed sleep when siblings of various ages and differing bedtimes must sleep together.\nIt is desperately unfair when, according to the latest statistics the council has published, at least 7 individuals or childless couples appear to be living in five-bedroomed social homes, 25 in four-bedroomed homes, and no less than 341 in three-bedroomed homes.\n(It could be that they have a child or children, but that means you can add extra bedrooms to the figures above.)\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg – those who have been living rent-free and must now pay towards their unused bedrooms. There could be as many again over pension credit age, who are exempt from the size criteria; it is often the elderly who find themselves in unmanageably large properties when children have left. And then there are people who pay the full (subsidised) rent.\nThe ideal answer to overcrowding is to build more affordable homes, but that takes time and a great deal of money – up to £200,000 for the family houses which are in high demand.\nWith 5,555 families in priority need of a new home with 3 or more bedrooms, the majority of them overcrowded, the council should be pursuing every solution. One priority family in 15 could be rehoused if just those grossly under-occupying at public expense moved – potentially as many as one in 8 if all under-occupiers did.\nOldham had until recently an award-winning downsizing scheme which delivered over 200 larger homes for occupation quickly and for around £500 a time.\nCouncillors Thompson and McCann are seeking its reinstatement, along with a whole raft of other measures, in order to free up large homes for the families they were built for.\nThose measures include:\nCouncillor John McCann explains:\n“These are voluntary schemes we are proposing to help people who find themselves financially squeezed because they live in homes which are far larger than they need.\n“Our experience with the downsizing scheme was that the big reduction in outgoings was in heating bills and running costs. The reason many beneficiaries, especially older people, had hesitated was the complexity of moving home. Our downsizing scheme’s one-to-one support made it easy and they found themselves much better off.\n“We have not hesitated to make common cause with our Labour colleagues on the council in opposing the size criteria legislation where it is bad – inadequate allowance for disability, for instance, and failure to allow for the scarcity of one-bedroomed accommodation.\n“However, those with two or more spare bedrooms have a choice because they are vastly outnumbered by families who want family-sized houses. It is council procedure which perversely makes a move more difficult than it need be.”\n“The crunch question is whether to press people to move”, says Cllr LynneThompson. The most heart-rending casework I get is still from people living like sardines in overcrowded homes.\n“I understand emotional attachments to houses but ultimately I have to question whether it is morally right to allow people to play dog-in-the-manger with publicly-provided houses they do not need and others need desperately.\n“I also sympathise with young families struggling with a mortgage so they can realise the dream of a home of their own. Under-occupiers’ outrage that they must pay £21 a week to keep a four or five bedroomed house rings very hollow in their ears – and Labour’s claim they are hard-done-to even more so.\n“I believe that, in the first instance, the council should leave people a choice – downsize or contribute if required to. But if selfish people dig their heels in, the council must consider tougher measures and councillors of all parties must face up to supporting that. There is nothing generous about sacrificing children’s well-being to others’ self-interest.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Not enough warning not enough support just straight to sanction. “\n“Sometimes sanctions would be justified but sometimes it is clear they are not, sanctions are placed on applicants anyway and the applicant would clearly win on appeal but they then are left without money for weeks. Even then they won’t get it completely back dated. A recent report to Oldham council has highlighted the growing problem with homelessness in Oldham “\nCouncillor Harkness said “Landlords and private landlords in particular are not going to accept non-payment of rent because the Job centre has wrongfully sanctioned someone. This can put families with children at risk of eviction and homelessness. “\n“It is my view that Job Centre Plus need to do more to reduce the number of inappropriate sanctions and look at reasons for any non-attendance e.g. families with children, offer appropriate alternatives. “\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrat council group have suggested bespoke support for the most vulnerable cases but situations where for example, single parents and children are at risk of homelessness because of immediate sanctions without any investigation is unethical and should be reviewed as a matter of urgency.”\nEnds\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

When it came to the administration’s motion about the council tax despite being asked if anyone wanted to speak I was gagged and they went straight to the vote. I wanted to talk about the system of who pays council tax in the borough.\nChanges to the council tax support scheme make things more difficult. I am opposed to the reduction.

They would be better off in any of the Lib Dem run authorities across the country In fact in 12 there is no minimum payment.\nLabour’s Oldham has opted to introduce a scheme where everyone of working age will be required to contribute a minimum of 25% towards their Council Tax regardless of their financial circumstances. They expect a 50% collection rate so have to send out bills twice what is needed to meet the shortfall.\nLiberal Democrats have been working to make things fairer by cutting income tax in half for those on minimum wage and the lowest earners paying no income tax at all.On housing support Liberal Democrat Treasury Minister, Danny Alexander is battling and telling the Secretary of State his fears about the change in housing support, and urging his Conservative cabinet colleague to moderate his reforms.\nLib Dems support reducing the Single Persons Discount to 20% instead of 25% It would now be law if Labour nationally had supported it\n– and there would be no requirement for a 25% minimum payment from Oldham’s poorest households. Actually there is no requirement for the poorest to pay 25%- It is Labour’s choice to introduce it.

EON had never wanted consultation in conservation areas. They appeared to go off sulking and did not respond with proposals following our conservation area walks. They seem to want to carry on where they left off and I am concerned that this is what we are letting them do.\nThe response has been that they also “share my concerns and are taking all reasonable steps to ensure against works continuing in areas where consultation has not been completed”. Since my contact they called a meeting with EON this with week where they say they were going to re-iterate their position.\nThey say that to facilitate works progressing with an agreed approach in the conservation areas they have agreed to supply an input based specification. This means they will build a paper on each of the conservation areas which explains clearly to Eon what we are expecting from their designs and it will also enable them to continue work across the area where Members have no great concerns and a standard installation is appropriate. They will then need to supply any additional costs associated with the proposals which EON have so far failed to do.\nI personally would have preferred to have seen any further work in the conservation areas be suspended in it’s entirety until the public consultation drop-ins. It does seem to only be taking place where members had no objections to the style (even if there are other difficulties still outstanding e.g. the one in Delph opposite the White Lion) but if communities wanted to enhance some of these and had funds to do so it would be a good opportunity to do so. I know EON don’t want to be held up but in my opinion, it is their own fault.\nI will be meeting with them soon to continue to put the case forward and the continuing concerns.\nGarth, November last year these new lights were erected, they were painted black but remained unlit for nearly 10 months. Certainly on my street in Delph the old ugly concrete posts which were showing obvious signs decay and poor light – were side by side with the new ones. Well done Eon for finally getting stuck in and finishing the job.\nMuch better light improving safety and security, presumably more energy saving and finally we have got rid of the ugly concrete posts with terrible sodium lighting.\nIt’s about time councillors actually worked for improvement rather than against. This is a classic case of let the workers get on with the job.\nIan\nThanks for your comments\nAll street lighting in the borough is being replaced and I agree that the street lighting is to a much better standard. I do think they should be using LEDs though as they are more energy efficient. I have had complaints in many cases where there are issues and the response from EON has been poor in many cases. Throughout the process there are many examples where they have not listened in the consultation to many residents concerns. In the conservation area it was agreed that they would come up with options for enhanced lighting options or refurbishment in areas where they exist and costings if there is a desire to do it elsewhere within the conservation area. They have so far failed to do this.\nThere are a number of areas outside the conservation area where the posts are put up way before the lamps are activated and this is part of the process they use. No old lamps should be switched off until the new ones are on and working.\nThe reason I am doing this is precisely to work for improvements. EON are not doing the job properly\nRegards\nGarth",

It also plans to progress improvements in the facilities at the Civic Hall and provide new allotments throughout the Saddleworth. A major renovation and improvement programme of the Parish Cemetery is also underway. Parish Council Chairman, Brian Lord said “we want to do more for Saddleworth and this will cost money. But we recognise the difficult economic conditions facing many people and we felt that this year we ought to try to manage on the same money as last year”. The Parish Precept for a Band D property will now remain at £19 per year per household for another year.\nA major concern expressed at the meeting is the changes to Council Tax Benefit and its effect on how the Parish Precept is calculated. This could have led to a 20% increase in the Precept if government money had not been available to top up the shortfall resulting from the change.\nCouncillors also expressed concern at the possibility of unexpected costs arising during the year. In 2012 two by-elections had led the Parish Council having to pick up an unexpected and unbudgeted cost of £10,000.\nCouncillor Mike Buckley, in supporting the proposal said “Oldham Council have proposed an increase in Council tax of 3.5% or £54 for an average property, this is all the more reason why we should try to minimise the burden on the tax payer this year. We have already made significant economies this year through the hard work by all concerned. We are now going to look at further savings where they can be identified”.\nDespite the concerns, the Council agreed to hold the precept at the present level for another year.\nAllotments\nThe Parish Council has been successful in its bid to purchase land from the Canal and River Trust to provide around seventeen allotment plots between the river and High Street in Uppermill.\nThe District Partnership is providing the funding for this purchase and the Parish Council will arrange construction and the running of the area.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This week’s GDP figures showed the economy is starting, slowly, to get stronger, as we steadily bring borrowing under control and build confidence in Britain again. Liberal Democrats in government have focused on creating jobs and opportunities, especially for young people, and our commitment to a stronger economy is pointing us in the right direction.\n3. Crime is falling – again. It’s one of the untold stories of this government, but crime is lower than at any time since 1981. Of course, many factors affect crime rates but I firmly believe our drive on rehabilitation and treatment in prison and in the community is paying dividends.\n4.

I have been liaising with Oldham council who have been working with United Utilities and the Environment Agency to look at a more joint approach to deal with the flooding issues.\nI asked another question at full council to try to get the Woolpack pitch issue sorted as many people have become very frustrated. The damaged culvert at the Woolpack has now been repaired. There is to be sealing and some other work to take place over the spring and it is anticipated that the Woolpack pitch will be up and running again by August 2015.\nLikewise, frustration is rife on the flooding issue at Churchfiedls. A CCTV survey was carried out at the site and the external third party investigations have concluded that the cause of this flooding is a United Utilities (UU) clean water pipe installed by a UU contractor. The contractor laid their water main through an existing surface water culvert causing an obstruction that has effectively reduced the hydraulic capacity of it by substantially impeding the flow of water. This has resulted in water overflowing from the culvert during times of heavy rainfall, ultimately resulting in the flooding that is occurring in Churchfields and at Dobcross New Road. Now that the problem has been identified a joint urgent meeting has been arranged to try to find a solution.\nWe managed to save the Dobcross sorting office towards the end of last year. There is a review taking place again and we should finds out if it is under threat shortly.

Ratepayers expect their money to be spent on providing quality services in the neighbourhoods in which they live – the Liberal Democrats want to see more funding spent on bringing our roads up to scratch, on supporting a ‘war on waste’ and on devolving more of our budget to local leaders in each of our borough’s districts so that more local services can be delivered in response to local needs.”\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for the 1.7% Council Tax rise to be used to:\n“A 1.7% Council Tax increase will allow the Council to borrow an extra £5 million to invest in our borough’s roads. Imagine the impact that such an investment will make – the money can be employed wisely on improving roads where there is greatest public demand and drivers and their passengers will enjoy safer, smoother roads and improvements in travel times and road safety.”\nThe Shadow Cabinet Member for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Councillor John McCann, said:\n“The Liberal Democrats would make money available to employ two more cleaning teams and an extra vehicle to jet out gullies that have been filled with soil and other debris. Such an investment would be a victory for common sense as jetting means that clogged gullies do not have to be dug out at huge expense. This also reduces the risk of homes being flooded and there will be less water and ice on the roads, and in the long-term, a reduction in the damage caused by frozen water to road surfaces.”\n“The Liberal Democrats also want to use some of the extra money raised through a Council Tax rise to restore the free Bulky Bobs service. From contact with my own constituents, I know that people were angry when a £15 charge was brought in by the Labour Council and the imposition of a charge has contributed to a rise in fly-tipping. Tackling fly-tipping costs the Council and the ratepayers a small fortune so, surely then it is common sense to bring back a free service for everyone at a fraction of the cost.”\nThe Liberal Democrats want also to keep the team of enforcement officers up to full strength.\nCouncillor McCann: “We need to continue to employ the same number of officers to carry out enforcement action to ensure that fly-tippers know that in our borough this activity will not be tolerated and that offenders will always be prosecuted.”\n“I would also like to speak out particularly in support of the proposal to devolve £1 million of public money down to our districts. Despite Labour’s rhetoric, the Liberal Democrats are in fact the party of devolution, but in this instance we want to devolve £1 million down from Oldham Council to local people in each of the districts,” stated Councillor Sykes.\n“This would provide the three Councillors in every ward with a £50,000 budget to spend collectively to meet the needs of local people.”\n“In Shaw and Crompton, for example, we would use some of this money to commission more services for our young people to make up for the closure of our local Youth Centre by the Labour Council, but it is up to the local councillors of every district to decide what is important to the people they serve.”\n“The Liberal Democrats stand ready to accept the challenge of spending this money wisely to meet the needs of people in their local community – do Labour, the Tories, the Independents and UKIP?”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The professionalism of the meeting was that bad that it descended into a shambles, with members of the public not knowing what how the committee voted” said Councillor Garth Harkness.\nCouncillor Diane Williamson added “We have lodged a formal complaint on the grounds of unfairness and procedural impropriety due to the poor leadership of the meeting and decisions made that maybe constitutionally questionable and therefore legally questionable”.\nDear Carolyn and Sean\nOn Monday 1 July we attended the extraordinary Planning Committee to consider the following planning applications:\nPA/342008/18 Land at Hodge Clough Road\nPA/342030/18 Land at Pearly Bank\nPA/343269/19 Land at Knowls Lane\nMembers of the public and ward Councillors came to listen to the debates on the various applications and also to speak in support of refusal for all three applications. Members of the committee then asked questions to the speakers, ward Councillors and planning officers.\nIt was at this point the meeting descended into a shambles due to the inexperience of the chair and vice-chair.\nHodge Clough Road – we tried to put forward a proposal for refusal on Hodge Clough Road and the chair appeared to not know how to take the proposal forward. He asked for those in favour of refusal and we put our hands up. Then he says all those for the development, which is a clear breach of the constitution because he did not ask members to vote on approving the refusal put forward. He then ask for the approval of the planning application, without getting the refusal voted properly. He declares the application refused and the members of the public cheer. Lots of hasty conversations were had about it; incorrect numbers were given to the public on who voted how and on what proposal. The legal officer then declared that there was no decision made. A Councillor proposed it and the chair instructs someone to second it. The chair changed his vote and a member of public asked him what had changed his mind. Then he got the vote calculation incorrect then says the correct one; the head of planning confirms the correct result.\nKnowles Lane – It became extremely unclear as to what Councillors were voting for and members of public at one stage clearly did not know or understand what was going because some of the comments made. Thee chair tried proposing and seconding himself. The Vice-chair then asks if members want to put forward a proposal to approve it which appeared to put pressure on members to put forward a proposal to approve. The Chair at one point declared it as unanimous to approve but that was incorrect.\nTherefore on the grounds of unfairness and procedural impropriety we are writing to make formal complaint about the unprofessionalism leadership of the meeting and decisions made that maybe constitutionally questionable and therefore legally questionable.\nYours sincerely\nCllr Garth Harkness (as a member of the Planning Committee) and Cllr Diane Williamson (as a substitute of the Planning Committee).\nleadership of the meeting and decisions made that maybe constitutionally questionable and therefore legally questionable”.\n3 Comments\nThe Meeting was listed as “Extraordinary” – “Bloody unbelievable” is a more accurate assessment!\nSuggested working titles for the video https://youtu.be/v4IjxHNI8hc?t=5298\n“Clinty Pythian’s Lying Circus”,\nor – “Carry On Planning”.\nCould you please look into this.

Council minutes have since recorded that the matter is ‘in progress’. After almost two years of waiting for a meeting, Councillor Sykes’ patience has worn thin and he is concerned that time for further meaningful debate on the issue is fast running out.\nCommenting Councillor Sykes said: “The Greater Manchester Spatial Framework will, aside from Coronavirus, have one of the greatest impact of any issue on Oldham and its people, and this impact will be felt for twenty – thirty years. Under the current plans of Labour’s Greater Manchester Mayor and the Leaders of the ten Greater Manchester local authorities, thousands of new homes will be built across the Oldham Borough over two decades.”\n“Many of the Borough’s residents were rightly up-in-arms about the proposals to build most of these new homes on our precious and irreplaceable Green Belt, and Oldham’s Liberal Democrat Councillors joined them on protest marches and by objecting strongly in writing in response to every consultation and by raising questions in Full Council. I now feel it is time for Oldham’s Labour Administration to bring the latest proposals before the elected members who represent the people, and it must be at a one-item Council meeting as this is such an important issue there should be time for proper debate without the distraction of other business.”\nThe letter from Councillor Sykes to the Leader of Oldham Council, Councillor Sean Fielding, is shown below.\n22 July 2020\nCouncillor Sean Fielding, Leader of Oldham Borough Council\nDear Sean Fielding,\nRe: Meeting to discuss Greater Manchester Spatial Framework\nI am writing to you to follow up on my question to you at the full meeting of Oldham Council on 12th September 2018 requesting that a special meeting of the Council be convened with a one-off agenda item to discuss the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework.\nIn your response, you indicated that you were mindful to have an extraordinary meeting with this single item agenda and I would request that this be in addition to the agreed meeting cycle.\nIn ‘Update on Actions’ at last Council (page 133) there was a short note to say this was ‘in progress’ with Constitutional Services.\nI hope that we are not being left behind, and I would appreciate it if you could give me an indication of when this meeting will be held?\nWill it be in the current municipal year or in the 2021/22 Council meeting cycle?\nAre there any provisional dates under consideration which you can share?\nAs always, happy to discuss before a formal response is sent.\nYours sincerely,\nHoward Sykes\nThe question Councillor Sykes asked the Leader in Full Council on 12 September 2018 is shown below\nMr Mayor, my first question tonight relates to a future decision which will be one of the most momentous in its impact on many of our Borough’s residents over the next two plus decades.\nNamely the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) – the adoption of a 20-year housing and industrial land use development plan for Greater Manchester.\nThe revised proposals have been some time coming, but I understand that they will now be available for so called public consultation in October.\nI also understand that a decision has recently been made by the ten Labour Council leaders and the Mayor of Greater Manchester who have decided that the ultimate decision to adopt, or not to adopt the final plans, will rest solely with them.\nThere will be NO requirement to bring the plan to a full meeting of each of the ten Councils for debate and a full vote on formal adoption by all councillors.\nThis is a complete reversal of democracy.\nMembers will recall that many of our residents were outraged when the initial plans to build thousands of new homes on Green Belt land in Shaw, Crompton, Saddleworth, Royton and Chadderton were first unveiled.\nLiberal Democrat colleagues, I and members from the seats opposite, joined them in opposing the proposals when responding to the consultation or attending demonstrations in Tandle Hill Country Park and in Albert Square.\nMr Mayor, public sentiment is still the same across Greater Manchester – NO to building new homes on our Green Belt and YES to local Councillors as the people’s representatives ultimately making the decision where new homes are built.\nWard members are elected to lead, but also to represent the constituents and the communities we serve. How can we do this if we are denied the final vote on the plan?\nIf we get this wrong, it will represent a disaster for our communities and for our Green Belt. Yet the ten Labour Council Leaders and GM Mayor are saying ‘leave it to us, we know what is best for you’.\nIt is simply not right that such an important decision can be taken by so few people.\nIt is certainly not what I and many others envisaged but perhaps it is a sign of things to come with so called devolution to Greater Manchester.\nMr Mayor, I would like to ask the Leader tonight, whether despite this backroom deal, he will still be doing the honourable thing by bringing the final plan back to a meeting of the full Council for debate and adoption.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

That is why eligibility for free school meals is a criteria used to determine eligibility for Pupil Premium as this extra money enables extra support to be given at an early stage\nThat is why there is £1300 for each primary school pupil and £935 for secondary.\nIn the borough last year over £11 million extra funding giving a lift to 12 500 young people.\nIssues need to be tackled early and the free nursery places and free meals for infant children all would not happen without the Lib Dems and will help address the imbalance.\nAdopted children, children in care, in hospital or service personnel children are all included, quite rightly in the pupil premium.\nYoung carers are not included and so schools do not get extra financial support for them despite, being more likely to miss school, experience educational difficulties and have lower attainment at GCSE. We need to address this.\nTo be a carer can be exhausting and we need to do all we can to ensure they have the best possible chance to succeed at school and beyond.\nIt’s not all about money. Support agencies don’t even know about some young carers so some access no help at all. This is a problem that we need to work together to address.\nSystems need to be in place to support young carers with collaboration and closer working with groups such as the Young Carers Trust and the Oldham Young Carers Project.\nThis is a vulnerable group that needs more support and we should all do what we can to make sure they get it.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

These situations usually occur when drivers ignore displayed weight or width restrictions or use satnavs designed for cars instead of those specifically designed for HGVs and large vehicles. We want the Government to change the law so that these vehicles have to be equipped with the appropriate commercial version. They may cost a little more, but they will help reduce the price paid in inconvenience by local residents, such as our constituents in Delph, and other road users.”\nThe two Councillors also want the Council to support a call by the Local Government Association that Government give local authorities new powers to enforce traffic restrictions against HGVs.\nCouncillor Heffernan added: “The Police are often too overstretched to enforce these regulations. If the Government enacted Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004, this would grant Councils the necessary powers to carry out enforcement action.”\nFinally, the motion calls on the Council to co-operate with the two Parish Councils, with local residents’ associations and the Police to introduce Lorry Watch schemes in areas of the borough where HGV holdups may happen.\nCouncillor Heffernan concluded: “Lorry Watch scheme rely on local residents to record vehicles flouting weight and width restrictions and report them. Like Home Watch, this is about empowering local residents to take positive action to help keep their villages and rural areas HGV free. If we all do our bit, we can keep the traffic flowing.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Their infamous ‘Bunch of Fives’ unleashed three successive years of 5% rises from 2005 to 2007.

People are given vouchers and some organisations put a price on items so that anyone can come in and perhaps buy items and all funds go back into the scheme.”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said: “The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group has previously proposed motions to take action on food poverty, fuel poverty, water poverty, and period poverty. Now we are turning our spotlight on clothing poverty.\n“We have only in the last week seen Boohoo involved in claims of exploitation and unsafe working practices. This follows a Sunday Times report claiming workers at a Leicester factory were paid £3.50 an hour, while being offered no protection from coronavirus.\n“In November 2019, a survey on the Greater Manchester textile and garment industry that included 182 companies operating across the region, also found evidence that workers were being paid as little as £3-4 an hour.”\nNo Labour councillors or Conservative councillors decided to speak on the motion. All Labour councillors voted against the motion. One Conservative voted for the motion, one against and two did not vote.\nCouncillor Diane Williamson said:\n“The Labour administration did not even deem it to be worthy of someone to explain why they would not support this motion; I would take on any comments about what was in the motion, but there was deafening silence and they voted against it.\nSo why are they voting against tackling sweatshops, supporting low-paid workers and setting up an organisation to support those in need?”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said: “Of course, we do not always agree, and I have had motions that have not passed before. In this case I am genuinely baffled. I cannot understand why Labour councillors did not want to address poverty or modern slavery. They all chose to vote against this and not one decided to request to speak. That probably gives an indication of what they think about these important issues.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Chris, a Shaw Councillor, is a former Greater Manchester Police Inspector with 30 years’ front-line experience, patrolling Oldham’s streets.\n“A damning report published in July by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary showed that the investment in roads policing is totally inadequate. Due to years of chronic under-funding, traffic cops are left over-stretched, under-resourced and treated like a Cinderella service, though what they do is so vital,” stated Councillor Gloster.\n“Road policing has had its budget cut by far more than any other Police department, and this has meant more lives have been needlessly lost and more people needlessly injured in road accidents. In just three years, between 2015 and 2018, the Conservative Government cut funding by a quarter. Not only did this mean less officers were available to police our streets, but it also led to an increase by a quarter in the number of people killed or seriously injured on our roads. The lesson here is clear; investment in road policing saves lives,” he added.\nCouncillor Gloster is clear that under funding has led to less enforcement against drivers committing serious traffic offences which contribute to road accidents.\n“The rise in road deaths and serious injuries is linked to a sharp decline in impairment testing. Drivers now get behind a wheel under the influence of drugs or drink, and we need to do more testing to tackle this.” Said Councillor Gloster.\n“The Inspectorate report also showed that Police enforcement involving the reckless use of mobile phones by drivers and driving without a seat beat have slumped by as much as 75% since 2011. When certain drivers think they can get away with irresponsible and criminal behaviour, they will. To prevent this, enforcement is key and to have enough traffic officers to do this you need to invest in them.”.\nThe motion is being seconded by his colleague for Saddleworth North, Councillor Garth Harkness.\nGarth and his Liberal Democrat colleagues have previously proposed that Oldham Council adopt several major initiatives to improve road safety across the borough, including:\n• introducing a default speed limit of 20mph on minor residential roads\n• calling for more funding for speed cameras at danger spots\n• introducing gating schemes to keep our children safe when they are dropped off or picked up by their parents from school\n• establishing more Speed-watch and Lorry Watch schemes to enable concerned citizens to support the Police in reporting traffic violations\n• seeking more Police enforcement on pavement parking, and\n• further investment in vehicle activated road signage to curb speeding.\nGarth is passionate about road safety: “I was proud to propose several of these initiatives on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, but, unfortunately, the Labour Administration has chosen not taken any of these ideas forward in any meaningful way. I hope on this occasion they will at least back this motion as it is so important that we get more traffic police on our streets to help keep everyone safe, especially our children and elderly.”\nIn addition to calling for a restoration of Government funding and a Council response to the recent consultation, Councillors Gloster and Harkness want the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Panel to prioritise traffic policing in the local policing plan.\nCouncillor Chris Gloster ends: “The recent Inspectorate report clearly indicated that insufficient training and support was given by many Police Services to their traffic officers. This is not just about money, it is also about valuing traffic officers and giving them ‘the tools’ they need to do the job. I hope the Police and Crime Panel will feel able to give traffic policing in Greater Manchester the priority it deserves. We all have the right to feel safe on our streets”.\nEnds/…\nThe motion to Oldham Council on 9 September reads:\nRoads Policing ‘Not Optional’\nCouncil notes that:\n• In the last ten years, there has been no significant decline in the number of people killed and seriously injured on Britain’s roads, after decades of reducing casualties.\n• According to Department of Transport figures, there are still on average 5 fatalities and 68 serious injuries in England and Wales every day.\n• In early July, the Department of Transport published a public consultation document supporting a Roads Policing Review. The closing date for submissions is October 5th.\n• In the preamble to that document, the Under Secretary of State for Transport said the review sought to ‘build the fairest and most operationally effective enforcement capability in police and other agencies to deliver the best outcome for the safety of all road users.’\n• In the same month, the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary published a damning report which predicted an increase in road deaths because:\no According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, there has been a 34% cut in funding in real terms for road policing between 2012/3 and 2019/20 leading to a reduction of police officers available for these duties.\no These officers receive insufficient training and operational support.\no Road policing is ‘seen as less of a priority than it should be’ in most local plans and there is an ‘unclear national strategy.’\n• The HM Inspectorate called for urgent action as ‘roads policing is not optional.’\nCouncil resolves to:\n• Ask the Chief Executive to write to the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Transport, making clear this Council’s position that funding in real terms for road policing should be restored; that the HM Inspectorate’s recommendations be implemented in full as a priority; and that a new national strategy for road policing and safety should be developed.\n• Ask the Chief Executive to send copies of this letter to the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, the Police and Crime Panel and our three local Members of Parliament to seek their support for the Council’s position.\n• Ask the Council’s representative on the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Panel to request the Panel revisit the local policing plan to ensure that roads policing is sufficiently prioritised.\n• Ask the Chief Executive, in conjunction with the appropriate Council officers and the relevant Cabinet Member, to make a submission to the Roads Policing Review consultation on behalf of the Council taking this resolution into account.\nProposed by:\nCouncillor Chris Gloster\nSeconded by:\nCouncillor Garth Harkness\nLeave a Reply",

He works in an academy in Manchester with pupils with special needs and knows from first-hand experience how hard his Oldham colleagues will have been working through the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpeaking of the motion, Councillor Harkness said: “Everyone will be aware that all students have now returned to their classrooms and workshops from March 8 of this year, but some people will be unaware that teachers and education staff have in fact been working hard throughout the year-long pandemic, delivering learning in new and innovative ways. Often this has been online learning with pupils in a virtual classroom and sometimes it has been in-class tuition with the children of key workers or children unable to study at home.”\n“Despite the difficulties, educators and those many staff who support them in their work, from caretakers to school meals staff to administrators, have continued to work with the utmost professionalism and dedication, and the Oldham Liberal Democrats now think it’s time for Oldham Council to say a big thanks!”\nShaw Liberal Democrat Councillor Hazel Gloster will be seconding the motion.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Additional proposals for use of the existing site, along with the previous proposals of around 15 other alternative have all been rejected.\nThe Liberal Democrats believe we owe it to the people of Saddleworth and particularly the children to provide decent educational facilities. Currently Saddleworth School has the best results for its age group throughout the borough. We need a building which is going to maintain this high standard. The Liberal Democrats understand that this has come to a simple choice between a school on the Diggle site or no school at all.\nContrary to rumours the school is not being built on a greenbelt site although some fields will become playing fields and there will be a sports hall.\nMake no mistake with over 1100 spare places in Oldham schools at present it would be all too easy for Oldham Labour to ship pupils out of Saddleworth across the borough to solve a financial problem elsewhere. Those people who oppose a new school for Saddleworth are gambling with the future of the community.\nNo area like Saddleworth could maintain its strong sense of identity with no secondary school in it. Children deserve the best facilities we can give them and despite the heroic efforts of teachers on the Uppermill site that building is worn out and needs to be replaced. The needs of education when the Uppermill site was first built on bear no resemblance to the needs of a school in the 21st century.\nThe Liberal Democrats will now campaign with and for residents affected by the site to get the highways, design, noise protection and community use that they deserve to make the impact of a brand new school as positive as possible.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Now it’s being completely overturned by someone, I don’t know who or on what grounds.\n“It beggars belief that tickets are still being issued by parking attendants for parking outside marked bays, yet time limits are being ignored.\n“We need to ask officially why this decision was taken, who by and why we were not consulted.”\nHe later added that it was giving an unfair advantage to those in the know about the lack of enforcement compared with village visitors sticking to the restrictions.\nThe move was branded outrageous by Councillor Garth Harkness, while Councillor Alan Roughley said that not applying the restrictions was irresponsible and brought the council into contempt locally.\nThe revelation follows months of heated debate during which a review of the restrictions was pencilled in to begin this April.\nBut it was suggested that the results of surveys, intending to examine the effectiveness of the measures, could be skewed by locals knowing they won’t face punishment.\nWhile similar restrictions were suspended in Royton and Chadderton by bags being put over signs awaiting review, this has not been the case in Saddleworth.\nBut confused car-owners are being warned not to take the news as a green light to overstay the limits.\nCouncillor Royce Franklin said: “It could be a risk parking over the time limit. If someone chooses to park for more than two hours they will still be liable for prosecution.”\nThe district partnership agreed to write to the Highways Department demanding answers.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Almost 1.5 million of our youngest pupils have benefited from this policy.\nAs a Liberal Democrat, I am really proud of the effort made by schools to ensure children get the healthy meals they need. And studies have shown that the provision of a free school meal for every pupil helps improve concentration and academic performance and promote good behaviour.\nSuch has been the success of the programme that the Coalition Government’s independent school food reviewers even recommended extending free school meals to all primary school pupils.\nThis is now the party policy of the Liberal Democrats.\nIf we were in government, we would find the money to extend universal free school meals to all seven to eleven year olds, benefitting 1.9 million children and saving parents over £400 a year for each of their children.\nContrast this to the Tories who instead of investing in our children seem intent on turning up at the school gate and stealing their lunch money.\nLeave a Reply",

Risks can be reduced by regular gully cleaning and that is why Liberal Democrats have been clear that further investment is required on gully cleaning.\nOf course the amount of rainfall wouldn’t have changed if the Lib Dem budget proposals had been introduced and if Independent Labour and Conservative councillors had voted for it then what would have happened is that there would be three times as many gully cleaning appliances than at present. Having a regular gully cleaning programme with more resources would help reduce the impact. Increasing the capacity can be seen as a spend to save as jetting means clogged gullies do not have to be dug out at huge expense. It also ensures that there is less risk of homes flooding, less water and ice on the roads, which endangers drivers and pedestrians, and, in the long term, a reduction in damage to the roads caused by frozen water breaking the road surfaces.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This majority believe the proposals will make planning less democratic as elected members and members of the public will largely be excluded from the planning process, with decisions being handed over to unelected planning officers and developers being given more freedom to build as they wish, rather than as the public wants.\nCouncillor Sheldon also argued that the proposals in the White Paper will ensure that: “Green spaces will be protected for future generations”, but this is also a conviction out of step with his party colleagues. 70% of Conservative Councillors surveyed by Savanta Comres wanted to see an increase in the land allocated to Green Belt. The Planning for the Future proposals would diminish green space provision as unprotected farm land and open land would be made available for future development.\nSaddleworth North Liberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness said: “Once again, the Saddleworth Conservatives have shown their support for both planning democracy and the Green Belt is fickle. In the debate, Liberal Democrat Councillors spoke and voted against the proposals.\n“Planning for the Future will clearly lead to less planning democracy, less security for our precious green spaces, less social and affordable housing, and poorer housing standards. It is not planning ‘red tape’ that is preventing the building out of development sites with the new homes that we need. There is already planning permission for developments amounting to one million houses.

Marcus Rashford has proven that footballers can also care about others, and whilst there may have been a hiatus of play on the pitch during the Covid-19 pandemic, he has been playing away in a different arena, quietly but forcefully, to ensure that every child who is hungry gets fed. It is largely down to him that the Conservative Government was embarrassed into a U-turn to provide school meals for pupils, and his MBE is richly-deserved for those efforts.”\nMr Rashford has recently called on the Government to immediately fund three recommendations from the National Food Strategy during and after the pandemic.\nCrompton Councillor Louie Hamblett is backing his Liberal Democrat colleague: “Whatever football team you support, it still feels the same when you are hungry.

There are three local sorting offices in Saddleworth and Royal Mail wanted to close them all and sorting would be done in Oldham.

Unfortunately six months on, nothing seems to have changed.\nCouncillor Harkness said: “Speeding is one of those issues that every ward councillor receives complaints about on a regular basis, yet action on this issue by this Labour Administration seems so slow. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats seek action on road safety issues.”\n“We have previously proposed 30mph zones on residential streets but, after a long look by the Overview and Scrutiny Board, nothing happened, and more recently we proposed Lorry Watch schemes to tackle irresponsible truck drivers using the wrong Sat Navs and blocking our villages.”\n“I now hope that Council will adopt this motion and look to introduce more community led anti-speeding schemes backed by roadside cameras to catch offenders.”\nThe motion appears below:\nThe motion reads:\nCouncil notes that speeding continues to be a factor in road collisions and that a pedestrian is four times more likely to die if they are hit by a vehicle travelling at forty miles per hours than they are at 30mph.\nIt is therefore imperative that Council working with the Police and residents seek to reduce excessive vehicular speeds in this borough, especially outside schools, on minor residential roads and in rural areas.\nCouncil believes that we should work with our residents’ groups to deter and catch offenders and that we should employ mobile technology in order to do so.\nCouncil therefore resolves to ask the Overview and Scrutiny Board to:\n· Identify, with the assistance of District Executives, local police and the Council’s highways officers, locations not currently equipped with a speed camera which might benefit from one for consideration by the Drive Safe Greater Manchester Casualty Reduction Partnership.\n· Explore the availability of funding to purchase and deploy mobile speed cameras to catch offenders, change driver behaviour and improve road safety.\n· Investigate how the Council and the police can work with community and residents’ groups to establish Community Speed Watch schemes and Community Concern speed enforcement sites in the Borough\n· Explore the merits of establishing ‘bus gates’ at suitable sites outside schools and look at establishing a pilot project. (‘Bus gates’ limit vehicular through traffic outside schools to cycles and local buses at the start and end of the school day, with a fixed penalty for transgressors.)\nProposed by: Seconded by:\nCouncillor Garth Harkness Councillor Hazel Gloster\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

That is why following previous flooding I have met with council officer, United Utilities and the Environment Agency about the flood risks at key points in Saddleworth I even organised a public meeting with representatives from the council and the Environment Agency to discuss the River Tame Flood Appraisal not to mention which I understand would be finalised this year. Risks can be reduced by regular gully cleaning and that is why Liberal Democrats have been clear that further investment is required on gully cleaning.\nOf course the amount of rainfall wouldn’t have changed if the Lib Dem budget proposals had been introduced and if Independent Labour and Conservative councillors had voted for it then what would have happened is that there would be three times as many gully cleaning appliances than at present. Having a regular gully cleaning programme with more resources would help reduce the impact. Increasing the capacity can be seen as a spend to save as jetting means clogged gullies do not have to be dug out at huge expense. It also ensures that there is less risk of homes flooding, less water and ice on the roads, which endangers drivers and pedestrians, and, in the long term, a reduction in damage to the roads caused by frozen water breaking the road surfaces.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Saddleworth Moor has been devastated by fires in the past and these incidents are always tragic. When they are especially tragic is when they are wantonly caused by idiots intent on arson or being irresponsible by using disposable barbeques. Although I have supported calls to impose a higher penalty upon those using them, the best defence for the moor is eternal vigilance. That is why is crazy to scrap the volunteer ranger scheme.”\n“The volunteers are individuals who have a love for our natural environment and who want to preserve it,” added Councillor Harkness. “They are extra eyes and ears watching out for the moor and the people who visit it. Some have volunteered for decades. They receive no reward for their dedication and commitment and are now sadly being kicked in the teeth.

In 2020, the Manchester Recovery Task Force was formed with representatives from the Department of Transport, Network Rail, Northern, TransPennine Express, Transport for the North and Transport for Greater Manchester, to come up with proposals to restore the rail service.\nThe findings of the task force and a series of possible options were published by the Department for Transport on 14 January and are now open to public consultation.\nCouncillor Sykes, and his Liberal Democrat colleague, Councillor John Leech, from Manchester are clear where they stand.\n“Option 3 stands out as the one we want”, said Councillor Sykes, “it will help restore some of the trains to Greenfield as well as providing a more reliable service in the so called ‘congested corridor’ in Manchester. It will better enable commuters to get to and from their places of work and students to get to their colleges and universities in towns and cities served by a new half-hour daytime service from Greenfield. We also want to see the investment that is much needed and overdue to make this station completely accessible so all passengers can enjoy an improved service.”\nAlthough both Councillors will be making representations supporting option 3, Councillor Sykes is clear that members of the public should have their say too: “I would urge all passengers who use this station to use this opportunity to speak out in favour of more frequent and more reliable services and a fully-accessible station at Greenfield.”\nThe consultation can be found at:\nResponses can be made by email to performancerecoverytaskforce@dft.gov.uk or in writing to MRTF Consultation, 3rd floor, Department for Transport, Great Minster House, 3 Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 4DR\nThe Closing Date for responses is 10, March.\nThe Greenfield Rail Action Group can be found on Facebook at\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I am proud that I was part of the group to make this happen. I know not everyone is happy with the option but the alternative was that nothing would happen. Aside from the other arguments for choosing this option it is important to note that the major investors would only invest in this particular option so not choosing it would result in at least a £210 000 shortfall. Other investors may then be reluctant and the consequence would be that the fields would become totally unusable soon. So it was this or nothing.

Eon is the contractor and whilst there is supposed to be consultation about the design and siting of street lamps in conservation areas, elsewhere they are marching ahead plonking new ones just where they want them.\nIts quite crazy. As each street is dealt with, local councillors are getting complaints. Lamps put in front of windows or gardens when the old ones were on the boundaries between houses, lamps put in cockeyed, local power and telephone cables cut, abuse to locals who remonstrate.\n‘We are arguing fiercely with Eon who say they do not need to consult with elected councillors – we shall see’, says Cllr Derek Heffernan.\nWhen householders point out that there are lots of cables and ducts where they are starting to dig, they are ignored – until proved right!\n‘We have discovered that a large number of metal lampposts installed in Saddleworth villages less than two years ago are being replaced and scrapped. They had a 25 year life expectancy and Eon tell us they will not be selling them on!’ says Cllr Alan Roughley. ‘This is a scandalous waste of taxpayers money. The new ones, which look very similar, are expected to last 50 years. How daft can you get? Who can say what lighting technology there will be in 10 years from now, let alone 50, or if there will be street lighting at all in rural areas?’\n‘We have told Eon that they must improve and consult with locals, who are rightly concerned about these changes. We intend calling public meetings in various villages to agree the design and siting of street lamps in conservation areas. In the meantime please call us with any problems you are having,’ comments Cllr Garth Harkness.\nAll householders are supposed to receive a letter from Eon before work begins in their area. It doesn’t say much and you need to look out for yellow circles spray painted onto the footpath to find out where they are due to be sited. ‘Far better to argue first than have to try and get newly installed ones moved afterwards,’ says Cllr Roughley.\n2 Comments\nOn Wall Hill Road Dobcross EOn just turned up one day last week and did exactly what you said put a new lamp in front of someone’s window. I do not want this to happen to our house but we were not in when they came and there are no yellow marks as to where the next ones are going. We live in Semi detached houses so it makes sense to put them in front of the gap of the houses(as they are currently) so as not to spoil the view or have a light directly in front of your bedroom window. How can we find out what they intend to do I can’t be all the time.\nCan you let me know outside which house. It is not on I think they need another telling off. I’ve never come across something so badly managed as this project. If you prefer you can email me garth.harkness@gmail.com mailto:garth.harkness@gmail.com",

Saddleworth North representative and Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Housing councillor Garth Harkness said, “Private renting is becoming increasingly unaffordable and insecure in Oldham Borough.”\n“The private rented sector is like the Wild West. There aren’t enough regulations in place to crack down on cowboy landlords, poor quality living conditions and unfair evictions. This also does not reward responsible landlords either.”\nCouncillor Harkness will move a motion in the council chamber next week (1/11/23) that calls on Oldham Council to get tougher on rogue landlords by issuing and enforcing improvement notices where conditions are unacceptable. This includes issues with excess cold as well as damp and mould.\nAccording to the homelessness charity Crisis, the end of a private rented tenancy is now the leading cause of homelessness in England.\nEarlier this month, several of Greater Manchester’s leading housing and homelessness charities came together to announce a new campaign declaring a “private renters’ emergency”. Their campaign was supported by Oldham Liberal Democrat Leader councillor Howard Sykes MBE who will second the Liberal Democrat motion next week.\nCouncillor Sykes said, “Wages are not keeping up with the rising cost of renting and this is already having devastating consequences for families in Oldham. Urgent changes in the law are needed to give private renters more protections from runaway rents and poor-quality housing. We also need to build more homes to rent!”\n“But it’s not just about pointing the finger at the government. Here in Oldham, we need the council to act proactively, to support residents when they are living in substandard homes, and to crack down on landlords when they aren’t meeting basic requirements.

The previous professional opinions were that it was not possible to use the old Uppermill site for the new school.\nThe Education Funding Agency are looking at all options on the Diggle and Uppermill sites. If, as before, the Uppermill options continue to be discounted then the best alternative seems to be the Shaw Pallets works at the back of the site already occupied by the old derelict factory. This option is one that we have consistently tried to achieve in the absence of the possibility of acceptance of other sites.\nA major factor of course, will be that there will be no buildings on the greenbelt.

The proposals for the Parish Council to take a lead in improving winter gritting is a good cross-party initiative. There have already been some positive meetings with Oldham Council and hopefully the Borough will provide some extra resources to enable the Parish Council to improve snow clearance and gritting across the District.\nOn the other hand, something that has annoyed me is an example where Ken Hulme has decided that he will boycott all official channels in a self-publicity exercise. It is disappointing that the Borough Council and MP are endorsing a Ken Hulme appointed transport group that has shunned a dialogue with borough councillors,parish councillors and the Saddleworth & Lees District Partnership. This is duplicating work for officers and is a waste of time. When I asked our MP to clarify I received a reply from the “Independent” Ken Hulme and not her. This is not what I expect from our MP\nAs Vice Chairman of the Parish Council, Ken Hulme, could have voiced his traffic concerns at the joint sub-committee of the District Partnership set up to address traffic issue in Saddleworth. This has officers and residents in attendance as well as locally elected members of the Borough and Parish Councils. He has never attended these meeting nor addressed any concerns there about traffic he may have.\nMost of us are trying to work together on the Parish for the good of the District, as the recent winter gritting and boundary initiatives demonstrate. If he truly wants to improve traffic issues in Saddleworth and effect change, rather than pursue a self promoting ego trip, he should address his concerns through the channels specificallyset up to address these issues. Sadly, it seems that only meetings with press coverage are important to him. This is another example of Ken creating smoke, but not actually changing anything. He has been wasting the time of Delph residents for two years calling local meetings and achieving nothing. He would achieve a lot more if he started working with his colleagues as a member of a team and doing things the democratic way rather than the way that achieves maximum publicity for himself.\nHe wants more bollards, yellow lines and a 24/7 20 mph speed limit complete with road humps and more signage. When this was first suggested we asked the people of Saddleworth what they wanted. A questionnaire was sent out by the Parish Council to all the 20,000+ houses in Saddleworth asking their views on a number of topical issues. There was an overwhelming response – 71% favoured a 20 mph speed limit during school hours only and 82% favoured the use of flashing warning lights to enforce this. This is what was delivered and what the people of Delph overwhelmingly endorsed when the proposed scheme was displayed for consultation. But Ken doesn’t take no for an answer he still wants speed humps and a 20mph speed limit even when the school is closed. What’s more Ken now wants a 20mph speed limit in the centre of Delph, a street where it is rarely possibly to drive through without giving way to oncoming traffic.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Last year we were extremely critical of the management of the scheme and have expressed these concerns with the media, EON and the council on a number of occasions. The implementation of the contract was referred to Overview and Scrutiny however, we do not feel that they held them to account adequately or had the firm discussions with EON that were required. The council should have done more to hold them to account. Many officers at the council acknowledge that their conduct had been inadequate.\nEON have a new project manager and team to deal with the difficulties of the implementation of the project. Previously many people had expressed concerns over the complacency, apathy and sometimes rudeness when addressing people’s concerns. Many people have felt that they were being ignored and I echoed this sentiment.\nWe met with them last week and EON acknowledged that such behaviour was unacceptable and they were clear that the communication with residents has to be better. The intention of the project manager seemed clear, and he did come across genuine.\nThere has been some improvements but we are still getting reports of people saying they were not consulted or given no reason for the changes. EON do seem to be responding to more residents concerns, based on when residents have contacted us but there is some way to go. Some residents are being told they will be responded to and are not. It is not as bad as last year.\nBuckton Close and Devon Drive in Diggle are a couple of examples where lighting columns were moved from positions at one side to the opposite side of the street which now effect the residents. Another where work had begun in conservation areas consultation- this has stopped now.\nWe will be meeting with the conservation officer to discuss the street lighting options and then we have agreement to hold consultation meetings in the villages with conservation areas in Saddleworth North ward (Diggle, Dobcross, Delph, Denshaw)\nSome progress but the idea that EON can do what they please ignore everyone seems to be wavering but there is more still to be done.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Our budget amendment found some finances to make a new health centre in Saddleworth a possibility. Whilst the administration rejected the proposal, they did say they would look at this.\nA new site was problematic, and I have always advocated the existing Saddleworth School site as a suitable location. and this should never have been considered for any land swap. Now that there has been a fortunate failure to reach agreement on a land swap this provides a real opportunity to build a new health centre for Saddleworth.\nWill the Cabinet Member commit to making this a reality?\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

We have cancelled plans for a law which would have kept records of all the websites you visit and all the people you communicate with on social media sites – the so-called snooper’s charter. The proposals were an infringement of our privacy that wouldn’t have worked to make us safer, so we said no.\n2. This week’s GDP figures showed the economy is starting, slowly, to get stronger, as we steadily bring borrowing under control and build confidence in Britain again. Liberal Democrats in government have focused on creating jobs and opportunities, especially for young people, and our commitment to a stronger economy is pointing us in the right direction.\n3. Crime is falling – again. It’s one of the untold stories of this government, but crime is lower than at any time since 1981. Of course, many factors affect crime rates but I firmly believe our drive on rehabilitation and treatment in prison and in the community is paying dividends.\n4. Payday comes this week for millions – the first pay cheque to benefit from our £600 tax cut. Everyone who was affected by Gordon Brown’s 10p tax fiasco now pays no tax at all on their wages.\n5.

Cllr Akhtar stated that the funding would not be pulled and the council and Education Funding Agency are committed to the project\nBreakfast clubs\nI asked a cabinet question relating to breakfast clubs. The Oldham Liberal Democrats have been surveying schools to identify the extent of the provision and want to do all we can to ensure that every child has access. The cabinet member has agreed for the council to commission a survey.\nFree School Meals\nCouncil agreed my motion unanimously and enthusiastically to lobby government to help provide universal free school meals for all primary aged children providing an extra 10,000 children in Oldham and Saddleworth with free school meals.\nWhen in government the Lib Dems introduced free school meals for every five, six and seven year old. This was championed by the then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg\nThis was an excellent reform which has helped to start early in helping bring down barriers and all children achieve in school. In Oldham for the first time 9,800 children in reception, year 1 and year 2 sat down and received a free school meal at the start of the last academic year\nWe want to see this increased to the age 8 to 11 bracket so that all primary school children can benefit. In Oldham there are currently 13,100 pupils in this age bracket, only 3,000 are eligible for a free meal.It would save £400 per child for parents on lunches on average but also. A hot healthy meal greatly increases concentration, behaviour and results of students.\nThe Liberal Democrat pupil premium provides extra support for schools to ensure that all can achieve their potential. Providing free school meals for all primary age children means that means that Children from all backgrounds, rich and poor sitting down for lunch together, ending any stigma of young pupils having to admit they receive free school meals is a good thing\nWe believe every child, regardless of their background, should have the same opportunities. No child should be hindered because they are not eating a nutritious meal at lunchtime\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The money from the sale of the old site will be used to cover this when it is sold.\nCouncillor Sam Al-Hamdani said: “With the economy as it is, this comes with a certain amount of risk. The Council are confident that the site will cover the costs; we will be holding them to account on it. Having already seen the decision to axe the land-swap taken in secrecy, we must have complete transparency on any future decisions.

Invest £6.5 million in building a green infrastructure taking Oldham forward in its ambition to be Britain’s first carbon-neutral Council and Borough. Create a dedicated fund worth £2.5 million to repair our pavements.\nFor the next financial year, the Liberal Democrats have also found £294,000 more to tackle the antisocial behaviour, such as fly-tipping, litter and dog-fouling, which ruins so many communities and blights the lives of so many Oldham residents. They will spend £200,000 to introduce 20-mph zones in residential streets to cut road deaths and injuries, especially amongst children and the elderly. This is also part of their build back better agenda and making sure we recognise and keep the increased amount of walking that has happened due to the lockdowns.\nIn the next two years, the Liberal Democrats have identified over £1.2 million in savings from cutting Civic Centre bureaucracy and waste, such as reducing or abolishing car mileage allowances for Council staff that no longer need them (working from home for example), to spend on front-line services. They also wish to redirect a significant sum from the Council’s Capital Programme currently allocated to ‘so called projects’ in Oldham town centre to realise their ambitions.\nCommenting Councillor Gloster said: “As we hopefully emerge from the nightmare of Covid-19, the proposals we have outlined in our budget amendment will help make Oldham a healthier, greener and cleaner Borough, and I am looking forward to outlining them to the PVFM Committee.”\n“I anticipate some tough questions as – rightly – it is the job of PVFM to properly scrutinise any plans to save or spend the hard-earned cash of our residents, but I also expect that those of our proposals which are rejected by the committee this year may well be taken up by Labour next year, or in subsequent years, without fanfare and without giving credit to the Liberal Democrats, as has happened in the past.”\nCouncillor Howard Sykes MBE, Leader of the Opposition, spoke in support of the proposals: “I would first like to thank Chris and the finance team for their hard work in putting together this Budget Amendment. The Liberal Democrats have consistently, year-on-year, put forward common-sense proposals which cut waste at the Civic Centre to reinvest in the frontline services that matter to Council Tax-payers, and this has again been our approach this time around.”\n“Although Council finances remain very tight and we have very little latitude to make changes, the Liberal Democrats have once again come up with some innovative ideas that would – if implemented – significantly improve the lives of many of the residents of our Borough. It is noticeable that yet again the Conservative Group has failed to put forward any proposals of its own. They talk tough but consistently fail to back it up with actions. This demonstrates once more that only the Liberal Democrats have credibility as an opposition to Labour in Oldham Borough.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Oldham Council was awarded £1,022,449 by the Government in the current financial year.\n“From April 2015, local Councils were expected to find the money themselves, but the Liberal Democrat Group feels it is unrealistic to expect Oldham Council to shoulder the burden when we are already making such deep cuts in our budget.\n“There is a real need for the continuation of sufficient government funding to local authorities to meet the emergency needs of individuals facing severe financial hardship”.\nIn July 2014, the Liberal Democrat Group brought a motion to Oldham Council opposing the abolition of government funding for Local Welfare Provision and seeking its reinstatement.\nResponding to the consultation, Cllr Alcock stated:\n“The Liberal Democrat Group’s position remains unchanged from July 2014. We are opposed to the abolition of funding of this provision, and strongly believe that the Government should continue to provide specific funding to every local authority for Local Welfare Provision on the same basis and formula as applied in the 2014/15 financial year, but with ongoing funding adjusted to account for inflation”.\nInterestingly, Labour as usual made a big fuss in the press but appear to have failed to have formally responded. The consultation closed on 21st November.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is my belief that all our children or young people has just as much right to expect an excellent education as any other pupil.\nThe inspection team found that the revelation that Oldham is one of the worst-achieving areas nationally for educational achievement with these children and young people waiting too long for their needs to be identified. The poor achievement is exacerbated by high levels of fixed-term exclusions, persistent absences and failures of the school transport.\nMr. Mayor, this is simply unacceptable. We are leaving these children behind, abandoning them educationally. By not properly accessing the needs of these children, and the support that they need, at an early enough stage – sometimes not until they move from primary to secondary school – we are making it more likely that they will underperform at school. By excluding them and tolerating poor attendance, we are exacerbating this problem, and by having a school transport system that is not up to the challenge we make it harder to encourage parents to send their children to school in the first place.\nThe report called for a Written Statement of Action to be produced because of ‘significant areas of weakness in the local area’s practice’. Can the Cabinet Member please tell me tonight what action this Administration is proposing to address the failings highlighted in this report and when?\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is expected to be presented to theTransport for Greater Manchester Committee on 13th April.\nCouncillor Harkness says\n“Network Rail’s proposed Northern Hub rail investment plan 2014-19 to increase capacity on the railway lines from Leeds, Sheffield and Liverpool into Manchester is the best opportunity for a generation to make the case for reopening Diggle Station, which closed in the 1960s as part of the Beeching cuts. When the Northern Hub Plan was first published it included the reopening of the two disused Standedge railway tunnels. It is vital they remain in the revised version of the plan to be published this summer and that the case for reopening Diggle Station is included.”\n“As a Dobcross resident I know how much residents in Diggle, Dobcross and beyond and visitors to the area would welcome the reopening of Diggle Station.

What a silly generalisation that as Lib Dems we will not agree with. He wants to cap child benefit at 2 children and stopping housing benefit for the under 25s. This has NOT been agreed by this government and is not part of the coalition government so it should be made very clear by him that this is the case and this will happen if the TORIES WIN the next election.\nWe should be starting at the top and working down not picking on the vulnerable.\nI recently put a motion to council on Under 25 housing benefit. The reply to the council from Lord Freud on Housing Benefits for Under 25s ignores the request for reassurances that proposals to cut housing benefit for the under 25s will not be implemented. The fact that it is completely ignored may be because it HAS NOT been agreed.\nLiberal Democrats want to start at the top and work down when it comes to making savings as a country and that the Lib Dem Steve Webb MP has said\n“Nothing has been agreed within government on the detail of any further changes; these are the kind of things that we will thrash out within government in the months ahead.” The Liberal Democrats have not signed up to £10bn of cuts in the welfare budget that the Tories want to slash in 2016\nIt is particularly difficult for young people to get a job and creating anxiety by suggesting there will not be support for shelter is morally wrong. Cuts need to be made but the vulnerable need to be protected and that is what my colleagues and I will fight to do.\nLeave a Reply",

Last year we were extremely critical of the management of the scheme and have expressed these concerns with the media, EON and the council on a number of occasions. The implementation of the contract was referred to Overview and Scrutiny however, we do not feel that they held them to account adequately or had the firm discussions with EON that were required. The council should have done more to hold them to account. Many officers at the council acknowledge that their conduct had been inadequate.\nEON have a new project manager and team to deal with the difficulties of the implementation of the project. Previously many people had expressed concerns over the complacency, apathy and sometimes rudeness when addressing people’s concerns. Many people have felt that they were being ignored and I echoed this sentiment.\nWe met with them last week and EON acknowledged that such behaviour was unacceptable and they were clear that the communication with residents has to be better. The intention of the project manager seemed clear, and he did come across genuine.\nThere has been some improvements but we are still getting reports of people saying they were not consulted or given no reason for the changes. EON do seem to be responding to more residents concerns, based on when residents have contacted us but there is some way to go. Some residents are being told they will be responded to and are not. It is not as bad as last year.\nBuckton Close and Devon Drive in Diggle are a couple of examples where lighting columns were moved from positions at one side to the opposite side of the street which now effect the residents. Another where work had begun in conservation areas consultation- this has stopped now.\nWe will be meeting with the conservation officer to discuss the street lighting options and then we have agreement to hold consultation meetings in the villages with conservation areas in Saddleworth North ward (Diggle, Dobcross, Delph, Denshaw)\nSome progress but the idea that EON can do what they please ignore everyone seems to be wavering but there is more still to be done.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The council still preferred the longer restriction, arguing that it would allow overnight parking.\n“Most people don’t leave their house at 6am and pupils don’t arrive at school then, so I challenged it and am pleased that the Traffic Regulation Order Panel decided to make this accommodation. It is disappointing that my Labour and Conservative colleagues in Saddleworth North let this go by default.”\nCllr Harkness added, “The traffic management of Huddersfield Road in Diggle has understandably brought about much anxiety amongst residents. As many views are polar opposites it is impossible to accommodate everything and I understand that some people will not be happy with the outcome.\n“The process has been going on for about 8 years. I remember a number of village consultation events quite some time ago and the proposals have been amended many times.\n“The turning circle, extra car park and parking spaces at the back of some of the houses on Huddersfield Road are all concessions we have pushed for, so I do feel efforts have been made to accommodate concerns as much as possible .\n“We need a new school and my Liberal Democrat colleagues and I decided long ago that it was better to work for the safest and least disruptive solution for pupils and residents, not stand on the sidelines and carp, as some local representatives have done.”\nThe Traffic Regulation Order Panel is a cross-party group of councillors who scrutinise proposals for schemes such as this, to ensure that they are in the best interests of the borough’s residents. The Panal agreed to Councillor Garth Harkness proposals to reduce these restrictions to 7.30am to 5pm\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In particular in Saddleworth the District funded the Band contest and Christmas trees, Grit bins etc.\nThe council leader has dismissed claims that the band contest would be put at risk. We disagree with him The District Executive paid £15000 to the band contest and individual councillors also contributed extra too. I have asked now twice about funding this gap both times he has not committed. I have read his statement on twitter. He has not committed to funding the 15 thousand. Many of the band contests are already struggling before this cut so it is not scaremongering. They can find money for the lofty fact finding trips abroad or the borough life magazine which never mentions Saddleworth but not the band contest. I am sure local councillors will plug the 15000 gap but that means they will likely get less than they used to from individual councillors budgets thereafter and they are at risk. We will have to work with band contest organisers to look at innovative ways forward. Other local projects councillors provide money to which often provide a catalyst will be reduced as we battle to save the band contest.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The leading animal welfare charity launches this campaign every year on Valentine’s Day (14 February) to encourage dog owners who love their pets to clean up after them.\nSince being elected in 2015, Liberal Democrat Councillor Chris Gloster has, like his Liberal Democrat colleagues in Shaw and Crompton, found dog fouling to be the bane of his life in elected office.\nCommenting Councillor Gloster said: “Ward Councillors receive regular complaints about dog fouling. It is both an eye-sore and a health hazard, and it has a real impact on the quality of life of many of my constituents. Most dog owners are very responsible, and clean up after their pets, but unfortunately a few do not.”\nWith his Liberal Democrat ward colleagues, Councillor Gloster has been active in working to place more signs about dog fouling around Shaw to help enforcement. He is therefore delighted to be to endorse this campaign:\n“The aims of this campaign are quite simple, to encourage the many responsible dog owners to continue what they are doing and to make the irresponsible minority think again about their behaviour. Not only is it anti-social but it is also criminal attracting a fine of up to £1,000.”\n“All dog owners should take out bags to collect poop and they should dispose of it safely in a public litter bin or take it home. Otherwise the consequences could include a child being blinded by Toxocariasis after coming into contact with uncollected dog poo.”\nCouncillor Gloster was speaking at Dunwood Park, where local ward councillors and the Council’s District team have been working with parks department staff, the Friends of Dunwood Park and the local community to raise public awareness of the importance of owners cleaning up after their dog. This has included children at local schools designing innovative posters to bring the message home.\nAt the forthcoming Council meeting in March to discuss the 2019/20 budget, the Liberal Democrats are proposing an amendment which includes a commitment to create a new Environment Task Force charged with tackling, amongst other things dog waste.\nCouncillor Gloster added: “I really hope that Councillors from all parties will back this proposal. Such an Environment Task Force will have an extra £500,000 with which to tackle fly-tipping and dog fouling through enforcement, new innovative public education campaigns to change the behaviour of irresponsible individuals and the use of new technology, such as Poovers, which literally hoover up dog mess, and a real-time online tracking application to enable the public to report instances of fly tipping, dog fouling and offenders. Similar applications exist elsewhere, for example the Poo Watch scheme operated in Worcester which my colleague, Councillor Howard Sykes, suggested Oldham Council look at many months ago.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

These will be rectified in the coming weeks with a process called ‘Earth Quaking’. This operation fragments the ground immediately below the surface allowing water to quickly disappear into the newly installed drains and should alleviate any major problems.\nThere is also further work to be done on the Oliset sprint track where again there is some surface water holding. The work to be done will again ensure that the surface comes into contact with the drains which will hopefully alleviate this problem.\nThe pitches are still in the establishment phase and it will be some time before we have the ideal.\nAn additional issue during periods of heavy and prolonged rainfall as we have recently experienced is that the water table is high on what is a flood plain. The outlet for the drainage system is into the river has a non return valve, when the river is high the non-return valve closes and any water is trapped between the surface and the river, thus causing ponding as the water has nowhere to go. As soon as the water table reduces the non-return valve opens and water escapes more quickly.\nThis is as a result of the geography of the site and not the design of the drainage system.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It also ensures that there is less risk of homes flooding, less water and ice on the roads, which endangers drivers and pedestrians, and, in the long term, a reduction in damage to the roads caused by frozen water breaking the road surfaces.”\nIn its other spend to save measure, the Liberal Democrat Group wants to make available a further £272,000 in 2016/17 for investment in youth services by the District Partnerships/Executives.\nCommenting, Cllr Sykes said: “The Liberal Democrats firmly believe that local ward councillors and local peopl know best where money can be best spent on services in their locality. Local knowledge and requirements should determine the allocation of this money in each of the districts.\nThe Youth Service is an excellent service and investment in it saves money in the long run as young people are productively engaged rather than – in some instances – engaging in crime and anti-social behaviour.\nOur proposal will I hope be accepted by the administration in the same way they accepted our suggestion that this years cuts to District staffing be decreased.”\nDeputy Leader Cllr McCann, who will be seconding the amendment, stated that the extra money for the proposed investment will be found “reducing management, council publications, subscriptions and conferences and increasing income from optional council services”.\nThe Liberal Democrat Group is also proposing that in 2016/17 (ie during the next financial year) a review of the number of councillors takes place, with a reduction in numbers being considered.\nCllr McCann added: “A reduction in Councillors to two per ward instead of three would generate a minimum saving of £212,000 per year. We believe that such a reduction is possible now we have a Council run by a Cabinet rather than committees. We know this proposal will be popular because this was one of the suggestions that came forward from the public in the consultation over the budget”.\nCllr McCann was also pleased to see that the Labour Administration has adopted one of his suggestions in last year’s Budget debate that budgets on the Council’s capital programme could be reduced because of delays and efficiencies that he had identified.\nHe stated: “Last year, some Labour Councillors were adamant that I wanted to put the redevelopment of Oldham and Royton town centres ‘on hold’. In fact my common sense suggestion was that the figures in Labour’s budget simply did not stack up. Put simply they were allocating more money than they could spend in the financial year given delays in the capital programme.\nIt is interesting that this year Labour have quietly slipped in this very same proposal to the tune of some £5 million, hardly small beer. I am delighted that by building on our suggestion some of the harsh cuts to services have been mitigated and actual efficiencies found “.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This Prime Ministers version of compassion seems to be limiting child benefits so poor children go hungry, cutting schools budgets so schools have to sack staff, not investing in the NHS so that the service is crumbling, and disregarding mental health.\nThe Prime Minister says she wants to make mental health a priority yet her minister tells disability benefits assessors to discriminate against people with mental health conditions.. Liberal Democrats in the Lords proposed a motion to kill the Government’s attempts to severely restrict disability benefits. Unfortunately this has been lost after Labour peers failed to support it. Thankfully we passed a motion I proposed in Oldham Council to ensure new safeguards for vulnerable benefit claimants living in our borough to reduce the number of these claimants who receive a benefit sanction.\nThis policy of hitting those who find it hardest to fight back, whilst giving a tax break for the richest, shows that the Prime Minister is out of touch with the real needs of most British people today and firmly in the camp of the privileged.

The figures for sleeping rough have increased by fifty percent in the last two years alone.\nCouncillor Williamson said: “It is a national disgrace that in a modern industrial economy, and Britain is one of the world’s leading economies, rough sleeping and homelessness can exist in the twenty first century.”\nOfficial figures also show that Greater Manchester is a city region with the fourth highest levels of homelessness.\n“At full Council, I will be hoping for cross-party support to commit Oldham to do its bit to make rough sleeping and homelessness a thing of the past. We would like a report on the current situation in our borough and what is being doing, and can be done, to improve it.”\nCouncillor Williamson added: “The Oldham Liberal Democrats also endorse the campaign launched recently by the new Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham to tackle this issue head on as an urgent priority for all ten local authorities and partner organisations in our city region.”\nUnfortunately a recent report for the homelessness charity Crisis has identified that rough sleeping and homelessness may rise by three quarters over the next decade.\nIn response, Councillor Williamson said: “This is why it is important that we also tackle this issue at a national level. Changes to housing benefit entitlement and delays in payments, wages not rising sufficiently to meet spiralling private sector rents, and the lack of affordable housing for rent has exacerbated this situation, and much of the blame must be placed at the feet of Conservative ministers who are so unconcerned because they are so out-of-touch with the day-to-day reality of those affected. We support the End Rough Sleeping Campaign, and call on our fellow Councillors and local Members of Parliament to also endorse this.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In 2012, the Foundation awarded £1.6 million in grants to 75 small and medium charities in Lancashire, Cumbria and Manchester and currently still has funding available for charities in Oldham.\nLast year a grant of £19,700, over two years, was awarded to the Coppice Neighbourhood Group to help fund the salary of a Welfare and Debt Advice worker. By funding this core cost, the charity was able to ensure minority communities had access to advice and information to tackle poverty and deprivation.\nIf you would like to discuss charity funding in your area please contact Yvonne Taylor on 07734 973 464 or ytaylor@lloydstsbfoundations.org.uk\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is good too that Labour decided recently to follow a past Liberal Democrat proposal to invest more in additional street-cleaners, but again we have done one better in finding money for a new responsive Environmental Task Force.”\nHe added:\n“I am especially pleased that in our budget proposals we have also found money to build a new replacement health centre for the people of Shaw and Crompton; this is long-overdue. Liberal Democrat Ward Councillors have been calling for a new health centre for many years. The present building is falling apart at the seams, and increasingly unfit-for-purpose. It is inadequate to meet the current health-care needs of our constituents, let alone those of the thousands of new residents that we will see if the Labour Council approves the thousands of new homes that the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework threatens Shaw and Crompton with. Royton and Werneth have bespoke all-singing, all-dancing health centres, and it is about time Shaw and Crompton did too.”\nThe Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader fully acknowledges that Conservative government funding cuts have made balancing the Council’s budget an increasingly difficult proposition so the party’s spending plans have been financed by extra saving cuts and revenue-raising in ways that do not increase the Council Tax.\nIn response, Councillor Gloster said:\n“I do not envy the lead Cabinet Member for or our officers in the Treasury team their task. Government funding shortfalls mean that once more £22.7 million in savings must be found from the Council’s budget in the next financial year. Current estimates are that in subsequent years the budget will need to be trimmed by £22.883m for 2020/21, £10.889m for 2021/22, £6.859m for 2022/23 and £4.160m for 2023/24. So the Liberal Democrats will, with great regret, support Labour’s proposal to increase Council Tax bills by 3.99% to help balance the books, but, because we know many of our residents are hurting financially, we will not add to their burden with our plans.”\nOnce again the Liberal Democrat Group has found the money to pay for their extra investments through taking a scythe to back-office administration and bureaucracy.\nThis year’s ‘War on Waste’ has yielded over £1 million in additional savings without having a negative impact on front-line services.\nCouncillor Gloster explained some of the additional reductions the Liberal Democrats are proposing:\n“Many of our proposals have been consistent in recent years, but this year we have discovered one or two new sources of waste. Our cuts focus on several core areas – better workforce management practices, a reduction in the number of councillors and reduction in expenditure on communications.”\n“We believe that Labour is not being ambitious enough in its proposals to manage the recruitment and retention of staff, especially agency staff and consultants. We want to place increasingly ambitious targets year-on-year upon managers to manage their workforces more efficiently. This year we estimate this could yield an additional £550,000 in savings. We also want again to look at how sickness is managed in this authority”.\n“Lastly we want this Administration to live up to the promise it made to review car allowances and cut lump sum payments to staff using their vehicles very infrequently on Council business. If, as we propose, the automatic entitlement to a £500 payment is withdrawn from the 100 or so staff who use their vehicles to make journeys amounting to 100 miles per year or less – an average of less than two miles per week – we can realise a saving of at least £50,000 per annum when fully-implemented. We also want the Administration to look again at expenditure on air travel for staff, which seems grossly excessive when compared to that of our neighbours.”\nThe Liberal Democrats are mindful that it is only fair that Councillors too share the pain with staff. Councillor Gloster explained how:\n“Once more, we are calling for a reduction in the number of Councillors by 20 (a third) and for a reduction in the number of local elections to two every four years. This is consistent with our proposals in recent years. If approved by the Boundary Commission, these changes would release a £290,000 saving in 2020-21 to spend on front-line services.”\nCouncillor Howard Sykes, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council along with his Liberal Democrat colleagues also want to revisit expenditure on marketing and communications. He explained:\n“We would cull all non-statutory spending. There is a requirement to publish certain statutory notices to inform the public and invite comments, but there is no legal requirement to publish ‘propaganda on the rates’ like Borough Life. We want to scrap it and in our view every penny spent on this and another staff conference is another one denied to vulnerable people receiving social care. We want to see a saving of £150,000 on marketing this year and a further £100,000 in each of the next two financial years. Information and messages can now be delivered almost cost free via social media, and printing less is good for our environment.”\nCouncillor Sykes concluded:\n“Although the Liberal Democrat proposals are modest when compared to the financial challenge faced by Oldham Council, they do nonetheless achieve real savings that can be put back into front-line services that matter to people, and they are reflective of the Liberal Democrat approach to public finance – to apply common sense, an innovative approach and tough love to cut waste and squeeze the most out of every penny of our finances to deliver the best services that we can for our hard-pressed Council Tax payers.”\n“I would like to thank my colleague, the new Deputy Leader and Shadow Cabinet Member for Finance, Councillor Chris Gloster, and the Council officers who have supported him, for their hard-work and commitment in putting this budget amendment together. In the current challenging financial situation it is difficult to create a balanced budget, whether in the Administration or in Opposition, and anyone involved in this process deserves full credit for their efforts.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

You should tackle an issue early that is why Liberal Democrats ensured that there are free nursery places available for the most vulnerable and that every infant child will receive a free school meal.\nThe Liberal Democrat Pupil Premium ensures that schools receive extra funding for the most vulnerable students and also the catch up premium to help those who are behind at the start of secondary school. All met with little enthusiasm from Labour and Conservatives.\nYou can’t trust Conservatives to be fair. We know the Conservatives want to stop housing benefits for under 25s and consider stopping JSA for young people too. It is depressing when you hear the Labour MP Rachel Reeves saying that Labour would be tougher on welfare than the Tories and are also considering such a policy so you can’t trust Labour either.\nI understand that those at 18 who fail to get a c in English or maths or those with learning difficulties or disabilities. So there is some protection.\nI am not reassured however this will be enough and fear that those who need the extra support to achieve the qualifications they need will end up leaving without the skills to be successful in the work place.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

At present, Oldham Council has an elected member on the Board. How can the Peak District and our other National Parks be better preserved and protected by a new National Landscape Authority which there will be no local representation and that is accountable to no-one?”\n“I will campaign to stop this Conservative Government from transferring control over the Peak District National Park from local authorities to Whitehall civil servants,” added Councillor Harkness. “Liberal Democrat councillors in Oldham and Saddleworth will be totally opposed to the abolition of the Peak District National Park Authority and we will fight any plans to do so.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Conservative ministers claim it will eliminate ‘red tape’ but the Liberal Democrats fear that it abolish any meaningful involvement of local councils and residents in planning matters.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “I already have a lot of residents tell me of their frustrations that planning applications which should be classed as inappropriate development are now allowed under permitted development rights. Relaxing the regulations further will only have a negative impact on areas like Saddleworth”.\n“The National Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Wildlife Trusts have warned that wide-scale deregulation in planning which will lead to lower environmental standards.”\n“Meanwhile, Greater Manchester’s Labour Mayor is about to bring out a revised Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF).\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “As local people know only too well, Labour’s plan will cover vast tracts of green land in Saddleworth and elsewhere with houses and industry. Disregard for protected land has already been seen in Grotton, Crompton and Moorside recently. The government plan will make it much harder to resist. We need to pull out of the GMSF and adopt out own plans. I urge people to get involved when consultation starts”.\nIn order to fulfil housing targets previously developed land will need to be utilised further.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said;\n“An example of the difficulties with building on previous developed land is Bailey Mill in Delph. I have pushed for Bailey Mill to be demolished and re-developed for many years and I know that the owners and local residents very much share my frustrations.\n“It is clearly cheaper to build on green space. The government promised Greater Manchester a pot of money to help build on previously developed land, and then broke that promise. My colleagues and I campaigned for the funding to be restored, and now finally the Government has reinstated a Brownfield Fund, but it will be distributed across the country. It is nowhere near enough, but the Liberal Democrats will nonetheless be fighting to get a share of this pot, and if we are successful I will certainly make the case for some of it to be spent in making Bailey Mill ready for development.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

There are three local sorting offices in Saddleworth and Royal Mail wanted to close them all and sorting would be done in Oldham. Sub Postmasters would be compensated but the problem in Dobcross is that the closure of the sorting office here means that the whole business would no longer be viable and Dobcross Post Office, the only shop in the village will close.

Our proposal was therefore lost. The pitiful excuse given by the Labour councillors was they said TfGM could not do anything about this.\nI am pleased that TfGM did not have the same defeatist attitude that the Labour councillors in Oldham had in helping job seekers. The travel training and ticketing project is now underway. The project is now nearing the point of an initial trial of the free day tickets to jobseekers We need make it a priority to get people back into work for example Nick Clegg recently unveiled £50million for Greater Manchester in a bid to slash youth unemployment. Liberal Democrats have also ensured that more apprenticeships than ever before but there needs to be more among the 18-24 group.\nThe new money and concessionary fares should then begin to give a fairer chance to succeed. I hope that Transport for Greater Manchester maintain a commitment on helping young Job Seekers to interviews and even if some choose to talk down the efforts for a stronger economy and fairer society\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Britain may be in the fast lane in terms of job creation and unemployment is falling, but we need to ensure that people who may need a little more help are not left behind.\n“That is why we are building on our motion at the last council which sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for disabled people and carers who want to seek employment.\n“As part of its offer to Get Oldham Working, the Liberal Democrat Group wants to see Oldham Council offer specialist support and better access to technology to people with dyslexia in their quest for work and to support our employees so they can excel in their jobs”.\nFellow Saddleworth Lib Dem councillor, Derek Heffernan, who is seconding the motion, said\n“As a school governor I see first-hand the benefits that the Pupil Premium, introduced by the Liberal Democrats in Government, has provided in supporting the most vulnerable. At school and college young people can get extra support to ensure they can be just as successful as their peers, if not more so. The support seems to stop after the young people leave education”.\n“We need to work with the Dyslexia Foundation to establish specialist courses for those with dyslexia, the advisors who support them, and local employers.\n“The motion also asks the Council to investigate installing voice recognition software on computers in public libraries and the Link Centre, and to urge Job Centre Plus to do the same at the Oldham Job Centre as part of their digital rollout. Such software packages cost very little but can be invaluable to jobseekers with dyslexia”.\nCllr Harkness added\nLeave a comment“Dyslexia is a recognised disability and without reasonable adjustments it can be a huge barrier to gain employment or remain employed. With reasonable adjustments and appropriate support people can succeed with dyslexia.\n“Once more the Liberal Democrat Group is bringing a motion to Council that contains practical ideas to help more people in our borough get working.\n“Lastly we want to look to the future and ensure we mark Dyslexia Awareness Week (5th to 11th October 2015) with suitable events to raise awareness amongst the public and employers and to promote this provision”.\nLeave a Reply",

In our motion, we also expressed our belief that the National Living Wage “should be the minimum pay rate for all employees”.\nNationally the Liberal Democrats are campaigning on the streets and in Government to create one million more jobs to boost the record number of 30 million Britons in employment, and we are also fighting hard to make sure that these pay a decent wage.\nThis is why Lib Dem Business Secretary, Dr Vince Cable, will increase the National Minimum Wage in October to £6.50 per hour, a rate above inflation, and why Dr Cable plans similar inflation-busting increases in the years to come.\nAnd this is why the Liberal Democrats have secured in increase in the personal tax allowance so that the first £10,000 per annum is now earned tax free.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The lease (and obligation to maintain and repair the car park) passed to OMBC when local government was re-organised not long afterwards.\nThe car park has gradually deteriorated since then and, though discussions between the church and OMBC continued over many years, the lease lapsed and the church has had to accept that OMBC no longer want to fund this car park as a public service.\nThe three Liberal Democrat Saddleworth North councillors, Alan Roughley, Garth Harkness and Derek Heffernan, have pledged to help towards the car parking issues in Delph and are appealing to others to help too. The NHS has provided some money towards resurfacing but more needs to be done\nMargaret Taylor, Property Steward, Delph Methodist said:\n“Because of its poor condition of the car park, the church has, on the advice of its insurers and solicitors, had to close the car park off – on safety grounds and to prevent further deterioration. The church does not have the resources to repair the car park nor to fund the ongoing maintenance required for a car park used by the public.\nThe church, however, appreciates how valuable the car park is to the local community and wants it to continue to be available for the use of residents and visitors to the village. Other car parking is in very short supply.\nSome local individuals and groups have already offered to help or made donations and the church is delighted that our local councillors – Alan Roughley, Garth Harkness and Derek Heffernan – have committed their remaining budget for 2013-14 to the works, giving the funds a welcome boost of £4350. These councillors work very hard on behalf of the local community and the church is very grateful for their support.\nA public appeal will be launched shortly to raise the funds needed to re-open the car park as quickly as possible and the church would be pleased to hear from anyone else who is prepared to help or contribute. “\nCllr Alan Roughley said\n“We have been working with the Methodist Church for several months to help them with the negotiations and battles with Oldham council and discussions with the NHS. The NHS were positive but Oldham council are not willing to put up any money so again Saddleworth have to do it alone.

We have been lobbying the District Executive to earmark funds towards this important scheme too which were supportive.

We believe that removing this right will deny these individuals one of the longest established rights available to appellants in any court proceedings – their right to appear in person to present their case. This would appear to be totally contrary to natural justice.”\nThe Government instead wants claimants to submit their appeal online and in writing in future.\nCouncillor Harkness added:\n“If someone chooses to go before a tribunal it is to present extenuating circumstances that may not be apparent in documentation and to demonstrate their sincerity. If a claimant is not before them, the panel members cannot see how debilitating their medical condition is or question them about it.”\n“We are not convinced that a tribunal which relies solely upon written evidence in order to make its determination will be fully conversant of all of the relevant facts.\nIn past cases, where written evidence has been submitted, the quality has often been found to be poor without sufficient evidence of the appellant’s medical history.”\n“By insisting that claimants make their appeal on-line, the Government is also assuming that they have the technical skills and physical dexterity to access information technology, and a computer to hand.”\nFinally, Councillor Harkness has objected Government proposals to remove the requirement that tribunals include a panel member with direct experience of disability.\nIn cases involving appeals for disability living allowance, personal independence payments, and attendance allowances, a panel typically includes a judge, a medical professional, and someone with a disability or the carer of one who does.\nCouncillor Harkness said:\n“Their removal will reduce the impartiality and professionalism of the panel.”\nResearch by the University College London Judicial Institute and the Nuffield Foundation in 2013 found that claimants were almost three times more likely to win an appeal for disability living allowance after an oral hearing rather one determined on written evidence alone (46% compared to 17%).\nIn conclusion, Councillor Harkness stated:\nLeave a comment“The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group believes that these proposals are yet another example of the callous way in which this Tory Government treats disabled people in receipt of welfare benefits. They are cynically designed simply to save money by reducing the need to convene tribunals whilst massively reducing the chances of a claimant with a disability being successful in their appeal and that they are contrary to natural justice and fair play. Consequently we are adamantly opposed to them.”\nLeave a Reply",

I now intend to work hard for both my ward and indeed the whole of Saddleworth. I believe that the Parish needs to modernise as we are using standing orders established in 1974. The expected changes through the localism bill should enable the council to have a bigger say in the development of our area with devolved powers for dealing with planning and housing. The localism bill will give us a great opportunity to develop Saddleworth in a way that protects its heritage.\nThe District Partnership has shown how different people can work together for a common aim namely improving the area. I think that this needs to continue and I aim to play a big part in developing the District Partnership. I think we should be working together not only in the council but with other organisations also.\nIn the past committees have always been agreed before the annual meeting and 42% of committee positions were offered to conservatives and independents. (They make up 40% of the council) before the meeting. It was therefore disappointing that the committees are yet to be decided. I hope we can move forward and work together in a professional manner.\nTwo of the main issues in Springhead and Grotton involve the Cooper Street Quarry and the Grotton Hotel proposed developments. I have already been involved in the public meetings on these issues. The public opinion is obvious and I will continue to campaign on them. I am working hard to improve the roads etc. I have had many pot holes filled; graffiti sorted etc and am hopeful of some resurfacing work on Old Mill Lane. I will continue to look for improvements to green land, roads and parking in our area. As I said before the election, I will campaign for sensible development and I will both listen and act. Now I have been elected I promise to maintain that commitment.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Local government continues to be one of the biggest victims of this Government’s austerity strategy and things will only get worse; by 2021 Oldham will lose all of it’s central Government grant.”\nLabour has again proposed that Council Tax bills rise by 2% to pay for improvements to adult social care and a further 1.99% for other services.\nCllr McCann commented:\n“The Liberal Democrats will once again support this rise as it will at least raise some more money for services, but we also think it is important to focus every penny that we have on core services. As well as revenue-raising, our strategy is to continue to identify savings in back-office bureaucracy and waste to free up money to support the services that are most valued by our ratepayers.”\nThis year, once more the Liberal Democrats are proposing measures that will generate almost £675,000 in savings each year – from reducing publications, printing and advertising, to tackling absenteeism and reducing expenditure on employing agency staff. This is money that they want to spend on better roads, cleaner streets and more youth outreach provision.\nCllr McCann said:\n“We recognise that this is only a relatively small amount compared to the many millions that this Council has been forced to save, but this modest amount could nonetheless be a game-changer – it would provide us with the revenue we need to borrow over £5 million to invest in our key highways, with enough left over to radically improve our gully-cleaning service, restore a free Bulky Bobs waste collection service and pay for more youth outreach provision to engage with young people in our communities.”\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for over £460,000 from the additional savings that they have identified to go to:\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Saddleworth Moor has been devastated by fires in the past and these incidents are always tragic. When they are especially tragic is when they are wantonly caused by idiots intent on arson or being irresponsible by using disposable barbeques. Although I have supported calls to impose a higher penalty upon those using them, the best defence for the moor is eternal vigilance. That is why is crazy to scrap the volunteer ranger scheme.”\n“The volunteers are individuals who have a love for our natural environment and who want to preserve it,” added Councillor Harkness. “They are extra eyes and ears watching out for the moor and the people who visit it. Some have volunteered for decades. They receive no reward for their dedication and commitment and are now sadly being kicked in the teeth. I would ask the Peak District National Park to apply some common sense and keep them. They are worth every penny.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The amendment, proposed by Cllr Garth Harkness and seconded by the Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Cllr Howard Sykes MBE, roundly attacks the Tory Government for hurting the ‘working poor’. The motion and amendment will be discussed at the 4th November Council meeting.\nCllr Harkness said:\n“Liberal Democrats in Parliament and in Oldham have been adamant in our opposition to these cuts.\n“When the Lib Dems were in Coalition Government we stopped the Tories from introducing similar measures, but now the Tories are able to wield power alone they have quickly shown themselves to be no friend to hard working families. We believe Government should stand up for such families who are doing the right thing in working to support themselves – not stab them in the back”.\nCllr Sykes added:\n“These disgraceful Tory proposals undermine the work done by the Liberal Democrats in Government to make sure it always pays more to be in work than on benefits.\n“Before even considering any reduction in tax credits, measures need to be in place to ensure that all of those working and claiming are fully compensated by ensuring they receive an enhanced National Living Wage and that they also benefit from increasing tax allowances and national insurance thresholds to enable them to keep more of the money that they earn. I was especially pleased that in Oldham it was the Liberal Democrats who first proposed that the Council became a National Living Wage employer.\n“Consistently increasing the national minimum wage and tax allowances above the rate of inflation were two policies that the Lib Dems actively pursued when they were in power”.\nCllr Harkness said:\n“If these measures are passed at least 26,000 children in our borough, and this is only in the two main Oldham constituencies, will end up living in households with a reduced income, making it harder for their parents to make ends meet. We were opposed to these cuts when we were in Government and we remain opposed to them now.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

But it will not work if Government money does not follow the transfer of power, and we will not accept any attempt by Government to merely pass on responsibility for carrying out difficult cuts.”\nThe Oldham Liberal Democrats are firmly committed to seeing transparency in the work of the new Combined Authority – where all the Greater Manchester councils work together using the devolved powers and budget.\n“It isn’t enough just to tell people what’s going on.

We want to actively involve Greater Manchester residents in making the decisions that affect their lives and in shaping the services that their taxes pay for. And we want to work with people and communities to deliver those services more effectively and in a more responsive and accountable way.”\n“So we want information to be in plain English, and available on-line and on demand, and we want all meetings to be open to the public and to be webcast so taxpayers can call their representatives to account.

He also has his own personal concerns.\nHe explained: “Like many people in this region, I have a heart condition. I rely upon regular health checks from NHS staff based at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, I am reassured that my current health can be managed within the region and at the moment, I would not have to travel outside the region to access specialist services. Sadly this is not the case for many others and the situation could get worse.”\n“Regrettably, despite the work being done to promote healthy life choices, heart disease remains one of the biggest killers of adults in this borough and in this region. Many thousands of local people rely on the local NHS for their specialist treatment.”\n“Despite this, as a result of a recent review where NHS England find it acceptable to consider relocating specialist services to Leeds, Newcastle and Sheffield, and to expect local patients, many of whom are seriously ill, and their carers to travel there for treatment. This will mean that they will incur additional costs and the stress and time involved in travel; not great for patients who are not in good health and for households who are often likely to be reliant on welfare benefits. This is now already happening because surgeons have left Manchester and they can’t replace them.”\n“Most worrying the review says that in the event of an emergency attendance at a local hospital, patients will be ‘stabilised and managed’ by doctors until fit for transfer to a specialist centre. I am sure that heart patients who take a turn for the worse will have higher expectations of treatment than merely being ‘stabilised and managed’ until they can be shipped out of their local area for real treatment. What if these emergency patients do not survive the journey?”\n“This is a National Health Service and heart patients should expect to receive the same level of high quality of care wherever we may live, whether this be in Oldham or Otley, Oxford or Ottery St Mary.”\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats are saying ‘Don’t Kill Off’ our heart services and demanding that specialist services stay in Greater Manchester. We want this Council to back that demand and to enlist the support of our local Members of Parliament and the new Greater Manchester Mayor in support of our campaign.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

There are now well over 30 million Britons in employment, more than 14 million of them women – both new record highs. Conversely unemployment continues to drop – by 125,000 in the last three months.

Well youth unemployment is also an issue that the Liberal Democrats care deeply about.\nHere too we are moving in the right direction – the number of young people in work increased by 49,000 whilst the number of young people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance is now 123,100 lower than in May 2010. Liberal Democrats in Government have ensured that there has been investment in young people at school, with free nursery places and the pupil premium, and after school, by creating more apprenticeships with the Youth Contract.\nWhat is happening in Oldham -well this mirrors what is happening nationally. In the last year there have dramatic drops in the number of local people unemployed – by 37% of those aged 25+ and 59.9% for the under 25s.

The vision projects a population growth of 294,800 and 199,700 additional jobs across Greater Manchester.\nThe consultation document provides insufficient analysis of how these deductions for population and economic growth have been made and therefore is devoid of justification for the additional land demands. Further specific clarification of the rationale would be welcome and is desperately needed.\nThe plan requires 690,000 m2 industrial and warehousing space and 13,700 homes in the Oldham Borough. Of these 13,700 homes approximately 3,000 will be located on sites in Royton, Shaw and Crompton and other vast tracts of land (Green Belt) are designated for industrial development.\nTo the Liberal Democrat Group and to many of our constituents, these plans represent a massive and inequitable land grab in Royton, Shaw and Crompton with the devastation of our local Green Belt and OPOL (Other Protected Open Land).\nIt is proposed that new properties will be built at Cowlishaw; in the Beal Valley; Rushcroft; the Whitfield Farm area over towards Newhey; and around Gravel Hole and Low Crompton.\nAdjacent sites at Broadbent Moss (Oldham), Hanging Chadder (Oldham) and land East and West of the A627M (Rochdale and Oldham) if developed would also see a significant erosion of the Green Belt land in the so called ‘Northern Gateway’.\nIt is the view of the Liberal Democrat Group that there is no justification for the construction of a large number of properties (or indeed any properties) on Green Belt or OPOL before new homes are first built on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted and upon the many derelict and unloved sites in our town centres and districts.\nIt is unfortunate that the consultation document does not identify the many such sites that are available across the Borough other than those that currently sit outside Oldham’s Local Development Framework (formerly the Unitary Development Plan).\nFurthermore it is our view that conversions should take place so empty mills and factories can be used for housing (buildings and/or sites); as can land marked for industrial/commercial use; and bring the large number of empty homes back into use.\nAll this should be done before any consideration is given to future development on Green Belt or OPOL and this development for Oldham should, in our view, be apportioned better in the Metropolitan Borough rather than disproportionately in Royton, Shaw and Crompton as at present.\nThe draft GMSF readily identifies the need for a very significant investment in transport infrastructure. Improved transport is a critical obstacle to be overcome to ensure the success of the expansion desired in the GMSF. Many of the strategic allocations are sited near our motorway corridors, ostensibly to take advantage of existing networks.\nHowever, our existing motorways are frequently constrained by high levels of congestion resulting in unacceptable journey times and additional traffic jams on feeder and local roads. The projected growth of industrial warehousing, office space and new homes will require monumental investment in transport infrastructure. It is of paramount importance to ensure that the transport infrastructure is in place before other building takes place.\nAll the sites identified, especially those in Royton, Shaw and Crompton are devoid of good vehicular access and there is no obvious way to make the necessary improvements.\nCowlishaw has no acceptable roads leading into the proposed site. The topography around the Whitfield Farm area makes it difficult to envisage an elegant solution to site access. Similarly the Beal Valley site is currently served only by a narrow road and the desire to facilitate access to this site by enhancing links to Shaw and Crompton Metrolink Station seem incredulous; the only current access, via Beal Lane, is saturated with existing traffic and HGV movements to and from existing businesses which are large National/European distribution centres.\nThe increase in population will necessitate provision of additional services. The GMSF does not appear to adequately address available funding to deliver on these requirements.\nIn Shaw and Crompton, the necessary infrastructure to support even our existing population is lacking. We have primary schools that are already overcrowded or full; a secondary school that is falling apart; a dilapidated Health Centre that is near cardiac arrest; no swimming facilities or dry leisure provision; precious few youth facilities and no municipal tip.\nUnder the proposals, 3,000 homes will be built in Royton, Shaw and Crompton for growing families. These new residents will need more primary and secondary school places; more GPs and dentists; leisure and shopping facilities; and new highways and more buses and trams to get them there.\nNow doesn’t Oldham Council’s decision to close and not replace the Crompton Swimming Pool and Gym look a little short-sighted given the number of new young residents that will need to learn to swim and the number of adults that will want to keep fit.\nAn important vision of the GMSF is that Greater Manchester becomes as well known for the quality of its environment as for its economic success. Green Belt plays a role in this but there are important green spaces, parks, rivers and canals in the heart of our urban communities which are equally valuable. The protection and enhancement of our blue and green infrastructure is a central theme of the strategy.\nIn view of the above aspiration it is difficult to understand why the specific green sites in Royton, Shaw and Crompton have been proposed. There has been a lack of balance in the review and failure to give necessary weight to environmental and quality of life issues.\nThe vast majority of sites are notably attractive open spaces that provide pleasure, relaxation, and health benefits to local residents as well as our wider community. The sites include public footpaths enjoyed by many dog-walkers, ramblers and walking groups. Many of the Public Rights of Way are important to the historic Shaw and Crompton ‘Beating of the Bounds’ and Crompton Circuit walks. These locations also provide one of the few opportunities for people to undertake horse riding in safely which is particularly of concern for young and inexperienced riders.\nThese sites are further enhanced by a diverse range of flora and fauna and importantly provide those ‘green lung’ areas which minimise urban sprawl between built up conurbations.\nTwo of the sites include small but nevertheless important rivers within their boundaries; the Rivers Irk and Beal (Cowlishaw and Beal Valley respectively) help to prevent flooding and are attractive features of the two sites.\nAdditionally the Cowlishaw site is renowned for upwell of numerous local springs and given to serious flooding. The area has deep unstable subsoil that will require significant pilings leading to excessive construction costs.\nCowlishaw and Beal Valley also contain Sites of Biological Importance and these must be retained.\nIn regards to Saddleworth there is only one Strategic Site in the Spatial Plan, Robert Fletcher’s in the Greenfield valley, which has long been seen as needing a strategic view and plan to avoid piecemeal development. Indeed Saddleworth Parish Council presented an outline plan for the valley some years ago and has done so again in response to the spatial proposals.\nThe plan proposes some 120 houses and 100 ‘lodges’ which one assumes, given past happenings, would become houses for some 220 residences. These houses given the lack of public transport or facilities and the preference for high value housing would do nothing to lessen the need for affordable housing in the area.\nThe topography and lack of transport links and the high value of local scenery makes other large sites hard to find in Saddleworth especially given the presence of the Peak National Park there.\nSaddleworth is, however, very vulnerable to the number of other smaller sites, some of them astoundingly unsuitable, offered for development in addition to those in this strategic framework.\nThe Green Belt and open spaces within Oldham are areas of pleasant natural beauty that make us unique in Greater Manchester.\nThe Oldham Council Liberal Democrat Group firmly believes that our precious Green Spaces should be protected.\nThe Group strongly advocates that no building on Green Belt or OPOL be undertaken until developments are first undertaken on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted, and upon the many derelict and unloved sites in our town centres and districts; and also after the conversion of mills and factories into housing use and after every empty home has been brought back into use.\nOnly when all of these things have been done should we then, and only then, consider developing any part of our precious Green Belt.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It will be interesting to see if Labour’s commitment to abolishing this for social tenants, should they take office in 2015, will be extended to private tenants. Would they reverse it also? – I doubt it.\nI have no problem with the principle of only paying housing benefit sufficient to cover the housing needs of a tenant, rather than a ‘spare room subsidy’, but I do have major issues with the implementation. It is not fair for some to live in social houses that are bigger than they need whilst others are left in overcrowded accommodation. However, until more one-bed homes for social rent are built and become available, it seems to me also unfair to penalise social tenants falling into arrears when there is no-where suitable for them to move to.\nThe Liberal Democrats at their recent conference criticised the implementation and lack of available alternate accommodation. The party also called for social tenants not to be penalised where there was no alternative accommodation as well as a review of the policy. In the meantime, the Labour-controlled Council can do something though. At July’s Council, the Lib Dems proposed an amendment to a Labour motion on this issue outlining a set of practical measures to support social tenants affected by changes in housing benefit. These included reinstating the downsizing scheme that this Labour council recently abolished, supporting social tenants who wish to take on lodgers, establishing a hardship fund and, and supporting disabled people to take up entitlements to extra bedrooms and Discretionary Housing Payments.

The North West England Region will lose seven constituencies.\nThe Commissioners first shot at redrawing the patchwork means almost every constituency has been changed, none more than our own. Oldham East and Saddleworth no longer, they propose that Saddleworth should be combined with central Oldham.\nA big change from the old Colne Valley constituency, linking Slaithwaite and Marsden to Saddleworth for 100 years, or the short lived Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency. This latest reconfiguration will mean rural Saddleworth will always have its MP elected by votes cast in some of the most urbanised wards in the country.\nIf no one comes up with a better solution this is how it will be at the next General Election.\nThe Commissioners are coming to Manchester on the 11-12th October to hear alternative suggestions, which can come from councils, local groups or individuals. The whole of the North West Region is being looked at, but Saddleworth suffers by being on the border with the Yorkshire and Humber region. They are very reluctant to see a new constituency straddling the regional boundary, so the options are severely limited. Moving just one ward from one constituency to another, so they both fall within the upper and lower limits for numbers of electors, can cause a ripple effect across a number of constituencies, which then have also to be adjusted.\nThe alternative set of revised constituencies now being put forward by Saddleworth Parish Council will place Saddleworth at the centre of a new rural ‘South Pennines’ constituency, consisting of small towns and villages nestling in the folds of the Pennines. We want our MP to concentrate on our problems, not be swamped by the quite different needs of the wards clustered round Oldham town centre.\nWe believe that our alternative proposals will also give a better result than the Commissioners original suggestions for the rest of Oldham Metropolitan Borough. Under their scheme, the other parts of the borough would become minor parts of new constituencies centred on Ashton, Middleton and Rochdale.\nAll the constituencies shown on our alternative map meet the criteria set by the Commissioners, and no further constituencies are affected by the creation of this new South Pennine constituency.\nAnd we know that boundary commissioners do listen! Some years ago, Saddleworth White Rose Society’s suggestions regarding local ward boundaries in Saddleworth were accepted.\nWe will be presenting our case at the Manchester meeting with the full version containing more detail going on to the Commissioners for their consideration.\nOnce this round of consultations ends in December 2011, the Commissioners will put out a revised constituency map for the North West and invite further comments before they make their final recommendations to Parliament in October 2012.\nPolitical party considerations have not influenced the way these alternative new constituencies have been constructed. It is not possible to forecast which party would win a General Election in the proposed South Pennines constituency.\nMy Comments:\nThe Commissioners are coming to Manchester on the 11-12th October to hear alternative suggestions, which can come from councils, local groups or individuals.

Chris, a Shaw Councillor, is a former Greater Manchester Police Inspector with 30 years’ front-line experience, patrolling Oldham’s streets.\n“A damning report published in July by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary showed that the investment in roads policing is totally inadequate. Due to years of chronic under-funding, traffic cops are left over-stretched, under-resourced and treated like a Cinderella service, though what they do is so vital,” stated Councillor Gloster.\n“Road policing has had its budget cut by far more than any other Police department, and this has meant more lives have been needlessly lost and more people needlessly injured in road accidents. In just three years, between 2015 and 2018, the Conservative Government cut funding by a quarter. Not only did this mean less officers were available to police our streets, but it also led to an increase by a quarter in the number of people killed or seriously injured on our roads. The lesson here is clear; investment in road policing saves lives,” he added.\nCouncillor Gloster is clear that under funding has led to less enforcement against drivers committing serious traffic offences which contribute to road accidents.\n“The rise in road deaths and serious injuries is linked to a sharp decline in impairment testing. Drivers now get behind a wheel under the influence of drugs or drink, and we need to do more testing to tackle this.” Said Councillor Gloster.\n“The Inspectorate report also showed that Police enforcement involving the reckless use of mobile phones by drivers and driving without a seat beat have slumped by as much as 75% since 2011. When certain drivers think they can get away with irresponsible and criminal behaviour, they will. To prevent this, enforcement is key and to have enough traffic officers to do this you need to invest in them.”.\nThe motion is being seconded by his colleague for Saddleworth North, Councillor Garth Harkness.\nGarth and his Liberal Democrat colleagues have previously proposed that Oldham Council adopt several major initiatives to improve road safety across the borough, including:\n• introducing a default speed limit of 20mph on minor residential roads\n• calling for more funding for speed cameras at danger spots\n• introducing gating schemes to keep our children safe when they are dropped off or picked up by their parents from school\n• establishing more Speed-watch and Lorry Watch schemes to enable concerned citizens to support the Police in reporting traffic violations\n• seeking more Police enforcement on pavement parking, and\n• further investment in vehicle activated road signage to curb speeding.\nGarth is passionate about road safety: “I was proud to propose several of these initiatives on behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, but, unfortunately, the Labour Administration has chosen not taken any of these ideas forward in any meaningful way. I hope on this occasion they will at least back this motion as it is so important that we get more traffic police on our streets to help keep everyone safe, especially our children and elderly.”\nIn addition to calling for a restoration of Government funding and a Council response to the recent consultation, Councillors Gloster and Harkness want the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Panel to prioritise traffic policing in the local policing plan.\nCouncillor Chris Gloster ends: “The recent Inspectorate report clearly indicated that insufficient training and support was given by many Police Services to their traffic officers. This is not just about money, it is also about valuing traffic officers and giving them ‘the tools’ they need to do the job. I hope the Police and Crime Panel will feel able to give traffic policing in Greater Manchester the priority it deserves. We all have the right to feel safe on our streets”.\nEnds/…\nThe motion to Oldham Council on 9 September reads:\nRoads Policing ‘Not Optional’\nCouncil notes that:\n• In the last ten years, there has been no significant decline in the number of people killed and seriously injured on Britain’s roads, after decades of reducing casualties.\n• According to Department of Transport figures, there are still on average 5 fatalities and 68 serious injuries in England and Wales every day.\n• In early July, the Department of Transport published a public consultation document supporting a Roads Policing Review. The closing date for submissions is October 5th.\n• In the preamble to that document, the Under Secretary of State for Transport said the review sought to ‘build the fairest and most operationally effective enforcement capability in police and other agencies to deliver the best outcome for the safety of all road users.’\n• In the same month, the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary published a damning report which predicted an increase in road deaths because:\no According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, there has been a 34% cut in funding in real terms for road policing between 2012/3 and 2019/20 leading to a reduction of police officers available for these duties.\no These officers receive insufficient training and operational support.\no Road policing is ‘seen as less of a priority than it should be’ in most local plans and there is an ‘unclear national strategy.’\n• The HM Inspectorate called for urgent action as ‘roads policing is not optional.’\nCouncil resolves to:\n• Ask the Chief Executive to write to the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Transport, making clear this Council’s position that funding in real terms for road policing should be restored; that the HM Inspectorate’s recommendations be implemented in full as a priority; and that a new national strategy for road policing and safety should be developed.\n• Ask the Chief Executive to send copies of this letter to the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner, the Police and Crime Panel and our three local Members of Parliament to seek their support for the Council’s position.\n• Ask the Council’s representative on the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Panel to request the Panel revisit the local policing plan to ensure that roads policing is sufficiently prioritised.\n• Ask the Chief Executive, in conjunction with the appropriate Council officers and the relevant Cabinet Member, to make a submission to the Roads Policing Review consultation on behalf of the Council taking this resolution into account.\nProposed by:\nCouncillor Chris Gloster\nSeconded by:\nCouncillor Garth Harkness\nLeave a Reply",

That was the astonishing admission by Labour Leader Jim McMahon to the Performance and Value for Money Overview and Scrutiny Committee this evening (Thursday 17th November) as it examined proposals to balance next year’s budget.\nCllr Lynne Thompson said, “I could not believe my ears – a trade unionist and leading Labour politician saying he was prepared to sack and re-engage workers to reduce their sick pay. But I wrote down his exact words: “The route you could have to go down is to dismiss and re-engage.”\n“It was no slip of the tongue, either. Another budget proposal to change terms and conditions for the pupil escorts – staff who see disabled pupils safely to school and home again – refers twice to ‘rehiring’ on new conditions. Dismissal with an offer to re-hire is the standard last-resort procedure where staff refuse new terms.”\nCllr Mahon’s revelation came as Cllr Lynne Thompson raised concerns about a proposal to cease paying sick pay for the first three days of illness, both for its disproportionate impact on low-paid staff and for the risk to stable labour relations in Oldham Council.\n“If this goes ahead unamended, the lowest-paid staff will bear the brunt”, she pointed out. “A senior manager might lose more money, but it is a bigger loss to low-paid workers – and it is a total loss because the cut-off point is the worst one possible. There is no Statutory Sick Pay for the first three days, either. What is a worker with a family to do faced with the same food and rent bills but only half a week’s pay?”\nCllr Thompson asked whether the Labour leadership understood this and they said yes.\n“They also appeared to understand the crazy disincentive to minimise time off if workers lose nothing when absent for four days but are penalised for coming back sooner. When you plan to save half a million pounds by reducing agency cover for sickness absences, the lack of joined-up thinking is painful”, she added.\nThe threat to future labour relations comes from the fact that sick pay forms part of national terms and conditions. “That is not just a technical point”, says Cllr Thompson. “National conditions are a stable framework, the bedrock of good relations, and an acknowledged benefit to both staff and councils. But you cannot pick and choose; it’s a club you are part of or out of. If the council comes out of it, what of the half-million pound saving in this budget from national pay restraint?”\nCllr Thompson acknowledges that she understands Cllr McMahon’s dilemma. His plaintive “How else do we find £24.4m?” is a valid question. He may press on with his plan; he may find alternative savings; or he could use the £1.1m balance of the government subsidy to fund this year’s council tax freeze, which he admitted to keeping up his sleeve so far.\n“It’s over to him now”, says Cllr Thompson. “Scrutiny has done it job exploring the issues and received an amazing insight into the administration’s thinking. It is food for thought all round.”\nLeave a Reply",

The aim is to ensure that all jobless young people are earning or learning again before long-term damage is done.\n- Over three years, the Youth Contract will provide at least 410,000 new work places for 18 to 24 year olds into work. Starting April 2012\n- Including 160,000 wage subsidies and 250,000 new work experience placements.\n- In addition, there will be at least 20,000 more incentive payments to encourage employers to take on young apprentices.\n- A new programme to help the most disengaged 16 and 17 year olds – getting them back to school or college, onto an apprenticeship or into a job with training.\nLib Dems fight for what is right in the difficult times\nThese are difficult times for people across Britain, but this week has shown that this can also be an opportunity to reshape Britain into a fairer, more equal and greener country.\nLabour’s financial legacy has left Britain needing to borrow an extra £400million, every single day, just to get by. Labour also left us paying £120million in interest on our debt each and every day – for that we could build a new primary school every hour.\nOldham’s share of the country’s debt now stands at a dangerous £7.68billion and something needs to be done.\nBut despite all this, Liberal Democrat policies coming into action this week are making a positive difference to people’s lives.\nOver the last seven days in Oldham, thanks to Liberal Democrats:\n- 67000 people are getting a £200 income tax cut – benefiting 23 million people across the country\n- 2300 people have been lifted out of paying income tax altogether, with more to come\n- £625million extra has gone to our schools, aimed at the most disadvantaged pupils – rising to £2.5billion a year by 2015\n- 39700 pensioners have been given an extra £4.50 a week – and those retiring from today will be on average £15,000 better off over their retirement.\nLiberal Democrats in government will not stop there.\nThis week also saw Pensions Minister Steve Webb announcing that the Government will be introducing a simple, flat-rate state pension of £140 to replace the current complicated, unfair and means-tested system.\nBusiness Secretary Vince Cable is cutting regulation to promote small business and create jobs.\nEnergy and Climate Change Secretary, Chris Huhne revealed that Britain will be hosting the 2012 Clean Energy Summit – putting Britain at the heart of the Green Energy Revolution.\nThe Liberal Democrats have entered government at one of the most challenging times for the country. We did not choose the moment but we have not shrunk from our responsibility to act in the national interest. We will not miss the opportunity we have to build a greener, fairer and more liberal Britain",

He has insisted that the next stage now needs public consultation, particularly relating to planning. It has also been suggested that there should be ongoing consultation throughout the process.\nThe parish council set up the meeting on Wednesday so that people could express their views and form part of the consultation process. There is another public meeting scheduled for 16th October however, it is anticipated that the site would be identified and plans identified by then. so we feel consultation is needed now as well as later.\nI was promised a public meeting way before this by Oldham council but to our annoyance they changed their minds. We want people to have their say and we feel that many issues need to be fed in now. There is a statutory obligation that people have to be consulted through the planning process. We have met with officers who have assured us that consultation will take place before a planning application.\nYour three ward councillors are regularly raising issues of concern on this issue and are fighting for what is best for our young people and residents of Saddleworth and will continue to do so.\nIf you have any issues that I may be able to help with then please do not hesitate to get in contact.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Jenny Harrison and Cllr. Shoab Akhtar who serve as Labour Cabinet Members in the relevant policy areas of social care and employment asking for their support in finding suitable premises and offering these free of charge to MIND as our contribution to bringing this worthwhile endeavour to Oldham.”\nCllr. Harkness added: “At any one time, one in three people of working age in the UK is likely to be experiencing some kind of mental distress or mental health problem. This can often affect their ability to work.\n“One in 100 working age adults exhibit symptoms of a serious mental health condition such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Whilst these may have some impact upon the person’s ability to work, the stigma and discrimination experienced is often a greater barrier.\n“Where someone remains out of work it is more likely that their mental health will deteriorate and the cycle of unemployment will continue. In contrast, employment has been found to be good for mental health and well-being, and there is no evidence that work is harmful to the mental health of people with serious conditions.\n“We need to do all that we can as a Council to support our residents who have mental health conditions to have the chance to improve their well-being, increase their confidence and find employment. Bringing a MIND training academy to Oldham at minimal cost to the Council will be a very worthwhile investment”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This brings in an income to the public purse for many years to come, as well as providing new affordable homes to help reduce overcrowding and provide for young low-income families and jobs to address local unemployment.”\nThe announcement followed soon after the resolution by Liberal Democrats at their September conference to:\n“Dramatically increase the number of houses being built by pooling council borrowing limits, so that councils who want to build more houses but are at their borrowing limits are able to do so” and\n“enabl(e) councils with a sustainable business model to borrow to invest in building more homes for rent.”\nThe Autumn Statement also made a pledge to return the New Homes Bonus, a sum of money paid to Council on the completion of new homes, to local authorities instead of transferring it to Local Enterprise Partnership.\nCllr McCann added:\n“The previous threat to transfer Oldham’s New Homes Bonus money to an unelected Local Enterprise Board was a great concern to Oldham Liberal Democrats. We are glad that as result of pressure applied by Liberal Democrat Ministers in Government this proposal has now been abandoned”.\n“More money spent on house building in Oldham will mean more business for local businesses and more work for local people which must be welcomed.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

We will not let them down; the Liberal Democrat Group intends to fight these proposals tooth and nail!”\n“I know that Labour colleagues representing Royton and Chadderton are also upset at plans to devastate Green Belt in their areas so we hope that they will support this motion.”\nWithin the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework it is proposed that new properties will be built at Cowlishaw, in the Beal Valley, at Rushcroft, on the Whitfield Farm site across to Newhey and around Gravel Hole and Low Crompton.\nAdjacent sites at Broadbent Moss (Oldham), Hanging Chadder (Oldham) and land East and West of the A627M (Rochdale and Oldham) if developed would also see a significant removal of the Green Belt land in the so called “Northern Gateway”.\nCouncillor Sykes added: “It is the view of the Liberal Democrat Group that there is no justification for the construction of a large number of properties (or indeed any properties) on Green Belt or OPOL land before new homes are first built on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted and upon the many derelict and the unloved sites in our town centres and districts.”\n“We also believe that every empty mill and factory should be converted and used for housing and that the large number of empty homes in our Borough should be brought back into use.”\nWe are calling on Oldham Council to abandon their involvement with the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework and to instead meet our legal obligations by creating a fifteen year local plan, which apportions housing and commercial development across the Borough rather than in a few areas; meet our local requirements rather than those of others; and which emphasises development on Brownfield sites first.”\nThe Liberal Democrats have also objected to the GMSF plans as they believe that Shaw and Crompton simply does not have the necessary infrastructure in place to meet the needs of the residents of 3,000 new homes.\nSeconding the motion will be Crompton Councillor Dave Murphy. Commenting, Councillor Murphy said: “We have primary schools that are already overcrowded and full; a secondary school that is falling apart; a dilapidated Health Centre that is near cardiac arrest; no swimming facilities or dry leisure provision; precious few youth facilities and no municipal tip.”\n“Under the proposals, 3,000 homes will be built in Shaw and Crompton for growing families. These new residents will need more primary and secondary school places; more GPs and dentists; leisure and shopping facilities; and new highways and more buses and trams to get them there.”\n“Oldham Council’s decision to close and not replace the Crompton Pool and Gym now looks a little short-sighted given the number of new young residents that will need to learn to swim and the number of adults that will want to keep fit.”\n“A local plan would not overload any one part of the Borough with excessive development. We can instead properly and fairly apportion new developments across the Borough and make our own plans to ensure the infrastructure needs of new residents are met in an effective and timely manner.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Following the loss of a number of seats in the borough, we have lost control of Oldham Council. I now worry for Oldham, given the previous record of the new administration.\nI am extremely disappointed that our hardworking ward councillor, Brian Lord, has lost his seat on the borough council by 140 votes to Labour’s Adrian Alexander. Brian has worked hard for the area since before I was even born and this is a bitter blow to the area.\nThere was some good news in the fact that the Liberal Democrats retained all five seats for the ward on the Parish Council and remain the largest party.

The localism bill does bring about further opportunities for the community to shape the area.\nIndeed on planning- the Neighbourhood plans while far from perfect show an indication that the community decide on how planning happens in their area.\nThese proposals totally contradict this premise and would pull powers not just from local communities but to central government. As a point of principle I therefore have to oppose this.\nThe other issue is that the economics do not add up. There are around 400 thousand homes that have been given planning permission yet remain un built by developers. We need more affordable housing yet many planning permissions remain undeveloped.\nThe issue is to get developers developing the land that already has permission and this policy does nothing to attempt to address this. It doesn’t encourage development of the right kind.\nIf it is suitable it will get planning permission according to the National and local development frameworks and in the future neighbourhood plans.\nA streamlined planning system I would support for small applications but to have no scrutiny at all and a one size fits all for the whole country seems very rash.\nThe economic viability of Diggle station and the two tunnels was stated in one of the reports. I am continuing to challenge this.\nLocalism\nI asked what support is the council is going to provide parish councils and neighbourhood groups in producing neighbourhood plans or In providing input short of a neighbourhood plan.

The Conservatives recently made the unilateral decision to renege on the deal. Councillor Garth Harkness is seconding the motion, and their proposal is backed by the whole Liberal Democrat Group.\nCouncillor Williamson represents Crompton ward. Both the Crompton and Shaw wards, represented by six Liberal Democrat Councillors, and the two neighbouring Royton wards, are threatened with the prospect of thousands of new homes on the surrounding green belt under the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework proposals.\nCouncillors Williamson and Harkness, and their colleagues, want to see any new housing built on brownfield sites, former industrial land, rather than by destroying any irreplaceable greenbelt – and they want to see the Conservative Government cough up the promised money to do so.\nCommenting on her motion, Councillor Williamson said: “The Conservative Government stated in its white paper, ‘Fixing our Broken Housing Market’, that Councils should ‘maximise‘ the number of homes built on brownfield sites, and they promised Greater Manchester £50-million to remediate, or clean up, such sites for development. In Oldham, most of our brownfield sites suffer from significant land or building contamination, which is the result of their previous industrial use. This contamination costs a small fortune to clean up and, without outside funding, housing development is often unaffordable.”\nAccording to Department of Trade figures, the UK has approximately 1,000,000 acres of contaminated land, much of it in Northern towns, like Oldham. The estimated average cost of cleaning up contaminated land is £250,000 per acre – meaning a staggering £250-billion would be required to clear them all up for development.\nCouncillor Williamson added: “The fact is that on remediation this Government is all talk. £50-million is nowhere near adequate to address the challenge that we face in Greater Manchester in making these sites fit for use. In reality we probably need ten times as much or more, but the money would be a start and every brownfield acre that we can redevelop for housing means an acre of irreplaceable green belt that we can save. It is our hope that Councillors from across all parties will back our ambition next Wednesday to lobby this government to get our promised money back; after all it is the stated position of this Council to built on brownfield first!”\nMotion – Restoring Government Funding for Brownfield Housing Development\nCouncil notes that:\nCouncil condemns the decision by the Conservative Government to withdraw its offer of the Outline Housing Package, which will make the delivery of new homes on brownfield sites unaffordable and force more development onto the Green Belt, a direct contradiction of the Government’s own stated policy.\nCouncil resolves to ask the Chief Executive to:\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Liberal Democrats would ring fence the NHS budget in the next parliament. There is a need for further funding in the NHS that is why I support the Liberal Democrat commitment to meet the extra £8 billion that the NHS chief thinks is needed to plug the gap by 2020. This is four times more than Conservatives are proposing and over twice as much as Labour are proposing.\nI support the Liberal Democrat commitment to a mental health research budget of £50 million by 2020. I firmly believe in the Lib Dem plan to end stigma attached to mental health and the commitment to put more money into mental health such as the £1.25 billion boost for children’s mental health. A situation whereby 3 in 10 children in a class can be suffering mental health issues is something that needs to be tackled fast.\nI am a firm believer that the NHS is free at the point of use and we need to ensure that we protect the future of the NHS. I agree it is vital that the NHS is universal and needs to be protected. I would never want to see the NHS be privatised and have a system whereby the haves get quality treatment and the have not’s get nothing.\nLiberal Democrat ministers have pushed for reassurances from the EU that TTIP will have no effect on the powers of the NHS at a local level.\nA letter from EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom received by Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable specifically mentions the case of the NHS in Britain as an example of the rights of member states that are over and above TTIP.\nThe letter categorically states that under TTIP, “member states do not have to open public health services to competition from private providers, nor do they have to outsource services to private providers\nLiberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable has been absolutely clear at all times that we will protect the NHS as a top priority. Local GPs – who we put in charge of commissioning services – will continue to decide what is best for patients.\nThere may be a role for the private sector in the NHS but I am opposed, as is my party of privatisation of the NHS and will always fight for it to be free at the point of use.\nI would resist any attempts by other parties to privatise the NHS. For example, Liberal Democrats have stopped the Conservatives’ privatisation plans and we reversed Labour’s policy of allowing private companies to ‘cherry pick’ lucrative NHS contracts and get special favours. The Labour Government paid private companies £250 million for operations they didn’t perform and in Government, Liberal Democrats have made sure that can never happen again.\nYou can support the Lib Dem campaign to safeguard the NHS at http://www.libdems.org.uk/\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I wanted to talk about the system of who pays council tax in the borough.\nChanges to the council tax support scheme make things more difficult. I am opposed to the reduction. But we should do what we can to soften the blowWe should be protecting the most vulnerable and what has this administration done?

They expect a 50% collection rate so have to send out bills twice what is needed to meet the shortfall.\nLiberal Democrats have been working to make things fairer by cutting income tax in half for those on minimum wage and the lowest earners paying no income tax at all.On housing support Liberal Democrat Treasury Minister, Danny Alexander is battling and telling the Secretary of State his fears about the change in housing support, and urging his Conservative cabinet colleague to moderate his reforms.\nLib Dems support reducing the Single Persons Discount to 20% instead of 25% It would now be law if Labour nationally had supported it\n– and there would be no requirement for a 25% minimum payment from Oldham’s poorest households.

They’ve chosen to hit some of the most vulnerable who are having to pay council tax for the first time This is bad enough but raising the council tax by 3.5% -higher than inflation will affect even more.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Yet it was decided by the Mayor only two hours before the start of Council, under pressure from colleagues in the Labour Party, to decide the motion should not be debated and should be ruled out of order. There is nothing constitutional about this it is just gagging the opposition and is clearly a draconian act by an increasingly dictatorial administration\nIronically, it was our intention to invite the Labour Group to work co-operatively in jointly lobbying the government on making the system fairer\nI even thought that it was Labour policy.\nIn 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown pledged to introduce free prescription charges for long-term medical conditions\nHe said “Savings in drugs budgets will be ploughed into abolishing prescription charges for all patients with long term conditions”. Gordon Brown chose not to implement them and so we can assume that Labour do not support the motion.\nIn government Lib Dems sought to get mental health on a level playing field with other conditions. This has improved and we feel that for fairness we should have all long term medical conditions to be on level playing field when comes to prescription charges.\nThere should be no postcode lottery. In Scotland, N I and Wales they have free prescriptions. In England, there are free prescriptions for only for some medical conditions.\nMedical exempt certificates are good but the list is outdated.\nIt needs updating and many more long term conditions need adding.\nEveryone who needs treatment should get it.\nResearch shows people struggling to afford essential medication and it involves Cutting up pills, going without food Etc.\nPeople should never have to make a decision whether to collect the prescription or not?\nIf people can’t afford the drugs they may end up in hospital and is a false economy.\nThe current government plans to support the rich on the back of the poor. We were not surprised that the Conservative and UKIP leader did not want to debate abolishing prescription charges for long term medical conditions but we expected an ally in Labour in challenging this. It seems clear they do not agree with fairness and modernising prescription charges.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Events such as flea markets help raise money to alleviate the suffering of cancer patients and provide them with a range of support services at a time when they (and their families) are facing serious (or sometimes fatal) disease.\nMy concern is that these charges will significantly reduce – or wipe out – the profit that many of these community events make, ‘profit’ in name only as the money is used to alleviate suffering, poverty or other disadvantage.\nThese arbitrary charges – which are now being called Oldham’s Charity Tax – surely represent in no way the actual cost of issuing the licence to the event organisers.

McCann accepted that realistically there was little room for manoeuvre within the total budget, given the financial constraints placed on the council and the need for a far reaching review and redesign of services, but feels “there is opportunity to maintain the progress made in previous years in areas such as gully clearance and street cleanliness, highlighted by many as areas of priority, with funding to mitigate the early effects of the necessary re-organisation of Adult and Childrens services.”\nCllr Sykes is delighted that the administration has not increased, for a second year, council tax but has accepted government help to peg it at zero. Cllr Sykes explained” it is just and appropriate that when many of our citizens are struggling financially we take any opportunity not to increase their burden as the original possibility of a 3.5% increase would have done, but take advantage of the money the government is offering.” He went on: “ It is with the effects on our most vulnerable in mind that we have found some money to alleviate the immediate effects of the changes to Adult and Childrens services. These changes will in some cases be far reaching and so we propose to use some of the funds we believe we have found to ease the transition for the most vulnerable: by resourcing individual help for those moving from extra care accommodation with the range of those needing such help ranging from 5 to 50 (using the administrations own figures) and by putting money into extending the support time for our children in care. As the system changes as it is often the personal links with care workers that are most vital so sudden changes can be traumatic. Often it is the small personal contact or touch that makes all the difference to the individual who does not see the major reorganisation going on.”\nCllr McCann stated “I hope this will be a disciplined debate with acceptance that the majority of the budget proposals of the administration are accepted as inevitable, though many are unwanted by all, and that our suggestions are given in a positive spirit rather than just negative opposition: though as the main opposition it is our duty to examine and offer alternatives or suggestions to the administrations budget that we feel mitigate some hard decisions or offer alternatives or efficiencies.\nOldham has a long and productive tradition of co-operative or consensus working, with cross party support putting the interest of the borough first and enabling major schemes to progress to the advantage of all. Long may this continue.”\nOur alternative suggestions are therefore reflecting our concerns for the most vulnerable with £333,000 to extend the transition period and provide support for the\nOld and Young in care.\nTo provide two additional gully cleaning teams to bring resources back to previous levels and prevent the deterioration in the drainage systems which, as so graphically illustrated elsewhere in the country, are vital for safety, flood prevention and road condition.\nTo provide extra resources for enforcement action against fly tippers along with cleaning up the tipped rubbish. We fully support the administrations prosecution of those responsible and feel a drive against these litterers would bring benefits to all.\nThe money will come from:\nA review of the Street Lighting contract so that optimum lighting levels are used rather than the very bright levels from some of the current new lamps along with updating the technology being used, so for instance LED be used which has in Edinburgh led to a 40% saving in consumption. Safety would always be the overriding factor.\nSavings from Senior Management vacancies will be £200,000\nCease printing & delivering the Borough Life, we many other more efficient ways of communicating as shown by increased use of the Chronicle newspaper for some items.\nFinally (and deliberately misunderstood by some), to capture the savings in repayments arising from delays to the Capital Programme.\nIndeed at the cabinet meeting of 24th Feb Cllr Jabbar stated about the capital programme that there was “some significant slippage” and that it was “right for people to question”: very fair comments that accord with our suggestion that by reviewing and quantifying the amounts of interest that is not being paid as the project has not started major spending some money becomes available on a “one off basis” for the 14/15 budget.\nRoyton is taken as an example where project delays could mean some £157,000 could be allocated this year to particular needs.\nWe are not against all areas of the Capital programme; we are opposed to any proposed spend on New Statues in the town centre as the saving is £98,000 (revenue to fund) and we feel this could be better used.\nCllr McCann went on to say “the sums involved in the Capital Programme are very large but if the schemes are delivered to cost would indeed transform our Borough.\nThe investment proposed amounts to some £105 million, with an annual financing/repayment cost of £7 million. This could mean a rise of some 10% in council tax (£140 per band D payer) or extra savings of this amount from services or a mixture of the two.\nIt is a large mortgage for the future of Oldham which cannot afford any errors in management or contracts on the scale of DunwoodPark at about 25%. over run\nThe schemes must be properly run and managed and we want the Borough to benefit from these ambitious schemes, but also want the people to be aware of the risk.\nOldham will have a much higher level of debt than neighbouring and comparator authorities and so (two & one half more than Rochdale’s for instance) this has to be “right”.”\nTo emphasise we do not wish to just be negative about a transformational programme but hope to help by asking the relevant questions about value, timescale, contract control, project control and financial commitment.\nThe Liberal Democrats therefore have tried to be positive, not attack or slight changes just for short term political gain, but to be positive with suggestions and comment and indeed to present an idea for debate for the future by offering the suggestion that the number of councillors be reduced from 60 to 40.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I would like to focus on four policy priorities outlined at the manifesto launch.\nI am very proud that it is the Liberal Democrats who will ensure that mental illness is not stigmatised and who are committed to giving the treatment of mental illness equal priority with other illnesses in the NHS. The Liberal Democrats would back this commitment with an injection of a further £8Billon into the NHS.\nWorking in education, I am immensely proud of the pupil premium introduced by the Liberal Democrats in Government to provide additional resources to schools to educate disadvantaged children.\nThe Liberal Democrats in Government have also delivered on their promise to create over two million apprenticeships in the lifetime of this Parliament and locally we introduced policies in Council to help disabled people, carers, former armed service personnel and those with dyslexia into work.\nWe cannot have a stronger economy if we do not utilise peoples skills. We cannot have a fairer society if we do not give people the support to flourish.\nFinally, let’s not forget that the number one priority on the front page of the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto was to raise the income tax threshold.\nThis policy, which was dismissed by David Cameron as unaffordable, has become the signature tax policy of the coalition, cutting taxes for more than 23 million working people.\nWe would raise the tax threshold further so that income tax is not paid on the first £12,500.

We believe that removing this right will deny these individuals one of the longest established rights available to appellants in any court proceedings – their right to appear in person to present their case. This would appear to be totally contrary to natural justice.”\nThe Government instead wants claimants to submit their appeal online and in writing in future.\nCouncillor Harkness added:\n“If someone chooses to go before a tribunal it is to present extenuating circumstances that may not be apparent in documentation and to demonstrate their sincerity. If a claimant is not before them, the panel members cannot see how debilitating their medical condition is or question them about it.”\n“We are not convinced that a tribunal which relies solely upon written evidence in order to make its determination will be fully conversant of all of the relevant facts.\nIn past cases, where written evidence has been submitted, the quality has often been found to be poor without sufficient evidence of the appellant’s medical history.”\n“By insisting that claimants make their appeal on-line, the Government is also assuming that they have the technical skills and physical dexterity to access information technology, and a computer to hand.”\nFinally, Councillor Harkness has objected Government proposals to remove the requirement that tribunals include a panel member with direct experience of disability.\nIn cases involving appeals for disability living allowance, personal independence payments, and attendance allowances, a panel typically includes a judge, a medical professional, and someone with a disability or the carer of one who does.\nCouncillor Harkness said:\n“Their removal will reduce the impartiality and professionalism of the panel.”\nResearch by the University College London Judicial Institute and the Nuffield Foundation in 2013 found that claimants were almost three times more likely to win an appeal for disability living allowance after an oral hearing rather one determined on written evidence alone (46% compared to 17%).\nIn conclusion, Councillor Harkness stated:\nLeave a comment“The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group believes that these proposals are yet another example of the callous way in which this Tory Government treats disabled people in receipt of welfare benefits. They are cynically designed simply to save money by reducing the need to convene tribunals whilst massively reducing the chances of a claimant with a disability being successful in their appeal and that they are contrary to natural justice and fair play. Consequently we are adamantly opposed to them.”\nLeave a Reply",

This can put families with children at risk of eviction and homelessness. “\n“It is my view that Job Centre Plus need to do more to reduce the number of inappropriate sanctions and look at reasons for any non-attendance e.g. families with children, offer appropriate alternatives. “\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrat council group have suggested bespoke support for the most vulnerable cases but situations where for example, single parents and children are at risk of homelessness because of immediate sanctions without any investigation is unethical and should be reviewed as a matter of urgency.”\nEnds\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This would support first time Council Tax payers who face exceptional hardship in paying their bill. “The hardship fund is one of a set of practical measures that the Oldham Liberal Democrats have proposed to support our poorest citizens, especially those who are disabled or otherwise vulnerable. Some of these measures have subsequently been taken up by the Labour Administration – and I hope that this idea will also be adopted.\n“The bumper Manchester Airport Group dividend could be used to support the establishment of this fund – and I would welcome the chance to have a dialogue with the Leader of the Council as I requested at September’s Council meeting.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Oldham Chronicle has reported this evening the several other options put forward many by your Lib Dem ward colleagues over previous months. Prior to this the Liberal Democrats wanted it to be built on the site in Greenfield but the Labour controlled administration decided that Tesco would be built there. My view is that I want a new school and if it was possible to build on the existing site, within the budget and the school are satisfied that education will not be jeopardised then that is fine but if it is a straight choice of no school or a school in Diggle then I support the latter.\nThe existing site was previously rejected under previous schemes and again under this scheme as not financially viable. The recent option to build on the existing site is again being considered by Oldham council and the EFA. The Chair of governors announced on Monday night that there seemed be considerable financial obstacles of the new existing site proposal, we await further details, but the prospect of building on the existing site are becoming unlikely.\nThe contractor now appointed is Interserve and we understand that they should be in a position to engage fully with the School and Council by January 2014. In preparation and responding to the feedback received at the public meetings, the School have arranged a series of ‘Technical Group’ meetings.\nIt is clear that a key area of concern for local residents is the pedestrian safety, highway and accessibility issues that could be exacerbated by the development of a new School. Officers have therefore already met with highway colleagues from the Council and Unity Partnership in order to look at options in which these issues can be removed or alleviated.\nOne option is for the Council to introduce parking restrictions on the section of carriageway fronting 20-44 (even) Huddersfield Road. In doing this, the Council would look to provide replacement residents car parking and, on this basis.\nThe council should be sending letters to the residents on Huddersfield Road and seek comments\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This represents a direct attack on everyday workers who go out to work come rain or shine to provide for their families, and this will dishearten them when we should be giving them a helping hand. Everyone sensible knows we need to balance the books but this should be not be done on the backs of the working poor – especially at a time George Osborne is handing tax breaks to millionaires”.\nIn April of this year David Cameron was asked if tax credits would be cut after the election. He said No Michael Gove was asked in an interview if tax credits would be cut he said no\nWe see six months later that we were lied to. The whole rhetoric they are using around their cuts is welfare is by giving examples of a minority who abuse the system. Those individuals should be tackled not demonise people who need some extra support. The tax credit cuts effect the working poor. They are morally wrong and a disincentive to work The prime minister uses the rise in the tax threshold as an excuse. People not having to pay tax until they earn more is obviously a good thing and is something the Liberal Democrats had to fight for. It is good they are keeping this. That is not an excuse to penalize people who are trying to work and now around 16,400 families who live in the borough of Oldham will lose out under Conservative plans to cut tax credits. Families will see their entitlement reduced on average by £1,350 per year, as part of the Government’s proposals.\nAn estimated loss to local families and the Oldham economy of over £22 million.These are ideological cuts and they do not have to take £12 billion from the poorest and working people. There may be opportunities for some savings there need a leg up very hard.\nWe need collective opposition to challenge what is now clearly going to be a heartless government. By working together to fight for the poorest and most vulnerable in society. Now unchecked by the Lib Dems in coalition, the Conservatives are showing themselves to be a party dead set on balancing the books on the backs of the vulnerable and poor.\nLabour run away on tax credits\nDuring the welfare bill in parliament we saw the mass of abstention from Labour of 184 on the welfare bill in the House of Commons including the MP for Failsworth.\nThe Labour councillors did not want to support this amendment which highlighted this fact and so did not support this amendment in Oldham\nLiberal Democrats in the House of Lords put forward a motion that would mean that the tax credit cuts would be abandoned. Obviously the Tory peers did not support the motion, neither did the Labour peers and therefore the motion failed. The Lords did approve a delay and a review. I welcome this although the Liberal Democrats wanted the tax credit cuts to be shelved completely\nI hope we can move forward and as a council contribute to the debate by showing our joint opposition to the tax credit cuts Cutting tax credits is morally and economically wrong too.\nThe Government do not have to take from the poorest families in the country. They are choosing to do so and at the same time as giving tax breaks to millionaires. Who are not be asked to pay a penny more. No amount of political spin will protect the individuals who have to live with the reality.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The awards were presented to groups who have helped make the local area more resilient in terms of improving the clinical outcomes of those who have unfortunately suffered a cardiac arrest.\nThe award also recognises the work the group have done on the council to improve access to defibrillators across the borough and the work done on promoting and arranging lifesaving courses.\nSaddleworth based Liberal Democrat councillors Alan Roughley, Garth Harkness and Derek Heffernan ran a campaign to get a defibrillator in every village in Saddleworth to be accessible 24 hours.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “It is a great privilege to be receiving such an award which needs to be shared with community groups and volunteers across Saddleworth. I want to pay tribute to our Saddleworth and Lees District team, officers in the public health department at Oldham council and fellow councillors for also passing a motion to make Oldham council more resilient in helping people suffering a cardiac arrest. Working together we have moved the odds in our area of surviving a cardiac arrest. Community spirit made this happen”\nCouncillor Derek Heffernan added “We are pleased to see so many defibrillators accessible across the borough 24 hours an example that other areas hopefully will follow. The guardians who check them each week are a vital part in ensuring we have good coverage”\nShaw and Crompton Liberal Democrat councillors ensured the lifelong learning centre has a 24 hour accessible defibrillator.\nCouncillor Dave Murphy said “Outside hospital cardiac arrests every year in the UK see less than a 10% survival rate. When every minute counts it is important to be able to have quick access to defibrillators. The Ambulance service have been very supportive all the way in getting us to where we are as a borough”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Clearly local Conservatives do not care about hurting the feelings of relatives, friends and party colleagues of the deceased in using this out-of-date image. Two of the three councillors, Susan Dearden and Brian Ames, sadly died in February and March 2018 and the third, my dear friend, former Mayor of Oldham councillor Derek Heffernan, in December 2019. Getting an up-to-date image of the current 60 councillors would have been so easy but local Conservatives obviously could not be bothered.”\nWhat makes the use of the image worse is that the Conservative election ‘promise’ not only represents breath-taking hypocrisy on their part, but it cannot be kept.\n“At every Annual Budget meeting of the Council from 2012 until 2020, the Liberal Democrats proposed a cut of Councillor numbers from 60 to 40 to save money. The Conservative Group never did. The reason we did not do so again in 2021 is that Councillor numbers in the Oldham Borough has been reviewed by the Electoral Commission in 2020 and fixed at 60”, added councillor Gloster.\n“When the Commission called for comments on councillor numbers late last year, the Oldham Liberal Democrat Group wrote back calling for a comprehensive cut in Councillor numbers to two from three per electoral ward. The Council took a vote at its meeting on 4 November 2020 to propose to the Commission that councillor numbers remain at 60, the Conservative councillors present voted with Labour, the Liberal Democrats did not. Against our wishes, the Commission stuck at 60, and now whatever the Tories might say it is now too late to do anything about it.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The ‘Golden’ period is just 8 minutes, after which it goes rapidly downhill.\nAmbulances in this area are based at Royal Oldham A&E, so there is no possibility of them being able to reach the Saddleworth Villages in that time.\nThere are some defibrillators in the district – one or two schools have them, doctors surgeries and one or two pubs – but none are available for 24 hours a day and particularly during night times.\nIt is possible to mount a defibrillator in a vandal proof box fastened to the outside of a building, which can then be accessed by any member of the public once the 999 call has been made. They are capable of being used without any previous training.\nThe North West Ambulance Service is very keen to have lots of these devices installed throughout the region and they are coming to explain everything about them at 2.30pm in Denshaw Village Hall on this Friday 7th February (drive to crossroads in Denshaw, turn towards Ripponden, the Village Hall is on a road going off to the right, just 100 yards from the Junction Inn at the crossroads).\nEach one costs around £1500 installed and funds will have to be raised somehow! Your local borough councillors may be able to help from the monies they are allowed to spend on projects in their ward, the District Executive could be approached and there are other grant opportunities available but it is likely that some at least of the cost will have to be raised locally.\nWe are meeting this Friday at Denshaw Village hall at 2.30pm to see just what is possible.

Liberal Democrats in Oldham would like to see disabled people exempted from many of the provisions of welfare reform, as pensioners have, and we will lobby Government to make this so .\nHowever, whatever the rights and wrongs of welfare reform, the reality is that it is here to stay in one form or other as any Government in power will need to address the ever spiralling benefits bill. One of my concerns is that, in the rush to prepare for the introduction of welfare reform, agencies and officers may have paid insufficient attention to the needs of the disabled. Oldham is a pilot authority for welfare reform – by establishing best practice here we can set a standard for other authorities introducing welfare reform from October.\nThe Liberal Democrat Group has issued a policy paper to Councillor Jabbar, Cabinet Member for Finance, and the Labour Administration outlining 12 practical measures that the authority should adopt to support disabled people in our borough faced with welfare reform.I hope that, after a period of reflection, we will have the opportunity to meet with them to discuss the document and identify how we can take these measures forward.

However, we need to recognise that Metrolink is becoming an important way to travel in the borough so we need to lobby for a concessionary scheme to be introduced here too”.\nCllr Sedgwich added:\n“I would also like to see more of our front-line Council staff receive training so they can become ‘travel champions’, supporting job seekers with journey planning and accessing the best travel deals”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This creates challenges around community cohesion, impacts on the individual’s well-being and mental health, and forces them to remain in poverty, dependent on benefits.\nLast year, the Policy Advisor and Researcher from the Liberal Democrat Group met several times with frontline staff from the charity Refugee Action. These staff each had a caseload comprising refugees living in the borough.\nFrom these conversations, it was identified that in Oldham many refugees seeking work are single and better educated, including professionals such as teachers\nIssues for refugees living in Oldham in securing employment are:\nThese issues are not exclusive to Oldham and will apply in other parts of Greater Manchester.\nFrom these discussions, proposals were developed that could constitute an action plan for Greater Manchester:\nI believe that these represent a solid set of practical proposals that if implemented across Greater Manchester will help make our city region an exemplar borough for refugee employment.\nI understand that employment matters come under the remit of Cllr Sean Anstee, Chairman of the Greater Manchester Skills & Employment Partnership, so I am sending him a copy of this letter.\nI look forward to hearing from you of progress in due course and thank you for giving these ideas your serious consideration.\nYours Sincerely,\nCouncillor Garth Harkness,\nShadow Cabinet Member for Employment and Skills,\nOldham Council\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

If a defibrillator is used in conjunction with CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), then this can increase the survival rate to over 70%”.\nHeartstart Oldham which is an organisation that provides CPR training to the public and community groups, has raised funds over the last 15 years to place AEDs* (automated external defibrillator) in schools; North West Ambulance Service have supported this initiative.\n“I recently attended a Heartstart Oldham training event at the Civic Centre for staff who were first aiders or fire wardens. It was a well-attended session and whilst doing the training I spoke to someone who had performed CPR, in the Civic Centre car park, but did not have access to an AED.” Said Councillor Diane Williamson who has spoken previously in the Council chamber about lifesaving training and equipment in schools.\nCouncillor Harkness, Shadow Cabinet Member for Employment and Skills added “Councillor Williamson asked the Chief Executive about the lack of AEDs in the Civic Centre, particularly at the Rochdale Road entrance, and we are pleased to see that two defibrillators have now been fitted in the building. One in the Civic entrance and the other is on level 7 – this was placed here after recommendations in relation to travel distance; access to a defibrillator needs to be within 10 minutes, according to the NHS.”\nThe Motion being put forward is asking the Council to work with commercial partners so that sufficient functional AEDs are in their buildings, as well as making sure that staff are properly trained.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

With both Christmas Day and New Year’s Day falling on a Tuesday this year alternative arrangements should have been made by Oldham Council for the general black waste bins as they were on 29th December for the green bins (food and garden waste).”\nCouncillor Harkness comments\n“With no general rubbish (black bin) and paper and cardboard (blue bin) collection between 18th December and 15th January, thousands of residents have been overwhelmed with all of the extra Christmas wrappings and nowhere to store the huge quantities for a month.”\nCouncillor McCann comments\n“For some residents cans, bottles and plastic bottles (brown bins) have been collected today (8th January) for the first time since 11th December and the refuse collectors have struggled to get round with the huge month long backlog.

Recent frackingactivities on the Fylde Coast have demonstrated that there are public health issues with fracking activities, such operations involve many vehicle movements, ground disturbances that have led to earth tremors, and the real danger that frackingcould lead to the pollution of local water supplies. It is only right that where such operations are contemplated that local people and their elected Councillors are able to properly consider them under established planning procedures.”\nHe added: “And this is not simply about fracking. There is a danger that the government could decide that other contentious planning issues, such as building new nuclear power plants or housing on the green belt, could be considered at national level, denying local people and local Councillors any say in what goes on in their area. At the end of the day they are the people who have to live with the consequences. This goes completely against the grain of localism, which is about divesting power to local communities, and it is fundamentally undemocratic, and this is why as Liberal Democrats we are opposed to these changes.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The amendment, proposed by Cllr Garth Harkness and seconded by the Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Cllr Howard Sykes MBE, roundly attacks the Tory Government for hurting the ‘working poor’. The motion and amendment will be discussed at the 4th November Council meeting.\nCllr Harkness said:\n“Liberal Democrats in Parliament and in Oldham have been adamant in our opposition to these cuts.\n“When the Lib Dems were in Coalition Government we stopped the Tories from introducing similar measures, but now the Tories are able to wield power alone they have quickly shown themselves to be no friend to hard working families. We believe Government should stand up for such families who are doing the right thing in working to support themselves – not stab them in the back”.\nCllr Sykes added:\n“These disgraceful Tory proposals undermine the work done by the Liberal Democrats in Government to make sure it always pays more to be in work than on benefits.\n“Before even considering any reduction in tax credits, measures need to be in place to ensure that all of those working and claiming are fully compensated by ensuring they receive an enhanced National Living Wage and that they also benefit from increasing tax allowances and national insurance thresholds to enable them to keep more of the money that they earn. I was especially pleased that in Oldham it was the Liberal Democrats who first proposed that the Council became a National Living Wage employer.\n“Consistently increasing the national minimum wage and tax allowances above the rate of inflation were two policies that the Lib Dems actively pursued when they were in power”.\nCllr Harkness said:\n“If these measures are passed at least 26,000 children in our borough, and this is only in the two main Oldham constituencies, will end up living in households with a reduced income, making it harder for their parents to make ends meet. We were opposed to these cuts when we were in Government and we remain opposed to them now.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group is calling on the Labour Administration to take urgent action to meet the recommendations outlined in the report.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness, Shadow Cabinet Member for Employment and Skills and an Autism Spectrum Disorder lead teacher at a Manchester school, said:\n“Although the inspectors found some good practice and some motivated staff, it is clear from this report that there is a serious disconnect between what should be happening to meet the accepted standards of good practice and what is all-too-often happening on the ground and in our classrooms in Oldham.\n“A child or young person with SEN, such as autism, and/or disabilities has just as much right to expect an excellent education as any other pupil. The inspectors refer to the many children and young people with these conditions who possess a ‘stunning conviction and a humbling humility about the work they do to improve the lives of their peers’. It is unforgiveable and it is shameful if we as a Council and as an education authority continue to fail them in this way, and this failure must stop.”\nThe condemnatory report called for a Written Statement of Action to be produced because of ‘significant areas of weakness in the local area’s practice’.\nCouncillor Harkness added:\n“We have had a long standing problem in Oldham in providing the best start for our children and young people with additional needs. As someone who works in specialist Autism Spectrum Disorder provision myself and who works closely with the Local Authority in Manchester on Special Educational Needs and Disabilities I know how important it is to provide the right support to these youngsters.”\nYet the report says that: ‘Oldham is one of the worst-achieving areas nationally for educational achievement for this group of children. This prevalent poor achievement is exacerbated by high levels of fixed-term exclusions and persistent absences from school for children and young people who have SEN and/or disabilities.’\nThe report also highlights that school transport is flawed and that ‘children and young people wait too long for the needs to be identified.’\nCouncillor Harkness said:\n“This is simply unacceptable. We are leaving these children behind, abandoning them educationally. By not properly accessing the needs of these children, and the support that they need, at an early enough stage – sometimes not until they move from primary to secondary school – we are making it more likely that they will underperform at school. By excluding them and tolerating poor attendance, we are exacerbating this problem, and by having a school transport system that is not up to the challenge we make it harder to encourage parents to send their children to school in the first place.\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group’s score on the performance of the Labour Administration based on the findings of this report is an F – for Failure. This is not just about ‘could do better’, this is about ‘must do better’ and now, because this Council has spent a fortune on the Oldham Education Commission but it continues to let our most vulnerable young people down.\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats want to see every child and young person in our Borough achieve as much as they possibly can in education and in life so that they can fulfil their true potential. As always we are willing to work with the Labour Administration if they genuinely want to work with us in achieving this laudable objective.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Yet it was decided by the Mayor only two hours before the start of Council, under pressure from colleagues in the Labour Party, to decide the motion should not be debated and should be ruled out of order. There is nothing constitutional about this it is just gagging the opposition and is clearly a draconian act by an increasingly dictatorial administration\nIronically, it was our intention to invite the Labour Group to work co-operatively in jointly lobbying the government on making the system fairer\nI even thought that it was Labour policy.\nIn 2008, Prime Minister Gordon Brown pledged to introduce free prescription charges for long-term medical conditions\nHe said “Savings in drugs budgets will be ploughed into abolishing prescription charges for all patients with long term conditions”. Gordon Brown chose not to implement them and so we can assume that Labour do not support the motion.\nIn government Lib Dems sought to get mental health on a level playing field with other conditions. This has improved and we feel that for fairness we should have all long term medical conditions to be on level playing field when comes to prescription charges.\nThere should be no postcode lottery. In Scotland, N I and Wales they have free prescriptions. In England, there are free prescriptions for only for some medical conditions.\nMedical exempt certificates are good but the list is outdated.\nIt needs updating and many more long term conditions need adding.\nEveryone who needs treatment should get it.\nResearch shows people struggling to afford essential medication and it involves Cutting up pills, going without food Etc.\nPeople should never have to make a decision whether to collect the prescription or not?\nIf people can’t afford the drugs they may end up in hospital and is a false economy.\nThe current government plans to support the rich on the back of the poor. We were not surprised that the Conservative and UKIP leader did not want to debate abolishing prescription charges for long term medical conditions but we expected an ally in Labour in challenging this.

The review falls three weeks prior to the Liberal Democrat Amendment being considered by the Full Council (26 February).\nIn their budget proposals for the coming financial year (2020/21), the Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council has found significant sums to invest in front-line services over the next five years by finding a further £1.888 million over two years in savings at the Civic Centre.\nThe Liberal Democrats would utilise the £1.621m of revenue savings from the coming financial year to:\nThe Liberal Democrats would also refocus the Council’s capital programme on new priorities:\nThe Deputy Leader of the Opposition and of the Liberal Democrat Group, Councillor Chris Gloster, who is Shadow Cabinet Member for Finance said: “Our proposals are visionary. The Liberal Democrats would build three new health centres, including a desperately needed replacement health centre in Shaw; save our previous Green Belt from development; put Oldham at the forefront in tackling climate change; make improvements in signage and pedestrian footpaths to make our streets safer for drivers and pedestrians; and keep more money in the budgets of local Councillors and Parish Councils to help provide responsive services for the people and communities that they serve. We are also committed to creating special funds to support two priorities which are close to our hearts – providing money to set up school holiday clubs to feed our Borough’s neediest children and funding our world-renowned annual Saddleworth Band Contest.”\n“We have found the money to do this by proposing some common-sense savings at the Civic Centre – better control by managers of staff recruitment and retention, reduced spending on media and communications, removing car allowances from staff who drive 100 miles or less in a year on Council business, and cutting sky-high spending on air travel.”\nCouncillor Gloster added: “The Liberal Democrats also welcome the Boundary Commission review of the number of Councillors and ward boundaries. We have been asking for a review of Councillor numbers since at least 2012 as we believe this may lead to further savings should our proposals for a reduction from 60 Councillors to 40 come to fruition.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This creates challenges around community cohesion, impacts on the individual’s well-being and mental health, and forces them to remain in poverty, dependent on benefits.\nLast year, the Policy Advisor and Researcher from the Liberal Democrat Group met several times with frontline staff from the charity Refugee Action. These staff each had a caseload comprising refugees living in the borough.\nFrom these conversations, it was identified that in Oldham many refugees seeking work are single and better educated, including professionals such as teachers\nIssues for refugees living in Oldham in securing employment are:\nThese issues are not exclusive to Oldham and will apply in other parts of Greater Manchester.\nFrom these discussions, proposals were developed that could constitute an action plan for Greater Manchester:\nI believe that these represent a solid set of practical proposals that if implemented across Greater Manchester will help make our city region an exemplar borough for refugee employment.\nI understand that employment matters come under the remit of Cllr Sean Anstee, Chairman of the Greater Manchester Skills & Employment Partnership, so I am sending him a copy of this letter.\nI look forward to hearing from you of progress in due course and thank you for giving these ideas your serious consideration.\nYours Sincerely,\nCouncillor Garth Harkness,\nShadow Cabinet Member for Employment and Skills,\nOldham Council\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This will mean the Government has to go straight back to the drawing board.\nUnlike Labour, the Liberal Democrats have been steadfast in their opposition to the cuts in tax credits. When the bill was first presented in the House of Commons, most Labour MPs abstained despite knowing the impact that a cut would have on many of their poorest constituents.

To do this during recess when some councillors are on holiday is poor form. The process was put to us as “opportunities to save money” .Residents need to be able to get to the primary gritting routes so even if a bin is placed on a primary gritting route then side streets might use that bin If this is now being retracted then I welcome this but it needs to be an actual listening exercise and not a pause and plough on with the original plan.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor for Saddleworth North, Garth Harkness, has hit out at the council for their plan to remove some of some of the grit bins in Saddleworth. It will put the public at risk, he says.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “Saddleworth residents rely on grit bins during the winter months and this plan disproportionately affects our villages. I am not sure council leaders who live in other areas understand how difficult it can be to get to work on a snowy winter morning.”\nThe council plans to remove several grit bins in Delph, two in Diggle and one in Denshaw. It claims that some are on gritting routes and others are not used enough.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “They use figures for a mild winter, which is not appropriate. Many residents in Saddleworth need to dig themselves out and they really need more grit bins to service housing areas, not fewer. People have to get to the primary gritting routes to use them.\n“This is Oldham Council’s cynical attempt to blame local councillors for Labour cuts\nby demanding they pay for bins they say are essential.”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added “They are trying to put more and more things onto local councillors. We have very little funding and it is for things like community projects that matter to residents.”\n“I of course am opposing these cuts”, said Councillor Harkness. “Road safety is not an optional add-on.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The report also takes a thoughtful look at Oldham’s capital spending.\nCllr McCann is positive but realistic about the scope and remit of an alternative budget when the council is undertaking a complete redesign of its services.\nCllr McCann explains: “We recognise that the environment within which Local Government has to work is challenging and is likely to remain so for a number of years regardless of who governs nationally.\n“Cross party working and consensus has a major part to play in ensuring future success so, in the interest of putting the borough first, we seek to add value and prudence to the current administration’s budget.\n“We accept that there are a number of proposals within the administration’s budget which they themselves have flagged up as difficult or unpalatable. We agree but we believe that yah-boo politics is not the way forward.\n“Our aim is a disciplined debate and a positive contribution in which proposals for extra or alternative investment must be balanced with corresponding savings. Accordingly we offer a constructive challenge to some of the administration proposals.

Mental illness affects one in three people at some point in their lives, and yet it is not often talked about or is stigmatised or ridiculed.”\n“I give credit to my Liberal Democrat colleague, Norman Lamb MP, who did a great job as health minister in the Coalition Government to provide greater investment for mental health services and to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who in recent months have gone to great lengths to meet with Britons with these conditions and to champion the need to provide them with greater understanding and support.”\n“Young people, particularly adolescents, are often faced with situations of great stress, such as when they encounter bullying at school or on-line or are facing all-important examinations, and for some the stress is simply too much leading a minority to self-harm, resort to drugs or alcohol misuse, or even contemplate suicide. This investment at Saddleworth School will enable MIND to provide resilience courses and extra support to young people to help bring down the barriers, develop understanding and support them through troubled times.”\nCouncillor Harkness has also accepted an invitation to become involved with the work of a new Whole School and College Approach Council steering group. He added:\n“We need to look holistically at how we can provide comparable support for young people in distress in each of our borough’s schools, and I would like also particularly to look to meet the needs of those young people who, alongside study, provide care for other members of their family. I have raised the needs of young carers before in full Council, and I will continue to champion their cause.”\nThe Liberal Democrat campaign for better mental health services is not limited to young people of school age.\nCouncillor Harkness said:\nLeave a comment“There is also a great issue with young people with mental health conditions making the transition from school and college into adulthood and when adults with these conditions seek employment. There is clear evidence that prejudice and misunderstanding from society towards them can continue when they are adults and some employers discriminate against them when they are recruiting.”\n“So I am campaigning with MIND to establish a new Training Academy, staffed by MIND, for the borough where such individuals would be able to access training courses and therapeutic services to help them cope better with a mental health condition and to prepare for employment.”\n“I have previously written to my Labour counterpart, Councillor Jenny Harrison, asking for her support to establish a new academy in a town centre building, and I am now working with Council officers and with MIND to bring this about.”\nLeave a Reply",

It is good too that Labour decided recently to follow a past Liberal Democrat proposal to invest more in additional street-cleaners, but again we have done one better in finding money for a new responsive Environmental Task Force.”\nHe added:\n“I am especially pleased that in our budget proposals we have also found money to build a new replacement health centre for the people of Shaw and Crompton; this is long-overdue. Liberal Democrat Ward Councillors have been calling for a new health centre for many years. The present building is falling apart at the seams, and increasingly unfit-for-purpose. It is inadequate to meet the current health-care needs of our constituents, let alone those of the thousands of new residents that we will see if the Labour Council approves the thousands of new homes that the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework threatens Shaw and Crompton with. Royton and Werneth have bespoke all-singing, all-dancing health centres, and it is about time Shaw and Crompton did too.”\nThe Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader fully acknowledges that Conservative government funding cuts have made balancing the Council’s budget an increasingly difficult proposition so the party’s spending plans have been financed by extra saving cuts and revenue-raising in ways that do not increase the Council Tax.\nIn response, Councillor Gloster said:\n“I do not envy the lead Cabinet Member for or our officers in the Treasury team their task. Government funding shortfalls mean that once more £22.7 million in savings must be found from the Council’s budget in the next financial year. Current estimates are that in subsequent years the budget will need to be trimmed by £22.883m for 2020/21, £10.889m for 2021/22, £6.859m for 2022/23 and £4.160m for 2023/24. So the Liberal Democrats will, with great regret, support Labour’s proposal to increase Council Tax bills by 3.99% to help balance the books, but, because we know many of our residents are hurting financially, we will not add to their burden with our plans.”\nOnce again the Liberal Democrat Group has found the money to pay for their extra investments through taking a scythe to back-office administration and bureaucracy.\nThis year’s ‘War on Waste’ has yielded over £1 million in additional savings without having a negative impact on front-line services.\nCouncillor Gloster explained some of the additional reductions the Liberal Democrats are proposing:\n“Many of our proposals have been consistent in recent years, but this year we have discovered one or two new sources of waste. Our cuts focus on several core areas – better workforce management practices, a reduction in the number of councillors and reduction in expenditure on communications.”\n“We believe that Labour is not being ambitious enough in its proposals to manage the recruitment and retention of staff, especially agency staff and consultants. We want to place increasingly ambitious targets year-on-year upon managers to manage their workforces more efficiently. This year we estimate this could yield an additional £550,000 in savings. We also want again to look at how sickness is managed in this authority”.\n“Lastly we want this Administration to live up to the promise it made to review car allowances and cut lump sum payments to staff using their vehicles very infrequently on Council business. If, as we propose, the automatic entitlement to a £500 payment is withdrawn from the 100 or so staff who use their vehicles to make journeys amounting to 100 miles per year or less – an average of less than two miles per week – we can realise a saving of at least £50,000 per annum when fully-implemented. We also want the Administration to look again at expenditure on air travel for staff, which seems grossly excessive when compared to that of our neighbours.”\nThe Liberal Democrats are mindful that it is only fair that Councillors too share the pain with staff. Councillor Gloster explained how:\n“Once more, we are calling for a reduction in the number of Councillors by 20 (a third) and for a reduction in the number of local elections to two every four years. This is consistent with our proposals in recent years. If approved by the Boundary Commission, these changes would release a £290,000 saving in 2020-21 to spend on front-line services.”\nCouncillor Howard Sykes, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council along with his Liberal Democrat colleagues also want to revisit expenditure on marketing and communications. He explained:\n“We would cull all non-statutory spending. There is a requirement to publish certain statutory notices to inform the public and invite comments, but there is no legal requirement to publish ‘propaganda on the rates’ like Borough Life. We want to scrap it and in our view every penny spent on this and another staff conference is another one denied to vulnerable people receiving social care. We want to see a saving of £150,000 on marketing this year and a further £100,000 in each of the next two financial years. Information and messages can now be delivered almost cost free via social media, and printing less is good for our environment.”\nCouncillor Sykes concluded:\n“Although the Liberal Democrat proposals are modest when compared to the financial challenge faced by Oldham Council, they do nonetheless achieve real savings that can be put back into front-line services that matter to people, and they are reflective of the Liberal Democrat approach to public finance – to apply common sense, an innovative approach and tough love to cut waste and squeeze the most out of every penny of our finances to deliver the best services that we can for our hard-pressed Council Tax payers.”\n“I would like to thank my colleague, the new Deputy Leader and Shadow Cabinet Member for Finance, Councillor Chris Gloster, and the Council officers who have supported him, for their hard-work and commitment in putting this budget amendment together. In the current challenging financial situation it is difficult to create a balanced budget, whether in the Administration or in Opposition, and anyone involved in this process deserves full credit for their efforts.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It also plans to progress improvements in the facilities at the Civic Hall and provide new allotments throughout the Saddleworth. A major renovation and improvement programme of the Parish Cemetery is also underway. Parish Council Chairman, Brian Lord said “we want to do more for Saddleworth and this will cost money. But we recognise the difficult economic conditions facing many people and we felt that this year we ought to try to manage on the same money as last year”. The Parish Precept for a Band D property will now remain at £19 per year per household for another year.\nA major concern expressed at the meeting is the changes to Council Tax Benefit and its effect on how the Parish Precept is calculated. This could have led to a 20% increase in the Precept if government money had not been available to top up the shortfall resulting from the change.\nCouncillors also expressed concern at the possibility of unexpected costs arising during the year. In 2012 two by-elections had led the Parish Council having to pick up an unexpected and unbudgeted cost of £10,000.\nCouncillor Mike Buckley, in supporting the proposal said “Oldham Council have proposed an increase in Council tax of 3.5% or £54 for an average property, this is all the more reason why we should try to minimise the burden on the tax payer this year. We have already made significant economies this year through the hard work by all concerned. We are now going to look at further savings where they can be identified”.\nDespite the concerns, the Council agreed to hold the precept at the present level for another year.\nAllotments\nThe Parish Council has been successful in its bid to purchase land from the Canal and River Trust to provide around seventeen allotment plots between the river and High Street in Uppermill.\nThe District Partnership is providing the funding for this purchase and the Parish Council will arrange construction and the running of the area.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In particular in Saddleworth the District funded the Band contest and Christmas trees, Grit bins etc.\nThe council leader has dismissed claims that the band contest would be put at risk. We disagree with him The District Executive paid £15000 to the band contest and individual councillors also contributed extra too. I have asked now twice about funding this gap both times he has not committed. I have read his statement on twitter. He has not committed to funding the 15 thousand. Many of the band contests are already struggling before this cut so it is not scaremongering. They can find money for the lofty fact finding trips abroad or the borough life magazine which never mentions Saddleworth but not the band contest. I am sure local councillors will plug the 15000 gap but that means they will likely get less than they used to from individual councillors budgets thereafter and they are at risk. We will have to work with band contest organisers to look at innovative ways forward. Other local projects councillors provide money to which often provide a catalyst will be reduced as we battle to save the band contest.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

McCann accepted that realistically there was little room for manoeuvre within the total budget, given the financial constraints placed on the council and the need for a far reaching review and redesign of services, but feels “there is opportunity to maintain the progress made in previous years in areas such as gully clearance and street cleanliness, highlighted by many as areas of priority, with funding to mitigate the early effects of the necessary re-organisation of Adult and Childrens services.”\nCllr Sykes is delighted that the administration has not increased, for a second year, council tax but has accepted government help to peg it at zero. Cllr Sykes explained” it is just and appropriate that when many of our citizens are struggling financially we take any opportunity not to increase their burden as the original possibility of a 3.5% increase would have done, but take advantage of the money the government is offering.” He went on: “ It is with the effects on our most vulnerable in mind that we have found some money to alleviate the immediate effects of the changes to Adult and Childrens services. These changes will in some cases be far reaching and so we propose to use some of the funds we believe we have found to ease the transition for the most vulnerable: by resourcing individual help for those moving from extra care accommodation with the range of those needing such help ranging from 5 to 50 (using the administrations own figures) and by putting money into extending the support time for our children in care. As the system changes as it is often the personal links with care workers that are most vital so sudden changes can be traumatic. Often it is the small personal contact or touch that makes all the difference to the individual who does not see the major reorganisation going on.”\nCllr McCann stated “I hope this will be a disciplined debate with acceptance that the majority of the budget proposals of the administration are accepted as inevitable, though many are unwanted by all, and that our suggestions are given in a positive spirit rather than just negative opposition: though as the main opposition it is our duty to examine and offer alternatives or suggestions to the administrations budget that we feel mitigate some hard decisions or offer alternatives or efficiencies.\nOldham has a long and productive tradition of co-operative or consensus working, with cross party support putting the interest of the borough first and enabling major schemes to progress to the advantage of all. Long may this continue.”\nOur alternative suggestions are therefore reflecting our concerns for the most vulnerable with £333,000 to extend the transition period and provide support for the\nOld and Young in care.\nTo provide two additional gully cleaning teams to bring resources back to previous levels and prevent the deterioration in the drainage systems which, as so graphically illustrated elsewhere in the country, are vital for safety, flood prevention and road condition.\nTo provide extra resources for enforcement action against fly tippers along with cleaning up the tipped rubbish. We fully support the administrations prosecution of those responsible and feel a drive against these litterers would bring benefits to all.\nThe money will come from:\nA review of the Street Lighting contract so that optimum lighting levels are used rather than the very bright levels from some of the current new lamps along with updating the technology being used, so for instance LED be used which has in Edinburgh led to a 40% saving in consumption. Safety would always be the overriding factor.\nSavings from Senior Management vacancies will be £200,000\nCease printing & delivering the Borough Life, we many other more efficient ways of communicating as shown by increased use of the Chronicle newspaper for some items.\nFinally (and deliberately misunderstood by some), to capture the savings in repayments arising from delays to the Capital Programme.\nIndeed at the cabinet meeting of 24th Feb Cllr Jabbar stated about the capital programme that there was “some significant slippage” and that it was “right for people to question”: very fair comments that accord with our suggestion that by reviewing and quantifying the amounts of interest that is not being paid as the project has not started major spending some money becomes available on a “one off basis” for the 14/15 budget.\nRoyton is taken as an example where project delays could mean some £157,000 could be allocated this year to particular needs.\nWe are not against all areas of the Capital programme; we are opposed to any proposed spend on New Statues in the town centre as the saving is £98,000 (revenue to fund) and we feel this could be better used.\nCllr McCann went on to say “the sums involved in the Capital Programme are very large but if the schemes are delivered to cost would indeed transform our Borough.\nThe investment proposed amounts to some £105 million, with an annual financing/repayment cost of £7 million. This could mean a rise of some 10% in council tax (£140 per band D payer) or extra savings of this amount from services or a mixture of the two.\nIt is a large mortgage for the future of Oldham which cannot afford any errors in management or contracts on the scale of DunwoodPark at about 25%. over run\nThe schemes must be properly run and managed and we want the Borough to benefit from these ambitious schemes, but also want the people to be aware of the risk.\nOldham will have a much higher level of debt than neighbouring and comparator authorities and so (two & one half more than Rochdale’s for instance) this has to be “right”.”\nTo emphasise we do not wish to just be negative about a transformational programme but hope to help by asking the relevant questions about value, timescale, contract control, project control and financial commitment.\nThe Liberal Democrats therefore have tried to be positive, not attack or slight changes just for short term political gain, but to be positive with suggestions and comment and indeed to present an idea for debate for the future by offering the suggestion that the number of councillors be reduced from 60 to 40.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is following recent damage in Dobcross due to HGV vehicles and a campaign by local residents\nLiberal Democrats want Dobcross to be one of the first places to benefit from campaigns for 20mph zones in local centres. Councillor Garth Harkness presented a motion to the March 2019 council meeting about tackling speeding. As a result, a working group is considering proposals. This followed the Liberal Democrats’ previous attempts for a borough wide 20mph speed limit on residential roads being rejected.\nMeanwhile, Dobcross residents have raised a petition, aimed at 20mph limits and signs to keep damaging lorries out, and the press has lent excellent support.\nNow, Garth has followed it up with a question to the November council meeting, backing local residents and calling for a 20 mph zone in Dobcross to be trialled and then hopefully rolled out further. Carrying on from his proposals for action to tackle the HGV issues in Saddleworth, he has now called for better signage Garth said, “With all this momentum, I am optimistic of success.”\nThe response from the cabinet member is as follows:\nThe current situation is as follows:\nLorry Watch should only be carried out in areas that have Environmental weight restrictions in place; however, these are relatively expensive to introduce due to the need to illuminate signs around a cordon and are difficult to resource and enforce by the Police as schemes must be able to both accommodate legitimate delivery access but deter all other HGV’s.\nInitial consideration in Dobcross suggests that safely positioning and siting of the required signs may be an issue due to some of the routes not having footways or footways being of substandard width.\nLorry watch isn’t currently in progress in Delph as some signing issues need rectifying at a cost currently being identified by Traffic Officers.\nRegarding the introduction of a 20mph Speeds limit strategy for villages in the Saddleworth area. This is something that is currently being considered by traffic engineers and a request for funding from a future year’s Capital Programme is being pursued.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The work to be done will again ensure that the surface comes into contact with the drains which will hopefully alleviate this problem.\nThe pitches are still in the establishment phase and it will be some time before we have the ideal.\nAn additional issue during periods of heavy and prolonged rainfall as we have recently experienced is that the water table is high on what is a flood plain. The outlet for the drainage system is into the river has a non return valve, when the river is high the non-return valve closes and any water is trapped between the surface and the river, thus causing ponding as the water has nowhere to go. As soon as the water table reduces the non-return valve opens and water escapes more quickly.\nThis is as a result of the geography of the site and not the design of the drainage system.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Cllr Harkness said:\n“Many people with long term medical conditions do not qualify for free prescriptions and struggle to pay for regular treatment. Around a third of people are choosing not to collect prescriptions because of the cost. Consequently, some of these patients fall ill and are admitted to hospital. Ultimately hospital admissions and treatment cost the tax payer far more.”\nSeconding the motion, Julia Turner, Councillor for Crompton and Shadow Cabinet member for Performance and Corporate Governance, said:\n“Some conditions get a medical exempt certificate, which is exactly right, but equally many other potentially debilitating medical conditions are not exempt and are subject to the £8.20 charge per item. Even with pre-payment cards you are looking at over £100 per year and many people round here simply do not have this to spare and choose to go without”.\nCouncillor Harkness added\nLeave a comment“We think there should be equality in healthcare.

This move would cut income tax for 30 million workers and be worth £400 per year to a typical basic rate taxpayer.\nRichard Marbrow said:\n“Because of the Liberal Democrats in Government, 81,400 workers in Oldham have benefited from the increase in the personal allowance to £10,500, with over 10,000 lifted out of taxation altogether”.\n“It was on the front page of the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto and we have fought to keep it on the agenda at every Budget.

We’ve delivered the largest programme of tax cuts for a generation over the last four years, despite all of the other financial pressures.\nPensioners have not benefitted from the previous increases in the personal allowance, but the increase to £12,500 will benefit more than 6m pensioners.\nAnd in a new proposal announced today, Liberal Democrats will seek to raise the amount people can earn before paying National Insurance once the personal income tax allowance has reached £12,500.”\nSaddleworth Councillor Garth Harkness, Shadow Cabinet Member for Employment and Skills added:\nLeave a commentThe Oldham Liberal Democrats proposed a motion to Council in April of this year supporting the call by the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference to raise personal allowances for £12,500.

The Conservatives recently made the unilateral decision to renege on the deal. Councillor Garth Harkness is seconding the motion, and their proposal is backed by the whole Liberal Democrat Group.\nCouncillor Williamson represents Crompton ward. Both the Crompton and Shaw wards, represented by six Liberal Democrat Councillors, and the two neighbouring Royton wards, are threatened with the prospect of thousands of new homes on the surrounding green belt under the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework proposals.\nCouncillors Williamson and Harkness, and their colleagues, want to see any new housing built on brownfield sites, former industrial land, rather than by destroying any irreplaceable greenbelt – and they want to see the Conservative Government cough up the promised money to do so.\nCommenting on her motion, Councillor Williamson said: “The Conservative Government stated in its white paper, ‘Fixing our Broken Housing Market’, that Councils should ‘maximise‘ the number of homes built on brownfield sites, and they promised Greater Manchester £50-million to remediate, or clean up, such sites for development. In Oldham, most of our brownfield sites suffer from significant land or building contamination, which is the result of their previous industrial use. This contamination costs a small fortune to clean up and, without outside funding, housing development is often unaffordable.”\nAccording to Department of Trade figures, the UK has approximately 1,000,000 acres of contaminated land, much of it in Northern towns, like Oldham. The estimated average cost of cleaning up contaminated land is £250,000 per acre – meaning a staggering £250-billion would be required to clear them all up for development.\nCouncillor Williamson added: “The fact is that on remediation this Government is all talk. £50-million is nowhere near adequate to address the challenge that we face in Greater Manchester in making these sites fit for use. In reality we probably need ten times as much or more, but the money would be a start and every brownfield acre that we can redevelop for housing means an acre of irreplaceable green belt that we can save. It is our hope that Councillors from across all parties will back our ambition next Wednesday to lobby this government to get our promised money back; after all it is the stated position of this Council to built on brownfield first!”\nMotion – Restoring Government Funding for Brownfield Housing Development\nCouncil notes that:\nCouncil condemns the decision by the Conservative Government to withdraw its offer of the Outline Housing Package, which will make the delivery of new homes on brownfield sites unaffordable and force more development onto the Green Belt, a direct contradiction of the Government’s own stated policy.\nCouncil resolves to ask the Chief Executive to:\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The campaign by the charity Crohn’s and Colitis UK encourages venues with such toilets to install special signage with the logo ‘Not every disability is visible’.\nCrompton Councillor Louie Hamblett, who is the Shadow Cabinet Member for Health and Social Care, is raising this issue in a motion to the next meeting of the full Council (September 9). He said: “This motion is timely. The requirement to wear face coverings in shops and on public transport has started to raise public awareness that people can be exempted from their use because of a hidden disability. Accessible toilets, often opened using a RADAR key, are also sometimes needed by people who have a hidden disability. This campaign is around raising public awareness of that fact to help stop stigma and discrimination, and inappropriate challenges by staff, against those who have ‘invisible illnesses’, such as Crohn’s Disease.”\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats want the Council to ensure that the accessible toilets in our buildings all have this signage and that our onsite staff all receive appropriate training. We would also like to see retailers and leisure outlets across our borough encouraged to do the same.”\nThe motion also calls on the Council to install a Changing Places toilet in any new large Council building that opens to the public, and for new and existing Changing Places toilets to be properly sign-posted. The Government has legislated to make such toilets compulsory from next year.\nShaw Councillor Hazel Gloster, who is backing the motion, said: “The new legal requirement to provide Changing Places toilets to enable people with invisible disabilities to use purpose-built facilities affording them proper privacy and dignity is very welcome and long overdue.

Contrary to the comments in the letters page recently by an independent councillor I’d asked for these discussions in public about two and a half years ago and have met with officers and the cabinet member on a number of occasions relating to these highways issues and the cabinet member for highways is one who when it matters does collaboration and engagement. Positive engagement usually produces better results and I would urge people to approach the issue in this manner. I am glad that there were many valid points raised at the meeting and I expect they will be discussed in great detail in Oldham. We now need a sensible traffic management system. I have suggested that there is enforceable access only through Dobcross centre and to address the parking issues on Dobcross New Road as is being discussed with parking on Huddersfield Road in Diggle. I have also suggested that enhancing the turning circle on Wool Road rather than proposed drop off points opposite the Navigation Inn could help alleviate the rat run through Dobcross. In Diggle it needs to be clear that students can walk in from any drop off points safely and buses can get through without getting stuck at the thinner parts of the road. The residents effected by parking restrictions need to be able to access off road parking but any restrictions need to be enforced from day one. I would urge residents to engage with suggestions when any formal highways options are proposed so that the issues are addressed properly and we still get a new secondary school in Saddleworth\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I was surprised to be informed that the route in Delph was proposed to go up The Sound and then straight up Grains Road. This was the original proposal however, we were concerned that it would miss out the whole of the village. My understanding was that we had agreed there would be a short diversion down King street to Church street then Holland Close and Garside street so that the centre of the village would be visited.. Quite a lot of work, time and money has been spent in and around the centre of Delph with some plants and work provided by Oldham council. It therefore seems strange to now go back and miss it out.\nI have spoken to a number of Delph residents all who still believe that the centre of village will be visited and thus a considerable amount of work has already been done. The Delph community were very keen to get involved.\nThe lads from the park team have been working really hard on the route given to them and it looks great. In the main it had been positive and for example in Dobcross has been a great joint community project with revamped garden and Dobcross looking great. The council and community have been great in getting things looking the part.\nI know the competition it can’t go everywhere but when you are told it will go through Delph, people do lots of work and then they change their minds it is disappointing. It was only a tiny de-tour.\nIt is a kick in the teeth when people have worked hard and spent money to get the village ready and it won’t be seen. It is a great shame that people in Delph were not told they are going to go back on the agreement so near the event. I hope they can reconsider.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Some have gone to domestic violence centres with little. Recent legislation changes mean in order to access legal aid series in domestic violence cases, evidence from a GP letter is required. Reports of charges for GP letters have been around £75 but as much as £175 as it is outside the NHS contract. Having to find a fee for a GP letter is unreasonable and many victims will not have it. This is not acceptable. We need to support domestic violence sufferers not put up barriers”.\nSeconder of the motion, Liberal Democrat Councillor, Julia Turner, Crompton said:\n“Reports of domestic violence are on the increase. The government need to let innocent suffers of domestic abuse access legal aid support without the requirement to provide written evidence which will cost them money to obtain it they don’t have.. Whilst we push for the government to change the requirements we need to ask our local GPs not to charge for letters until the requirement is scrapped\n“There were 1.3 million females and 600,000 males who were victims of domestic violence in 2014/15. On average 100 women and 30 men are killed every year from domestic violence. We need to support victims to get justice not hinder them”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added “The council should support the campaign “Scrap the Fee” launched by Whythenshawe Safe Sports and Labour MP, Tom Watson. A stance for no fees for a letter to be used as evidence in domestic violence case is supported by many Police and Crime Commissioners across the country. They know that it has a significant impact in ensuring justice. It is time Oldham council join the campaign”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Diggle Station is already included in Oldham Council’s Strategic Plan but this is a golden opportunity to make it happen”\nCouncillor Harkness says\n“This is the best opportunity for a generation to make the case for reopening Diggle Station, which closed in the 1960s as part of the Beeching cuts. When the Northern Hub Plan was first published it included the reopening of the two disused Standedge railway tunnels. It is vital they remain in the revised version of the Northern Hub to be published this summer and that the case for reopening Diggle Station is included.”\n“Local residents have warmly welcomed this Petition and strongly support the re-opening of Diggle Station.

The implementation of Universal Credit has therefore been scandalous. Oldham a trial area highlighted the issues but the government ignored this.\nIn November Lib Dems in Westminster lead a rebellion against Tory tax cuts for higher earners 21 Labour MPs supported this but the rest decided not to oppose . It is beyond belief that a party which claims to stand ‘for the many, not the few’, decided not to oppose the Government on this.\nUsing the money to fund Universal Credit or end the benefits freeze would have been a far more progressive way of using the money. In July 2015 a bill was passed in parliament to take £12 billion out of welfare. The bill passed by 184. Labour decided not to vote against the Welfare cuts so there were 184 Labour MP abstained.\nSo Labour allowed the welfare cuts through. .We know Oldham was a pilot area and my Liberal Democrat colleague, Howard Sykes proposed 12 practical measures that the Liberal Democrat Group believed the Labour Administration should adopt to mitigate the impact of welfare reform on one particularly vulnerable group – the disabled.\nI and many of my Liberal Democrat colleagues have met with and challenged the Department of Work and Pensions and the Job Centre over the implementation to challenge and offer remedies.\nI have written to the Oldham cabinet member on a few occasions about this issue .Liberal Democrats in this chamber have proposed bespoke support for the most vulnerable -Helping those with dyslexia, autism, mental health\nThere has been a problem hitting people hard because of an overzealous regime which seeks to sanction first and ask questions later. When I met with staff at Tameside and Oldham MIND to discuss what could be done to support claimants with a history of mental illness\nThey were being sanctioned because they were unable to comply with the conditions that accompany claiming benefits.. A pilot project for claimants was introduced hopefully results less ESA claimants will be sanctioned in Oldham. This should then look at other vulnerable claimants\nOn the issue of sanctions -Too many cases are occurring where the Job Centre are sanctioning residents on Universal Credit without looking at the information first. Not enough warning not enough support just straight to sanction. I have asked officers for sanction figures but they appear to have dried up. Sometimes sanctions would be justified but sometimes it is clear they are not, sanctions are placed on applicants anyway and the applicant would clearly win on appeal but they then are left without money for weeks. Even then they won’t get it completely back dated\nWe need the figures on sanctions- to see\nHow many are justified?\nHow many are vulnerable groups who were not given the right level of support?\nHow many were issued by the providers working on behalf of DWP or Job Centre Plus?\nDid they follow a Vulnerability Guide and process flow chart?\nA Summary of the Liberal Democrat 12-Point Plan follows –. Oldham Council can support disabled people faced by welfare reform:\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

We only found this out by asking the question at the last full Council meeting about when the work would be carried out. To our astonishment we were told that it was not being considered and that it was the Saddleworth and Lees District Partnership’s responsibility. This is completely untrue\nThe Partnership have a small budget for schemes in the area to agree to have highway repairs that would not otherwise be considered on other projects.\nWe find it outrageous that the Labour controlled Oldham administration ignored them and would not even consider their proposals.\nAs a way forward we have suggested sharing the cost, using a part of the ‘Councillors budget’ with the rest coming from the main Highways budget.\nIf this fails we will see what can be done about some smaller scale patching work.\nDobcross parking and buses\nProblems still persist with buses getting stuck in Dobcross.\nThere was quite a lot of problems caused tonight by inconsiderate parking near the Square in Dobcross. Two double decker buses were stranded for nearly two hours and the police were in attendance for about 90 minutes. It has been raised many times about the issue and does not help with trying to hold first to task on keeping to their routes when this happens.\nI had done some work before Christmas to get the parking restrictions moved forward and at the end of November an order was passed for parking restrictions. The problem is there are no signs or yellow lines and we have been chasing this since. I asked a question at full council in December when they would be done- I was told by the cabinet member “when the weather is better”- despite line painting has happened elsewhere. We will continue to press for this\nDobcross Drainage issues\nFollowing my question at council, a report has been commissioned into the delays in dealing with the drainage issues in Dobcross and in particular, the playing fields near the woolpack.

The shocking study shows the areas worst hit by Covid-19 will now receive some of the largest cuts in Government support.\nOldham Borough is in the top ten Councils hit harder than any other area by the virus. More than £100 million of public money has been diverted away from Councils in the bottom half of the English deprivation index. Oldham Borough is unfortunately one of those Council areas.\nConservative run areas are not receiving funding cuts in the same way. Many believe this is a sly political move by Boris Johnson and the Conservatives. Oldham Borough will now not receive £1.1 million diverted monies.\nCouncillor Sykes says “The cash was supposed to be for fighting Covid-19. Our communities need this money, our area is already struggling badly.”\n“I commend bravery and hard-working nature of local people. However, Oldham needs the financial support!

This brings in an income to the public purse for many years to come, as well as providing new affordable homes to help reduce overcrowding and provide for young low-income families and jobs to address local unemployment.”\nThe announcement followed soon after the resolution by Liberal Democrats at their September conference to:\n“Dramatically increase the number of houses being built by pooling council borrowing limits, so that councils who want to build more houses but are at their borrowing limits are able to do so” and\n“enabl(e) councils with a sustainable business model to borrow to invest in building more homes for rent.”\nThe Autumn Statement also made a pledge to return the New Homes Bonus, a sum of money paid to Council on the completion of new homes, to local authorities instead of transferring it to Local Enterprise Partnership.\nCllr McCann added:\n“The previous threat to transfer Oldham’s New Homes Bonus money to an unelected Local Enterprise Board was a great concern to Oldham Liberal Democrats.

He also has his own personal concerns.\nHe explained: “Like many people in this region, I have a heart condition. I rely upon regular health checks from NHS staff based at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, I am reassured that my current health can be managed within the region and at the moment, I would not have to travel outside the region to access specialist services. Sadly this is not the case for many others and the situation could get worse.”\n“Regrettably, despite the work being done to promote healthy life choices, heart disease remains one of the biggest killers of adults in this borough and in this region. Many thousands of local people rely on the local NHS for their specialist treatment.”\n“Despite this, as a result of a recent review where NHS England find it acceptable to consider relocating specialist services to Leeds, Newcastle and Sheffield, and to expect local patients, many of whom are seriously ill, and their carers to travel there for treatment. This will mean that they will incur additional costs and the stress and time involved in travel; not great for patients who are not in good health and for households who are often likely to be reliant on welfare benefits. This is now already happening because surgeons have left Manchester and they can’t replace them.”\n“Most worrying the review says that in the event of an emergency attendance at a local hospital, patients will be ‘stabilised and managed’ by doctors until fit for transfer to a specialist centre. I am sure that heart patients who take a turn for the worse will have higher expectations of treatment than merely being ‘stabilised and managed’ until they can be shipped out of their local area for real treatment.

Also common is disturbed sleep when siblings of various ages and differing bedtimes must sleep together.\nIt is desperately unfair when, according to the latest statistics the council has published, at least 7 individuals or childless couples appear to be living in five-bedroomed social homes, 25 in four-bedroomed homes, and no less than 341 in three-bedroomed homes.\n(It could be that they have a child or children, but that means you can add extra bedrooms to the figures above.)\nAnd that is just the tip of the iceberg – those who have been living rent-free and must now pay towards their unused bedrooms. There could be as many again over pension credit age, who are exempt from the size criteria; it is often the elderly who find themselves in unmanageably large properties when children have left. And then there are people who pay the full (subsidised) rent.\nThe ideal answer to overcrowding is to build more affordable homes, but that takes time and a great deal of money – up to £200,000 for the family houses which are in high demand.\nWith 5,555 families in priority need of a new home with 3 or more bedrooms, the majority of them overcrowded, the council should be pursuing every solution. One priority family in 15 could be rehoused if just those grossly under-occupying at public expense moved – potentially as many as one in 8 if all under-occupiers did.\nOldham had until recently an award-winning downsizing scheme which delivered over 200 larger homes for occupation quickly and for around £500 a time.\nCouncillors Thompson and McCann are seeking its reinstatement, along with a whole raft of other measures, in order to free up large homes for the families they were built for.\nThose measures include:\nCouncillor John McCann explains:\n“These are voluntary schemes we are proposing to help people who find themselves financially squeezed because they live in homes which are far larger than they need.\n“Our experience with the downsizing scheme was that the big reduction in outgoings was in heating bills and running costs. The reason many beneficiaries, especially older people, had hesitated was the complexity of moving home. Our downsizing scheme’s one-to-one support made it easy and they found themselves much better off.\n“We have not hesitated to make common cause with our Labour colleagues on the council in opposing the size criteria legislation where it is bad – inadequate allowance for disability, for instance, and failure to allow for the scarcity of one-bedroomed accommodation.\n“However, those with two or more spare bedrooms have a choice because they are vastly outnumbered by families who want family-sized houses. It is council procedure which perversely makes a move more difficult than it need be.”\n“The crunch question is whether to press people to move”, says Cllr LynneThompson. The most heart-rending casework I get is still from people living like sardines in overcrowded homes.\n“I understand emotional attachments to houses but ultimately I have to question whether it is morally right to allow people to play dog-in-the-manger with publicly-provided houses they do not need and others need desperately.\n“I also sympathise with young families struggling with a mortgage so they can realise the dream of a home of their own. Under-occupiers’ outrage that they must pay £21 a week to keep a four or five bedroomed house rings very hollow in their ears – and Labour’s claim they are hard-done-to even more so.\n“I believe that, in the first instance, the council should leave people a choice – downsize or contribute if required to. But if selfish people dig their heels in, the council must consider tougher measures and councillors of all parties must face up to supporting that. There is nothing generous about sacrificing children’s well-being to others’ self-interest.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is to reduce the potential number of visitors expected. Check before you travel.\nCheck the recycleforgreatermanchester.com website for more details.\nHow will it work?\nSUEZ have reorganised the layout of the recycling centres and introduced social distancing measures. Only a limited number of cars (up to 5) will be allowed on site at any one time with a one in, one out policy. For each parking bay, there will be a container to place bags of general waste in. There will be no other recycling containers available. Residents should leave the site as quickly as possible to allow the next car in.\nHighways officers and traffic marshals will patrol the roads surrounding the recycling centres to guide the public.

This was also attended by a number of parish councillors. It is not uncommon for a developer to provide initial information before a planning application to elected members before submission of an application. This is a private development and land is owned privately and not by Oldham Council. The land has been designated for industrial use for a number of years.\nThe land in question is either side of the access road in front of where the new Saddleworth School will be. Currently no planning application has been submitted.\nFollowing the meeting the developers agreed to consult with residents before they submit a planning application. Further details should emerge from them soon.

The leading animal welfare charity launches this campaign every year on Valentine’s Day (14 February) to encourage dog owners who love their pets to clean up after them.\nSince being elected in 2015, Liberal Democrat Councillor Chris Gloster has, like his Liberal Democrat colleagues in Shaw and Crompton, found dog fouling to be the bane of his life in elected office.\nCommenting Councillor Gloster said: “Ward Councillors receive regular complaints about dog fouling. It is both an eye-sore and a health hazard, and it has a real impact on the quality of life of many of my constituents. Most dog owners are very responsible, and clean up after their pets, but unfortunately a few do not.”\nWith his Liberal Democrat ward colleagues, Councillor Gloster has been active in working to place more signs about dog fouling around Shaw to help enforcement. He is therefore delighted to be to endorse this campaign:\n“The aims of this campaign are quite simple, to encourage the many responsible dog owners to continue what they are doing and to make the irresponsible minority think again about their behaviour. Not only is it anti-social but it is also criminal attracting a fine of up to £1,000.”\n“All dog owners should take out bags to collect poop and they should dispose of it safely in a public litter bin or take it home. Otherwise the consequences could include a child being blinded by Toxocariasis after coming into contact with uncollected dog poo.”\nCouncillor Gloster was speaking at Dunwood Park, where local ward councillors and the Council’s District team have been working with parks department staff, the Friends of Dunwood Park and the local community to raise public awareness of the importance of owners cleaning up after their dog. This has included children at local schools designing innovative posters to bring the message home.\nAt the forthcoming Council meeting in March to discuss the 2019/20 budget, the Liberal Democrats are proposing an amendment which includes a commitment to create a new Environment Task Force charged with tackling, amongst other things dog waste.\nCouncillor Gloster added: “I really hope that Councillors from all parties will back this proposal. Such an Environment Task Force will have an extra £500,000 with which to tackle fly-tipping and dog fouling through enforcement, new innovative public education campaigns to change the behaviour of irresponsible individuals and the use of new technology, such as Poovers, which literally hoover up dog mess, and a real-time online tracking application to enable the public to report instances of fly tipping, dog fouling and offenders. Similar applications exist elsewhere, for example the Poo Watch scheme operated in Worcester which my colleague, Councillor Howard Sykes, suggested Oldham Council look at many months ago.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The group have support from Councillors; 3 local M.Ps whose areas include the line and from the Chair of the European Parliament Transport Committee, an M.E.P. whose constituency is in the Northwest of England.\nThe group were told they should be clear about what they wanted once electrification is completed in 2018. Currently interim plans by the transport authorities include all trains going to Piccadilly rather than Victoria during the period 2016-18 when work along the line for electrification will be most disruptive. The group say the concentration of shopping in Manchester, for instance, is nearer to Victoria and this plan is wrong. A recent poll of passengers from Greenfield supported this view with over 400 signing a petition collected in little over a fortnight.\nThe group also indicated they wanted the current peak hour services maintained; an half-hourly service all day; better weekend and evening services. They concede that with half-hourly services ideally one train could go to Piccadilly and one to Victoria giving passengers a choice. Lastly the group are working on a timetable which could see 2 per hour services evenly spaced at half-hourly intervals as near as possible.\nMark Ashmore Chair of the Group and resident of Greenfield said: ‘We had a most amicable meeting where the Transport Authorities clearly indicated they wanted to work with us to improve the service in a way which was consistent with passengers’ views.

There aren’t enough regulations in place to crack down on cowboy landlords, poor quality living conditions and unfair evictions. This also does not reward responsible landlords either.”\nCouncillor Harkness will move a motion in the council chamber next week (1/11/23) that calls on Oldham Council to get tougher on rogue landlords by issuing and enforcing improvement notices where conditions are unacceptable. This includes issues with excess cold as well as damp and mould.\nAccording to the homelessness charity Crisis, the end of a private rented tenancy is now the leading cause of homelessness in England.\nEarlier this month, several of Greater Manchester’s leading housing and homelessness charities came together to announce a new campaign declaring a “private renters’ emergency”. Their campaign was supported by Oldham Liberal Democrat Leader councillor Howard Sykes MBE who will second the Liberal Democrat motion next week.\nCouncillor Sykes said, “Wages are not keeping up with the rising cost of renting and this is already having devastating consequences for families in Oldham. Urgent changes in the law are needed to give private renters more protections from runaway rents and poor-quality housing. We also need to build more homes to rent!”\n“But it’s not just about pointing the finger at the government.

That was the astonishing admission by Labour Leader Jim McMahon to the Performance and Value for Money Overview and Scrutiny Committee this evening (Thursday 17th November) as it examined proposals to balance next year’s budget.\nCllr Lynne Thompson said, “I could not believe my ears – a trade unionist and leading Labour politician saying he was prepared to sack and re-engage workers to reduce their sick pay. But I wrote down his exact words: “The route you could have to go down is to dismiss and re-engage.”\n“It was no slip of the tongue, either. Another budget proposal to change terms and conditions for the pupil escorts – staff who see disabled pupils safely to school and home again – refers twice to ‘rehiring’ on new conditions. Dismissal with an offer to re-hire is the standard last-resort procedure where staff refuse new terms.”\nCllr Mahon’s revelation came as Cllr Lynne Thompson raised concerns about a proposal to cease paying sick pay for the first three days of illness, both for its disproportionate impact on low-paid staff and for the risk to stable labour relations in Oldham Council.\n“If this goes ahead unamended, the lowest-paid staff will bear the brunt”, she pointed out. “A senior manager might lose more money, but it is a bigger loss to low-paid workers – and it is a total loss because the cut-off point is the worst one possible. There is no Statutory Sick Pay for the first three days, either. What is a worker with a family to do faced with the same food and rent bills but only half a week’s pay?”\nCllr Thompson asked whether the Labour leadership understood this and they said yes.\n“They also appeared to understand the crazy disincentive to minimise time off if workers lose nothing when absent for four days but are penalised for coming back sooner. When you plan to save half a million pounds by reducing agency cover for sickness absences, the lack of joined-up thinking is painful”, she added.\nThe threat to future labour relations comes from the fact that sick pay forms part of national terms and conditions. “That is not just a technical point”, says Cllr Thompson. “National conditions are a stable framework, the bedrock of good relations, and an acknowledged benefit to both staff and councils. But you cannot pick and choose; it’s a club you are part of or out of. If the council comes out of it, what of the half-million pound saving in this budget from national pay restraint?”\nCllr Thompson acknowledges that she understands Cllr McMahon’s dilemma. His plaintive “How else do we find £24.4m?” is a valid question. He may press on with his plan; he may find alternative savings; or he could use the £1.1m balance of the government subsidy to fund this year’s council tax freeze, which he admitted to keeping up his sleeve so far.\n“It’s over to him now”, says Cllr Thompson. “Scrutiny has done it job exploring the issues and received an amazing insight into the administration’s thinking. It is food for thought all round.”\nLeave a Reply",

Much of this waste goes to landfill, more sadly still some of it ends up in our oceans.”\n“I think all of us will have been shocked by the recent images on our televisions and on social media of the world’s oceans being smothered by discarded plastic and sea birds and mammals choking on this detritus,” added Councillor Murphy.\n“In 2016, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation estimated that by weight there could be more plastic in our oceans than fish. Columbia University has estimated that these plastics stay in our environment for up to 600 million years. Imagine that an item you might use for six minutes polluting our environment for six hundred million years. And it doesn’t lie dormant – plastic contaminates the food chain. Plastic is consumed by fish and fish is consumed by us,” he stated.\n“As human beings, let us use our supposedly higher intelligence to take collective responsibility for the stewardship of this planet and the plants and animals which inhabit it. The Liberal Democrats believe passionately that one single thing that we can all do as part of this shared responsibility is to choose not to use and discard single-use plastic items, such as plastic drinking straws or picnic utensils, in our daily lives,” claimed Councillor Murphy.\nThe motion is being seconded by Liberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness. He commented:\nLeave a comment“I am proud that the Oldham Liberal Democrats are sponsoring this motion. We have a long track record of championing many environmental concerns in the Council Chamber, including calling for the establishment of tree wardens and a woodland strategy, seeking protection for bees and pollinators, and calling for an end to the use of non-recyclable coffee cups.”\n“Many other local authorities have chosen to ban the use of single-use plastic items in their workplaces and public buildings; the Liberal Democrats want Oldham Council to be part of that pack,” stated Councillor Harkness. “If in adopting this policy, we can influence our social and business partners and the citizens of this Borough to also say No to single-use plastic then together we can make Oldham a single-use plastic free Borough by the end of the year.”\nLeave a Reply",

We cannot have a fairer society if we do not give people the support to flourish.\nFinally, let’s not forget that the number one priority on the front page of the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto was to raise the income tax threshold.\nThis policy, which was dismissed by David Cameron as unaffordable, has become the signature tax policy of the coalition, cutting taxes for more than 23 million working people.\nWe would raise the tax threshold further so that income tax is not paid on the first £12,500. After this the threshold would be raised to the equivalent national minimum wage level.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Places like Oldham are the ones who suffer. He does not want Oldham to lose support from the European Social Fund. It has taken years already not to get an agreement on how to leave Europe. It will take many more years to actually agree trade agreements with Europe and the rest of the world.\nGarth believes we are neglected by Westminster already in Oldham.

The Conservatives are showing their true colours. We have a health secretary who is attacking junior doctors and then decides to hit out at hard working people who receive tax credits claiming people lack dignity and self-respect. He goes on to state that it promotes hard work. It is an insult. They already have targeted people with disabilities by changes to the Employment Support Allowance, the young by scrapping housing benefit for Under 25s. They now plan to target low paid working people now. The cuts in the tax credits are a direct attack on hard working people. The IFS calculation says 3 million families will be £1000 worse off as a result of this. This is on top of cuts people receive from a four year freeze. At the same time those who are able to pay a little more are not being asked to do so by this government. The whole rhetoric of blaming people for being ill, disabled or not having much money is morally repugnant. Tribalism on the left or right of politics with “us against them” is dangerous and will pull our communities apart. The creation of division, fear, resentment and isolationism. In times of difficulty the Liberal way is that we are stronger together and weaker apart. We should pull together, be open, generous and not penalise and vilify people because of who they are.

This would form part of a total ring-fenced fund of £500 million for Local Authorities across England to spend on youth services, providing young people with positive, safe and healthy alternatives to gangs.\nUnder the Conservatives, council spending on youth services has been cut by £300 million – or 40 per cent – since 2015. Knife crime has risen by 80% over the same period\nThe Liberal Democrats want youth violence to be addressed early on, with youth workers, police, teachers, health professionals and social services all working closely together to prevent young people falling into gangs and violence.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness, Liberal Democrat Parliamentary candidate for Oldham West and Royton said:\n“We recently had a great motion at Oldham council on tackling youth crime. We have heard about recent young people being killed in London as a result of knife crime. What is less publicised is what is occurring locally.\n“I work in a school in Manchester and our school community was affected recently by the death of one of our ex-pupils as a result of knife crime.

Derek was my ward colleague, my mentor and my friend.\nI first served with Derek in 2011 on Saddleworth parish council and had fond memories of his strong grasp of figures. Without fail Derek would always have some questions ready on the financial statements. I became Derek’s ward colleague in Saddleworth North in 2012. Derek was easy to get along with and his experience was eminence. When you discussed an issue with him he could recall some similar situation in 1998 and had a story to follow. Derek was keen on his stories and my favourite were often about his time as a VAT man for the Inland Revenue.\nDerek had a quiet and understated authority. His manner was friendly but assertive.He could work across parties with ease and command respect from all quarters. In a time where there is a lot of toxicity and mistrust in politics Derek’s conduct should prove a valuable lesson.If more politicians were like Derek then we would have far more trust in politics. This is one of the reasons I guess that he never lost an election in over 30 years.\nDerek was passionate about Saddleworth and worked hard as a councillor both on Oldham council and Saddleworth parish council He fundraised so much for many charities and in particular McMillan. As part of fundraising his bacon butties were legendary in Saddleworth\nDerek was a primary school governor and was incredibly active where he put his heart and soul into the role.He was well respected by staff and pupils alike.\nIn terms of Fire and Rescue Derek was the Lib Dems Steve Williams Derek has served as Chair of Saddleworh Parish council ,mayor of Oldham, Mayor of Austerlands and Father Christmas\nDerek suffered a fair bit in the last couple of years or so and not being able to always be in the same residence as Di was really hard for him.Derek was an independent man, sometimes frustratingly so.He would give so much help but not ask for it.\nDerek is what I would say is a true definition of a Liberal. As well as a great knowledge of the community he had a great knowledge of wine and beer too.He was kind and warm and positive. He was so easy to talk to\nDerek will be greatly missed.\nRest in Peace my friend.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

All the leading economic forecasters say that leaving the EU would be bad for Britain’s economy for years to come, so the consequences are inevitable. Cuts in spending will follow quickly followed by job losses in both the private and public sectors.”\nSykes claims that even supporters of Brexit admit that any economic benefits could only come after years have passed, and he says that they are offering no guarantees at all that there will be a long term improvement.\n“The fact is that Britain created the EU single market and has done very well out of it. To leave something we devised for our own benefit would be like shooting ourselves in the foot.”\nFears about immigration are said to be a major reason why people might vote to leave the EU, but Sykes argues that Oldham Borough’s major concern is not EU citizens working locally but the need to provide for asylum seekers and that other areas have a fair share.\nHe says: “Pulling out of the EU won’t help us in any way to deal with the problem and it could make the situation worse.\n“A Britain isolated and alone can’t deal with the problems of people fleeing Syria or Libya. There are no easy solutions but the only way forward lies through partnership with our European colleagues.\n“It would be madness to decide that we didn’t want to be in the rooms where decisions will be taken that are bound to affect our future and that of our children and grandchildren. Britain will be smaller and weaker if it opts for isolation. We will be bigger, stronger and have more influence if we remain IN.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

A recent limit has been introduced in Uppermill, and residents in villages like Dobcross and Delph have been pushing for similar initiatives.

Invest £6.5 million in building a green infrastructure taking Oldham forward in its ambition to be Britain’s first carbon-neutral Council and Borough. Create a dedicated fund worth £2.5 million to repair our pavements.\nFor the next financial year, the Liberal Democrats have also found £294,000 more to tackle the antisocial behaviour, such as fly-tipping, litter and dog-fouling, which ruins so many communities and blights the lives of so many Oldham residents. They will spend £200,000 to introduce 20-mph zones in residential streets to cut road deaths and injuries, especially amongst children and the elderly. This is also part of their build back better agenda and making sure we recognise and keep the increased amount of walking that has happened due to the lockdowns.\nIn the next two years, the Liberal Democrats have identified over £1.2 million in savings from cutting Civic Centre bureaucracy and waste, such as reducing or abolishing car mileage allowances for Council staff that no longer need them (working from home for example), to spend on front-line services. They also wish to redirect a significant sum from the Council’s Capital Programme currently allocated to ‘so called projects’ in Oldham town centre to realise their ambitions.\nCommenting Councillor Gloster said: “As we hopefully emerge from the nightmare of Covid-19, the proposals we have outlined in our budget amendment will help make Oldham a healthier, greener and cleaner Borough, and I am looking forward to outlining them to the PVFM Committee.”\n“I anticipate some tough questions as – rightly – it is the job of PVFM to properly scrutinise any plans to save or spend the hard-earned cash of our residents, but I also expect that those of our proposals which are rejected by the committee this year may well be taken up by Labour next year, or in subsequent years, without fanfare and without giving credit to the Liberal Democrats, as has happened in the past.”\nCouncillor Howard Sykes MBE, Leader of the Opposition, spoke in support of the proposals: “I would first like to thank Chris and the finance team for their hard work in putting together this Budget Amendment. The Liberal Democrats have consistently, year-on-year, put forward common-sense proposals which cut waste at the Civic Centre to reinvest in the frontline services that matter to Council Tax-payers, and this has again been our approach this time around.”\n“Although Council finances remain very tight and we have very little latitude to make changes, the Liberal Democrats have once again come up with some innovative ideas that would – if implemented – significantly improve the lives of many of the residents of our Borough. It is noticeable that yet again the Conservative Group has failed to put forward any proposals of its own. They talk tough but consistently fail to back it up with actions. This demonstrates once more that only the Liberal Democrats have credibility as an opposition to Labour in Oldham Borough.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Elected members are told to follow the same channels and get the same lack of response. Members are now having to put in freedom of information requests, which is a shameful indictment on this council’s transparency and accountability”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness also adds that the situation has got worse recently\n“We were told when the new Labour coalition took over the council we would have more collaborative working. We have seen less. Opposition councillors are banned from certain parts of the building and often don’t get access to information or answers. We find out the Chief Executive is going to Tameside through the press. This is just an example of arrogance of the leadership to exclude elected members”.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness called for a review on council communications at Oldham council on 11th September 2024 and suggested some remedies for the way of working which included each department having a dedicated member’s email enquiry inbox and it should be monitored by a senior officer who triages work to the appropriate member of staff. There should be a guaranteed response time for initial findings and timeframes on future actions.\nDespite chasing he is yet to receive a response.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added “It is ironic that the point about not getting responses has not had a response. There has been swarms of senior officers leave Oldham Council. There is a toxic nature to full council meetings. All have a responsibility to act with respect. What we see as opposition councillors is a lack of transparency and culture in an organisation is down to leadership.

That is nowhere near enough to satisfy demand.\nThe Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council believes that the Council needs to identify more allotment sites and the funding to develop and sustain them by working with District Partnerships, Parish Councils, local allotment societies and local residents to find those sites and identify sources of funding.\nAt the meeting of Oldham Council on Wednesday 10th September, Lib Dem Cllr Derek Heffernan will move a motion, seconded by Lib Dem Cllr Dave Murphy, asking the Council to identify suitable sites in Council ownership that have the potential to be developed into allotments as part of the District Asset Review and to identify funding to make this happen, because we are realistic and know that there is always a cost involved. The Lib Dems also want the Council to grant Council-owned allotments statutory status to given them some legal protection for the future.\nThe Council is looking to sell-off small plots of land throughout the Borough to developers instead of using them to meet a long term need for more allotments.\nSaddleworth Parish Council has done its bit by identifying a site in Uppermill, which is currently in the course of being brought into use as allotments, and is looking at other sites. There is no evidence that Oldham Council is following the same plan.\nThe enlightened attitude of a few wealthy people in the late 18th and early 19th Centuries, including social reformers such as William Cobbett, recognised the value of allotments in helping people become more self-sufficient.\nToday we recognise that working an allotment is both good for the individual and good for our environment by providing healthy local produce with no carbon footprint, unlike much supermarket produce.\nAllotment holding can also be a family affair with adults and children of all ages and abilities able to take part.

The Coalition Government has just announced a massive inquiry into the way the Big Six energy companies operate.\nThe inquiry has been promised by Liberal Democrat energy minister Ed Davey MP and is in direct response to public campaigns about increasing fuel costs at a time when the profits of energy companies are ever on the up.\nThe Government’s energy regulator (Ofgem) has now been instructed by the Minister to launch the biggest ever investigation into the energy market, which may lead to some of these massive companies being broken up to create more competition and so reduce consumer prices.\nThe Liberal Democrats are committed to a fairer society – and this includes being fair over access to energy. In government, we have encouraged competition and created simpler tariffs in the energy market creating competition and making it easier for consumers to switch suppliers. We have also sought to address fuel poverty by providing Warm Homes discounts and free insulation and boilers for the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe Big Six rose to prominence during the last Labour Government when a failed regulatory regime led to these huge energy companies dictating prices.\nIn 2000, there were three generating companies and 14 suppliers – 17 companies – and after Labour’s reforms there was the Big Six.\nAnd who was one of the Labour ministers under whose watch this happened – why none other than Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, now Labour leader Ed Miliband MP.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

(Presently this is capped at 75% of a bill for Band A payers).\nThis is line with the one of the recommendations made by Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Democrat Group, Cllr Howard Sykes, in a letter to Borough Treasurer Steven Mair in October of this year.\nCllr Sykes said: “The Liberal Democrats have always believed that the original discount scheme was not generous enough. It was based on what we felt was an overly pessimistic projected collection rate of only 50%.”\n“Whilst the increase from 75% to 80% is modest, to the poorest Council Tax payers every penny saved will make a big difference so the Liberal Democrats are happy to endorse this.”\nThe Liberal Democrats now hope that the level of support for the poorest will increase further in line with increased collection rates.\n“We would support further increases in line with improvements in the collection rate, added Cllr Sykes, “so long as the overall scheme remains affordable.”\nHowever, disappointingly, the report’s recommendations do not include establishing a discretionary hardship fund rather like that of other Greater Manchester Councils, as suggested by the Lib Dems.\nCllr Sykes said: “The hardship fund was one of a set of practical measures that the Oldham Liberal Democrats proposed to the Council to support the poorest citizens of our borough, particularly those who are disabled or other vulnerable. Gratifyingly, after talking with us, the Labour Administration has taken up many of our suggestions – but in this particular case they have chosen not to do so”.\n“The hardship fund would have been used to support first time Council Tax payers in arrears who are making some payment, yet face, because of exceptional circumstances, undue hardship in discharging their total debt. Liberal Democrats wanted particularly to target this help to claimants with disabilities and long-term debilitating health conditions.”\nCllr Sykes added: “I suggested to the Leader at September Council that the bumper Manchester Airport Group dividend could have be used to support the establishment of this fund – but Labour have chosen not to do so. So my overall verdict of the performance of the Administration on this issue is – making progress but could do better”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Almost 1.5 million of our youngest pupils have benefited from this policy.\nAs a Liberal Democrat, I am really proud of the effort made by schools to ensure children get the healthy meals they need. And studies have shown that the provision of a free school meal for every pupil helps improve concentration and academic performance and promote good behaviour.\nSuch has been the success of the programme that the Coalition Government’s independent school food reviewers even recommended extending free school meals to all primary school pupils.\nThis is now the party policy of the Liberal Democrats.\nIf we were in government, we would find the money to extend universal free school meals to all seven to eleven year olds, benefitting 1.9 million children and saving parents over £400 a year for each of their children.\nContrast this to the Tories who instead of investing in our children seem intent on turning up at the school gate and stealing their lunch money.\nLeave a Reply",

These are ideological cuts and they do not have to take £12 billion from the poorest and mostly working people. The changes to ESA will trap people on welfare and is a disincentive to work. They are not helping people into work but hinder them. Cutting tax credits is morally and economically wrong too. Young people can’t get any housing benefits under the changes. I expect this from the Tories as they’ve tried to do this for five years and the Lib Dems stopped it. I don’t expect much from Labour I didn’t expect the mass of abstention from Labour 184 of them in fact. The same number as the majority the bill received. We should be working together to fight for the poorest and most vulnerable in society. I hope Labour open their eyes to that fact soon. At least if you are a millionaire you will become increasingly better off. Will they pay a single penny more? Of course not!\nSign the petition and tell the Labour party to oppose the welfare cuts\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Some have gone to domestic violence centres with little. Recent legislation changes mean in order to access legal aid series in domestic violence cases, evidence from a GP letter is required. Reports of charges for GP letters have been around £75 but as much as £175 as it is outside the NHS contract. Having to find a fee for a GP letter is unreasonable and many victims will not have it. This is not acceptable. We need to support domestic violence sufferers not put up barriers”.\nSeconder of the motion, Liberal Democrat Councillor, Julia Turner, Crompton said:\n“Reports of domestic violence are on the increase. The government need to let innocent suffers of domestic abuse access legal aid support without the requirement to provide written evidence which will cost them money to obtain it they don’t have.. Whilst we push for the government to change the requirements we need to ask our local GPs not to charge for letters until the requirement is scrapped\n“There were 1.3 million females and 600,000 males who were victims of domestic violence in 2014/15. On average 100 women and 30 men are killed every year from domestic violence. We need to support victims to get justice not hinder them”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added “The council should support the campaign “Scrap the Fee” launched by Whythenshawe Safe Sports and Labour MP, Tom Watson. A stance for no fees for a letter to be used as evidence in domestic violence case is supported by many Police and Crime Commissioners across the country. They know that it has a significant impact in ensuring justice. It is time Oldham council join the campaign”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The contractors painted lines in on 2nd June 2020 and there was a gap where the layout has changed before the lay-by.

It is important when agreements and compromises have been made through constructive discussions that they should be adhered to.”\nRoadworks are have also been taking place at the Wool Road/ Dobcross New Road Roundabout. Councillor Garth Harkness highlighted that previous work was not announced at this roundabout but was pleased that this time they were.\nEnds\nLetter to cabinet member responsible for highways:\n24th July 2020\nDear Councillor Brownridge,\nRe; Highways works on Wool Road Dobcross\nI am writing to express concern in relation to the implementation of the highways schemes on Wool Road Dobcross.\nThere has been a lot of work gone into the highways schemes in preparation for the new Saddleworth school and I am generally pleased with the general members engagement around highways and the opportunities for councillor briefings which I have of course, taken up. . I have attended several meetings around the highways proposals. Indeed prior to the 2015 application there were a series of events across a number of the where views were sought from residents and elected members. Many changes and improvements were also made following these consultations over the years. It is important when agreements and compromises have been made through constructive discussions that they should be adhered to.\nIn relation to Wool Road and Sugar Lane. The latest proposals came out in January and we were told that there would be no changes to the parking arrangements on the Navigation Inn side. The contractors painted lines in on 2nd June 202 and there was a gap where the layout has changed before the lay-by. This means that about 3 or 4 car spaces have been lost on what was agreed and what has been painted. I questioned at the time why they painted the road lines and installed a roundabout because the road is going to be resurfaced and will need to be re painted again. The contractors had been instructed to do so and were also a little baffled too. I raised this issue on 2nd June but did not get a reply from the highways team when I raised this on 2nd June. This seems a waste. so can I ask:\nThere has been roadworks at the roundabout at the junction of Wool Road and Dobcross New Road again this week. I am pleased that this time it appeared on the roadworks bulletin, Unfortunately, this was not the case only a few weeks ago when earlier work took place. Could I ask that roadworks that are to cause major disruption only take place after this has been placed on the roadwork bulletin unless there are exceptional circumstances.\nI look forward to your reply\nYours Sincerely,\nCllr Garth Harkness, Saddleworth North\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I have been working for some time on the flooding issues. The council have carried out work in the area and United Utilities have already carried out work around The Square in Dobcross . Some issues have been tackled by opening culverts, clearing grids, redirecting water etc. Causes for the flooding relating to the Woolpack pitch are progressing finally.

This is to aid vulnerable children and protect local education. The National Education Union (NEU) Councillors Network has written a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson for local councillors to sign up to.\nSchools have been underfunded and struggling and the Covid-19 world has increased that mounting pressure. The signed letter has several key demands noted here:\n1. Assurance that families will be eligible for free school meals (FSM) will be given food vouchers during summer holidays.\n2. Government to work with local authorities to protect vulnerable children.\n3. Supporting calls from the teaching profession that schools be reopened when it is safe to do so, for both staff and students.\n4. Local authorities be given a role in coordinating with schools, trade unions and the DfE on a safe end to school closures.\nCouncillor Sykes says: “This letter of support, has been backed by thousands of councillors from all parties and non, hopefully it will send a strong message to central government. I am pleased that all Liberal Democrat Councillors on Oldham Council have signed it.”\nENDS/…\nNotes:\nLetter to Gavin Williamson\nDear Gavin Williamson MP,\nAs local councillors, we are writing to raise concerns in relation to current school closures.\nThe first issue is our concern about the impact school closures are having on disadvantaged students and their families.\nStudents eligible for free school meals (FSM) have had mixed experiences when applying for the Government’s voucher scheme, with some unable to access vouchers to which they are entitled. We would like your assurances that all families with children eligible for FSM will receive vouchers for the full period of school closure, including school holidays. This may need to be in retrospect for families who have not yet been able to access their vouchers.\nWe would ask that the Department for Education (DfE) continues to work with local authorities who are at the forefront of supporting families facing unprecedented food insecurity in the current climate.\nAs you will know, holiday hunger is an issue for many families, and we would like your assurances that families eligible for FSM will be given food vouchers to sustain them during the summer holidays. We believe that this should become a permanent fixture within our school system, so no child need go hungry during the school holidays again.\nWe also have concerns about support for vulnerable children and the increased calls to domestic violence helplines nationally. We would ask that the Government continue to work with local authorities and schools to ensure vulnerable children do not ‘slip through the net’ and the necessary financial support is available to councils to support families fleeing domestic violence.\nFinally, we are concerned by the current speculation on the end to school closures. We find current speculation unhelpful but would like to support the calls from the teaching profession that schools only be reopened when it is safe to do so, for both teachers and students.\nWe also ask that local authorities be given a role in coordinating with schools, trade unions and the DfE on a safe end to school closures.\nWe hope that the Government will continue to collaborate closely with local councils to support families and schools as we weather the current crisis and its aftermath. This will require an end to austerity and a new, long-term, funding settlement for local authorities and schools, to ensure they are best equipped going forward.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

All the leading economic forecasters say that leaving the EU would be bad for Britain’s economy for years to come, so the consequences are inevitable. Cuts in spending will follow quickly followed by job losses in both the private and public sectors.”\nSykes claims that even supporters of Brexit admit that any economic benefits could only come after years have passed, and he says that they are offering no guarantees at all that there will be a long term improvement.\n“The fact is that Britain created the EU single market and has done very well out of it. To leave something we devised for our own benefit would be like shooting ourselves in the foot.”\nFears about immigration are said to be a major reason why people might vote to leave the EU, but Sykes argues that Oldham Borough’s major concern is not EU citizens working locally but the need to provide for asylum seekers and that other areas have a fair share.\nHe says: “Pulling out of the EU won’t help us in any way to deal with the problem and it could make the situation worse.\n“A Britain isolated and alone can’t deal with the problems of people fleeing Syria or Libya. There are no easy solutions but the only way forward lies through partnership with our European colleagues.\n“It would be madness to decide that we didn’t want to be in the rooms where decisions will be taken that are bound to affect our future and that of our children and grandchildren. Britain will be smaller and weaker if it opts for isolation. We will be bigger, stronger and have more influence if we remain IN.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

All I want is a decent facility, where our children can work, which is not a 100 years old and sadly no longer suitable for today’s type of education and which doesn’t cost a lot of money to sustain.\nI believe that many people still believe the misinformation and doubtful financial figures being put about by the Save Diggle Action Group (SDAG) and Cllr Mike Buckley.\nI would like to take this opportunity to answer many of their objections and suggestions.\nThere are three bodies involved in the Priority Schools Building Programme (PSBP) for the new school: The EFA, OMBC and the school. However the former two are the main players with the school acting as an advisory body.\nI strongly believe that residents should know the exact reasons why it is not possible to build on the existing Uppermill site. I will try to outline the main ones.\nFirstly the land on which the SDAG plan shows the new school to be built is what is called ‘made land’ i.e. it is not the original surface. In this case it is the spoil from earlier development of the site or elsewhere. Thus it is highly likely that the new building would have to be ‘piled’ – at very considerable cost – not allowed for in the SDAG figures.\nThe proposed road leading up to the new school building would also need to be piled to prevent it slipping into the adjoining Pickhill Brook – again not allowed for in the SDAG figures.\nBecause the school would be built on reclaimed land it is also extremely likely that the land and foundations would have to be protected against gas emissions, with methane barriers etc. – again not allowed for in the SDAG scheme.\nThe SDAG scheme suggests the removal of a classroom block – originally stated as 6 classrooms but it isn’t – it is 10 classrooms, plus toilets and offices. Worse still, the majority are specialist Art and Technology rooms – far larger than general classrooms. The existing rooms contain cookers, sinks and specialist benching.\nThe scheme suggests putting temporary classrooms on the site of the existing Multi Use Games Area (Muga) and grassed area alongside the linear path. Both areas are used daily for PE lessons. If this were the case we would be short of places to teach PE. The costs of large ‘prefabs’ would be much greater than the SDAG suggestion. In addition they would need a significant power supply as two rooms are for Food Technology and have ovens, washers, fridges etc. and as the school supply is already overloaded, and given the building site would also need power, there would need to be a separate supply going back to the nearest substation. Again costs not accounted for in the SDAG scheme.\nIt is also suggested that significant savings could be made by retaining the existing sports hall. Again this would be far from ideal as the building needs considerable money spending on it as it leaks – not only from above but also from below. It would also stick out into the suggested playing field!\nWhilst any building work was underway the school drive would have to serve both the builders and pupils – clearly a very challenging and dangerous situation to manage. One way to combat this would be to construct a second access– again at considerable cost not accounted for in the SDAG scheme.\nAs the Uppermill site is worth more than that at Diggle the Authority would receive the cash difference – money that it has guaranteed to spend on the new school and a sum which would not be available if the original site was to be used.\nThere are other minor matters but it is clear from the above that financially it is not possible to use the Uppermill site given the modest budget available. One final point concerns the time window within which the new school would have to be completed. It is estimated by the EFA that it would take an extra 8 months to do the building in Uppermill which would mean that it could not be completed in the required time scale.\nWith regard to the potential problems relating to the Diggle site. Firstly the Council have made it clear the Diggle site is 18% bigger than the Uppermill one.\nThe first concern which people have is the fact that at present the parked cars and the ‘pinch’ point at the start of Huddersfield Road cause problems for people trying to get in and out of the Village. This could be very simply cured by stopping cars parking on the Road (but also providing a car park behind the houses for displaced cars) and by widening the road at the pinch point and this is exactly what the Council are proposing.\nSecondly people fear the problems caused by parents dropping off their children at the entrance to the school (already a major concern at the present site). This will be dealt with by means of a ‘school safety zone’ where stopping is forbidden and could be enforced by the camera car.\nThe current control option shows all buses will load and unload on the school site and parents will be able to drive in and drop off their children thus leaving the main road free of obstructions.\nThe school has a technical group working to provide the best possible outcome both visually and educationally. This is made up mainly of local people who have volunteered to be part of the group and who have not been “handpicked” as stated by SDAG. The group have education, the children and the village as a main concern and many have experience of working in construction or design. Already they have managed to persuade the EFA to have a two story building facing the main road rather than a three storey and will continue to work for the best possible outcome.\nI understand the reasons behind SDAG wishing to block the application and I have no problem in them stating their case but they must tell the truth and not blow problems out of proportion and accept that their scheme to build in Uppermill is not viable.\nIf SDAG manage to hold up the planning process we will inevitably lose our chance of having a new school – one which may never come again in the foreseeable future and this would be a disaster for the area. Should the present school have to close because the building is judged to be inadequate or unsafe, our children would have to travel to other parts of Oldham and beyond for their education. Is this what SDAG really want?\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Ratepayers expect their money to be spent on providing quality services in the neighbourhoods in which they live – the Liberal Democrats want to see more funding spent on bringing our roads up to scratch, on supporting a ‘war on waste’ and on devolving more of our budget to local leaders in each of our borough’s districts so that more local services can be delivered in response to local needs.”\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for the 1.7% Council Tax rise to be used to:\n“A 1.7% Council Tax increase will allow the Council to borrow an extra £5 million to invest in our borough’s roads. Imagine the impact that such an investment will make – the money can be employed wisely on improving roads where there is greatest public demand and drivers and their passengers will enjoy safer, smoother roads and improvements in travel times and road safety.”\nThe Shadow Cabinet Member for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Councillor John McCann, said:\n“The Liberal Democrats would make money available to employ two more cleaning teams and an extra vehicle to jet out gullies that have been filled with soil and other debris. Such an investment would be a victory for common sense as jetting means that clogged gullies do not have to be dug out at huge expense. This also reduces the risk of homes being flooded and there will be less water and ice on the roads, and in the long-term, a reduction in the damage caused by frozen water to road surfaces.”\n“The Liberal Democrats also want to use some of the extra money raised through a Council Tax rise to restore the free Bulky Bobs service. From contact with my own constituents, I know that people were angry when a £15 charge was brought in by the Labour Council and the imposition of a charge has contributed to a rise in fly-tipping. Tackling fly-tipping costs the Council and the ratepayers a small fortune so, surely then it is common sense to bring back a free service for everyone at a fraction of the cost.”\nThe Liberal Democrats want also to keep the team of enforcement officers up to full strength.\nCouncillor McCann: “We need to continue to employ the same number of officers to carry out enforcement action to ensure that fly-tippers know that in our borough this activity will not be tolerated and that offenders will always be prosecuted.”\n“I would also like to speak out particularly in support of the proposal to devolve £1 million of public money down to our districts. Despite Labour’s rhetoric, the Liberal Democrats are in fact the party of devolution, but in this instance we want to devolve £1 million down from Oldham Council to local people in each of the districts,” stated Councillor Sykes.\n“This would provide the three Councillors in every ward with a £50,000 budget to spend collectively to meet the needs of local people.”\n“In Shaw and Crompton, for example, we would use some of this money to commission more services for our young people to make up for the closure of our local Youth Centre by the Labour Council, but it is up to the local councillors of every district to decide what is important to the people they serve.”\n“The Liberal Democrats stand ready to accept the challenge of spending this money wisely to meet the needs of people in their local community – do Labour, the Tories, the Independents and UKIP?”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

We are sure that you too share these concerns.\nA recent Cabinet report; ‘Welfare Reform: Food Poverty and Food Banks’ presented to last Council highlighted that Oldham has an estimated 24,700 people in food poverty (or 10.7% of the population) and estimated that 4,600 accessed the borough’s food bank network.\nWith a new Tory Government no longer checked by the Liberal Democrats in coalition, we face the frightening prospect that poorer households across the borough will face great hardship over the next five years as welfare reform bites.\nWe fear this will have a big impact on peoples’ nutrition. As you will be aware, an inadequate diet impacts both on the individual’s immediate and long-term health, but also upon their ability to effectively participate in education, employment or civic society. These risks are exacerbated where that individual is a child, an older person or already has a disability or a long-term health condition.\nWe have written to the Prime Minister outlining a national plan to address food poverty, but we are also convinced that the local situation calls for a unified response from Oldham’s politicians and agencies to ensure that none of our residents goes hungry.\nOur recommendation to Oldham Council\nThat the Council look to establish a Food Poverty Commission to bring together the agencies already working on this agenda, and those that need to be engaged in doing so, to establish a strategy and a local action plan that is effectively managed to alleviate food poverty.\nWe have done this with housing and with education, so why not now with food poverty?\nThe Commission should first and foremost identify those practical measures that can be taken now in our borough, with a particular focus on:\nWe have already called for the establishment of a Community Shop and we are pleased to see that the Administration is now investigating this.\nLeave a Reply",

The ‘Golden’ period is just 8 minutes, after which it goes rapidly downhill.\nAmbulances in this area are based at Royal Oldham A&E, so there is no possibility of them being able to reach the Saddleworth Villages in that time.\nThere are some defibrillators in the district – one or two schools have them, doctors surgeries and one or two pubs – but none are available for 24 hours a day and particularly during night times.\nIt is possible to mount a defibrillator in a vandal proof box fastened to the outside of a building, which can then be accessed by any member of the public once the 999 call has been made. They are capable of being used without any previous training.\nThe North West Ambulance Service is very keen to have lots of these devices installed throughout the region and they are coming to explain everything about them at 2.30pm in Denshaw Village Hall on this Friday 7th February (drive to crossroads in Denshaw, turn towards Ripponden, the Village Hall is on a road going off to the right, just 100 yards from the Junction Inn at the crossroads).\nEach one costs around £1500 installed and funds will have to be raised somehow!

Of the 13,700 new homes, almost a quarter – almost 3,000 – will be located in sites in Shaw and Crompton, this is in addition to other vast tracts of land that are designated for industrial development.”\n“We believe this is madness. To Liberal Democrat Councillors representing Shaw and Crompton, this plan represents a massive and inequitable land grab in our area with the loss of our much-loved Green Belt and OPOL (Other Protected Open Land). Our constituents are up-in-arms about it, they have marched to save their Green Belt and they rightly expect their elected representatives to stand by them on this vital issue. We will not let them down; the Liberal Democrat Group intends to fight these proposals tooth and nail!”\n“I know that Labour colleagues representing Royton and Chadderton are also upset at plans to devastate Green Belt in their areas so we hope that they will support this motion.”\nWithin the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework it is proposed that new properties will be built at Cowlishaw, in the Beal Valley, at Rushcroft, on the Whitfield Farm site across to Newhey and around Gravel Hole and Low Crompton.\nAdjacent sites at Broadbent Moss (Oldham), Hanging Chadder (Oldham) and land East and West of the A627M (Rochdale and Oldham) if developed would also see a significant removal of the Green Belt land in the so called “Northern Gateway”.\nCouncillor Sykes added: “It is the view of the Liberal Democrat Group that there is no justification for the construction of a large number of properties (or indeed any properties) on Green Belt or OPOL land before new homes are first built on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted and upon the many derelict and the unloved sites in our town centres and districts.”\n“We also believe that every empty mill and factory should be converted and used for housing and that the large number of empty homes in our Borough should be brought back into use.”\nWe are calling on Oldham Council to abandon their involvement with the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework and to instead meet our legal obligations by creating a fifteen year local plan, which apportions housing and commercial development across the Borough rather than in a few areas; meet our local requirements rather than those of others; and which emphasises development on Brownfield sites first.”\nThe Liberal Democrats have also objected to the GMSF plans as they believe that Shaw and Crompton simply does not have the necessary infrastructure in place to meet the needs of the residents of 3,000 new homes.\nSeconding the motion will be Crompton Councillor Dave Murphy. Commenting, Councillor Murphy said: “We have primary schools that are already overcrowded and full; a secondary school that is falling apart; a dilapidated Health Centre that is near cardiac arrest; no swimming facilities or dry leisure provision; precious few youth facilities and no municipal tip.”\n“Under the proposals, 3,000 homes will be built in Shaw and Crompton for growing families. These new residents will need more primary and secondary school places; more GPs and dentists; leisure and shopping facilities; and new highways and more buses and trams to get them there.”\n“Oldham Council’s decision to close and not replace the Crompton Pool and Gym now looks a little short-sighted given the number of new young residents that will need to learn to swim and the number of adults that will want to keep fit.”\n“A local plan would not overload any one part of the Borough with excessive development. We can instead properly and fairly apportion new developments across the Borough and make our own plans to ensure the infrastructure needs of new residents are met in an effective and timely manner.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I know many Labour colleagues are uineasy about votes at 16 but it got through.\nLiberal Democrats want to build a fairer society, For a fairer society we need a fairer electoral system and that also means a more inclusive one\nIt has been Liberal Democrat policy for a lower voting age and indeed Lib Dem MP Steven Williams won his motion to parliament on this.\nThe problem is that many Tories are opposed to a change and many Labour MPs are undecided so it is right we keep up the pressure and aim to change opinions\nThe right to vote for 16 and 17 year olds is an important step in making Britain fairer .\nThe excellent video from Oldham very inspirationally highlight that they should be able to vote.\nThe level of maturity shown here and demonstrated by the Youth council give a clear indication that young people should not be patronized and have the opportunity to take part in the democratic process\nYoung people can already vote in many elections in the UK.\nThe Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey have already lowered their voting age. Scottish young people will have the chance to decide the future of their nation next year.\nThere is no electoral competency test at 18 so we should not apply this to 16 and 17 year olds too\nSeveral of the world’s largest democracies also give this right to their young people and it is right for Britain to become a fairer society that she does the same.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Conservative ministers claim it will eliminate ‘red tape’ but the Liberal Democrats fear that it abolish any meaningful involvement of local councils and residents in planning matters.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “I already have a lot of residents tell me of their frustrations that planning applications which should be classed as inappropriate development are now allowed under permitted development rights. Relaxing the regulations further will only have a negative impact on areas like Saddleworth”.\n“The National Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Wildlife Trusts have warned that wide-scale deregulation in planning which will lead to lower environmental standards.”\n“Meanwhile, Greater Manchester’s Labour Mayor is about to bring out a revised Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF).\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “As local people know only too well, Labour’s plan will cover vast tracts of green land in Saddleworth and elsewhere with houses and industry. Disregard for protected land has already been seen in Grotton, Crompton and Moorside recently. The government plan will make it much harder to resist. We need to pull out of the GMSF and adopt out own plans. I urge people to get involved when consultation starts”.\nIn order to fulfil housing targets previously developed land will need to be utilised further.\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said;\n“An example of the difficulties with building on previous developed land is Bailey Mill in Delph. I have pushed for Bailey Mill to be demolished and re-developed for many years and I know that the owners and local residents very much share my frustrations.\n“It is clearly cheaper to build on green space. The government promised Greater Manchester a pot of money to help build on previously developed land, and then broke that promise. My colleagues and I campaigned for the funding to be restored, and now finally the Government has reinstated a Brownfield Fund, but it will be distributed across the country. It is nowhere near enough, but the Liberal Democrats will nonetheless be fighting to get a share of this pot, and if we are successful I will certainly make the case for some of it to be spent in making Bailey Mill ready for development.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I initially had a meeting with United Utilities and Unity partnership (Oldham Council) officers in Dobcross relating to flooding issues and how a joint project could be put together to reduce the flood risk in the Saddleworth villages. Following further such meetings with Oldham council I feel that we are making progress on addressing some of the flooding issues\nYou will be aware that a joint project between the Environment Agency, United Utilities and Oldham council (via Unity Partnership) to address the issues of flooding and flooding risk along the River Tame and Diggle Brook. You will be aware that I arranged the first public consultation meeting for Thursday 20th June 2013 in Uppermill. This was to enable all partners to explain their role in the project and provide an opportunity for residents to ask questions and provide input into the in initial stages of the project. You will also be aware that a pre meeting was arranged for Tuesday 18th partners to discuss the public meeting.\nMany residents and businesses in Saddleworth have had first-hand experience of flooding and it’s effect in the last twelve months. As a result there is some anxiety. It can be difficult to know who to turn to for help. It is very positive that there is a joint partnership now to work together to find solutions. This joint working will increase the probability of success in bidding for funding to tackle the many issues. In order to be successful it is important that residents and business are able to feed in their local knowledge of the issues in order to provide a strong case.\nIt was therefore extremely disappointing that there was no representative from United Utilities at the pre-meeting or the public meeting. This compared to four from the Environment Agency, myself and two from Oldham Council. The non-attendance from United Utilities had a clear negative impact on the meeting and was in danger of overshadowing the positive progress that has been made.\nThe perception from some in the audience was that nothing had changed and there was an ineffective partnership. I do not subscribe to this view because I feel considerable progress has been made in a joint agenda to reduce the risk of flooding in Saddleworth.\nIn order to achieve the objectives I feel it is extremely important to take on the views of the local people because they have the examples that will strengthen the case. This project is a good news story and we need to work together to ensure that we achieve the desired outcome.\nI look forward to your response.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The physical closure will be between nos. 24 and 27, a distance of approximately 22 metres (24 yards).\nTraffic lights\nWith regards to using temporary traffic signals as opposed to a full road closure on Stoneswood Road, unfortunately this will not be possible. The narrowness of the road at the reconstruction location and the plant necessary to carry out the Works mean that a full road closure is necessary.

We were willing to join such a Government to make common cause in the interests of Britain with either of the two main.

Selling this land is a Government requirement for funding the new school.\nMick Scholes, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for Saddleworth South, said: “The public must be consulted now about future uses for this important site in the centre of Uppermill before the land is sold.

In 2015, Council passed a motion recognising that a disproportionate number of such claimants are being sanctioned through no fault of their own.”\n“As a result of a referral by MIND to the Greenwich Welfare Rights Service, I became aware of the work that had been done there to provide further safeguards to such vulnerable claimants, and I was keen to bring this model to Oldham.”\n“I am pleased to say that discussions between the Liberal Democrat team, officials of the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Head of the Council’s Welfare Rights Service have led to an agreement to establish a pilot project for claimants in receipt of the Employment Support Allowance (or ESA).”\n“It is my hope that this pilot will be successful and that as a result less ESA claimants will be sanctioned in Oldham. We should then look to offer the same safeguards to the claimants of other benefits who are vulnerable.”\nSeconding the motion, Councillor Julia Turner, said: “The safeguarding model established by our colleagues in Greenwich offers greater protection for vulnerable claimants and is one that we are keen to see adopted in Oldham. In particular in Greenwich, vulnerable claimants are encouraged to nominate a health or social worker to act on their behalf as an advocate or contact person with whom Job Centre staff will work before a sanction is considered.”\n“Our motion calls for this initiative to be actively promoted by the Council and for front-line staff in a range of agencies to receive training so that they understand how they can best support these clients. An initial training session has been organised by staff in the Liberal Democrat Office for such workers on the day of Council as we want to make sure the message goes out as quickly as possible.”\n“We are also calling for a Vulnerability Guide to be created as a ready source of information for these workers and for a liaison group to be established with representatives from all of the relevant agencies to ensure that the initiative works.”\nThe Liberal Democrat Office and the Manager of Oldham Council’s Welfare Rights Service have been working together to replicate in Oldham safeguards introduced by the Royal Greenwich Welfare Rights Service.\nCounillor Garth Harkness said “Training will be provided to front-line workers and volunteers to ensure that they can support vulnerable claimants in completing and registering the paperwork.

Lib Dem Baroness Manzoor proposed that the Lords refuse to ratify the cuts as the law requires; this would have killed the cuts stone dead.\nIn contrast, the Lib Dems graciously supported a Labour proposal to delay the introduction of the cuts until further safeguards have been established for those 3 million households who are affected.\nWe hope that these safeguards will include the immediate introduction of an enhanced national living wage and increases to the thresholds at which income tax and national insurance have to be paid.\nThese measures would ensure that low-paid workers will be better off in their pockets and oblige employers to pay a decent wage instead of relying on Government subsidies to disguise their parsimony.\nThe Liberal Democrats will continue to do all we can to stop tax credit cuts that disproportionately hurt low-earning families, and urge others of whatever party persuasion with a genuine interest in the welfare of the working poor to do the same.\nLeave a Reply",

What a silly generalisation that as Lib Dems we will not agree with. He wants to cap child benefit at 2 children and stopping housing benefit for the under 25s. This has NOT been agreed by this government and is not part of the coalition government so it should be made very clear by him that this is the case and this will happen if the TORIES WIN the next election.\nWe should be starting at the top and working down not picking on the vulnerable.\nI recently put a motion to council on Under 25 housing benefit. The reply to the council from Lord Freud on Housing Benefits for Under 25s ignores the request for reassurances that proposals to cut housing benefit for the under 25s will not be implemented. The fact that it is completely ignored may be because it HAS NOT been agreed.\nLiberal Democrats want to start at the top and work down when it comes to making savings as a country and that the Lib Dem Steve Webb MP has said\n“Nothing has been agreed within government on the detail of any further changes; these are the kind of things that we will thrash out within government in the months ahead.” The Liberal Democrats have not signed up to £10bn of cuts in the welfare budget that the Tories want to slash in 2016\nIt is particularly difficult for young people to get a job and creating anxiety by suggesting there will not be support for shelter is morally wrong. Cuts need to be made but the vulnerable need to be protected and that is what my colleagues and I will fight to do.\nLeave a Reply",

The Oldham Chronicle has reported this evening the several other options put forward many by your Lib Dem ward colleagues over previous months. Prior to this the Liberal Democrats wanted it to be built on the site in Greenfield but the Labour controlled administration decided that Tesco would be built there. My view is that I want a new school and if it was possible to build on the existing site, within the budget and the school are satisfied that education will not be jeopardised then that is fine but if it is a straight choice of no school or a school in Diggle then I support the latter.\nThe existing site was previously rejected under previous schemes and again under this scheme as not financially viable. The recent option to build on the existing site is again being considered by Oldham council and the EFA. The Chair of governors announced on Monday night that there seemed be considerable financial obstacles of the new existing site proposal, we await further details, but the prospect of building on the existing site are becoming unlikely.\nThe contractor now appointed is Interserve and we understand that they should be in a position to engage fully with the School and Council by January 2014. In preparation and responding to the feedback received at the public meetings, the School have arranged a series of ‘Technical Group’ meetings.\nIt is clear that a key area of concern for local residents is the pedestrian safety, highway and accessibility issues that could be exacerbated by the development of a new School. Officers have therefore already met with highway colleagues from the Council and Unity Partnership in order to look at options in which these issues can be removed or alleviated.\nOne option is for the Council to introduce parking restrictions on the section of carriageway fronting 20-44 (even) Huddersfield Road. In doing this, the Council would look to provide replacement residents car parking and, on this basis.\nThe council should be sending letters to the residents on Huddersfield Road and seek comments\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

So it will see lots more development, without the infrastructure, lack of affordable housing, loss of play areas or community facilities, loss of trees, loss of open space, traffic chaos and huge impacts on local residents.\nWe will see lowering of environmental standards and that is why there is opposition to this from the National Trust , RSPB and Wildlife TrustsThe presumption from the Conservative government is that the planning system is halting development.\nThis is not true and this motion addresses this fact. The planning system is flawed and an opportunity could have been to reform with a more localised approach, exploring affordable housing, social renting and green development.

On entering government, we set ourselves an ambitious target of delivering 2 million apprenticeships by the end of this Parliament and these latest figures show that we are well on course to meet that.\nMore importantly the numbers of young people in Oldham starting an apprenticeship have grown consistently ever since this coalition government took power. In the last year of the outgoing Labour Government, less than 1,500 young people entered an apprenticeship; this figure has now risen to over 2,500 a year”.\nCommenting, Liberal Democrat Business Spokesperson Gordon Birtwistle MP (MP for Burnley) – who started his career as a craft engineering apprentice – said:\nLeave a comment“All young people should have an opportunity to get on in life and apprenticeships are a great way to deliver that.

The North West England Region will lose seven constituencies.\nThe Commissioners first shot at redrawing the patchwork means almost every constituency has been changed, none more than our own. Oldham East and Saddleworth no longer, they propose that Saddleworth should be combined with central Oldham.\nA big change from the old Colne Valley constituency, linking Slaithwaite and Marsden to Saddleworth for 100 years, or the short lived Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency. This latest reconfiguration will mean rural Saddleworth will always have its MP elected by votes cast in some of the most urbanised wards in the country.\nIf no one comes up with a better solution this is how it will be at the next General Election.\nThe Commissioners are coming to Manchester on the 11-12th October to hear alternative suggestions, which can come from councils, local groups or individuals. The whole of the North West Region is being looked at, but Saddleworth suffers by being on the border with the Yorkshire and Humber region. They are very reluctant to see a new constituency straddling the regional boundary, so the options are severely limited. Moving just one ward from one constituency to another, so they both fall within the upper and lower limits for numbers of electors, can cause a ripple effect across a number of constituencies, which then have also to be adjusted.\nThe alternative set of revised constituencies now being put forward by Saddleworth Parish Council will place Saddleworth at the centre of a new rural ‘South Pennines’ constituency, consisting of small towns and villages nestling in the folds of the Pennines. We want our MP to concentrate on our problems, not be swamped by the quite different needs of the wards clustered round Oldham town centre.\nWe believe that our alternative proposals will also give a better result than the Commissioners original suggestions for the rest of Oldham Metropolitan Borough. Under their scheme, the other parts of the borough would become minor parts of new constituencies centred on Ashton, Middleton and Rochdale.\nAll the constituencies shown on our alternative map meet the criteria set by the Commissioners, and no further constituencies are affected by the creation of this new South Pennine constituency.\nAnd we know that boundary commissioners do listen! Some years ago, Saddleworth White Rose Society’s suggestions regarding local ward boundaries in Saddleworth were accepted.\nWe will be presenting our case at the Manchester meeting with the full version containing more detail going on to the Commissioners for their consideration.\nOnce this round of consultations ends in December 2011, the Commissioners will put out a revised constituency map for the North West and invite further comments before they make their final recommendations to Parliament in October 2012.\nPolitical party considerations have not influenced the way these alternative new constituencies have been constructed. It is not possible to forecast which party would win a General Election in the proposed South Pennines constituency.\nMy Comments:\nThe Commissioners are coming to Manchester on the 11-12th October to hear alternative suggestions, which can come from councils, local groups or individuals. The whole of the North West Region is being looked at, Others can go and voice thier opinions at the event too.

The recent lockdown measures have again shown how vital it is for everyone to have local green spaces, and the benefits these places have on mental and physical health. Whether a local park, playing field, the open countryside, or just a little corner of greenery, access and enjoyment is important to all, especially those in poorer households and areas, who usually have less green space nearby – some of the people we must protect the most.\nLiberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness said:\n“I am very pleased that my campaigning with local people to restore the bridges around Diggle, Dobcross and Uppermill has worked, and we will soon be able to return to what have been very popular routes around our villages. What could be better than walking – for our health and for the environment?”\n“The recent removal of a bridge carrying the bridleway over Church Road in Uppermill is something we shall be keeping our eye on,” said local campaigner Mick Scholes. “We understand money is very tight, and the council is quite rightly looking for outside funding to help, but one of the other local paths between Spring St and Bridge St was closed several years ago, and locals are still campaigning for it to be re-opened – we need to keep these issue alive to see progress.”\nParish and Borough Councillor Sam Al-Hamdani added:\n“The fight to keep Thornley Brook & Ashbrook Valley as a local green space for the benefit for all goes on, and now even more of the open space in Springhead and Grotton is threatened by the proposed development at Stonebreaks. The community has come together to fight these applications, and I have been proud to do whatever I can to support them.\n“The Knowls Lane planning meeting was a shambles, and it is unsurprising to see that a judicial review has been granted for next month. The works of residents in establishing the Ancient Woodland on the Knowls Lane site will hopefully help make the difference.”\n“Fundraising for the cost of the lawyers the community needs to fight the developers is ongoing, and all donations are welcome via the website www.crowdjustice.com/case/save-our-valleys/” said Sam.\nAnd all three Liberal Democrats voiced concern over the idea of closing Dovestone. The recent one-off “spike” in visitor numbers due to the relaxing of lockdown measures should not result in a knee-jerk reaction that is to the detriment of all.\n“In April last year I called for enforcement and hefty £1000 fines for BBQs and this was shortly followed by support from Saddleworth Parish Council and councillors with a call to action. Whilst I would like to see penalties being more than the current £100 I was very pleased for Saddleworth when the Public Spaces Prevention Order that I had asked for was created for Dovestone, but it needs enforcing, and that is the key to keeping the area open to all. We need a police presence on sunny summer days to boost the much-appreciated volunteer effort.” said Garth Harkness.\nMick Scholes added:\n“I have been dealing, face-to-face, with anti-social behaviour at Dovestone for years, and it is a very small minority who cause trouble – and the anti-social behaviour comes from across the spectrum of society. Those who suggest that somehow it is ‘outsiders’ coming into the area that are the root of the problem, or that trouble is only caused by young people do not know what they are talking about. Some of the worst abuse I have experienced is from middle-aged men from Saddleworth who don’t accept that the rules apply to them.”\nLeave a comment“The problems at Dovestone are not a recent thing, and I understand people’s concerns,” said Councillor Al-Hamdani. “We have the tools in place to make progress, and we want to keep the area open. To help that, we need to ensure that the rules are applied fairly, and to everyone. Recent events should not be an excuse for closing a much-used local area, an action that would have a disproportionate effect on those in poorer areas and for households who don’t have access to their own garden. These people need a green space, and we must do what needs to be done to deliver that.”\nLeave a Reply",

In the UK, however, due to Ed Balls and his Labour colleagues we are in a worse situation than many other countries. The economic mismanagement through lack of bank regulation, a system where millionaires and top earners paid less tax than they do now led to a situation where as former Labour minister Liam Byrne, put it “Sorry bu there’s no money left”. This financialmismanagement was left with the Liberal Democrats to clear up.\nFor three years now Ed Balls and Labour have talked down the economy, opposing every cut made by the Coalition to put public finances back into proper order, and have offered no alternatives. Tellingly they will not commit to reversing any cuts. Bankrupt of ideas and presenting no alternatives, that’s New Labour. The only policy we’ve heard from them is the mansion tax- ohand that’s a Lib Dem one. They won’t even say that they would commit to that in a manifesto.\nNow we have seen unemployment fall recently and a growth of the economy by 0.6% for two quarters now so we are slowly moving along the right path. So it is looking like Ed Balls is wrong. The Liberal Democrats have helped deliver a million private sector jobs andmore apprenticeships than ever before. To make sure he stays wrong we now need to deliver a million more jobs and apprenticeships to ensure we have a stronger economy. We need more apprenticeships for young people and more investment in manufacturing to give everyone a fair chance to get on. At least locally Labour and the Liberal Democrats are trying to get Oldham working- nationally from Labour we hear nothing.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Eon is the contractor and whilst there is supposed to be consultation about the design and siting of street lamps in conservation areas, elsewhere they are marching ahead plonking new ones just where they want them.\nIts quite crazy. As each street is dealt with, local councillors are getting complaints. Lamps put in front of windows or gardens when the old ones were on the boundaries between houses, lamps put in cockeyed, local power and telephone cables cut, abuse to locals who remonstrate.\n‘We are arguing fiercely with Eon who say they do not need to consult with elected councillors – we shall see’, says Cllr Derek Heffernan.\nWhen householders point out that there are lots of cables and ducts where they are starting to dig, they are ignored – until proved right!\n‘We have discovered that a large number of metal lampposts installed in Saddleworth villages less than two years ago are being replaced and scrapped. They had a 25 year life expectancy and Eon tell us they will not be selling them on!’ says Cllr Alan Roughley. ‘This is a scandalous waste of taxpayers money. The new ones, which look very similar, are expected to last 50 years. How daft can you get? Who can say what lighting technology there will be in 10 years from now, let alone 50, or if there will be street lighting at all in rural areas?’\n‘We have told Eon that they must improve and consult with locals, who are rightly concerned about these changes. We intend calling public meetings in various villages to agree the design and siting of street lamps in conservation areas. In the meantime please call us with any problems you are having,’ comments Cllr Garth Harkness.\nAll householders are supposed to receive a letter from Eon before work begins in their area. It doesn’t say much and you need to look out for yellow circles spray painted onto the footpath to find out where they are due to be sited. ‘Far better to argue first than have to try and get newly installed ones moved afterwards,’ says Cllr Roughley.\n2 Comments\nOn Wall Hill Road Dobcross EOn just turned up one day last week and did exactly what you said put a new lamp in front of someone’s window. I do not want this to happen to our house but we were not in when they came and there are no yellow marks as to where the next ones are going. We live in Semi detached houses so it makes sense to put them in front of the gap of the houses(as they are currently) so as not to spoil the view or have a light directly in front of your bedroom window. How can we find out what they intend to do I can’t be all the time.\nCan you let me know outside which house. It is not on I think they need another telling off.

We are the only party who want the people to decide on the terms of Brexit in a second referendum rather than giving the government a blank cheque to walk off a cliff. “\n“Locally, Labour have let people down by agreeing to stay in the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework rather than agreeing to the Lib Dem proposal to withdraw and produce our own local plan which looks at developed land, buildings which could be converted, stockpiles of land with planning permission and long-term empty houses and not concreting over our greenbelt and green spaces”\nHe ended by saying “Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour nationally have been too busy fighting among themselves and are not any sort of opposition to the Tories. Mental health services are in crisis and the Tory ministers seek to humiliate suffers in work capability assessments. The A&E’s are overstretched, teachers are being sacked and the environment is ignored.

He said: “I am keen to see that every child in Oldham and Saddleworth able to access a breakfast at school. The Lib Dems would welcome the opportunity to work with the Administration to extend breakfast club provision, initially targeting those schools with the highest proportion of children from poorer households.\n“Tory welfare cuts and cuts to tax credits will make our borough’s poorer families poorer yet. We already have children from poor families coming to school hungry and this situation will only get worse.\n“Council has just supported a proposal from the Oldham Liberal Democrats that the Government expand school meals provision so all primary pupils able to access a free hot lunch, but if a child comes to school hungry then they will be pre-occupied with a rumbling belly and their behaviour and performance will be impaired from the very start of the school day.\n“Breakfast clubs where children can get a free breakfast, or one for a nominal fee, is an excellent way to ensure that our most disadvantaged pupils can be suitably fuelled for a positive day’s learning, as well as providing a positive opportunity for children from all backgrounds to sit down together and socialise”.\n“I am proud that the Liberal Democrats in Government introduced a pupil premium to help schools support the most disadvantaged children, as well as free school meals for all infant children. We are now committed as a party to expanding the provision of free school meals so that all primary school pupils are entitled to one”.\nCllr Harkness feels that a survey is needed to identify where breakfast clubs exist. He added: “Before we look to establish more clubs, we first need a clear picture of existing provision. We have identified four new clubs from a survey that we have recently conducted ourselves, and I have shared this information, but an ‘official’ survey conducted by the Council would help to establish the true picture.\n“I will welcome the opportunity to meet with Cllr Akhtar once the results are in to discuss the findings and to find a way forward”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

He has frequently raised child hunger with the Council. Being employed at a Manchester school, Councillor Harkness is well-aware of the adverse impact that hunger can have on a child’s educational performance.\nCommenting Councillor Harkness said: “When many people think of top-flight footballers, they think of individuals who are over-paid and self-absorbed. Marcus Rashford has proven that footballers can also care about others, and whilst there may have been a hiatus of play on the pitch during the Covid-19 pandemic, he has been playing away in a different arena, quietly but forcefully, to ensure that every child who is hungry gets fed. It is largely down to him that the Conservative Government was embarrassed into a U-turn to provide school meals for pupils, and his MBE is richly-deserved for those efforts.”\nMr Rashford has recently called on the Government to immediately fund three recommendations from the National Food Strategy during and after the pandemic.\nCrompton Councillor Louie Hamblett is backing his Liberal Democrat colleague: “Whatever football team you support, it still feels the same when you are hungry. We would like Councillors from all parties, whatever colour rosette they may wear at election time, to back our motion which calls on the Tory Government to find this funding and to find it now. Quite simply, the Oldham Liberal Democrats believe that it is truly shameful that in one of the world’s most advanced economies, two decades into the twenty-first century, children still go hungry in the UK.”\nThe next meeting of Oldham Council will be online from 6pm on Wednesday November 4.\nThe wording of the motion follows.\nCouncil November 4, 2020 – Notice of Opposition Business –\nMotion 3 – Time to tackle child food poverty\nThis Council:\n· Believes that, in one of the world’s most advanced economies, it is shameful that two decades into the twenty-first century, children still go hungry in the UK.\n· Is committed to ensuring that reducing child food poverty in our Borough remains one of our top priorities and commends organisations in this Borough which are working to do so.\n· Also commends the initiative of Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford who has successfully campaigned on school holiday hunger and has recently formed a taskforce with some of the UK’s leading food retailers and charities to help reduce child food poverty.\n· Notes that this taskforce has called upon the government to fund three policy recommendations from the National Food Strategy, an independent review of UK food policy, as soon as possible:\nCouncil concurs with the conclusion of the taskforce in calling upon the government to immediately fund these recommendations.\nCouncil feels that if the Prime Minister wishes to be believed when he talks of ‘building (Britain) back better’ then he must address child food poverty as a top priority; for how can Britain be better when our nation’s children continue to go hungry?\nCouncil resolves to ask the Chief Executive to write to:\nProposed by Councillor Garth Harkness\nSeconded by Councillor Louie Hamblett\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Only last year, Nick Clegg announced that Greater Manchester received one of the largest shares of £5.9 million to fund over 2,500 young people back into work”.\nThe wage incentive element of the scheme sees up to £2,275 has been paid to employers for taking on people aged 18-24 who have been claiming Job Seeking Allowance for more than six months.\nHowever take up of this particular incentive has been low;\nCllr Harkness explained why:\n“This was in part because there was seen to be too much bureaucracy for small companies to cope with. More to the point, I am pleased to say that the huge decline in youth unemployment, particularly marked in Oldham, has meant less young jobseekers have need of this support”.\nCllr Akhtar recently asserted that the wage incentive element had been suddenly withdrawn, necessitating funding to be made available by the Council to support trainees with the Council.\nCllr Harkness sought to put the record straight:\n“The wage incentive element has not been ended. It will run until the end of the current financial year. It was always intended to be a temporary measure available for three years during the lifetime of this Government.\n“The Government has simply brought the cut-off date for new starters forward by one month to August from September. It is much better to focus on extra Job Seeker support and apprentices through grants which are proving much more effective. “\n”.Cllr Harkness described Labour tactics as ‘diversionary spin’\n: “In July 2013, Cabinet agreed to create 150 traineeships with the authority – this was over a year after the wage incentive scheme had been introduced. By the August cut-off date, only 54 had completed or enrolled\n“The fact that Cllr Akhtar and his Labour colleagues were unaware of the cut-off date also indicates that they were ignorant of the time scale of the scheme”.\nCllr Harkness was however supportive of the Cabinet in one of its actions:\n“The traineeship programme was based on securing funding from three sources – £300K from Council, £341K from Government and £225K from the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA).\n“It is interesting that Labour has been keen to blame the Government for a shortfall of funding, but have not laid equal blame on Labour colleagues in AGMA for doing the same.\n“Belatedly, the Cabinet has started to lobby their Labour colleagues for more cash to secure the unspent monies allocated to other authorities. I support and welcome their efforts, but feel that they should have been lobbying their Labour colleagues far harder and sooner to secure more cash”.\nCllr Harkness ended:\n“Whatever the shortcomings of this element of the scheme, this Council has nonetheless managed to draw down £123K in wage subsidies from this Government.\n“Once more Labour shows its breath-taking hypocrisy in criticising the youth contract all the way along, yet they are happy to take the money and then take credit.\n“We are committed to ensuring that young people have the best possible start in life that is why we have insisted on a pupil premium to help the most vulnerable whilst at school and support them into work afterwards.\nLiberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable launched a new campaign to encourage more young people to take up apprenticeships. The “Get In, Go Far” campaign is being supported by a number of employers across the country and coincides with the introduction of 40 new employer-designed apprenticeships in sectors including engineering, hospitality and the legal profession. I am delighted that the Liberal Democrats continue both locally and nationally to build a stronger economy enabling people to prosper with.\nGiven Labour’s stated intention to abolish benefits for under-25s if they take national office, I have my doubts as to whether any similar support would be available under their stewardship”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is the sort of action you would expect in one party states like North Korea not in English local government\nProposals mean in effect that almost all of the time slot will be monopolised by Labour members\nThe Leader of the Opposition and of the Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council, Councillor Howard Sykes MBE, has attacked the Labour Administration for its proposals to radically alter the Council’s constitution to stifle debate in the Council Chamber.\nIn the proposals to Wednesday’s Annual Council meeting, Labour want to reduce the number of Council meetings in the year at which questions and motions can be tabled by one and to then further reduce the number of questions that members of the opposition parties can ask.\nCommenting Cllr Sykes said: “These proposals are not good for local democracy in Oldham.”\n“In seeking to reduce the number of opportunities where members of the opposition can question the actions of Labour Cabinet members, the public will be left with the impression that Labour is scared of debate and they will ask why?”\n“Perhaps Labour Cabinet members doubt their ability to respond effectively to questions from the floor of the Chamber, or perhaps they have something to hide, but there is no question that given their numbers (45 out of 60) it is always their will as the current majority party that shall prevail.”\n“Surely in a vibrant and healthy democracy, we should be encouraging members of the opposition to have their say in the Chamber and they should have the right to expect proper, considered answers to their questions from the Leader and Cabinet members.”\nUnder the proposals, Cllr Sykes as Main Opposition Leader will see the number of questions that he can ask the Council Leader fall from three to two at each Council, a 33% reduction. Also both the Conservative and UKiP group lose their right to ask a question and theory have to ‘share the right’ to ask one question between them.\n“With such a large majority and control of the Council agenda why reduce the amount the current pitiful time allowed to the opposition even further,” stated Cllr Sykes. “This is the sort of action you would expect in one party states like North Korea not in English local government.”\nCllr Sykes added: “This time slot is time well spent. In the past, there has been significant accord on many issues between myself and the Council Leader Cllr McMahon and in recent Councils, I have raised a number of innovative proposals that the Administration is now investigating, such as establishing a Community Shop to help low-income households source high quality food at low prices, alongside help to find employment, to exploring the geothermic power beneath our feet as a renewable energy source.”\n“The problem I encounter in the run up to each Council is not finding three good-quality questions to ask the Leader, but making a choice of which three of the many sensible and considered questions I have to hand to take into the Chamber.”\nLabour’s other proposal to take other questions on a “politically balanced basis” also do not sit well with Cllr Sykes.\nHe said: “Labour backbenchers have exclusive access to their own Cabinet members in internal group meetings or in their Cabinet Office. Councillors from other parties have neither. The Council Chamber often still remains the best and only place for opposition members to raise issues that are of concern to their constituents, particularly where previous attempts to engage officers or Cabinet members have met with little or no response.”\n“These proposals mean in effect that almost all of the time slot will be monopolised by Labour members with at most one, or perhaps two, questions available to members of the opposition. For the smaller groups on the Council, Conservative (2), UKiP (2) and Independent (1) this means they will be lucky if they ever get to ask a question. Previously ward questions were taken on an alternating basis and this was a sensible arrangement.”\nCllr Sykes stressed that his viewpoint was not just driven by expediency:\n“As a Liberal Democrat, I strongly believe that it is important for all democratically elected representatives to have the opportunity to raise issues in the Council Chamber. I feel particularly sorry that the Conservatives and UKIP as minor opposition parties are being even more short-changed by these proposals”.\nCllr Sykes has tabled amendments to the proposals to retain the existing arrangements.\n1 Comment\nPrevent spending money on tree treatment if the tree is\nin a disorder where it might proceed to stay without the threat.",

The Liberal Democrats have always unanimously supported a new school wherever the Education Funding Agency saw was appropriate.\nOur priority has always been to ensure that we get a new secondary school in Saddleworth and have always worked constructively with the council and other partners to achieve this. Sadly a small group have been stalling this process for over six years and we now have a generation who have missed out on a new school.\nWe do not want to see the worst case scenario as stated on the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) of the Diggle site occupied by a large number of houses funding being pulled away from the highways and us eventually having no secondary school in Saddleworth.\nWe believe we need to be open and transparent to get the best outcome for our young people.

Government already has a definition of fuel poverty, and we believe that this should be possible for food poverty. By establishing a definition, it will be possible to monitor it and establish progress in eliminating it;\n· Reduce poverty by enhancing the national minimum wage and by reducing the burden of taxation on low-income working families, to speed up payments made to claimants, and to ensure that benefits are sufficient to provide them with an adequate and nutritious diet;\n· Safeguard programmes such as Healthy Start Vouchers, Free School Meals and Meals on Wheels and to extend these to reach all who are eligible;\n· Support the establishment of breakfast clubs in all schools where there is a need;\n· Support school holiday food provision in deprived communities to combat the increasing occurrence of hunger amongst poor families when free school meals are unavailable;\n· Increase the amount of surplus food redistributed through Fare Share and similar organisations to support the commendable efforts of local food banks and other community-based food agencies providing food parcels or hot meals to those in need. At present 98% of this food goes to landfill or is burned.\n· Establish one of twelve pilot projects proposed by the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Food in Oldham. These pilots would draw together private, voluntary and public expertise to test the ‘Feeding Britain’ approach identified by the inquiry. Oldham has several extremely deprived electoral wards that would benefit from being a pilot area.\nFood poverty is an important issue for Oldham’s Liberal Democrats. As the Councillors stated to the Prime Minister “if you commit your Government to take the action that we outline in this letter that we will do all that we can to support you in making food poverty in Britain a thing of the past”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The idea they need us more is not true as only around 10% of their total trade comes to us.\nThe European Union is not perfect, then Whitehall isn’t, the council isn’t. You can’t change things sat on the side-lines. Of course we would negotiate trade agreements eventually but we would likely be bound by many of the terms but have less influence.

The proposals for the Parish Council to take a lead in improving winter gritting is a good cross-party initiative. There have already been some positive meetings with Oldham Council and hopefully the Borough will provide some extra resources to enable the Parish Council to improve snow clearance and gritting across the District.\nOn the other hand, something that has annoyed me is an example where Ken Hulme has decided that he will boycott all official channels in a self-publicity exercise. It is disappointing that the Borough Council and MP are endorsing a Ken Hulme appointed transport group that has shunned a dialogue with borough councillors,parish councillors and the Saddleworth & Lees District Partnership. This is duplicating work for officers and is a waste of time. When I asked our MP to clarify I received a reply from the “Independent” Ken Hulme and not her. This is not what I expect from our MP\nAs Vice Chairman of the Parish Council, Ken Hulme, could have voiced his traffic concerns at the joint sub-committee of the District Partnership set up to address traffic issue in Saddleworth. This has officers and residents in attendance as well as locally elected members of the Borough and Parish Councils. He has never attended these meeting nor addressed any concerns there about traffic he may have.\nMost of us are trying to work together on the Parish for the good of the District, as the recent winter gritting and boundary initiatives demonstrate. If he truly wants to improve traffic issues in Saddleworth and effect change, rather than pursue a self promoting ego trip, he should address his concerns through the channels specificallyset up to address these issues. Sadly, it seems that only meetings with press coverage are important to him. This is another example of Ken creating smoke, but not actually changing anything. He has been wasting the time of Delph residents for two years calling local meetings and achieving nothing. He would achieve a lot more if he started working with his colleagues as a member of a team and doing things the democratic way rather than the way that achieves maximum publicity for himself.\nHe wants more bollards, yellow lines and a 24/7 20 mph speed limit complete with road humps and more signage. When this was first suggested we asked the people of Saddleworth what they wanted. A questionnaire was sent out by the Parish Council to all the 20,000+ houses in Saddleworth asking their views on a number of topical issues. There was an overwhelming response – 71% favoured a 20 mph speed limit during school hours only and 82% favoured the use of flashing warning lights to enforce this. This is what was delivered and what the people of Delph overwhelmingly endorsed when the proposed scheme was displayed for consultation. But Ken doesn’t take no for an answer he still wants speed humps and a 20mph speed limit even when the school is closed. What’s more Ken now wants a 20mph speed limit in the centre of Delph, a street where it is rarely possibly to drive through without giving way to oncoming traffic.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is estimated that this ruling alone could free up to 125,000 employees to seek work with other employers”.\nBusinesses and trades unions will also draw up a code of fair practice and employees will also be given more information about their rights.\nCllr Harkness commented:\nLeave a comment“The changes follow from a public consultation that the Business Secretary conducted early this year.\nCouncillors had the opportunity to submit their own recommendations to the consultation after my colleague, the Leader of the Opposition, Cllr Howard Sykes, suggested at the February Council meeting that a special session be convened for this purpose.\nThe cross-party panel strongly supported a change to abolish ‘exclusivity clauses’, to create a fair code of practice and to make employees more aware of their rights, so it is especially pleasing that the Government has taken these recommendations on board – which shows that they were listening”.\nLeave a Reply",

By way of example, research conducted by Action on Smoking and Health and Cancer Research UK shows that, following reductions to the Public Health Grant in 2015, 2016, and 2017, stop smoking services were cut in 39%, 59% and 50% of local authorities respectively year-on-year. Now, 4 in 10 local authorities are not able to offer a stop smoking service for all smokers in their area.\nCommenting Councillor Gloster said: “Oldham is a borough with a high incidence of poor health. Many of our residents suffer from long-term health conditions and many others are at risk of developing such diseases as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, diabetes, CPD and cancer, often because of a poor diet or poor life style choices. Taking funds away from prevention services that prevent ill health is a false economy. Smoking, obesity and alcohol account for 80,000, 30,000 and 7,000 early deaths each year respectively; and smoking remains the single biggest cause of preventable cancer.”\nThe Liberal Democrats want to see increased and sustained Government funding for public health to address health inequalities in deprived boroughs like Oldham, but the present Government is instead proposing to cut existing funding and make Councils rely on business rates\nCouncillor Gloster added: “The Government is looking to phase out the Public Health Grant by 2020/21 and to replace this with funding via business rates retention. This might work in a local authority area with low rates of long-term ill-health and a very vibrant local economy, but in an economically-deprived borough like Oldham it is unlikely to stack up and this will mean that poorly people will suffer as they will no longer have access to the vital health services that they need. We want to see Oldham Council support the Cancer Research UK campaign for the Public Health Grant to be restored.”\nCouncillor Harkness said\n“Replacing a grant with business rates retention means that areas of most need , like Oldham are disproportionately affected. We will not raise enough in business rates to compensate. We all know that in Health and Social care is early help . I’ve mentioned in this chamber before about mental health for example and the consequences of ignoring the early cases and by only dealing with issues when they become high level is far more costly when the issues may ve been tackled earlier , in the community and cheaper .The same applies to all public health “\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

A new station in Diggle would be a welcome boost for residents and especially for commuters, not just from Diggle, but also from Dobcross, Delph and Denshaw as well as from parts of Uppermill to Huddersfield and Leeds as well as to Manchester.

The awareness event is happening from\nMonday 11th November – Friday 15th November 2019.\nOldham\nBorough Liberal Democrats are seeking to refresh the Council’s anti bullying policy\nand raise awareness at the 6th November 2019 Full Council\nMeeting.\nPeople\nof all ages are bullied because of their race, culture, faith, appearance, sex\nand identity. Councillor Garth Harkness,\nwho is also a teacher, says this bullying can take place in person but often\nhappens online. He wants to focus on the\nroot problem in local schools and at the Council itself.\nCouncillor Harkness states: “Bullying infiltrates every level of society. Even in government. This Council needs to communicate with schools in Oldham Borough about the packs released to schools for anti-bullying week.”\n“These will include lesson plans, and cross curricular activities for students and teachers. This will go a long way in raising awareness and dealing with the issue in schools”\nCouncillor\nLouie Hamblett who is seconding the motion is also calling for Anti-Bullying\ntraining for Councillors and Council staff.\nCouncillor Hamblett says “Oldham Council needs to adopt the Anti-Bullying Alliance’s definition of bullying. Oldham Council staff should be encouraged to undertake the Anti-Bullying Alliance’s online training module, so they can feel more confident in identifying and calling out or reporting bullying behaviour.”\nCopy of Motion:\n– Anti-Bullying Week 2019 “Change starts with us”\nThis year’s\nAnti-Bullying Week has the theme “Change Starts With Us” and is happening from\nMonday 11th November – Friday 15th November 2019.\nThis Council\nunfortunately notes that:\nTrades Union Congress (TUC) research revealed nearly\na third of people have been bullied at their workplace. Of those bullied,\nhalf said it had an adverse impact on their performance at work.\nFemale employees are more likely to be victims of\nbullying than males.\nPeople of all ages are bullied because of their race,\nculture, faith, appearance, identity, socioeconomic status,\ninterests/hobbies, academic ability, mannerisms, and whether they are\nyoung carers or looked after children. This bullying can take place in\nperson or online.\nNearly half of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans young\npeople have been bullied at school for being LGBTQIA+. Children with disabilities and those\nwith special educational needs are around twice as likely to be bullied.\nBullying pervades every level of human society, even\nthe Houses of Commons. Dame Laura Cox’s report into the Bullying and\nHarassment of House of Commons staff in 2018 revealed a dysfunctional\nworkplace- particularly faced by women.\nBullying and sexual harassment was reported to have long been\n“tolerated and concealed”.\nSometimes this bullying takes place in the home and\nserves as domestic abuse and violence.\nThis Council\nresolves to:\nHave the relevant cabinet\nmember communicate with schools in Oldham Borough about the packs released\nespecially for primary and secondary schools from the Anti Bullying Alliance. These will include\nlesson plans, activity ideas, cross curricular activities for students and\nteachers.\nAllow people to access a link to the Anti Bullying\nAlliance website from the Council web page that gives bullying support and\nadvice.\nHave Oldham Council sign up as a supporter of\nAnti-Bullying Week\nBuild on the #Stop work done by Oldham Youth Council\nin 2016 on highlighting that bullying is not ok.\nTo join the UK-wide Anti-Bullying Alliance, which\nalready comprises over 140 organisations and individuals.\nDevelop an anti-bullying training programme for\ncouncillors and review the current Council anti bullying policy.\nTo adopt the Anti-Bullying Alliance’s definition of\nbullying. And that Oldham Council staff are encouraged to undertake the\nAnti-Bullying Alliance’s online training module, so they can feel more\nconfident in identifying and calling out or reporting bullying behaviour.\nTo deal with workplace bullying more effectively, the\nCouncil will provide a link to the\nAdvisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) on the Council\nAnti-Bullying policy webpage.\nLeave a Reply",

This is instead an about turn in totally the wrong direction. For some poorer pupils, a lunchtime meal can be their only hot meal of the day, and children with empty bellies simply cannot learn.”\nLiberal Democrat Lord Storey asked a question on this matter in the House of Lords on behalf of Cllr Harkness.\nCllr Harkness added: “I am grateful to my party colleague for his intervention as it was only through this that we have identified that six schools in our borough will lose this money.

Mental illness affects one in three people at some point in their lives, and yet it is not often talked about or is stigmatised or ridiculed.”\n“I give credit to my Liberal Democrat colleague, Norman Lamb MP, who did a great job as health minister in the Coalition Government to provide greater investment for mental health services and to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who in recent months have gone to great lengths to meet with Britons with these conditions and to champion the need to provide them with greater understanding and support.”\n“Young people, particularly adolescents, are often faced with situations of great stress, such as when they encounter bullying at school or on-line or are facing all-important examinations, and for some the stress is simply too much leading a minority to self-harm, resort to drugs or alcohol misuse, or even contemplate suicide. This investment at Saddleworth School will enable MIND to provide resilience courses and extra support to young people to help bring down the barriers, develop understanding and support them through troubled times.”\nCouncillor Harkness has also accepted an invitation to become involved with the work of a new Whole School and College Approach Council steering group. He added:\n“We need to look holistically at how we can provide comparable support for young people in distress in each of our borough’s schools, and I would like also particularly to look to meet the needs of those young people who, alongside study, provide care for other members of their family. I have raised the needs of young carers before in full Council, and I will continue to champion their cause.”\nThe Liberal Democrat campaign for better mental health services is not limited to young people of school age.\nCouncillor Harkness said:\nLeave a comment“There is also a great issue with young people with mental health conditions making the transition from school and college into adulthood and when adults with these conditions seek employment. There is clear evidence that prejudice and misunderstanding from society towards them can continue when they are adults and some employers discriminate against them when they are recruiting.”\n“So I am campaigning with MIND to establish a new Training Academy, staffed by MIND, for the borough where such individuals would be able to access training courses and therapeutic services to help them cope better with a mental health condition and to prepare for employment.”\n“I have previously written to my Labour counterpart, Councillor Jenny Harrison, asking for her support to establish a new academy in a town centre building, and I am now working with Council officers and with MIND to bring this about.”\nLeave a Reply",

For 2013/14, the Premium will be worth £1.65bn, or £900 per pupil, in total.\nCommenting, Cllr Diane Williamson, Liberal Democrat and Shadow Cabinet Member for Education and Safeguarding said:\n“Liberal Democrats are building a strong economy and fair society where everyone can get ahead.\n“To do that we need to make sure that children are not held back by poverty and disadvantage.\n“For too long, social background has been a deciding factor in a child’s chances for the future.\n“I am proud that the Liberal Democrats are helping every child in Oldham to reach their full potential.\n“I know that there will be winners and losers but this money does not just help the poorest children, it helps every child. Fewer children falling behind means less disruption in class and a better education for everyone”\nCommenting further, Liberal Democrat Schools Minister, David Laws said:\n“We are already seeing across the country how the Pupil Premium is making a difference to children’s lives. Extra tuition, better IT resources and closer work with parents are all examples of how the Pupil Premium is being used to support the most disadvantaged pupils and benefit all their classmates too.\n“That’s why I’m so pleased that, next year, we’ll be extending the Pupil Premium to another half a million children, and increasing the money that schools get to £900 per pupil.\n“This means that, as a result of Liberal Democrats in the Coalition Government, more children will get a better start in life.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The implementation of Universal Credit has therefore been scandalous. Oldham a trial area highlighted the issues but the government ignored this.\nIn November Lib Dems in Westminster lead a rebellion against Tory tax cuts for higher earners 21 Labour MPs supported this but the rest decided not to oppose . It is beyond belief that a party which claims to stand ‘for the many, not the few’, decided not to oppose the Government on this.\nUsing the money to fund Universal Credit or end the benefits freeze would have been a far more progressive way of using the money. In July 2015 a bill was passed in parliament to take £12 billion out of welfare. The bill passed by 184. Labour decided not to vote against the Welfare cuts so there were 184 Labour MP abstained.\nSo Labour allowed the welfare cuts through. .We know Oldham was a pilot area and my Liberal Democrat colleague, Howard Sykes proposed 12 practical measures that the Liberal Democrat Group believed the Labour Administration should adopt to mitigate the impact of welfare reform on one particularly vulnerable group – the disabled.\nI and many of my Liberal Democrat colleagues have met with and challenged the Department of Work and Pensions and the Job Centre over the implementation to challenge and offer remedies.\nI have written to the Oldham cabinet member on a few occasions about this issue .Liberal Democrats in this chamber have proposed bespoke support for the most vulnerable -Helping those with dyslexia, autism, mental health\nThere has been a problem hitting people hard because of an overzealous regime which seeks to sanction first and ask questions later. When I met with staff at Tameside and Oldham MIND to discuss what could be done to support claimants with a history of mental illness\nThey were being sanctioned because they were unable to comply with the conditions that accompany claiming benefits.. A pilot project for claimants was introduced hopefully results less ESA claimants will be sanctioned in Oldham. This should then look at other vulnerable claimants\nOn the issue of sanctions -Too many cases are occurring where the Job Centre are sanctioning residents on Universal Credit without looking at the information first. Not enough warning not enough support just straight to sanction. I have asked officers for sanction figures but they appear to have dried up. Sometimes sanctions would be justified but sometimes it is clear they are not, sanctions are placed on applicants anyway and the applicant would clearly win on appeal but they then are left without money for weeks. Even then they won’t get it completely back dated\nWe need the figures on sanctions- to see\nHow many are justified?\nHow many are vulnerable groups who were not given the right level of support?\nHow many were issued by the providers working on behalf of DWP or Job Centre Plus?\nDid they follow a Vulnerability Guide and process flow chart?\nA Summary of the Liberal Democrat 12-Point Plan follows –.

I was surprised to be informed that the route in Delph was proposed to go up The Sound and then straight up Grains Road. This was the original proposal however, we were concerned that it would miss out the whole of the village. My understanding was that we had agreed there would be a short diversion down King street to Church street then Holland Close and Garside street so that the centre of the village would be visited.. Quite a lot of work, time and money has been spent in and around the centre of Delph with some plants and work provided by Oldham council. It therefore seems strange to now go back and miss it out.\nI have spoken to a number of Delph residents all who still believe that the centre of village will be visited and thus a considerable amount of work has already been done. The Delph community were very keen to get involved.\nThe lads from the park team have been working really hard on the route given to them and it looks great. In the main it had been positive and for example in Dobcross has been a great joint community project with revamped garden and Dobcross looking great. The council and community have been great in getting things looking the part.\nI know the competition it can’t go everywhere but when you are told it will go through Delph, people do lots of work and then they change their minds it is disappointing. It was only a tiny de-tour.\nIt is a kick in the teeth when people have worked hard and spent money to get the village ready and it won’t be seen. It is a great shame that people in Delph were not told they are going to go back on the agreement so near the event. I hope they can reconsider.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Conservative Government has pledged £396 million of targeted support for 1.7 million children over the Christmas, Easter and Summer school holidays. The Prime Minister conveyed the good news in a telephone call on Saturday with campaigning footballer Marcus Rashford OBE.\nThe Liberal Democrats brought a motion to the last meeting of the Oldham Council (4 November) in support of Marcus Rashford’s campaign to tackle holiday hunger and child poverty in England.\nOn hearing the welcome announcement, Saddleworth North Councillor Garth Harkness, who proposed the motion, said: “We congratulate Marcus Rashford on his successful campaign to turn around government policy on this issue. Only days before, Tory MPs had disgracefully voted against awarding money for school meals in Parliament; all the while taking advantage of the publicly subsidised canteens in Westminster. Over one million people signed a petition in support of the campaign of the Manchester United and England player, and the Oldham Liberal Democrats in bringing forward this motion wanted also to show our support for Mr Rashford’s initiative”.\nCrompton Councillor Louie Hamblett, who seconded the motion, added: “The Oldham Liberal Democrats believe that to let children go hungry in the United Kingdom, one of the world’s richest economies, is truly disgraceful. We hope that in passing this motion, Oldham Council will send a clear signal of support to Marcus Rashford and to Henry Dimbleby, who chaired the National Food Strategy group, in their fight to end child food poverty”.\nThe motion was carried at the Council meeting last Wednesday (4 November).\nEnds/…\nCouncil November 4, 2020 – Notice of Opposition Business –\nMotion 3 – Time to tackle child food poverty\nThis Council:\n· Believes that, in one of the world’s most advanced economies, it is shameful that two decades into the twenty-first century, children still go hungry in the UK.\n· Is committed to ensuring that reducing child food poverty in our Borough remains one of our top priorities and commends organisations in this Borough which are working to do so.\n· Also commends the initiative of Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford who has successfully campaigned on school holiday hunger and has recently formed a taskforce with some of the UK’s leading food retailers and charities to help reduce child food poverty.\n· Notes that this taskforce has called upon the government to fund three policy recommendations from the National Food Strategy, an independent review of UK food policy, as soon as possible:\nCouncil concurs with the conclusion of the taskforce in calling upon the government to immediately fund these recommendations.\nCouncil feels that if the Prime Minister wishes to be believed when he talks of ‘building (Britain) back better’ then he must address child food poverty as a top priority; for how can Britain be better when our nation’s children continue to go hungry?\nCouncil resolves to ask the Chief Executive to write to:\nProposed by Councillor Garth Harkness\nSeconded by Councillor Louie Hamblett:\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Oldham Liberal Democrat Group certainly wish to see more power and more revenue being devolved from Whitehall to local town halls so this is a big step in the right direction.\n“At the last Council meeting in October, I expressed my support for devolution and offered my full support to the Council Leader in achieving it.\n“The plan will devolve real powers to a new Greater Manchester Authority, led by an elected Mayor, allowing significant improvements to our infrastructure, the creation of more efficient and joined up public transport network and thousands of new homes to be built, whilst creating many more, much needed businesses and local jobs.\n“There is no doubt this will all have a positive impact on Oldham’s economy as one of the ten beneficiary authorities.\n“Another spin-off benefit will be amalgamation of the powers and responsibilities of the Police and Crime Commissioner, a post that has never been popular and the loss of which will not be lamented.\n“However the new Mayor will only be elected in 2017, after a delay of almost two and a half years and after a General Election, with all the uncertainties that this brings for the future. In the interim an appointed Mayor will take charge of a vast budget.\n“It is of course early days, but I am concerned that as yet there appears to be no concrete proposals in place to scrutinise the actions of the appointed Mayor or of the ten local authority Leaders who will sit in judgement on her or him.\n“There have been major past concerns about the accountability of the Police and Crime Commissioner to the public. I would certainly want the Greater Manchester Combined Authority to look at how the Mayor and new authority will be properly accountable to both elected members and the wider electorate.\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats will be looking to ensure that once worked up future governance arrangements balance operational efficiency with public transparency”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This has clearly been a problem for some time yet nobody has acted on it\n“We have spent a fortune on the Oldham Education Commission but this council has let the most vulnerable young people down in ensuring a satisfactory provision for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities.”\nThe Leader of the Opposition and of the Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council, Councillor Howard Sykes MBE has been very concerned for some time at the steady decline in educational performance at many of Oldham’s schools since the change in Administration in 2011. Councillor Sykes said:\n“We have spent a fortune on setting up the Oldham Education Commission yet we are bottom of the class for students getting the education place of their choice and we are providing an inadequate service at the Council for students with Special Educational Needs.\n“As an opposition group we have been raising our concerns for quite some time.\n“Young people with conditions like Autism, Dyslexia, learning difficulties or physical difficulties can often achieve great things if we provide the right support and bring down the barriers.

I know these concerns are shared by my Liberal Democrat colleagues in Saddleworth West and Lees, Shaw and Crompton.”\n“These fires are now a regular occurrence when the weather gets hot and the ground is dry. Some are doubtless ignited by natural causes, but, in all too many cases, they are the malicious work of arsonists or caused by irresponsibility on the part of day-trippers using portable disposable barbeques or discarding cigarettes on the moor. I worry that, now we are in summer, we are likely to see a further onset of moorland fires and so it is imperative that we maintain our vigilance and look to strengthen our powers in combatting criminal activity.”\nCouncillor Harkness and his Liberal Democrat colleagues all support the introduction of a Public Space Protection Order to help combat the fire menace.\nCouncillor Harkness added: “Crompton Moor has a Public Space Protection Order in place, which makes the lighting of fires and the cutting down of trees for firewood punishable offences, whereas Saddleworth Moor does not. I believe we need to have a Public Space Protection Order on Saddleworth Moor. It represents one more legal tool to help combat the irresponsible firelighters on the moor or those who are down-right criminal.\n“A PSPO provides for an on-the-spot Fixed Penalty and a £1,000 fine for matters taken to court. The Oldham Liberal Democrats would like to see the Council, with its partners in the Police, the Peak District Park Authority and United Utilities, working together to enforce these orders, including using drones on the moor, as I for one do not want to see another summer of our beautiful moorlands ablaze and the frightening prospect of a fatality.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In 2015, Council passed a motion recognising that a disproportionate number of such claimants are being sanctioned through no fault of their own.”\n“As a result of a referral by MIND to the Greenwich Welfare Rights Service, I became aware of the work that had been done there to provide further safeguards to such vulnerable claimants, and I was keen to bring this model to Oldham.”\n“I am pleased to say that discussions between the Liberal Democrat team, officials of the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Head of the Council’s Welfare Rights Service have led to an agreement to establish a pilot project for claimants in receipt of the Employment Support Allowance (or ESA).”\n“It is my hope that this pilot will be successful and that as a result less ESA claimants will be sanctioned in Oldham. We should then look to offer the same safeguards to the claimants of other benefits who are vulnerable.”\nSeconding the motion, Councillor Julia Turner, said: “The safeguarding model established by our colleagues in Greenwich offers greater protection for vulnerable claimants and is one that we are keen to see adopted in Oldham. In particular in Greenwich, vulnerable claimants are encouraged to nominate a health or social worker to act on their behalf as an advocate or contact person with whom Job Centre staff will work before a sanction is considered.”\n“Our motion calls for this initiative to be actively promoted by the Council and for front-line staff in a range of agencies to receive training so that they understand how they can best support these clients. An initial training session has been organised by staff in the Liberal Democrat Office for such workers on the day of Council as we want to make sure the message goes out as quickly as possible.”\n“We are also calling for a Vulnerability Guide to be created as a ready source of information for these workers and for a liaison group to be established with representatives from all of the relevant agencies to ensure that the initiative works.”\nThe Liberal Democrat Office and the Manager of Oldham Council’s Welfare Rights Service have been working together to replicate in Oldham safeguards introduced by the Royal Greenwich Welfare Rights Service.\nCounillor Garth Harkness said “Training will be provided to front-line workers and volunteers to ensure that they can support vulnerable claimants in completing and registering the paperwork. An initial training session is scheduled for 22 March. I would personally like to thank our researcher Richard Outram for all his hard work in helping move this forward”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

There need to either be significant changes to fund the regeneration of previously used land, or local authorities need the powers to insist developers cannot build on green spaces while brownfield sites remain.\n“The previous version of the Greater Manchester framework was unable to deliver the housing targets without building on the green belt. If central Government increases the figures like this, they are forcing more development on green space. They will then blame it on local authorities, rather than accepting responsibility for their own decisions.”\nThe next version of the Greater Manchester plan is not expected to be released until after the elections for the Greater Manchester Mayor, so any resulting increases in development on green space are not expected to be announced while they can impact on the election results.\nCouncillor Al-Hamdani continued: “There are no easy solutions to this. We need more houses, and we have green spaces that we want to protect. It requires honesty in decision making, and responsibility from the people making those decisions.

This is part of an ongoing Liberal Democrat campaign to raise the dangers of poor road surfaces with the current Labour Administration and to call for a change in policy so damage can be repaired if it is dangerous.\nThe Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrat Group, Councillor Chris Gloster, is proposing the motion: “This issue is of great concern to Liberal Democrat Councillors on Oldham Council. My Shaw colleague, Group Leader Councillor Howard Sykes, has written to the Council Deputy Leader about this and my Crompton colleague, Councillor Dave Murphy, raised it as a question at last Council. We are just not satisfied by the lack of action so have decided to bring our proposals for proper debate at full Council. Put simply, we want the Council to be able to repair any road surface that is dangerous, not just those roads where surface erosion is at least forty millimetres deep. At the moment the Council just says no if the holes are less than 40mm.”\nGovernment guidance issued to all local authorities in November 2016 states that Councils must ‘investigate’ instances where road surfaces have been eroded by at least 40mm, but there is no legal requirement placed upon Councils even then to repair them promptly. In Oldham, the current Labour Administration policy is to only consider potholes deeper than 40mm to be eligible for repair. By way of constant, the threshold for the repair of pavements is lower at 25mm.\nCouncillor Gloster explained why this is problematic: “One practical issue is that many roads in my own district of Shaw and Crompton do not even have a top surface that is 40mm thick; they can be worn away to the cobbles and present a real danger to cyclists and motorists, but as the ‘threshold’ can never be reached no action is taken. This cannot be fair or right.”\nThe Liberal Democrats want the Council to ensure that any road surface that becomes hazardous can be repaired. Councillor Gloster added: “I fully appreciate roads will still have to be prioritised and not all will be able to be repaired with the resources the council has, but we should look to address the danger that any worn road surface represents to the public, and not simply operate to some arbitrary ‘threshold’.”\nThe motion is being seconded by Councillor Gloster’s colleague, Saddleworth Liberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness, who said: “Another issue addressed in our motion is the lack of real finance made available to local government from central government for road repairs.

Under the coalition government the electrification of the Leeds to Manchester route had been agreed and the reports indicated that it would be self-financing. So it beggars belief that they pause this project at the same time as investing further in rail infrastructure in the south.\nSo we see investment per head of population in transport at £2731 per head in London, £792 per head in the South East & just £134 per head in the North West. So 20 times more is invested in London than the north west.

The 2016 referendum was built upon lies and this is reflected in the fact that the electoral commission would call the result null and void.\nGarth does not want years of uncertainty, a weaker economy and more years of cuts to education health and local government. Places like Oldham are the ones who suffer. He does not want Oldham to lose support from the European Social Fund. It has taken years already not to get an agreement on how to leave Europe. It will take many more years to actually agree trade agreements with Europe and the rest of the world.\nGarth believes we are neglected by Westminster already in Oldham.

Only last year, Nick Clegg announced that Greater Manchester received one of the largest shares of £5.9 million to fund over 2,500 young people back into work”.\nThe wage incentive element of the scheme sees up to £2,275 has been paid to employers for taking on people aged 18-24 who have been claiming Job Seeking Allowance for more than six months.\nHowever take up of this particular incentive has been low;\nCllr Harkness explained why:\n“This was in part because there was seen to be too much bureaucracy for small companies to cope with. More to the point, I am pleased to say that the huge decline in youth unemployment, particularly marked in Oldham, has meant less young jobseekers have need of this support”.\nCllr Akhtar recently asserted that the wage incentive element had been suddenly withdrawn, necessitating funding to be made available by the Council to support trainees with the Council.\nCllr Harkness sought to put the record straight:\n“The wage incentive element has not been ended. It will run until the end of the current financial year. It was always intended to be a temporary measure available for three years during the lifetime of this Government.\n“The Government has simply brought the cut-off date for new starters forward by one month to August from September. It is much better to focus on extra Job Seeker support and apprentices through grants which are proving much more effective. “\n”.Cllr Harkness described Labour tactics as ‘diversionary spin’\n: “In July 2013, Cabinet agreed to create 150 traineeships with the authority – this was over a year after the wage incentive scheme had been introduced. By the August cut-off date, only 54 had completed or enrolled\n“The fact that Cllr Akhtar and his Labour colleagues were unaware of the cut-off date also indicates that they were ignorant of the time scale of the scheme”.\nCllr Harkness was however supportive of the Cabinet in one of its actions:\n“The traineeship programme was based on securing funding from three sources – £300K from Council, £341K from Government and £225K from the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA).\n“It is interesting that Labour has been keen to blame the Government for a shortfall of funding, but have not laid equal blame on Labour colleagues in AGMA for doing the same.\n“Belatedly, the Cabinet has started to lobby their Labour colleagues for more cash to secure the unspent monies allocated to other authorities. I support and welcome their efforts, but feel that they should have been lobbying their Labour colleagues far harder and sooner to secure more cash”.\nCllr Harkness ended:\n“Whatever the shortcomings of this element of the scheme, this Council has nonetheless managed to draw down £123K in wage subsidies from this Government.\n“Once more Labour shows its breath-taking hypocrisy in criticising the youth contract all the way along, yet they are happy to take the money and then take credit.\n“We are committed to ensuring that young people have the best possible start in life that is why we have insisted on a pupil premium to help the most vulnerable whilst at school and support them into work afterwards.\nLiberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable launched a new campaign to encourage more young people to take up apprenticeships. The “Get In, Go Far” campaign is being supported by a number of employers across the country and coincides with the introduction of 40 new employer-designed apprenticeships in sectors including engineering, hospitality and the legal profession. I am delighted that the Liberal Democrats continue both locally and nationally to build a stronger economy enabling people to prosper with.\nGiven Labour’s stated intention to abolish benefits for under-25s if they take national office, I have my doubts as to whether any similar support would be available under their stewardship”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is a disgrace that it has remained inaccessible for all this time.”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness has been several years to reopen Diggle Station to provide Saddleworth with a second station, added: “With no other alternatives, it is an absolutely necessity that Greenfield Station gets step free access.

But if there remains no step-free access, we are not getting the service we need for everyone.\n“Purely and simply, this is a matter of fairness. Until the Conservative Government provides both the money and the commitment to make railways accessible, we know that they don’t care about people in Saddleworth – whether that is people with disabilities, parents with prams; anyone who struggles to access the station as it is now.

With all this some may say that more should have been done? I do not think any more could have been done. It has been particularly bad with the snow and 50mph gusts of winds meaning that drifting snow has been causing huge problems. Keeping many parts of Saddleworth and the Trans Pennine routes open has proved impossible. The large amount of snow even when gritted the snow on top can make it traitorous. In places as soon as the ploughs had passed the snow returned. I cannot criticise the council gritting team at all they were excellent and showed pure dedication I had contact with one officer who had been on shift for 16 hours at that point.

The more instances of flooding we know about the better our case so please let me know if you have experienced flooding. I was referred to as the Drainage champion of Saddleworth- A compliment from the Labour administration!\nPlanning\nThe Lib Dem motion to oppose the proposed new planning changes was passed I think this plan is ill thought through and would not be with us for a short while but the consequences will be seen for many years\nAs a Liberal I am a keen believer of community politics where more decisions are made locally and how the area is shaped is decided locally. The localism bill does bring about further opportunities for the community to shape the area.\nIndeed on planning- the Neighbourhood plans while far from perfect show an indication that the community decide on how planning happens in their area.\nThese proposals totally contradict this premise and would pull powers not just from local communities but to central government. As a point of principle I therefore have to oppose this.\nThe other issue is that the economics do not add up. There are around 400 thousand homes that have been given planning permission yet remain un built by developers. We need more affordable housing yet many planning permissions remain undeveloped.\nThe issue is to get developers developing the land that already has permission and this policy does nothing to attempt to address this. It doesn’t encourage development of the right kind.\nIf it is suitable it will get planning permission according to the National and local development frameworks and in the future neighbourhood plans.\nA streamlined planning system I would support for small applications but to have no scrutiny at all and a one size fits all for the whole country seems very rash.\nThe economic viability of Diggle station and the two tunnels was stated in one of the reports. I am continuing to challenge this.\nLocalism\nI asked what support is the council is going to provide parish councils and neighbourhood groups in producing neighbourhood plans or In providing input short of a neighbourhood plan.

These situations usually occur when drivers ignore displayed weight or width restrictions or use satnavs designed for cars instead of those specifically designed for HGVs and large vehicles. We want the Government to change the law so that these vehicles have to be equipped with the appropriate commercial version. They may cost a little more, but they will help reduce the price paid in inconvenience by local residents, such as our constituents in Delph, and other road users.”\nThe two Councillors also want the Council to support a call by the Local Government Association that Government give local authorities new powers to enforce traffic restrictions against HGVs.\nCouncillor Heffernan added: “The Police are often too overstretched to enforce these regulations. If the Government enacted Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004, this would grant Councils the necessary powers to carry out enforcement action.”\nFinally, the motion calls on the Council to co-operate with the two Parish Councils, with local residents’ associations and the Police to introduce Lorry Watch schemes in areas of the borough where HGV holdups may happen.\nCouncillor Heffernan concluded: “Lorry Watch scheme rely on local residents to record vehicles flouting weight and width restrictions and report them. Like Home Watch, this is about empowering local residents to take positive action to help keep their villages and rural areas HGV free.

Cllr Harkness added: “Dyslexia does not have to hold people back; Richard Branson and Tom Cruise have both been successful in their chosen fields.\n“With reasonable adjustments and appropriate support, dyslexics can be successful in their career. However it is a sad fact that for many there is a lack of specialist provision and this means that the talents and enthusiasm of many jobseekers with dyslexia is lost as they find difficulty in securing gainful employment.\n“We wanted to ensure that the needs of jobseekers with dyslexia were properly addressed through the Get Oldham Working programme”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The problem is huge all staff need training, there needs to be mental health first aiders in schools with clear guidelines for staff and a designated mental health lead . Approximately 10% of 5-16 year-olds have a clinically diagnosed mental health disorder. A further 15% of 5-16 year-olds have problems that put them at risk of developing mental health problems.”\nShaw Councillor Hazel Gloster said “We need to ensure all schools promote resilience, mindfulness and positive mental health along with skills to manage social and emotional difficulties to be taught in the curriculum. The government have talked about mental health but they still don’t back it enough and kids don’t get enough help until it is way down the line. Early help is the key”\n“Recent calls from government have called for more work to be done on supporting young people with mental health difficulties and also possibly include this in future inspection regimes.”\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added I welcome the work done by the Health and Wellbeing board and the employment of a mental health school advisor but I know waiting times for adults with mental health difficulties are bad enough but they are horrendous for children!

Councillor Sykes also represents Oldham Council on the Transport for Greater Manchester committee.\nAccording to Passenger Transport, in 2012/13 the division had a £101 million turnover and made £3.5 million profit. However, by 2017/18 revenues had fallen to £86m, and the Manchester operation made a loss of £5.8m. National media reports suggest the business could be sold for as little as £20 million with vehicles sold to one or more competing operators, along with depots at Bolton, Bury and Oldham.\nCommenting, Councillor Sykes said: “The consistent feedback received from my constituents, who are reliant on First Bus services, is often poor. First Bus fares are high compared to some other transport operators, such as Manchester Community Transport and Metrolink. First Bus services are also often unreliable compared to these same operators, particularly after 6pm. The 59-bus ‘service’ which runs from Manchester to Rushcroft through my ward is a case in point. It is a service in name only as the bus often fails to show or is significantly behind schedule.”\nCouncillor Sykes added: “First Bus have not yet confirmed if they are putting the Manchester business up for sale, but, if they are, it is real pity that local authorities were denied the chance to establish new bus companies under the recent Bus Services Act as this would have provided an ideal opportunity to bring back an Oldham Corporation bus company.”\n“However, the Greater Manchester Mayor and Transport for Greater Manchester should work to ensure that the purchaser, or purchasers, who take on these services are committed to providing a first-class service for bus passengers, which is customer-focused, reliable, safe and affordable, and provides continuity of employment for First Manchester drivers and staff.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The new proposals would see the loss of the single yellow lines and make them double yellow lines.\nSaddleworth North Councillor Garth Harkness, said “ I proposed that the 70 new homes should not be built due to the impact on the highways, impact on the listed building and lack of affordable housing. This was passed so the developer should now live with the proposals and changes to existing residents access to car parking is unacceptable.”\nAs part of the traffic measures in Diggle Councillor Garth Harkness said “I worked hard amongst much opposition to get a car park and reduced restrictions here so am opposed for any reduction to this.”\nParish Councillor Michael Powell said “ I am unsure why any proposed changes are being put forward now after approval. Residents will find it hard to get out of the new development, but this was approved at the planning meeting and current residents should not be impacted as a result of this decision.”\nLocal campaigner Lynne Thompson added “ On top of the new development and all it’s problems it will cause, to have existing residents to lose parking provision as a result is just a kick in the teeth that it will stop some of the residents from parking overnight.”“\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “The proposed building work of the houses in front of Saddleworth School has caused great concern amongst residents and am opposed to changes which further impact the residents.”\n“ The residents who use this parking are being disregarded.

EON had never wanted consultation in conservation areas. They appeared to go off sulking and did not respond with proposals following our conservation area walks. They seem to want to carry on where they left off and I am concerned that this is what we are letting them do.\nThe response has been that they also “share my concerns and are taking all reasonable steps to ensure against works continuing in areas where consultation has not been completed”. Since my contact they called a meeting with EON this with week where they say they were going to re-iterate their position.\nThey say that to facilitate works progressing with an agreed approach in the conservation areas they have agreed to supply an input based specification. This means they will build a paper on each of the conservation areas which explains clearly to Eon what we are expecting from their designs and it will also enable them to continue work across the area where Members have no great concerns and a standard installation is appropriate. They will then need to supply any additional costs associated with the proposals which EON have so far failed to do.\nI personally would have preferred to have seen any further work in the conservation areas be suspended in it’s entirety until the public consultation drop-ins. It does seem to only be taking place where members had no objections to the style (even if there are other difficulties still outstanding e.g. the one in Delph opposite the White Lion) but if communities wanted to enhance some of these and had funds to do so it would be a good opportunity to do so. I know EON don’t want to be held up but in my opinion, it is their own fault.\nI will be meeting with them soon to continue to put the case forward and the continuing concerns.\nGarth, November last year these new lights were erected, they were painted black but remained unlit for nearly 10 months. Certainly on my street in Delph the old ugly concrete posts which were showing obvious signs decay and poor light – were side by side with the new ones. Well done Eon for finally getting stuck in and finishing the job.\nMuch better light improving safety and security, presumably more energy saving and finally we have got rid of the ugly concrete posts with terrible sodium lighting.\nIt’s about time councillors actually worked for improvement rather than against. This is a classic case of let the workers get on with the job.\nIan\nThanks for your comments\nAll street lighting in the borough is being replaced and I agree that the street lighting is to a much better standard. I do think they should be using LEDs though as they are more energy efficient. I have had complaints in many cases where there are issues and the response from EON has been poor in many cases. Throughout the process there are many examples where they have not listened in the consultation to many residents concerns. In the conservation area it was agreed that they would come up with options for enhanced lighting options or refurbishment in areas where they exist and costings if there is a desire to do it elsewhere within the conservation area. They have so far failed to do this.\nThere are a number of areas outside the conservation area where the posts are put up way before the lamps are activated and this is part of the process they use. No old lamps should be switched off until the new ones are on and working.\nThe reason I am doing this is precisely to work for improvements. EON are not doing the job properly\nRegards\nGarth",

It is quite a lengthy reply so I have just attached an extract below\nLeave a commentWe aim to provide an electricity supply which is as safe and reliable as possible but unfortunately problems do occur due to the very nature of the electricity distribution network. In common with other electricity distribution companies, we cannot guarantee a continuous, uninterrupted supply of electricity, as there are too many factors outside our control which prevent us from achieving this.\nWe appreciate the frustration supply interruptions cause to our customers and accept the particular problems experienced by residents of Dobcross, Saddleworth and Grotton in recent months.\n“In your email you mention the electricity fault in Dobcross on 1 April 2014 where a generator providing temporary supply ran out of fuel. I have investigated this matter and have found that the supply interruption was the result of problems with our equipment in the Sugar Lane substation. Our engineers attached a generator in way of a temporary restoration until a permanent repair could be completed several days later. Throughout the course of the repair our engineers had to constantly refill the generator to ensure supplies remained on. On one occasion the generator ran out of fuel sooner than expected, resulting in a number of properties loosing electricity supply for a short period of time.\nA permanent repair was carried out at 14:21 on 7 April 2014, at this time we were able to transfer all the affected customers back onto the mains electrical supply and remove the generator.\nLeave a Reply",

He is a freelance graphic designer and editor, with clients as diverse as the World Health Organization, the CBI, and the Department of the Environment.\nSam said: “The country is currently stuck at a crossroads. The Conservative Government have spent three years failing to negotiate the first step in an agreement with the EU. If we go through with it, we’ll be stuck in negotiations with the EU for decades. The only clean break available is to stop the process, and look again at what we need to do to actually support people who have been let down by years of Conservative and Labour failures.”\nSam is a local Councillor, born and bred in Saddleworth and living in Lees. He is a freelance designer and editor working for clients as diverse as the Fair Tax Mark, the World Health Organisation, Chambers of Commerce and the CBI.\nHe believes that we need to look to build more engaged communities and society. Too many people in Oldham feel like they have been left behind, by years of national governments who are too focused on London and the South East.\nWe can deliver a brighter future for Oldham. It requires changing our thinking. We need to ensure that both national government policies and our membership of the European Union deliver for our town.\nOldham should be a place of opportunity, and right now it isn’t. We need to bring our communities together – celebrate the hard-working people who live here and who can make this a diverse, thriving town.\nMembership of the European Union can be one part of this. The UK must also deliver a green revolution. If we are ahead of the curve – leading the world in environmental technologies – then a greener economy will also be a growing, positive economy.\nA coherent approach to local services is crucial. Whether it is planning, social and health care, education – we need not just funding, but effective funding, and insightful planning. Spending money we don’t have will just make things worse.\nGovernment needs to deliver better.

This Prime Ministers version of compassion seems to be limiting child benefits so poor children go hungry, cutting schools budgets so schools have to sack staff, not investing in the NHS so that the service is crumbling, and disregarding mental health.\nThe Prime Minister says she wants to make mental health a priority yet her minister tells disability benefits assessors to discriminate against people with mental health conditions.. Liberal Democrats in the Lords proposed a motion to kill the Government’s attempts to severely restrict disability benefits. Unfortunately this has been lost after Labour peers failed to support it. Thankfully we passed a motion I proposed in Oldham Council to ensure new safeguards for vulnerable benefit claimants living in our borough to reduce the number of these claimants who receive a benefit sanction.\nThis policy of hitting those who find it hardest to fight back, whilst giving a tax break for the richest, shows that the Prime Minister is out of touch with the real needs of most British people today and firmly in the camp of the privileged. She does not speak for all of us.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The motion has been passed to the scrutiny board\nDyslexia is a recognised disability and without reasonable adjustments\nit can be a huge barrier to gain employment or remain employed. With reasonable adjustments and appropriate support people can be extremely successful with dyslexia.Richard Branson, Tom Cruse, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein were all dyslexic. They have all been extremely successful despite this condition. Dyslexia does not have to hold people back but the sad truth is that it does. Many employers fail to understand the condition or make reasonable adjustments in interviews or in the actual work place itself. This means that there is often a great deal of talent and skills not being used effectively. We cannot have a stronger economy if we do not utilise peoples skills We cannot have a fairer society if we do not give people the support to flourish\nit is clear that if the barriers for dyslexia are addressed and people are given a leg up then they can succeed. As Lib Dems we believe in a stronger economy and a fairer society with Opportunity for Every-one.\nBritain may be in the fast lane in terms of job creation and unemployment is falling, but we need to ensure that people who may need a little more help are not left behind. The Liberal Democrats in Government have led the apprentice drive and are on course to deliver two million apprenticeships in Britain by the end of this parliament.The Government’s Ambassador for Apprenticeships is Gordon Birtwistle, Lib Dem MP for Burnley, and himself a former engineering apprentice.\nWe are seeing more young people choosing apprenticeships while hearing from businesses who say they simply couldn’t function without the talent and ambition they bring.\nDelivering on apprenticeships helps build the stronger economy and fairer society Britain needs and locally helps Get Oldham Working\nPeople need to be given the chance to relish such opportunities.\nThat is why we are building on our motion at the last council which sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for disabled people and carers who want to seek employment.\nAs part of its offer to Get Oldham Working, the Liberal Democrat Group wants to see Oldham Council offer specialist support and better access to technology to people with dyslexia in their quest for work and to support our employees so they can excel in their jobs\nIn order to support people with dyslexia in the work place we want to see\nLastly we want to look to the future and ensure we mark Dyslexia Awareness Week (5th to 11th October 2015) with suitable events to raise awareness amongst the public and employers and to promote this provision”.\nOnce more the Liberal Democrat Group is bringing a motion to Council that contains practical ideas to help more people in our borough get working.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Local government continues to be one of the biggest victims of this Government’s austerity strategy and things will only get worse; by 2021 Oldham will lose all of it’s central Government grant.”\nLabour has again proposed that Council Tax bills rise by 2% to pay for improvements to adult social care and a further 1.99% for other services.\nCllr McCann commented:\n“The Liberal Democrats will once again support this rise as it will at least raise some more money for services, but we also think it is important to focus every penny that we have on core services. As well as revenue-raising, our strategy is to continue to identify savings in back-office bureaucracy and waste to free up money to support the services that are most valued by our ratepayers.”\nThis year, once more the Liberal Democrats are proposing measures that will generate almost £675,000 in savings each year – from reducing publications, printing and advertising, to tackling absenteeism and reducing expenditure on employing agency staff. This is money that they want to spend on better roads, cleaner streets and more youth outreach provision.\nCllr McCann said:\n“We recognise that this is only a relatively small amount compared to the many millions that this Council has been forced to save, but this modest amount could nonetheless be a game-changer – it would provide us with the revenue we need to borrow over £5 million to invest in our key highways, with enough left over to radically improve our gully-cleaning service, restore a free Bulky Bobs waste collection service and pay for more youth outreach provision to engage with young people in our communities.”\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for over £460,000 from the additional savings that they have identified to go to:\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

That is nowhere near enough to satisfy demand.\nThe Liberal Democrat Group on Oldham Council believes that the Council needs to identify more allotment sites and the funding to develop and sustain them by working with District Partnerships, Parish Councils, local allotment societies and local residents to find those sites and identify sources of funding.\nAt the meeting of Oldham Council on Wednesday 10th September, Lib Dem Cllr Derek Heffernan will move a motion, seconded by Lib Dem Cllr Dave Murphy, asking the Council to identify suitable sites in Council ownership that have the potential to be developed into allotments as part of the District Asset Review and to identify funding to make this happen, because we are realistic and know that there is always a cost involved. The Lib Dems also want the Council to grant Council-owned allotments statutory status to given them some legal protection for the future.\nThe Council is looking to sell-off small plots of land throughout the Borough to developers instead of using them to meet a long term need for more allotments.\nSaddleworth Parish Council has done its bit by identifying a site in Uppermill, which is currently in the course of being brought into use as allotments, and is looking at other sites. There is no evidence that Oldham Council is following the same plan.\nThe enlightened attitude of a few wealthy people in the late 18th and early 19th Centuries, including social reformers such as William Cobbett, recognised the value of allotments in helping people become more self-sufficient.\nToday we recognise that working an allotment is both good for the individual and good for our environment by providing healthy local produce with no carbon footprint, unlike much supermarket produce.\nAllotment holding can also be a family affair with adults and children of all ages and abilities able to take part. Youngsters will be kept happy for hours in the messed up corner of the allotment instead of Mum’s lawn being damaged and may just produce something wonderful.\nIn our motion, we are asking Oldham Council to identify local areas and needed sources of funding.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

In 2020, the Manchester Recovery Task Force was formed with representatives from the Department of Transport, Network Rail, Northern, TransPennine Express, Transport for the North and Transport for Greater Manchester, to come up with proposals to restore the rail service.\nThe findings of the task force and a series of possible options were published by the Department for Transport on 14 January and are now open to public consultation.\nCouncillor Sykes, and his Liberal Democrat colleague, Councillor John Leech, from Manchester are clear where they stand.\n“Option 3 stands out as the one we want”, said Councillor Sykes, “it will help restore some of the trains to Greenfield as well as providing a more reliable service in the so called ‘congested corridor’ in Manchester. It will better enable commuters to get to and from their places of work and students to get to their colleges and universities in towns and cities served by a new half-hour daytime service from Greenfield. We also want to see the investment that is much needed and overdue to make this station completely accessible so all passengers can enjoy an improved service.”\nAlthough both Councillors will be making representations supporting option 3, Councillor Sykes is clear that members of the public should have their say too: “I would urge all passengers who use this station to use this opportunity to speak out in favour of more frequent and more reliable services and a fully-accessible station at Greenfield.”\nThe consultation can be found at:\nResponses can be made by email to performancerecoverytaskforce@dft.gov.uk or in writing to MRTF Consultation, 3rd floor, Department for Transport, Great Minster House, 3 Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 4DR\nThe Closing Date for responses is 10, March.\nThe Greenfield Rail Action Group can be found on Facebook at\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I have raised issues with EON on many occasions and still have concerns over the lack of progress with regards to conservation areas, despite the best efforts, I must say from Oldham council.\nThe street lights we are getting are significantly better and provide better light coverage. When they are placed in the correct position. The increased flexibility in control of these new columns means that it could provide us with an important efficiency and environmental saving.\nWe are already used to driving on the motorway now with street lights turned completely off.Recent research has suggested that three quarters of councils have already dimmed street lighting or turned them off altogether.\nAn example of Sugar Lane in Dobcross from Wool Road up to the village. It is like a flood lit football pitch and there is virtually nothing on there so it seems completely pointless to light it at the 100% level.\nIf you reduce the level by 50% and stand under the column then you would notice no difference in lighting levels. I would argue that the lighting coverage would still be significantly better than the orange glow lighting.\nPlaces like Cornwall have already been using street lighting dimming. They introduced an invest to save project whereby streetlights dim, by 50% from midnight to 5.30am and allowed a saving of a third in energy output. By the last financial year, Cornwall was saving 6.4 million KWH of electricity just by dimming street lights. This has made Cornwall a world leader in carbon reduction and also adds to a tidy financial saving for their taxpayers.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Cllr Harkness said:\n“Many people with long term medical conditions do not qualify for free prescriptions and struggle to pay for regular treatment. Around a third of people are choosing not to collect prescriptions because of the cost. Consequently, some of these patients fall ill and are admitted to hospital. Ultimately hospital admissions and treatment cost the tax payer far more.”\nSeconding the motion, Julia Turner, Councillor for Crompton and Shadow Cabinet member for Performance and Corporate Governance, said:\n“Some conditions get a medical exempt certificate, which is exactly right, but equally many other potentially debilitating medical conditions are not exempt and are subject to the £8.20 charge per item. Even with pre-payment cards you are looking at over £100 per year and many people round here simply do not have this to spare and choose to go without”.\nCouncillor Harkness added\nLeave a comment“We think there should be equality in healthcare. In government we fought to get mental health on a level playing field with other conditions. We want to ensure that people with all long term medical conditions get the medication they need wherever they live in the UK\n“In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, residents receive free prescriptions; yet in England, we have patients with identical medical conditions who have to cut pills up to save money or go without altogether and that can’t be right. We should not be subject to a lottery where you only receive free medication based on where you live or which long term medical condition you have. Everyone who needs treatment should receive it. “\nLeave a Reply",

He railed against the waste of money sending out the letter represents:\n“To be blunt this is an absolute waste of council tax-payers’ money. At this year’s March budget council meeting, I proposed cuts of £250,000 to the Council’s Communications budget because of clear examples of waste, and this is a prime example. This single communication to more than 90,000 homes in Oldham will have cost in excess of £70,000 in time, paper and postage to circulate. I honestly despair at this financial waste that cannot be justified in my view. What is even more galling is that the letter arrived at the same time that residents received their latest council tax bill increased yet again by this Labour Administration.”\nCouncillor Gloster also believes that the letter represents Labour electioneering propaganda at the public’s expense:\n“Sending out such a letter at this time is so wrong. The Labour council leader is personally up for election in May, and to circulate a letter at council tax-payers’ expense to every home in Oldham encouraging residents to work together with him just days before the election is formally called smacks of electioneering.\n“A former Local Government Minister once talked about ‘Town Hall Pravda’, political material put out at public expense. There is no doubt in my mind that this letter is electioneering in disguise and based on the numerous people who have commented on it to this effect, people across Oldham share the same view.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Previously four in ten pupils living in a poorer household were not eligible for free school meals, yet shockingly for many this meal might represent their only hot meal in the day.\n“But not only are school meals helping to meet the nutritional needs of our children, they have proven educational benefits too. Previous studies have shown that a child who is properly fed will concentrate more, behave better and study harder.\n“The Oldham Liberal Democrats now want to see free school meals extended to all primary age pupils as an investment in our children’s future”.\nSeconding the motion, Lib Dem Cllr Diane Williamson added:\nLeave a comment“I am proud to say that the Liberal Democrats at their party conference agreed that our policy should be to support extending universal free school meals to all pupils aged 8 to 11.\n“This was the recommendation made to the last Government in the School Food Plan by experts John Vincent and Henry Dimbleby, but it has yet to be implemented.\n“We hope that, at Council, colleagues from every party will agree to take back to their respective political groups in the Local Government Association a call from Oldham that free school meals should be extended to all primary school children. We hope too that this policy will be supported by our local Members of Parliament”.\nLeave a Reply",

Indeed the words by Saddleworth school head boy, Joe Wheeler stating “The construction of the new school should not be a battle between the villages. We should all be in unison to allow the children of tomorrow every single opportunity to flourish within their education” shows some wise shoulders and great leadership that we could all learn from.\nIn moving forward we all have to work together to ensure we get a new secondary school.\nWe are sure you know that my priority has always been to ensure that we get a new secondary school in Saddleworth and have always worked constructively with the council and other partners to achieve this. After all this time, We do not want to see the worst case scenario of the Diggle site being occupied by industrial units (as per it’s site designation), funding being pulled and us eventually having no secondary school in Saddleworth. We believe we need to be open and transparent to get the best outcome for our young people.\nIn a Manchester Evening News they report that “The court heard the council accepted that redeveloping the school on its existing site, whilst a more expensive option, would be “viable and affordable”. When the phrase was repeated in the Oldham Evening Chronicle it prompted us to write this letter. The implication of this statement suggests that the Education Funding Agency would provide even more funding to cover the significant costs of building in Uppermill and presumably financially supporting the decant of students to alternative accommodation during the process. This contradicts every single briefing I and my colleagues have ever received from Oldham council and others.\nIf we have learnt anything from this process it is that the silence will be filled with inaccuracies. I am therefore asking that the comments be addressed head on. We need to be in possession of the facts. If it is apparent that councillors have been misled then I would call for a full investigation and if appropriate, disciplinary action to be taken. If the accusations are false then such reporting should be condemned and Oldham council need to put the record straight.\nWe are more than willing to work with you to ensure that we get a new school for Saddleworth. Other schools funded in this programme are now built, occupied and providing the facilities we want for our young people. This has gone on too long and we need to get the best for our young people.\nYours Sincerely,\nCllr Garth Harkness,\nCllr Derek Heffernan\nCllr John McCann\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Oldham Council was awarded £1,022,449 by the Government in the current financial year.\n“From April 2015, local Councils were expected to find the money themselves, but the Liberal Democrat Group feels it is unrealistic to expect Oldham Council to shoulder the burden when we are already making such deep cuts in our budget.\n“There is a real need for the continuation of sufficient government funding to local authorities to meet the emergency needs of individuals facing severe financial hardship”.\nIn July 2014, the Liberal Democrat Group brought a motion to Oldham Council opposing the abolition of government funding for Local Welfare Provision and seeking its reinstatement.\nResponding to the consultation, Cllr Alcock stated:\n“The Liberal Democrat Group’s position remains unchanged from July 2014. We are opposed to the abolition of funding of this provision, and strongly believe that the Government should continue to provide specific funding to every local authority for Local Welfare Provision on the same basis and formula as applied in the 2014/15 financial year, but with ongoing funding adjusted to account for inflation”.\nInterestingly, Labour as usual made a big fuss in the press but appear to have failed to have formally responded.

This way of working which supports the proposed arrangement will also allow Waste Management to maintain safe working procedures observing social distancing guidance as the crews will continue to work to two, rather than three in a vehicle cabin.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

As well as revenue-raising, our strategy is to continue to identify savings in back-office bureaucracy and waste to free up money to support the services that are most valued by our ratepayers.”\nThis year, once more the Liberal Democrats are proposing measures that will generate more than £730,000 in savings each year – from reducing publications, printing and advertising, to tackling absenteeism; and reducing expenditure on employing agency staff and reducing the size of the communications/policy team. The cash saved will be spent on better roads, cleaner streets and more youth outreach provision.\nCllr Sykes said: “We recognise that this is only a relatively small amount compared to the many millions that this Council has been forced to save, but this modest amount could nonetheless be a game-changer – it would provide us with the revenue we need to borrow more than £5 million to invest in our key highways, with enough left over to radically improve our gully-cleaning service, restore a free Bulky Bobs waste collection service and pay for more youth outreach provision to engage with young people in our communities.”\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for over £470,000 from the additional savings that they have identified to go to:\nCllr Sykes explained why the Liberal Democrat Group wanted once again, to focus on investing in highway improvements and tackling blocked gullies and fly-tipping across the Borough:\n“There is a backlog amounting to over £5 million in road repairs to our Borough’s main and secondary highways. Our highways improvement programme will make our key roads safer and smoother for drivers and their passengers and our Borough a more attractive one to travel in.”\n“An extra gully cleaning team and vehicle will mean we can free up more of the many gullies that are currently clogged with soil. When a gully is blocked water does not run away and the road can become slippery for drivers, especially when the water turns to ice. Local properties can also be flooded. Blocked gullies have to be dug out by hand, which is a slow and labour-intensive process that is costly. This timely investment on gully-cleaning represents good sense”.\n“We also full support returning Bulky Bobs to a free service. Time and again we read reports in the local press or hear from our constituents about furniture and other bulky household detritus being dumped in our streets. This is also a complaint made by several Labour Councillors in full Council over the past twelve months.”\n“Poorer people are unable to afford to pay for a collection service and irresponsible people do not want to. Making Bulky Bobs free again would mean that no one has any excuse for dumping these unwanted goods.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This meant that the Lane is without street lighting and I’d asked that it needed to be dealt with for health and safety reasons. The old ones are not supposed to be turned off until new ones are up and running. “\nFollowing contact from Councillor Harkness Council officers staid that EON explained that the remainder of the columns on Delph Lane will be installed from the 15th October and the electrical connection for the street lighting columns are programmed to start from the 19th October 2015 and the work will be completed on site by the 31st October 2015\nCouncillor Garth Harkness said “The huge delay was not acceptable but it seemed that EON were attempting to rectify the problem. It was very disappointing when a resident came to see me at my Ward surgery on 7th November to tell me that the lights were still not on. I was quite angry about this because residents have been without street lighting for months and no explanation has been given as to why.

The figures for sleeping rough have increased by fifty percent in the last two years alone.\nCouncillor Williamson said: “It is a national disgrace that in a modern industrial economy, and Britain is one of the world’s leading economies, rough sleeping and homelessness can exist in the twenty first century.”\nOfficial figures also show that Greater Manchester is a city region with the fourth highest levels of homelessness.\n“At full Council, I will be hoping for cross-party support to commit Oldham to do its bit to make rough sleeping and homelessness a thing of the past. We would like a report on the current situation in our borough and what is being doing, and can be done, to improve it.”\nCouncillor Williamson added: “The Oldham Liberal Democrats also endorse the campaign launched recently by the new Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham to tackle this issue head on as an urgent priority for all ten local authorities and partner organisations in our city region.”\nUnfortunately a recent report for the homelessness charity Crisis has identified that rough sleeping and homelessness may rise by three quarters over the next decade.\nIn response, Councillor Williamson said: “This is why it is important that we also tackle this issue at a national level. Changes to housing benefit entitlement and delays in payments, wages not rising sufficiently to meet spiralling private sector rents, and the lack of affordable housing for rent has exacerbated this situation, and much of the blame must be placed at the feet of Conservative ministers who are so unconcerned because they are so out-of-touch with the day-to-day reality of those affected. We support the End Rough Sleeping Campaign, and call on our fellow Councillors and local Members of Parliament to also endorse this.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I know these concerns are shared by my Liberal Democrat colleagues in Saddleworth West and Lees, Shaw and Crompton.”\n“These fires are now a regular occurrence when the weather gets hot and the ground is dry. Some are doubtless ignited by natural causes, but, in all too many cases, they are the malicious work of arsonists or caused by irresponsibility on the part of day-trippers using portable disposable barbeques or discarding cigarettes on the moor. I worry that, now we are in summer, we are likely to see a further onset of moorland fires and so it is imperative that we maintain our vigilance and look to strengthen our powers in combatting criminal activity.”\nCouncillor Harkness and his Liberal Democrat colleagues all support the introduction of a Public Space Protection Order to help combat the fire menace.\nCouncillor Harkness added: “Crompton Moor has a Public Space Protection Order in place, which makes the lighting of fires and the cutting down of trees for firewood punishable offences, whereas Saddleworth Moor does not. I believe we need to have a Public Space Protection Order on Saddleworth Moor. It represents one more legal tool to help combat the irresponsible firelighters on the moor or those who are down-right criminal.\n“A PSPO provides for an on-the-spot Fixed Penalty and a £1,000 fine for matters taken to court. The Oldham Liberal Democrats would like to see the Council, with its partners in the Police, the Peak District Park Authority and United Utilities, working together to enforce these orders, including using drones on the moor, as I for one do not want to see another summer of our beautiful moorlands ablaze and the frightening prospect of a fatality.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

I shared and raised those views and we asked for a delay on the motorway closure till 12pm. There is plenty of roadworks and speed restrictions on the M62 with little going on so this shouldn’t be an issue.

As predicted, they didn’t work and there were huge tailbacks”\nAs a result angry motorists were abusive to local volunteers who tried to manage the problem\nCouncillor Garth Harkness added\n“They made a decision and left volunteers to deal with the aftermath which is shameful. They should not be expected to put up with abuse because of a decision they made that based on previous issues in Denshaw was never going to work.

Cllr Akhtar stated that the funding would not be pulled and the council and Education Funding Agency are committed to the project\nBreakfast clubs\nI asked a cabinet question relating to breakfast clubs. The Oldham Liberal Democrats have been surveying schools to identify the extent of the provision and want to do all we can to ensure that every child has access. The cabinet member has agreed for the council to commission a survey.\nFree School Meals\nCouncil agreed my motion unanimously and enthusiastically to lobby government to help provide universal free school meals for all primary aged children providing an extra 10,000 children in Oldham and Saddleworth with free school meals.\nWhen in government the Lib Dems introduced free school meals for every five, six and seven year old. This was championed by the then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg\nThis was an excellent reform which has helped to start early in helping bring down barriers and all children achieve in school. In Oldham for the first time 9,800 children in reception, year 1 and year 2 sat down and received a free school meal at the start of the last academic year\nWe want to see this increased to the age 8 to 11 bracket so that all primary school children can benefit. In Oldham there are currently 13,100 pupils in this age bracket, only 3,000 are eligible for a free meal.It would save £400 per child for parents on lunches on average but also. A hot healthy meal greatly increases concentration, behaviour and results of students.\nThe Liberal Democrat pupil premium provides extra support for schools to ensure that all can achieve their potential. Providing free school meals for all primary age children means that means that Children from all backgrounds, rich and poor sitting down for lunch together, ending any stigma of young pupils having to admit they receive free school meals is a good thing\nWe believe every child, regardless of their background, should have the same opportunities. No child should be hindered because they are not eating a nutritious meal at lunchtime\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

When the Liberal Democrat Administration was in power from 2008 to 2011 money was found and properly budgeted to keep drains clear and avoid many of these problems. Unfortunately the Labour Administration since 2011 has seen fit to remove this money from the budget and rely on reactive gully clearing instead of proactive; only do something after the event. Prevention is always better than cure and a proper policy in place would have prevented much of this misery for the residents of Delph, Diggle, Uppermill, Greenfield and Grotton.\nWhen this option was included in our Budget amendment in 2015 Labour, Tory, and Independent Councillors, including Cllr Nicola Kirkham voted against it. Now we have hand-wringing from all sides. A policy of clearing all drains only once a year is never going to work where some areas are clearly urban with little problem and some areas rural with drainage from hills and fields.\nA clearly thought out plan by the Council is needed taking into account all known factors. Look at our Budget proposals for the last 2-3 years. The Liberal Democrat Opposition would have spent more on these preventative measures because we recognised the current dangers which have come about because of the heavy rainfall.

It also ensures that there is less risk of homes flooding, less water and ice on the roads, which endangers drivers and pedestrians, and, in the long term, a reduction in damage to the roads caused by frozen water breaking the road surfaces.”\nIn its other spend to save measure, the Liberal Democrat Group wants to make available a further £272,000 in 2016/17 for investment in youth services by the District Partnerships/Executives.\nCommenting, Cllr Sykes said: “The Liberal Democrats firmly believe that local ward councillors and local peopl know best where money can be best spent on services in their locality. Local knowledge and requirements should determine the allocation of this money in each of the districts.\nThe Youth Service is an excellent service and investment in it saves money in the long run as young people are productively engaged rather than – in some instances – engaging in crime and anti-social behaviour.\nOur proposal will I hope be accepted by the administration in the same way they accepted our suggestion that this years cuts to District staffing be decreased.”\nDeputy Leader Cllr McCann, who will be seconding the amendment, stated that the extra money for the proposed investment will be found “reducing management, council publications, subscriptions and conferences and increasing income from optional council services”.\nThe Liberal Democrat Group is also proposing that in 2016/17 (ie during the next financial year) a review of the number of councillors takes place, with a reduction in numbers being considered.\nCllr McCann added: “A reduction in Councillors to two per ward instead of three would generate a minimum saving of £212,000 per year. We believe that such a reduction is possible now we have a Council run by a Cabinet rather than committees. We know this proposal will be popular because this was one of the suggestions that came forward from the public in the consultation over the budget”.\nCllr McCann was also pleased to see that the Labour Administration has adopted one of his suggestions in last year’s Budget debate that budgets on the Council’s capital programme could be reduced because of delays and efficiencies that he had identified.\nHe stated: “Last year, some Labour Councillors were adamant that I wanted to put the redevelopment of Oldham and Royton town centres ‘on hold’. In fact my common sense suggestion was that the figures in Labour’s budget simply did not stack up. Put simply they were allocating more money than they could spend in the financial year given delays in the capital programme.\nIt is interesting that this year Labour have quietly slipped in this very same proposal to the tune of some £5 million, hardly small beer. I am delighted that by building on our suggestion some of the harsh cuts to services have been mitigated and actual efficiencies found “.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is now held back until after the local elections, including the one for Greater Manchester Mayor, and previous experience suggests that keeping it hidden does not promise good news.\nThe climbdown this time was forced by Stockport Council – previous participants who now want none of it. Key to this were Stockport’s near 50% Liberal Democrat councillors. Yet again we see that the Liberal Democrats are the only serious opposition to GMSF.\nGMSF has even stirred up the local Conservatives. They proposed a motion to council – their first this century – against it.\nUnfortunately their record is at odds with their deeds. Locally they welcomed the government’s even worse proposals as a ‘brighter future’; their last Greater Manchester mayoral campaign was in favour of GMSF; and GMSF is put forward by both Labour and Conservative council leaders.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

There was no further consultation allowed, and the notice given was unreasonably short”.\nHe added “Once residents contacted me I requested that work was paused until their questions were answered. It is disappointing, to say the least, that the work continued. I have made it clear that this is no way to treat residents and no way to maintain public goodwill while the new school’s traffic scheme takes shape.”\nThe felling was part of the process to create a safe pedestrian route between Standedge Road and Huddersfield Road for pupils to get to school. It was always understood that some trees would be lost to achieve it.\n“It is a sacrifice but my guiding principle has been that we take no chances with pupil’ lives,” said Councillor Garth Harkness.\n“However the council overstepped the mark. I have secured a commitment that three new trees will be planted for every one lost, and I will make sure we get them. It will not cancel the sadness of losing the mature trees but it will be a benefit now and a substantial legacy for the future.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This is undertaken by an army of keen volunteers. But it just in one place – the centre of Oldham.\n“We have many districts within our borough and the range of activities available other than what the Council provides is extremely varied. In Shaw and Crompton there are many activities but these are mainly uniformed services – ie beavers, brownies and scouts. These activities do not appeal to everyone, so a Youth Centre is a hub for other activities. But we believe that our Youth Centre in Shaw will close” said Councillor Diane Williamson, Shadow Cabinet Member for Education and Safeguarding.\nIt does appear that youth services are expendable but this should not be the case; we need to invest in our youth service not cut it.\nCllr Williamson added: “The provision of a youth service may not be statutory but at least at present it engages with young people within districts and some of the problems the communities encounter can be combated by those youth workers who are going to lose their jobs. They are the ones that build up relationships with sometimes vulnerable young people and engage with them about the negatives of their behaviour etc.\n“When this provision goes we are going to lose all those relationships. A lot of our young people will not go to Mahdlo because they just cannot get to it. So where will they go. Hang about on the streets and then be accused of causing all sorts of problems?\n“We must not forget that the young people of our borough are our future and if we treat them with dignity and respect, rather than cutting something that helps construct positive relationships between people and communities, then perhaps they will continue to live in and build our borough, rather than move away at the earliest opportunity.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This motion helps turn that commitment into meaningful action by identifying two practical measures to help disabled and disadvantaged former soldiers, sailors and aviators.\n“Our latest proposals follow on from previous Liberal Democrat demands for the Council to guarantee job interviews to applicants from service backgrounds who meet the essential criteria for a post and for streets to be named for armed forces or emergency service personnel who tragically have been killed in the line of duty.\n“Our motion calls upon the Council to look to commission Royal British Legion Industries, a social enterprise which employs disabled ex-service personnel, to make road signage for the Council. This is of high quality and meets Department of Transport regulations. It’s a win, win situation – we get the signs we want to the standard we want at a price that we can afford and the RBLI provides meaningful employment and recycles any ‘profit’ into providing support for ex-service personnel in the community”.\nIn addition to working with the Department for Transport, the Royal British Legion Industries also works with the Ministry of Defence, Network Rail, local authorities and other partners by providing other instructional and safety items.\nThe motion is backed by Councillor Garth Harkness, Shadow Cabinet member for Employment and Skills:\n“Our motion is in two parts. As well as looking to commission RBLI to work with us, we want the Council to offer any necessary facilities – such as accessible meeting rooms at the Civic Centre – free of charge to RBLI to deliver Lifework courses to former service personnel adjusting to a new life in civvy street. This will help the Council meet its obligation under the community covenant and achieve our strategic goal to Get Oldham Working by providing specialist employment advice and support to former service personnel”.\nAndrew Slater from RBLI adds\nLeave a comment“As a charity with almost 100 years’ experience in providing services to Armed Forces communities, RBLI is proud to support organisations to deliver their commitment to the Community Covenant. We are particularly pleased to hear that, in this motion, Councillors of all parties attending a meeting of Oldham Council next Wednesday are being asked to take a practical approach to meeting the principals of the Covenant by appointing RBLI as its preferred supplier of road signage and offering Lifework’s assessment and employability support to veterans living in the community ensuring they will not be disadvantaged when seeking employment.” – Andrew Slater, Head of Sales – Signs\nLeave a Reply",

As well as revenue-raising, our strategy is to continue to identify savings in back-office bureaucracy and waste to free up money to support the services that are most valued by our ratepayers.”\nThis year, once more the Liberal Democrats are proposing measures that will generate more than £730,000 in savings each year – from reducing publications, printing and advertising, to tackling absenteeism; and reducing expenditure on employing agency staff and reducing the size of the communications/policy team. The cash saved will be spent on better roads, cleaner streets and more youth outreach provision.\nCllr Sykes said: “We recognise that this is only a relatively small amount compared to the many millions that this Council has been forced to save, but this modest amount could nonetheless be a game-changer – it would provide us with the revenue we need to borrow more than £5 million to invest in our key highways, with enough left over to radically improve our gully-cleaning service, restore a free Bulky Bobs waste collection service and pay for more youth outreach provision to engage with young people in our communities.”\nThe Liberal Democrats are calling for over £470,000 from the additional savings that they have identified to go to:\nCllr Sykes explained why the Liberal Democrat Group wanted once again, to focus on investing in highway improvements and tackling blocked gullies and fly-tipping across the Borough:\n“There is a backlog amounting to over £5 million in road repairs to our Borough’s main and secondary highways. Our highways improvement programme will make our key roads safer and smoother for drivers and their passengers and our Borough a more attractive one to travel in.”\n“An extra gully cleaning team and vehicle will mean we can free up more of the many gullies that are currently clogged with soil. When a gully is blocked water does not run away and the road can become slippery for drivers, especially when the water turns to ice. Local properties can also be flooded. Blocked gullies have to be dug out by hand, which is a slow and labour-intensive process that is costly. This timely investment on gully-cleaning represents good sense”.\n“We also full support returning Bulky Bobs to a free service. Time and again we read reports in the local press or hear from our constituents about furniture and other bulky household detritus being dumped in our streets. This is also a complaint made by several Labour Councillors in full Council over the past twelve months.”\n“Poorer people are unable to afford to pay for a collection service and irresponsible people do not want to. Making Bulky Bobs free again would mean that no one has any excuse for dumping these unwanted goods.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Councillor Sykes said:\n“We have spent a fortune on setting up the Oldham Education Commission yet we are bottom of the class for students getting the education place of their choice and we are providing an inadequate service at the Council for students with Special Educational Needs.\n“As an opposition group we have been raising our concerns for quite some time.\n“Young people with conditions like Autism, Dyslexia, learning difficulties or physical difficulties can often achieve great things if we provide the right support and bring down the barriers. Sadly, too often in Oldham this is not happening.

These pleas have been ignored and therefore we will redouble our efforts in opposing these plans that will concrete over and change the character of our Borough and especially Shaw and Crompton.\nTo the Liberal Democrat Group and many of our constituents, these plans represent a massive and inequitable land grab in Royton, Shaw and Crompton with the devastation of our local Green Belt and OPOL (Other Protected Open Land).\nIt is proposed that new properties will be built at Cowlishaw; in the Beal Valley; Rushcroft; the Whitfield Farm area over towards Newhey; and around Gravel Hole and Low Crompton.\nAdjacent sites at Broadbent Moss (Oldham), Hanging Chadder (Oldham) and land East and West of the A627M (Rochdale and Oldham) if developed would also see a significant erosion of the Green Belt land in the so called ‘Northern Gateway’.\nIt is the view of the Liberal Democrat Group that there is no justification for the construction of a large number of properties (or indeed any properties) on Green Belt or OPOL before new homes are first built on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted and upon the many derelict and unloved sites in our town centres and districts.\nFurthermore it is our view that conversions should take place so empty mills and factories can be used for housing (buildings and/or sites); as can land marked for industrial/commercial use; and bring the large number of empty homes back into use.\nAll this should be done before any consideration is given to future development on Green Belt or OPOL and this development for Oldham should, in our view, be apportioned better in the Metropolitan Borough rather than disproportionately in Royton, Shaw and Crompton as at present.\nOur existing motorways are frequently constrained by high levels of congestion resulting in unacceptable journey times and additional traffic jams on feeder and local roads. The projected growth of industrial warehousing, office space and new homes will require monumental investment in transport infrastructure. It is of paramount importance to ensure that the transport infrastructure is in place before other building takes place.\nAll the sites identified, especially those in Royton, Shaw and Crompton are devoid of good vehicular access and there is no obvious way to make the necessary improvements.\nCowlishaw has no acceptable roads leading into the proposed site. The topography around the Whitfield Farm area makes it difficult to envisage an elegant solution to site access. Similarly the Beal Valley site is currently served only by a narrow road and the desire to facilitate access to this site by enhancing links to Shaw and Crompton Metrolink Station seem incredulous; the only current access, via Beal Lane, is saturated with existing traffic and HGV movements to and from existing businesses which are large National/European distribution centres.\nThe increase in population will necessitate provision of additional services. The GMSF does not appear to adequately address available funding to deliver on these requirements.\nIn Shaw and Crompton, the necessary infrastructure to support even our existing population is lacking. We have primary schools that are already overcrowded or full; a secondary school that is falling apart; a dilapidated Health Centre that is near cardiac arrest; no swimming facilities or dry leisure provision; precious few youth facilities and no municipal tip.\nUnder the proposals, 3,000 homes will be built in Royton, Shaw and Crompton for growing families. These new residents will need more primary and secondary school places; more GPs and dentists; leisure and shopping facilities; and new highways and more buses and trams to get them there.\nNow doesn’t Oldham Council’s decision to close and not replace the Crompton Swimming Pool and Gym look a little short-sighted given the number of new young residents that will need to learn to swim and the number of adults that will want to keep fit.\nAn important vision of the GMSF is that Greater Manchester becomes as well known for the quality of its environment as for its economic success. Green Belt plays a role in this but there are important green spaces, parks, rivers and canals in the heart of our urban communities which are equally valuable. The protection and enhancement of our blue and green infrastructure is a central theme of the strategy.\nIn view of the above aspiration it is difficult to understand why the specific green sites in Royton, Shaw and Crompton have been proposed. There has been a lack of balance in the review and failure to give necessary weight to environmental and quality of life issues.\nThe vast majority of sites are notably attractive open spaces that provide pleasure, relaxation, and health benefits to local residents as well as our wider community. The sites include public footpaths enjoyed by many dog-walkers, ramblers and walking groups. Many of the Public Rights of Way are important to the historic Shaw and Crompton ‘Beating of the Bounds’ and Crompton Circuit walks. These locations also provide one of the few opportunities for people to undertake horse riding in safety which is particularly of concern for young and inexperienced riders.\nThese sites are further enhanced by a diverse range of flora and fauna and importantly provide those ‘green lung’ areas which minimise urban sprawl between built up conurbations.\nTwo of the sites include small but nevertheless important rivers within their boundaries; the Rivers Irk and Beal (Cowlishaw and Beal Valley respectively) help to prevent flooding and are attractive features of the two sites.\nAdditionally the Cowlishaw site is renowned for upwell of numerous local springs and given to serious flooding. The area has deep unstable subsoil that will require significant pilings leading to excessive construction costs.\nCowlishaw and Beal Valley also contain Sites of Biological Importance and these must be retained.\nIn regards to Saddleworth there is only one Strategic Site in the Spatial Plan, Robert Fletcher’s in the Greenfield valley, which has long been seen as needing a strategic view and plan to avoid piecemeal development. Indeed Saddleworth Parish Council presented an outline plan for the valley some years ago and has done so again in response to the spatial proposals.\nThe plan proposes some 175 houses and 10-15 ‘lodges’ which one assumes, given past happenings, would become houses. These houses given the lack of public transport or facilities and the preference for high value housing would do nothing to lessen the need for affordable housing in the area.\nThe topography and lack of transport links and the high value of local scenery makes other large sites hard to find in Saddleworth especially given the presence of the Peak National Park there.\nSaddleworth is, however, very vulnerable to the number of other smaller sites, some of them astoundingly unsuitable, offered for development in addition to those in this strategic framework.\nThe Green Belt and open spaces within Oldham are areas of pleasant natural beauty that make us unique in Greater Manchester.\nThe Oldham Council Liberal Democrat Group firmly believes that our precious Green Spaces should be protected.\nThe Group strongly advocates that no building on Green Belt or OPOL be undertaken until developments are first undertaken on Brownfield sites, on sites where planning permission for housing development has already been granted, and upon the many derelict and unloved sites in our town centres and districts; and also after the conversion of mills and factories into housing use and after every empty home has been brought back into use.\nOnly when all of these things have been done should we then; and only then; consider developing any part of our precious Green Belt.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Oldham and Saddleworth Liberal Democrats are saying NO to Conservative Government plans to replace the local management of National Parks with a so-called National Landscape Service, states Saddleworth North Liberal Democrat Councillor Garth Harkness.\nThe Conservative Government is expected to make an announcement shortly (may be after May 6) on the future of National Parks, like the Peak District, as well as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty after a two-year delay following the Glover Review in 2019.\n17 April marked the seventieth anniversary of the Peak District National Park, and Councillor Harkness is greatly concerned about plans to scrap, or downgrade, the National Park Authorities in favour of a centrally controlled and distant National Landscape Service.\n“This is one unwanted anniversary present that the Peak District National Park could do without,” said Councillor Harkness. “Parts of Saddleworth are included within the Peak District National Park and I know the Park is precious to everyone, both the people who live and work in it but to the thousands of visitors.”\n“The Liberal Democrats believe strongly that local public organisations like the National Parks should be managed and be accountable locally. At present, Oldham Council has an elected member on the Board. How can the Peak District and our other National Parks be better preserved and protected by a new National Landscape Authority which there will be no local representation and that is accountable to no-one?”\n“I will campaign to stop this Conservative Government from transferring control over the Peak District National Park from local authorities to Whitehall civil servants,” added Councillor Harkness. “Liberal Democrat councillors in Oldham and Saddleworth will be totally opposed to the abolition of the Peak District National Park Authority and we will fight any plans to do so.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is my belief that all our children or young people has just as much right to expect an excellent education as any other pupil.\nThe inspection team found that the revelation that Oldham is one of the worst-achieving areas nationally for educational achievement with these children and young people waiting too long for their needs to be identified. The poor achievement is exacerbated by high levels of fixed-term exclusions, persistent absences and failures of the school transport.\nMr. Mayor, this is simply unacceptable. We are leaving these children behind, abandoning them educationally. By not properly accessing the needs of these children, and the support that they need, at an early enough stage – sometimes not until they move from primary to secondary school – we are making it more likely that they will underperform at school. By excluding them and tolerating poor attendance, we are exacerbating this problem, and by having a school transport system that is not up to the challenge we make it harder to encourage parents to send their children to school in the first place.\nThe report called for a Written Statement of Action to be produced because of ‘significant areas of weakness in the local area’s practice’. Can the Cabinet Member please tell me tonight what action this Administration is proposing to address the failings highlighted in this report and when?\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The lease (and obligation to maintain and repair the car park) passed to OMBC when local government was re-organised not long afterwards.\nThe car park has gradually deteriorated since then and, though discussions between the church and OMBC continued over many years, the lease lapsed and the church has had to accept that OMBC no longer want to fund this car park as a public service.\nThe three Liberal Democrat Saddleworth North councillors, Alan Roughley, Garth Harkness and Derek Heffernan, have pledged to help towards the car parking issues in Delph and are appealing to others to help too. The NHS has provided some money towards resurfacing but more needs to be done\nMargaret Taylor, Property Steward, Delph Methodist said:\n“Because of its poor condition of the car park, the church has, on the advice of its insurers and solicitors, had to close the car park off – on safety grounds and to prevent further deterioration. The church does not have the resources to repair the car park nor to fund the ongoing maintenance required for a car park used by the public.\nThe church, however, appreciates how valuable the car park is to the local community and wants it to continue to be available for the use of residents and visitors to the village. Other car parking is in very short supply.\nSome local individuals and groups have already offered to help or made donations and the church is delighted that our local councillors – Alan Roughley, Garth Harkness and Derek Heffernan – have committed their remaining budget for 2013-14 to the works, giving the funds a welcome boost of £4350. These councillors work very hard on behalf of the local community and the church is very grateful for their support.\nA public appeal will be launched shortly to raise the funds needed to re-open the car park as quickly as possible and the church would be pleased to hear from anyone else who is prepared to help or contribute. “\nCllr Alan Roughley said\n“We have been working with the Methodist Church for several months to help them with the negotiations and battles with Oldham council and discussions with the NHS.

Now there is nothing wrong with supporting jobseekers with disabilities to find meaningful and fulfilling employment that is appropriate for them, taking account of their medical conditions, but this support must be accessed voluntarily and it should be adequately funded.”\n“Under these proposals, disabled jobseekers will continue to be subjected to the discredited and reviled Work Capability Assessment and many, despite being plainly sick, will be forced to look for work for which they are incapable. The Employment Related Service Association, which represents organisations offering employment support to disabled jobseekers, has also identified that funding for support will drop to less than £130 million next year.”\nThe Employment Related Service Association recently published a report which identified that the Government’s new Work and Health Programme will deliver support to less disabled jobseekers – down from 300,000 between 2012 and 2015 to 160,000 from 2017 to 2020 – with less funding – down from £750 million in 2013/14 to less than £130 million next year.\nCouncillor Harkness believes that local authorities and local charities are better placed to deliver support services to disabled people:\n“Councils and charities operate on the ground in communities where local disabled people live and local businesses operate. The Liberal Democrats believe that there should be a role for Oldham Council and our charity sector, especially with employment support and training being devolved to Greater Manchester level.”\n“The new Health and Work Programme should provide a stronger role for local authorities and local charities to deliver responsive and value-for-money services to suit local needs and requirements, and to work with local businesses to provide employment on an flexible and accessible basis, and to encourage and support disabled claimants to help them secure work experience placements and employment opportunities in which they have a genuine interest and to which they are suited.”\nCouncillor Harkness is especially hostile to the continued use of the Work Capability Assessment. He added:\n“Our view is simply that the hated Work Capability Assessment must be scrapped. It should be replaced by one that is based on realistic world-of-work tests of capability and functionality, and that takes proper account of medical conditions which fluctuate, mental illnesses, learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities and conditions on the autism spectrum.”\n“Local authorities should be invited to carry out assessments or be responsible for contracting out this function to others. These assessments need to be carried out in a humane and caring manner, with those being assessed being treated with dignity and understanding.”\n“It is also crazy that at present contractors who carry out assessments are not routinely required to contact doctors and other medical professionals caring for the person being assessed to collect relevant evidence. This would mean that more assessment decisions can be right first time, avoiding reconsideration and appeal costs, and more importantly significantly reducing the stress caused to claimants under the present system.”\n“And finally there need to be safeguards enshrined in law so that vulnerable claimants are not sanctioned when they fail to comply with the requirements of the assessment process simply because they cannot understand or engage with them.”\nThe Green Paper is open to responses on the consultation until February 2017.\nCouncillor Harkness said: “The Oldham Council Liberal Democrat Group will soon be making a robust and comprehensive response to this consultation.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is not uncommon for a developer to provide initial information before a planning application to elected members before submission of an application.

Arrangements have been made to hand over the Petition to FirstBus this week at their First Manchester Oldham Headquarters at Wallshaw Street.\nRetired Liberak Democrat Councillor Richard Knowles organised the Greenfield Bus Petition with help from Councillor John McCann, many local residents and local shopkeepers after requests for First Manchester to reinstate the twice hourly service were ignored.\nRichard Knowles, who has lived in Greenfield for over 30 years, says\n“An hourly bus service to Oldham is completely unacceptable. First Bus and Transport for Greater Manchester fail to understand that Greenfield is Saddleworth’s largest village in population but has the worst bus service. Uppermill enjoys three direct daytime buses an hour to Oldham, whilst Diggle and Delph have two per hour and Grotton six per hour.”\nFirstBus are ignoring Greenfield again when they undertake their Saddleworth Bus Consultation later this month based in Uppermill, Delph and Lees.\n“First Bus could easily reinstate Greenfield’s half hourly bus service either by extending one of the Grotton buses or turning back the 180 Bus in Oldham rather than Manchester.”\n1 Comment\nNot to be pedantic or anything, but I would just like to highlight the fact that they in fact enhanced the frequency of the 180-184 between Grotton and Oldham/Manchester to every 7-8 minutes around last Christmas time/just after – therefore the frequency of buses at Grotton is in fact 9 buses per hour (which includes 180/184 and the subsidised Stotts 343). This is further enhanced massively at peak times with extra FirstGroup journeys on the 343 and X84. There is one quite simple negotiative tactic for the Greenfield frequency, though I dare not say it due to not having my own sufficient evidence as to what effect it would have on two other routes in the areas.",

Derek was my ward colleague, my mentor and my friend.\nI first served with Derek in 2011 on Saddleworth parish council and had fond memories of his strong grasp of figures. Without fail Derek would always have some questions ready on the financial statements. I became Derek’s ward colleague in Saddleworth North in 2012. Derek was easy to get along with and his experience was eminence. When you discussed an issue with him he could recall some similar situation in 1998 and had a story to follow. Derek was keen on his stories and my favourite were often about his time as a VAT man for the Inland Revenue.\nDerek had a quiet and understated authority. His manner was friendly but assertive.He could work across parties with ease and command respect from all quarters. In a time where there is a lot of toxicity and mistrust in politics Derek’s conduct should prove a valuable lesson.If more politicians were like Derek then we would have far more trust in politics. This is one of the reasons I guess that he never lost an election in over 30 years.\nDerek was passionate about Saddleworth and worked hard as a councillor both on Oldham council and Saddleworth parish council He fundraised so much for many charities and in particular McMillan. As part of fundraising his bacon butties were legendary in Saddleworth\nDerek was a primary school governor and was incredibly active where he put his heart and soul into the role.He was well respected by staff and pupils alike.\nIn terms of Fire and Rescue Derek was the Lib Dems Steve Williams Derek has served as Chair of Saddleworh Parish council ,mayor of Oldham, Mayor of Austerlands and Father Christmas\nDerek suffered a fair bit in the last couple of years or so and not being able to always be in the same residence as Di was really hard for him.Derek was an independent man, sometimes frustratingly so.He would give so much help but not ask for it.\nDerek is what I would say is a true definition of a Liberal. As well as a great knowledge of the community he had a great knowledge of wine and beer too.He was kind and warm and positive. He was so easy to talk to\nDerek will be greatly missed.\nRest in Peace my friend.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This should involve pulling down the barriers to employment. If Jobseekers cannot get to interviews then we need to help them. Jobseekers often face barriers in accessing employment; for example, they often cannot find the money that is needed to buy the clothes or to pay the bus fare to go to an interview or start a job.\nIt is too common that claimants are unaware that Job Centre Plus offers help through its Flexible Support Fund, or that Transport for Greater Manchester, working with partners First Bus and Stagecoach, offers concessions to jobseekers travelling to interviews or a new place of work.\nPeople need to be aware of this and the Oldham Liberal Democrats are keen to make jobseekers aware of this help”.\nSeconder, Liberal Democrat Cllr Val Sedgwick added:\n“Sometimes we hear myths that people don’t want to work but the reality is that the vast majority of unemployed people are actively seeking work, but the reality is that they often face genuine barriers in taking up employment.\nPromoting access to the Flexible Support Fund and to these concessionary travel schemes remove another of the barriers into work.\nLiberal Democrats in government have been helping create more apprentices, more jobs and rebalancing the economy. It is good news to see unemployment in Oldham fall again and nationwide more people are now in employment than ever before. However we need to help those who are still unemployed to find work to “Get Oldham Working”\nCllr Harkness was particularly pleased to hear of the new concessionary travel schemes:\n“Last year I proposed a motion to Council asking Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) to look at establishing a concessionary scheme to make travel more affordable for apprentices or claimants in receipt of Job Seekers Allowance.\nI was very pleased to see it looks like someone at TfGM listened and these concessionary schemes appear to be the result. However, we need to recognise that Metrolink is becoming an important way to travel in the borough so we need to lobby for a concessionary scheme to be introduced here too”.\nCllr Sedgwick added:\nLeave a comment“I would also like to see more of our front-line Council staff receive training so they can become ‘travel champions’, supporting job seekers with journey planning and accessing the best travel deals”.\nLeave a Reply",

As the voluntary sector becomes more important amid cutbacks this is hardly going to help charities and voluntary groups to fundraise to equip them to take support the community.\nResolution re Car boot / Temporary Market Fees\nThe Saddleworth & Lees District Partnership deplores the decision by Oldham Council to remove the exemption of charity and voluntary groups from the paying of fees for holding temporary markets and car boot sales. The fee of at least £40 means, that in many cases, there will be little or no profit made for the charity or group.\nWe feel that this decision goes against the spirit and principles of the Co-operative Council when voluntary and community groups are being urged to take on more and more services. We therefore call on the Council to reverse this decision as soon as possible.\n2 Comments\nIs there any point in a stall if only £40 is made? Using places like churches and community centers is always a valid option for free sites. If a charity takes up a free stall, there may have been people willing to pay for that particular stall and so the market loses money for every free stall they give away.\nThe issue is that all will now have to pay",

Additional proposals for use of the existing site, along with the previous proposals of around 15 other alternative have all been rejected.\nThe Liberal Democrats believe we owe it to the people of Saddleworth and particularly the children to provide decent educational facilities. Currently Saddleworth School has the best results for its age group throughout the borough. We need a building which is going to maintain this high standard. The Liberal Democrats understand that this has come to a simple choice between a school on the Diggle site or no school at all.\nContrary to rumours the school is not being built on a greenbelt site although some fields will become playing fields and there will be a sports hall.\nMake no mistake with over 1100 spare places in Oldham schools at present it would be all too easy for Oldham Labour to ship pupils out of Saddleworth across the borough to solve a financial problem elsewhere. Those people who oppose a new school for Saddleworth are gambling with the future of the community.\nNo area like Saddleworth could maintain its strong sense of identity with no secondary school in it. Children deserve the best facilities we can give them and despite the heroic efforts of teachers on the Uppermill site that building is worn out and needs to be replaced. The needs of education when the Uppermill site was first built on bear no resemblance to the needs of a school in the 21st century.\nThe Liberal Democrats will now campaign with and for residents affected by the site to get the highways, design, noise protection and community use that they deserve to make the impact of a brand new school as positive as possible.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The motion has been passed to the scrutiny board\nDyslexia is a recognised disability and without reasonable adjustments\nit can be a huge barrier to gain employment or remain employed. With reasonable adjustments and appropriate support people can be extremely successful with dyslexia.Richard Branson, Tom Cruse, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein were all dyslexic. They have all been extremely successful despite this condition. Dyslexia does not have to hold people back but the sad truth is that it does. Many employers fail to understand the condition or make reasonable adjustments in interviews or in the actual work place itself. This means that there is often a great deal of talent and skills not being used effectively. We cannot have a stronger economy if we do not utilise peoples skills We cannot have a fairer society if we do not give people the support to flourish\nit is clear that if the barriers for dyslexia are addressed and people are given a leg up then they can succeed. As Lib Dems we believe in a stronger economy and a fairer society with Opportunity for Every-one.\nBritain may be in the fast lane in terms of job creation and unemployment is falling, but we need to ensure that people who may need a little more help are not left behind. The Liberal Democrats in Government have led the apprentice drive and are on course to deliver two million apprenticeships in Britain by the end of this parliament.The Government’s Ambassador for Apprenticeships is Gordon Birtwistle, Lib Dem MP for Burnley, and himself a former engineering apprentice.\nWe are seeing more young people choosing apprenticeships while hearing from businesses who say they simply couldn’t function without the talent and ambition they bring.\nDelivering on apprenticeships helps build the stronger economy and fairer society Britain needs and locally helps Get Oldham Working\nPeople need to be given the chance to relish such opportunities.\nThat is why we are building on our motion at the last council which sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for disabled people and carers who want to seek employment.\nAs part of its offer to Get Oldham Working, the Liberal Democrat Group wants to see Oldham Council offer specialist support and better access to technology to people with dyslexia in their quest for work and to support our employees so they can excel in their jobs\nIn order to support people with dyslexia in the work place we want to see\nLastly we want to look to the future and ensure we mark Dyslexia Awareness Week (5th to 11th October 2015) with suitable events to raise awareness amongst the public and employers and to promote this provision”.\nOnce more the Liberal Democrat Group is bringing a motion to Council that contains practical ideas to help more people in our borough get working.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Liberal Democrats support government proposals to introduce new legislation to create new offences for carrying acid or corrosive substances in a public place and in situations where retailers make sales of these substances to under-age customers. However, this will take time and in the meanwhile we would like to see the Council taking action.”\nHe is backed by his Liberal Democrat colleague, Councillor Garth Harkness:\n“In our motion, we are calling for the Council to establish a voluntary scheme in which local retailers agree not to sell acid and corrosive substances to young people. The National Police Chiefs’ Council identified in a survey that over one fifth of all attacks were carried out by offenders aged 18 or younger.

These have been compounded by additional allegations of threats to the Headteacher and members of staff\nCommenting as Chairperson of the Group, Councillor Chris Gloster, himself a governor of two Oldham schools, said: “allegations of this type are damaging to everyone, most of all to the pupils of the school who should be free to learn and develop in a safe and caring environment.”\n“We all have a duty to actively promote fundamental British values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs. British Values have been actively taught in schools since at least 2014. Any external interference of this important area of the school curriculum is unacceptable and must and will not be tolerated.”\n‘We also have a duty to protect staff and pupils and if these allegations have any truth behind them, they are abhorrent and there is no place for them in an inclusive society, which Oldham strives to be’.\n‘I have today written to the Leader of Oldham Council, Councillor Jean Stretton, and the Chief Executive of Oldham Council, Dr Carolyn Wilkins OBE, asking that the school and Council formally request Ofsted carry out a full and independent inspection of the school at the earliest opportunity. This way we can be satisfied as to how the school is being run and provide additional support if necessary to the school and its leaders’.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Clearly local Conservatives do not care about hurting the feelings of relatives, friends and party colleagues of the deceased in using this out-of-date image. Two of the three councillors, Susan Dearden and Brian Ames, sadly died in February and March 2018 and the third, my dear friend, former Mayor of Oldham councillor Derek Heffernan, in December 2019. Getting an up-to-date image of the current 60 councillors would have been so easy but local Conservatives obviously could not be bothered.”\nWhat makes the use of the image worse is that the Conservative election ‘promise’ not only represents breath-taking hypocrisy on their part, but it cannot be kept.\n“At every Annual Budget meeting of the Council from 2012 until 2020, the Liberal Democrats proposed a cut of Councillor numbers from 60 to 40 to save money. The Conservative Group never did. The reason we did not do so again in 2021 is that Councillor numbers in the Oldham Borough has been reviewed by the Electoral Commission in 2020 and fixed at 60”, added councillor Gloster.\n“When the Commission called for comments on councillor numbers late last year, the Oldham Liberal Democrat Group wrote back calling for a comprehensive cut in Councillor numbers to two from three per electoral ward. The Council took a vote at its meeting on 4 November 2020 to propose to the Commission that councillor numbers remain at 60, the Conservative councillors present voted with Labour, the Liberal Democrats did not. Against our wishes, the Commission stuck at 60, and now whatever the Tories might say it is now too late to do anything about it.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Cllr Harkness added: “Dyslexia does not have to hold people back; Richard Branson and Tom Cruise have both been successful in their chosen fields.\n“With reasonable adjustments and appropriate support, dyslexics can be successful in their career. However it is a sad fact that for many there is a lack of specialist provision and this means that the talents and enthusiasm of many jobseekers with dyslexia is lost as they find difficulty in securing gainful employment.\n“We wanted to ensure that the needs of jobseekers with dyslexia were properly addressed through the Get Oldham Working programme”.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

This should involve pulling down the barriers to employment. If Jobseekers cannot get to interviews then we need to help them. Jobseekers often face barriers in accessing employment; for example, they often cannot find the money that is needed to buy the clothes or to pay the bus fare to go to an interview or start a job.\nIt is too common that claimants are unaware that Job Centre Plus offers help through its Flexible Support Fund, or that Transport for Greater Manchester, working with partners First Bus and Stagecoach, offers concessions to jobseekers travelling to interviews or a new place of work.\nPeople need to be aware of this and the Oldham Liberal Democrats are keen to make jobseekers aware of this help”.\nSeconder, Liberal Democrat Cllr Val Sedgwick added:\n“Sometimes we hear myths that people don’t want to work but the reality is that the vast majority of unemployed people are actively seeking work, but the reality is that they often face genuine barriers in taking up employment.\nPromoting access to the Flexible Support Fund and to these concessionary travel schemes remove another of the barriers into work.\nLiberal Democrats in government have been helping create more apprentices, more jobs and rebalancing the economy. It is good news to see unemployment in Oldham fall again and nationwide more people are now in employment than ever before. However we need to help those who are still unemployed to find work to “Get Oldham Working”\nCllr Harkness was particularly pleased to hear of the new concessionary travel schemes:\n“Last year I proposed a motion to Council asking Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) to look at establishing a concessionary scheme to make travel more affordable for apprentices or claimants in receipt of Job Seekers Allowance.\nI was very pleased to see it looks like someone at TfGM listened and these concessionary schemes appear to be the result. However, we need to recognise that Metrolink is becoming an important way to travel in the borough so we need to lobby for a concessionary scheme to be introduced here too”.\nCllr Sedgwick added:\nLeave a comment“I would also like to see more of our front-line Council staff receive training so they can become ‘travel champions’, supporting job seekers with journey planning and accessing the best travel deals”.\nLeave a Reply",

The Conservatives are showing their true colours. We have a health secretary who is attacking junior doctors and then decides to hit out at hard working people who receive tax credits claiming people lack dignity and self-respect. He goes on to state that it promotes hard work. It is an insult. They already have targeted people with disabilities by changes to the Employment Support Allowance, the young by scrapping housing benefit for Under 25s. They now plan to target low paid working people now. The cuts in the tax credits are a direct attack on hard working people. The IFS calculation says 3 million families will be £1000 worse off as a result of this. This is on top of cuts people receive from a four year freeze. At the same time those who are able to pay a little more are not being asked to do so by this government. The whole rhetoric of blaming people for being ill, disabled or not having much money is morally repugnant. Tribalism on the left or right of politics with “us against them” is dangerous and will pull our communities apart. The creation of division, fear, resentment and isolationism. In times of difficulty the Liberal way is that we are stronger together and weaker apart. We should pull together, be open, generous and not penalise and vilify people because of who they are.

We and the church of course would welcome the support of the council in achieving this and would be keen to know what their plans are to support the church to bring this back into use and resolve some of Delph’s parking issues.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

He railed against the waste of money sending out the letter represents:\n“To be blunt this is an absolute waste of council tax-payers’ money. At this year’s March budget council meeting, I proposed cuts of £250,000 to the Council’s Communications budget because of clear examples of waste, and this is a prime example. This single communication to more than 90,000 homes in Oldham will have cost in excess of £70,000 in time, paper and postage to circulate. I honestly despair at this financial waste that cannot be justified in my view. What is even more galling is that the letter arrived at the same time that residents received their latest council tax bill increased yet again by this Labour Administration.”\nCouncillor Gloster also believes that the letter represents Labour electioneering propaganda at the public’s expense:\n“Sending out such a letter at this time is so wrong. The Labour council leader is personally up for election in May, and to circulate a letter at council tax-payers’ expense to every home in Oldham encouraging residents to work together with him just days before the election is formally called smacks of electioneering.\n“A former Local Government Minister once talked about ‘Town Hall Pravda’, political material put out at public expense. There is no doubt in my mind that this letter is electioneering in disguise and based on the numerous people who have commented on it to this effect, people across Oldham share the same view.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The majority of residents want a new school without further delay, so it is right that I support them but Oldham council need to do things properly and get this sorted now.”\n“Otherwise, the losers are the students who should be in a new building by now, instead of one which is getting to the point where it may not be safe much longer for them to remain.\nCllr Harkness promised: “I will keep working with Oldham Council to ensure that concerns are addressed, the highways are monitored and we still get our new Saddleworth School. “\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

As a result we have undertaken a number of steps to combat the issue:\nI would also urge people not to panic and to ensure they use their burglar alarms and lights when their home is unoccupied, and remain vigilant for any suspicious activity which they should report to the police.\nRegards\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

The Liberal Democrats want to see that changed.\nWe have seen how much we rely on our Police, Fire Service and NHS to respond selflessly and with courage and professionalism when faced with emergencies such as the MEN Arena terrorist bombing, Grenfell Tower fire and, last week, the Pemberton House siege in Shaw.\nBut we also continue to rely week in, week out on our Council refuse collectors to take away our rubbish and our care workers to care for our elderly relatives.\nAnd yet all the while this Government short-changes them. If Theresa May can find £1 billion to bribe Irish Unionists to make an electoral pact with her, she can find the money to pay a decent wage rise to public sector workers.\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

It is really important that Network Rail’s Northern Hub rail investment plan to increase capacity on the railway lines from Leeds, Sheffield and Liverpool into Manchester includes the case for reopening Diggle Station and the two disused Standedge railway tunnels. Diggle Station is already included in Oldham Council’s Strategic Plan but this is a golden opportunity to make it happen”\nCouncillor Harkness says\n“This is the best opportunity for a generation to make the case for reopening Diggle Station, which closed in the 1960s as part of the Beeching cuts. When the Northern Hub Plan was first published it included the reopening of the two disused Standedge railway tunnels. It is vital they remain in the revised version of the Northern Hub to be published this summer and that the case for reopening Diggle Station is included.”\n“Local residents have warmly welcomed this Petition and strongly support the re-opening of Diggle Station. A station in Diggle would also give a boost to visitors to the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, Pennine Way, South Pennines and Peak District National Park.”\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply",

Recently we’ve seen a number of positive tests across Saddleworth – specifically in Austerlands, Delph & Lydgate. Everyone needs to follow the national and local Coronavirus restrictions to help stop the spread as none of us want to see a family member or friend catching the disease. Council teams have already been out carrying out engagement work in the area and we’ll continue to do so as we try and support as many people as we can.\nDo your bit to help the community and remember the following:\nContinue keeping 2m apart distance from other people and washing your hands.\nIf you have symptoms, get tested and if the test is positive make sure you and everyone who lives in your house isolates.\nThe NHS continues to offer testing to anyone so book online at https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/ or by calling 119\nFor more information about the virus locally please visit the Oldham Council website at https://www.oldham.gov.uk/coronavirus\nIf you are business and would like to download free posters and graphics to show in work visit https://www.oldham.gov.uk/cvassets\nLeave a comment\nLeave a Reply"
