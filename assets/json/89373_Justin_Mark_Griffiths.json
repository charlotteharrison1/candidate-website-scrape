  "https_www_libdems_org_uk_donate": "Make a donation today × Close the window This policy was last updated on the 2nd May 2018 Introduction The Liberal Democrats (“the Party”) respect individuals’ rights over their personal data. We are committed to ensuring that people are treated fairly in everything we do. This Privacy and Cookie Notice (“Notice”) outlines: How we may collect personal data about you How we may use your personal data Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way The circumstances under which we may share your personal data or disclose it to others Additional details about cookies and technical information Data retention policies Your rights over personal data How to contact us Where this Notice refers to ‘personal data’ it is referring to data about you (or other living people) from which you (or they) could be identified – such as name, date of birth or contact details. This Notice applies to all personal data processed by the Party about its members and members of the public. This includes data gathered via third parties, such as social media sites, and which is therefore also covered by their own Privacy Polices. This policy was last updated on 2nd May 2018. Any updates will be posted to this version of the policy. If you wish to see a previous version of the policy, or have any other questions, please get in touch . The Party may collect personal data from you via means such as: In person, when you speak to one of our representatives or volunteers Through a telephone call, either where you call us or we call you On paper, such as if you return a printed survey or a reply slip on a leaflet Digitally, such as if you fill in a form on a website or interact with the party online When you offer or ask about volunteering, or take part in party activities When you enter into a transaction with the party, such as donating, joining, purchasing a product or paying for an event Indirectly from other public records or sources, including the full electoral register which the party is legally entitled to On social media platforms, where you have made the information public, or you have made the information available in a social media forum run by the Party We may collect personal data about you such as: Name Contact details (e.g. email address, address, telephone / mobile number) Date of birth Future communication preferences Information about your financial transactions with the Party Racial or ethnic origin Family details Political opinions Religious or other beliefs Other demographic information Information about your home (e.g. whether it is a flat or house) Issues you raise Topics you are interested in We may also collect information when you interact with the party digitally, such as by visiting one of our websites or communicating with one of our social media channels. This may include additional data to that above, such as: Your IP address Your device, browser or operating system Details of the links that you click and the content that you view Your username or social media handle Any other information you share when using third party sites (e.g. sending a tweet or using the Like function on Facebook) We may also place one or more cookies on your device. For further details on this, see below . We may also collect information about you from other public sources, such as the Land Registry, Companies House or other commercially available sources. We only do so where those sources are lawfully permitted to share the data with us and where we have a legal basis to process data from such sources. This may include, for example, checking the eligibility of a potential donor and may include additional data to that above, such as: Lifestyle and social circumstance Goods or services purchased Charities you support How we may use your personal data We may use your personal data to further our objectives, share it with our elected representatives and/or contact you in future. Examples of the way we may use your data include to: Contact you to canvass for political support Understand your views and issues important to you Process surveys you have participated in Tell you about policies, campaigns or individuals that may be of interest to you Respond to queries that you raise with us Administer offers or applications to volunteer for the party or to become, remain or cease being a member of or candidate for the party Conduct fundraising activities, including checking your eligibility to donate Manage our sites and services For more specific information about how we use your data for these activities, and the legal basis on which we rely to process your data in this way, please see the ‘Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way’ part of this Notice. If you have provided us with your email, mobile phone number or landline phone number and we have a legal right to use them for such purposes, we may use that information to contact you to promote causes and campaigns that we support, such as by sending you an email, online advert, or a text message. We will respect any registration you hold with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) except where you have opted in to receive phone calls on that number from us. You may opt out of communications from us at any time. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (i.e. between local, regional and national parts of the party and with our elected representatives) or with companies that provide services to the Party (“service providers”). For more information on service providers, please see here: https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-sharing . In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so. For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party. Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way The Party is a registered national political party in the UK; our work is designed to promote our values and to engage UK citizens in the democratic process. Accordingly, our work is considered to be of substantial public interest. Because of that public interest basis we are entitled to process sensitive personal data which relates to your political opinions, and your personal data more generally, for the purposes of enabling us to perform our work effectively. Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community. You do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to. For example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract. Similarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in holding your data in that way. Finally, where we have received your personal data in the various ways described above, we may continue to hold it as part of our records after the relevant processing has stopped. We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you). The circumstances under which we may share your personal data or disclose it to others The Party will not sell your personal data to third parties. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”). We may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject. With your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you. Please note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA. In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public. In particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public. For more details about this, please contact us . However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so.

The Party may store your personal data on secure servers either on our premises or in third party data centres. Click on the following link to learn more about our Cookies Policy . Data retention policies We only keep your personal data for as long as required to meet the purposes set out in this Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law. For example, this may include holding your data after you have ceased to engage with the party (such as by resigning or ceasing to be a member) where we have a legitimate interest in doing so, such as to enable us to respond effectively to grievances that may arise after you cease to engage with us. Where we collect and hold your details as part of our public interest work, this may also include retaining those details for as long as you remain a registered voter in the UK. Where permitted by law, we may also save personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, including historical research. This may involving passing such data to third parties who run historical archives . The exact details of this are set out in our Data Retention Policy, a copy of which is available here ( https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-retention ) and all the above is subject to your legal rights, such as to have data in certain cases deleted or corrected, as set out below. Your rights over personal data You have legal rights over any of your personal data that we hold. Right of access You may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold which relates to you (sometimes called a subject access request). This right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to your personal data. Right to rectification and erasure You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (sometimes called the right to be forgotten). Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is accurate. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request. Right to restrict processing Where we process your personal data on the legal basis of us having a legitimate interest to do so, you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid. You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify its accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it. Right to opt out of processing relating to your political opinions You may, at any time, write to us to ask us to cease processing your personal data which relates to your political opinions (such as how you have voted in the past, and things that you have told us about how you are likely to vote). Please note that these requests can only be made about data which relates to your political opinions; they will not affect our right to use other aspects of your personal data. Right to portability Where you wish to transfer certain personal data that we hold about you, which is processed by automated means, to a third party you may write to us and ask us to provide it to you in a commonly used machine-readable format.

After our record-breaking success last year, this election is our chance to elect even more hard-working Liberal Democrat local champions in communities up and down the country. Right across our great United Kingdom, people from all backgrounds and all walks of life, are working hard, raising families, helping others and playing by the rules. They haven’t forgiven the Conservatives for all the damage they did, but are disappointed that the Labour Government has failed to deliver the change they promised. People know that Liberal Democrats get the job done. Kemi Badenoch and the Conservative Party may sneer at us for being the party that will fix your local church roof, but we are proud to be focusing on fixing the local issues people care about – whether it’s cutting crime, helping you see a GP or dentist, or cleaning up rivers polluted by filthy sewage. Every vote for the Liberal Democrats counts. It's a vote to elect a strong local champion, who will fight for a fair deal for you and your community. Polling station finder by Democracy Club . Liberal Democrats work hard for our communities, we hear your concerns, and never take you for granted. People still haven’t forgiven the Conservative Party for all the damage they did to the country. They trashed the economy and sent people’s mortgages spiralling, left the NHS at breaking point and let water companies pump filthy sewage into our rivers and seas. It’s why so many former lifelong Conservative voters turned to the Liberal Democrats last year, and why so many are saying they will back us again in May. Kemi Badenoch has criticised the Liberal Democrats for focusing on issues like fixing church roofs, and being in our communities rather than on Twitter. We will proudly wear that as a badge of honour. Liberal Democrats fix things and work hard for the communities we represent. The Conservatives are totally out of touch and take voters for granted. People are rightly disappointed that the Labour government has failed to deliver the change they promised. We are opposing Labour where they have got it wrong on issues like winter fuel payment cuts, the family farm tax and the job-destroying National Insurance tax hike. And we are pushing them to go further on issues like building a closer relationship with Europe, standing up to Donald Trump and fixing the NHS and care. Nigel Farage is more interested in promoting his idol Donald Trump than fixing the issues facing our local communities. He says he admires Vladimir Putin, and wants to make you pay for your healthcare by privatising the NHS. Reform are too busy fighting amongst themselves to actually get anything done for local people. I'm voting Liberal Democrat Vote Liberal Democrat for a fair deal. Oops!

With many opportunities to get involved with the Liberal Democrats in your community, there are plenty of ways you can make a local impact. Such roles could include being a volunteer or campaigner, which could see you talking to voters and running community and election campaigns, or becoming a Local Party Officer and being responsible for the day-to-day running of your local party. These are just some of the many ways in which you can help and support the running of your local party. Various roles are also available at the national level. As a Liberal Democrat member you can submit motions or amendments to conference, join policy working groups and respond to policy consultations to help shape the future direction of the party and its policies. Beyond helping make policy there are opportunities to join the committees and party organisations, to become more involved in the decision-making process, all of which have a significant impact at the national level. Read more about each of these opportunities below and how you can help run the party, locally or nationally, below.

Become a Local Party Officer (LPO) LPOs are responsible for the day-to-day running of your Local Liberal Democrat Party. There are many different roles within each Local Party which all local members are eligible to stand for at your Local Party's annual general meeting (AGM). Every Local Party works slightly differently to take into account their different circumstances, ambitions and volunteers. But there are a few key tasks that every Local Party should be doing, and a smaller number of things that all Local Parties must do to meet legal and constitutional requirements. What roles are there? Each Local Party is constitutionally required to have both a Local Party Chair and a Local Party Treasurer: Local Party Chair: responsible for chairing local party executing meetings and providing guidance and leadership to all other LPOs. Local Party Treasurer: responsible for managing the local party's finances, e.g. preparing budgets and financial targets. Other key roles include: Local Party Data Officer Local Party Diversity Officer Local Party Membership Officer Local Party Secretary Your Local Party Executive may have a range of other roles including: Local Party Vice Chair, Local Party Executive Committee Member, Local Party Media Officer, Election Agent, Local Party Fundraising Officer, Local Party Visits Officer. For more on how to become an LPO and the different roles and responsibilities click here , contact your Local Liberal Democrat Party or get in touch at help@libdems.org.uk . Make policy The Liberal Democrats are not like other parties. Our members decide our policy. Their experience and understanding helps ensure we have the very best policies that matter to ordinary people. That's why, unlike the other parties, Liberal Democrat members can vote on all policy at our Party Conferences. No proposal can become Lib Dem policy until Conference has voted for it - and our members can even put forward their own proposals, which carry the same weight as any other ideas from our MPs or spokespeople. There are a number of ways that you can get involved in making policy: Submit motions and amendments to conference Join working groups Respond to policy consultations (individually or with your local party) Find out more about current Liberal Democrat policy here. Submit Motions/Amendments to Conference You will need to submit your motion a few weeks before Conference starts (January for Spring Conference and July for Autumn Conference). Emergency motions and amendments can be submitted up to a few days before Conference. Procedural motions can be submitted at any time using this link. Join Policy Working Groups Liberal Democrats make policy with our members. We develop policy in specialised teams called policy working groups. If you want to get involved, you can - either as a member of a working group or by responding to our consultations. Some of of the working groups currently in operation include: Opportunity, Skills and Training Working Group , Food and Farming Working Group, A More Caring Society Working Group, Britain and Europe Working Group, Natural Environment Policy Working Group. To see the impact these groups have, here is an example of a final paper from a previous policy working group. Find out more about future, current and past policy working groups here. Respond to Policy Consultations There is are currently no active consultations. As part of the policy-making process, the Federal Policy Committee (FPC) routinely consults members so that your views can inform the development of new Lib Dem policy. Each working group publishes a consultation paper and a shorter survey to get members views. See more on committees below. We'd be grateful for any feedback on how useful it is to have the consultations in this format. If you have any questions, please email Joe Wright at joseph.wright@libdems.org.uk . Join a committee As a party, we believe strongly in democracy, and this is reflected in our organisational structures. Our three main decision-making committees are elected by our members. The Committees report to Conference and engage with members through a variety of channels. Members can also join party organisations, which are groups of like-minded people who share a particular interest or identity. Most committees are elected. To find out more about upcoming internal elections and how you can stand for election, visit this page or check for vacancies here. The principal Committees of the Federal Party are: The Federal Board (FB) - provides strategic direction for the Party The Federal Policy Committee (FPC) - responsible for the Party's policy-making process The Federal Conference Committee (FCC) - responsible for staging Federal Conference The Federal Finance and Resource Committee (FFRC) - responsible for planning and administering the budget The Federal Communications and Elections Committee (FCEC) - oversees the implementation of the Party's strategy over elections, campaigns and communications The Federal People and Development Committee (FPDC) - oversees the implementation of the Party's diversity, training, membership and registered supporter strategies The Federal International Relations Committee (FIRC) - manages the Party's relationships with sister parties internationally The Federal Audit and Scrutiny Committee - leads the Party's internal audit work Find out more about the federal committees here.

  "https_www_libdems_org_uk_join_local": "Join the Liberal Democrats × Close the window This policy was last updated on the 2nd May 2018 Introduction The Liberal Democrats (“the Party”) respect individuals’ rights over their personal data. We are committed to ensuring that people are treated fairly in everything we do. This Privacy and Cookie Notice (“Notice”) outlines: How we may collect personal data about you How we may use your personal data Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way The circumstances under which we may share your personal data or disclose it to others Additional details about cookies and technical information Data retention policies Your rights over personal data How to contact us Where this Notice refers to ‘personal data’ it is referring to data about you (or other living people) from which you (or they) could be identified – such as name, date of birth or contact details. This Notice applies to all personal data processed by the Party about its members and members of the public. This includes data gathered via third parties, such as social media sites, and which is therefore also covered by their own Privacy Polices. This policy was last updated on 2nd May 2018. Any updates will be posted to this version of the policy. If you wish to see a previous version of the policy, or have any other questions, please get in touch . The Party may collect personal data from you via means such as: In person, when you speak to one of our representatives or volunteers Through a telephone call, either where you call us or we call you On paper, such as if you return a printed survey or a reply slip on a leaflet Digitally, such as if you fill in a form on a website or interact with the party online When you offer or ask about volunteering, or take part in party activities When you enter into a transaction with the party, such as donating, joining, purchasing a product or paying for an event Indirectly from other public records or sources, including the full electoral register which the party is legally entitled to On social media platforms, where you have made the information public, or you have made the information available in a social media forum run by the Party We may collect personal data about you such as: Name Contact details (e.g. email address, address, telephone / mobile number) Date of birth Future communication preferences Information about your financial transactions with the Party Racial or ethnic origin Family details Political opinions Religious or other beliefs Other demographic information Information about your home (e.g. whether it is a flat or house) Issues you raise Topics you are interested in We may also collect information when you interact with the party digitally, such as by visiting one of our websites or communicating with one of our social media channels. This may include additional data to that above, such as: Your IP address Your device, browser or operating system Details of the links that you click and the content that you view Your username or social media handle Any other information you share when using third party sites (e.g. sending a tweet or using the Like function on Facebook) We may also place one or more cookies on your device. For further details on this, see below . We may also collect information about you from other public sources, such as the Land Registry, Companies House or other commercially available sources. We only do so where those sources are lawfully permitted to share the data with us and where we have a legal basis to process data from such sources. This may include, for example, checking the eligibility of a potential donor and may include additional data to that above, such as: Lifestyle and social circumstance Goods or services purchased Charities you support How we may use your personal data We may use your personal data to further our objectives, share it with our elected representatives and/or contact you in future. Examples of the way we may use your data include to: Contact you to canvass for political support Understand your views and issues important to you Process surveys you have participated in Tell you about policies, campaigns or individuals that may be of interest to you Respond to queries that you raise with us Administer offers or applications to volunteer for the party or to become, remain or cease being a member of or candidate for the party Conduct fundraising activities, including checking your eligibility to donate Manage our sites and services For more specific information about how we use your data for these activities, and the legal basis on which we rely to process your data in this way, please see the ‘Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way’ part of this Notice. If you have provided us with your email, mobile phone number or landline phone number and we have a legal right to use them for such purposes, we may use that information to contact you to promote causes and campaigns that we support, such as by sending you an email, online advert, or a text message. We will respect any registration you hold with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) except where you have opted in to receive phone calls on that number from us. You may opt out of communications from us at any time. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (i.e. between local, regional and national parts of the party and with our elected representatives) or with companies that provide services to the Party (“service providers”). For more information on service providers, please see here: https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-sharing . In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so. For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party. Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way The Party is a registered national political party in the UK; our work is designed to promote our values and to engage UK citizens in the democratic process. Accordingly, our work is considered to be of substantial public interest. Because of that public interest basis we are entitled to process sensitive personal data which relates to your political opinions, and your personal data more generally, for the purposes of enabling us to perform our work effectively. Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community. You do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to. For example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract. Similarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in holding your data in that way. Finally, where we have received your personal data in the various ways described above, we may continue to hold it as part of our records after the relevant processing has stopped. We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you). The circumstances under which we may share your personal data or disclose it to others The Party will not sell your personal data to third parties. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”). We may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject. With your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you. Please note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA. In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public. In particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public. For more details about this, please contact us . However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so.

We are committed to ensuring that people are treated fairly in everything we do. This Privacy and Cookie Notice (“Notice”) outlines: How we may collect personal data about you How we may use your personal data Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way The circumstances under which we may share your personal data or disclose it to others Additional details about cookies and technical information Data retention policies Your rights over personal data How to contact us Where this Notice refers to ‘personal data’ it is referring to data about you (or other living people) from which you (or they) could be identified – such as name, date of birth or contact details. This Notice applies to all personal data processed by the Party about its members and members of the public. This includes data gathered via third parties, such as social media sites, and which is therefore also covered by their own Privacy Polices. This policy was last updated on 2nd May 2018. Any updates will be posted to this version of the policy. If you wish to see a previous version of the policy, or have any other questions, please get in touch . The Party may collect personal data from you via means such as: In person, when you speak to one of our representatives or volunteers Through a telephone call, either where you call us or we call you On paper, such as if you return a printed survey or a reply slip on a leaflet Digitally, such as if you fill in a form on a website or interact with the party online When you offer or ask about volunteering, or take part in party activities When you enter into a transaction with the party, such as donating, joining, purchasing a product or paying for an event Indirectly from other public records or sources, including the full electoral register which the party is legally entitled to On social media platforms, where you have made the information public, or you have made the information available in a social media forum run by the Party We may collect personal data about you such as: Name Contact details (e.g. email address, address, telephone / mobile number) Date of birth Future communication preferences Information about your financial transactions with the Party Racial or ethnic origin Family details Political opinions Religious or other beliefs Other demographic information Information about your home (e.g. whether it is a flat or house) Issues you raise Topics you are interested in We may also collect information when you interact with the party digitally, such as by visiting one of our websites or communicating with one of our social media channels. This may include additional data to that above, such as: Your IP address Your device, browser or operating system Details of the links that you click and the content that you view Your username or social media handle Any other information you share when using third party sites (e.g. sending a tweet or using the Like function on Facebook) We may also place one or more cookies on your device. For further details on this, see below . We may also collect information about you from other public sources, such as the Land Registry, Companies House or other commercially available sources. We only do so where those sources are lawfully permitted to share the data with us and where we have a legal basis to process data from such sources. This may include, for example, checking the eligibility of a potential donor and may include additional data to that above, such as: Lifestyle and social circumstance Goods or services purchased Charities you support How we may use your personal data We may use your personal data to further our objectives, share it with our elected representatives and/or contact you in future. Examples of the way we may use your data include to: Contact you to canvass for political support Understand your views and issues important to you Process surveys you have participated in Tell you about policies, campaigns or individuals that may be of interest to you Respond to queries that you raise with us Administer offers or applications to volunteer for the party or to become, remain or cease being a member of or candidate for the party Conduct fundraising activities, including checking your eligibility to donate Manage our sites and services For more specific information about how we use your data for these activities, and the legal basis on which we rely to process your data in this way, please see the ‘Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way’ part of this Notice. If you have provided us with your email, mobile phone number or landline phone number and we have a legal right to use them for such purposes, we may use that information to contact you to promote causes and campaigns that we support, such as by sending you an email, online advert, or a text message. We will respect any registration you hold with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) except where you have opted in to receive phone calls on that number from us. You may opt out of communications from us at any time. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (i.e. between local, regional and national parts of the party and with our elected representatives) or with companies that provide services to the Party (“service providers”). For more information on service providers, please see here: https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-sharing . In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so. For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party. Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way The Party is a registered national political party in the UK; our work is designed to promote our values and to engage UK citizens in the democratic process. Accordingly, our work is considered to be of substantial public interest. Because of that public interest basis we are entitled to process sensitive personal data which relates to your political opinions, and your personal data more generally, for the purposes of enabling us to perform our work effectively. Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community. You do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to. For example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract. Similarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in holding your data in that way. Finally, where we have received your personal data in the various ways described above, we may continue to hold it as part of our records after the relevant processing has stopped. We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you). The circumstances under which we may share your personal data or disclose it to others The Party will not sell your personal data to third parties. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”). We may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject. With your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you. Please note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA. In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public. In particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public. For more details about this, please contact us . However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so.

Preamble to the Liberal Democrat Constitution The Liberal Democrats stand firm on seven core values: liberty, equality, democracy, community, human rights, internationalism, and environmentalism. Each of these underpin the party's specific policy proposals. Liberty We believe in the right of individuals to make their own decisions about how they live their lives, as long as they do not cause harm to others. Our aim is to empower and support individuals to pursue their dreams, to make the most of their talents and to live their lives as they wish. Equality We stand by the idea that without equality, true liberty cannot be realised. This requires an active state to: ensure that no one is held back by poverty, poor health, or discrimination, including on the basis of personal characteristics or beliefs; provide access to education or training, and other public services, including a welfare safety net; and guarantee that everyone enjoys equality before the law. Democracy We understand that through democracy, every citizen is empowered to make their voice heard, without being dominated by entrenched interests or the power of money; checks and balances, so that those in power cannot abuse their positions for personal gain or political advantage; and a plurality of views, where no individual or organisation is deterred from speaking truth to power. Community We believe it is important to provide support for a diverse range of organisations that enable individuals to join together in the pursuit of common goals or activities; and the decentralisation of political and economic power to local government and the nations and regions of the UK. Human Rights Upholding these values of individual and social justice, we reject all prejudice and discrimination based upon race, ethnicity, caste, heritage, class, religion or belief, age, disability, sex, gender identity or sexual orientation and oppose all forms of entrenched privilege and inequality. Internationalism Liberal Democrats are proud internationalists. We believe that our country and our people thrive when we are open and outward-looking. The UK can be an incredible force for good when it stands tall on the world stage, championing the values of equality, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We are passionate about close British-European cooperation, which benefits us and our allies. While we support a longer-term objective of EU membership, we recognise that the Conservatives have damaged trust in the UK so badly that there is a lot of work to do before that is possible. We have therefore set out a comprehensive step-by-step plan to rebuild our ties of trade, trust and friendship with our nearest neighbours – ties that can only be built back gradually over time. Environmentalism We value the importance of acting at home and internationally to promote environmentally sustainable means of production and consumption and living in harmony with nature.

Our campaigning victories deliver a fair deal for people across the UK. Find out how we've delivered for communities like yours. 2025 - Solar Energy Max Wilkinson MP brought forward a Private Member's Bill to ensure that solar panels are fitted to all new homes as standard. This would cut energy bills, reduce carbon emissions and improve Britain's energy security. In June, the Government committed to include these measures in the updated Future Homes Standard. 2025 - Protecting Survivors of Domestic Abuse Josh Babarinde MP secured a change in the law to see domestic abusers properly identified at sentencing. This will close a dangerous loophole that saw domestic abusers released early from prison because they were convicted of general offences like ABH, assault or battery - posing a threat to victims. Domestic abuse has a devastating impact on survivors, and the law is leaving too many of them without protection. My bill will mean abusers can no longer hide behind more general convictions they’ve relied on until now.\" Josh Babarinde MP 2025 - Court Transcripts Since 2023, Sarah Olney MP campaigned to make transcripts of court proceedings free to access for survivors of rape and sexual abuse. One of her constituents was asked to pay over £7,000 to access their case transcript. A transcript of the judge's sentencing remarks is essential in providing clarity, and supporting victims. In May 2025, the Government announced that victims of rape and sexual assault will be able to access sentencing remarks without charge. 2025 - Free School Meals After years of Lib Dem campaigning for an extension of free school meals to help tackle child poverty, the Government has finally listened - any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible from next year. This change will improve children's nutrition, boost educational attainment, and help families struggling in the cost of living crisis. 2024 - Support for Carers Ed Davey's first ever Prime Minister's Question to Keir Starmer focused on the scandal of family carers being unfairly pursued for repayments of Carer's Allowance. It's a scandal that dragged on for years under the previous Conservative Government. In October 2024, we secured the biggest ever increase in the earnings limit for Carer's Allowance, helping more than 60,000 unpaid carers as they juggle work with caring responsibilities. And in December 2024, under pressure from Ed Davey and campaigners, the Government finally announced an independent review of Carer's Allowance overpayments. 2023 - Worker Protection Act Wera Hobhouse's Worker Protection Act gives employees protections from sexual harassment in the workplace. The Bill presents an opportunity to shift the culture in our workplaces where harassment is no longer tolerated. It will create a duty on employers to prevent harassment from happening and should bring about a long-term change in attitudes. 2023 - Carer's Leave Act Wendy Chamberlain's Carer's Leave Act gives 2.4 million across the UK a statutory right to take five days of unpaid leave per year, helping carers to better balance work and care. The law has been described by the charity Carers UK as a ‘landmark’ piece of legislation. It is a first step to providing the greater support unpaid carers need. 2023 - Blocking a taxpayer payout to sewage-dumpers Richard Foord MP's amendment to the UK Infrastructure Bank Act stopped the Conservatives' plan to write a blank cheque of taxpayers money to polluting water companies. The Lib Dem win means the UK Infrastructure Bank will only be able to fund water companies if they produce a costed and timed plan for ending sewage discharges into rivers. 2022 - Vagrancy Act repeal secured The Vagrancy Act of 1824 makes it a criminal offence to beg or be homeless on the street in England and Wales. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran began the national campaign to repeal this cruel, Dickensian law in 2018 when a group of Oxford students brought the issue to her attention. Both Houses of Parliament voted to repeal the law in 2022, after 4 years of hard work from both MPs and activists. After more campaigning, the Government promised that the Act would finally be scrapped for good in 2025. Sleeping rough should not be a crime. Scrapping this archaic law represents the first step in a journey to taking a more compassionate and holistic approach to homelessness. Layla Moran, 2021 2021 - New visas introduced to allow people from Hong Kong to come and live in the UK The British National Overseas (BNO) visa grants Hong Kongers the right to live, work and study in the UK. Since the new visa programme launched, over 120,000 Hong Kongers have applied to move to Britain. Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael led the charge to introduce the new visa programme through his Hong Kong Bill. 2021 - New International Learning Exchange As Wales' Education Minister, Kirsty Williams MS secured a ground-breaking replacement for Erasmus+. The programme goes far beyond the UK Government's Turing Scheme. The scheme will fund 15,000 Welsh learners to study overseas with funding guaranteed until at least 2026. And 10,000 global learners will come to Wales to study and exhange experiences. 2021 - Blood donation barriers lifted for gay and bisexual men The Liberal Democrats had been pushing to lift the ban on men who have sex with men's ability to donate blood for over 15 years by the time it was finally implemented in 2021. While there is still progress to be made in regards to discriminatory restrictions on blood donation, this was a huge leap forward, one which the Lib Dems have long campaigned for. 2018 - Upskirting outlawed Upskirting is a highly intrusive practice, which typically involves someone taking a picture under another person’s clothing without their knowledge. In 2018, Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse tabled a Private Members’ Bill to make upskirting a specific crime – something that finally became law in the Voyeurism (Offences) Act 2019, following a tireless national campaign. 2016 - Improving Renters Rights Lib Dem pressure to help renters afford a home and reduce upfront costs proved successful in 2016, with the government announcing a ban on letting fees for tenants in the Autumn Statement of that year. This came only a few days after Liberal Democrat peer Olly Grender's Renters’ Rights Bill was debated in parliament. Our relentless campaigning to get tenants’ letting fees banned has finally paid off and the Government has recognised this is the right thing to do. Olly Grender, 2016 2015 - International aid spending enshrined in law In 2015, Lib Dem MP Michael Moore's Private Member's Bill was passed overwhelmingly to enshrine in law the target for 0.7% of gross national income to be spent on international development aid. As a result, the UK is a world leader in international development, and billions more pounds have gone to help the world’s poorest people. Last year, the Conservative Government shamefully broke the 0.7% commitment, so Liberal Democrats are now fighting to restore it. 2015 - Revenge porn banned Liberal Democrats led the campaign to ban revenge porn - the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent, and with the intention of causing them distress. The campaign was a success with revenge porn elevated to a criminal offence, with sentences of up to two years in prison for those convicted. 2015 - First mental health waiting time targets introduced Liberal Democrat Health Minister Norman Lamb introduced the first ever waiting time standards for mental health treatment, targeting talking therapy in as little as 6 weeks, with a maximum wait of 18 weeks, and treatment for first instances of psychosis guaranteed within 2 weeks of referral. This brought treatment targets  for mental health problems on par with physical health for the first time. 2014 - Free School Meals for all infants Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Schools Minister David Laws introduced free school meals for all infant pupils to help every child from every background get the best possible start in life, regardless of their family income. The move benefited children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 2. Universal free school meals will help give every child the chance in life that they deserve, building a stronger economy and fairer society. Nick Clegg, 2013 2014 - Same-sex Marriage In March 2012, Liberal Democrat Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone launched a consultation on how to introduce civil marriage for same-sex couples in England and Wales. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill was introduced into Parliament on 24 January 2013 and became law in July 2013. On 29 March 2014, the first same-sex couples were married. 2014 - Shared Parental Leave In 2013, Liberal Democrat Minister Jo Swinson sought to give mums and dads the opportunity to share their parental leave. The Shared Parental Leave Regulations she introduced in 2014 allow parents to divide parental leave between them. Mothers and adopters have more flexibility to choose when they return to work and fathers and partners are able to spend more time bonding with their children during the precious early stages of their development. Shared parental leave is good for children, good for families and good for equality. Jo Swinson, 2019 2012 - Green Investment Bank Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable led the formation of the Green Investment Bank, funding it with £3 billion of government money to invest in the successful transition to a low-carbon economy. Since its inception, it has avoided 222 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to removing 3 million cars from the road, and generated enough renewable energy to supply more than 5 million homes. 2010-15 - Cracking down on tax avoidance The Liberal Democrats led moves to clamp down on tax avoidance by the richest. Someone earning £1 million a year had to pay £381,000 more in tax than prior to the reforms. An extra £9 billion was raised each year as a result. Help us keep demanding change — join our fight today. Yes, I'm in 2010-15 - Cutting tax for the poorest When we were in government, the Liberal Democrats lifted 3.4 million of the lowest earners out of paying income tax altogether. By raising the personal allowance, we gave more than 26 million people an £825 tax cut. For the average family, this cut their income tax bill by over a third. 2011 - Ending detention of children for immigration purposes The Liberal Democrats ended the previous Labour Government's practice of detaining children for immigration purposes. Overnight detention of children at Dungavel House, Yarl's Wood and Tinsley House was ended in 2011. A new centre, Cedars, which could accommodate 9 families for a maximum of 72 hours and was run by Barnardo’s, was opened in August 2011. 2011 - Armed Forces Covenant The Armed Forces Act of 2011 created the requirement for an annual Armed Forces Covenant report to Parliament each year. This report sets out how the Government is supporting our Armed Forces, their families, and veterans in key areas such as healthcare, housing and education. 2011 - Pupil Premium In April 2011, the Liberal Democrats introduced the Pupil Premium and the Service Premium, to help children who might otherwise fall behind at school. This gives schools an extra £2.4 billion a year to close attainment gaps for disadvantaged pupils and care leavers and to assist with the pastoral needs of children with parents in the armed forces. A fairer society. That's what the Pupil Premium is for. Billions of pounds to stop poor children falling behind. Nick Clegg, 2013 2011 - ID cards scrapped Nick Clegg led the opposition to the Labour Government’s illiberal and expensive plans to force everyone to carry a government-issued ID card. He even said he’d go to jail to oppose the law if it was introduced. In Government, the Liberal Democrats scrapped the plans for ID cards altogether. 2010 - Pensions Triple Lock We believe everyone should be able to afford a decent retirement when the time comes, so we introduced a ‘Triple Lock’ to protect the state pension, ensuring that it rises each year in line with inflation, earnings or 2.5% – whichever is highest. This guarantees that we will never again see pensions go up by just 75p, like they did under Labour in 2000. 2009 - Gurkha settlement rights On 29th April 2009, a Liberal Democrat motion that all Gurkhas - Nepalese soldiers who serve in the British Army - be offered an equal right of residence was passed, allowing Gurkhas who served before 1997 residence in the UK. 2005 - Blocking 90-day detention without charge Liberal Democrat MPs voted down Tony Blair's proposal to allow police to hold suspects for 90 days without charge. 2003 - Section 28 repealed Liberal Democrat MP Ed Davey moved the clause that repealed Section 28, a series of laws introduced by Margaret Thatcher's government that prohibited the \"promotion of homosexuality\" by local authorities, including teaching about same-sex relationships in schools. 1998 - Human Rights Act Right from our founding, the Liberal Democrats campaigned to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, to allow us all to enforce our fundamental rights and freedoms in British courts. The Human Rights Act does exactly that. It protects everyone’s right to a fair trial and to keep their private life private. It bans torture, slavery and forced labour. It ensures we have freedom of religion and expression. And it empowers every individual to challenge governments in court to uphold their rights. We supported the Human Rights Act when it was passed, successfully defended it against the Conservatives’ attempts to repeal it when we were in Government, and are continuing to fight their renewed efforts to tear it up.

The scale of our 2024 General Election success would not have been possible without generous legacies received that helped boost our campaign. These gifts helped us win additional key battleground seats which otherwise would not have got over the line. The Future Fund will help us build upon the best result in the party’s history by electing more local champions across our communities. With your support, we can secure a more liberal future for Britain. Download Our Free Will Writing Guide How you can leave a gift in your Will It is easy to leave something for Liberal Democrats in your Will, while also providing for your loved ones. To make the process easier, we’ve partnered with Farewill, the UK’s leading online will-writing service, to offer free Will creation or amendments. You can write your Will from home in under 30 minutes Write your will for free Legacy gifts can be a fixed amount, a percentage of your estate, or proceeds from specific items like jewellery or stocks. Leaving a percentage of your estate is the most popular option, because your gift stays in line with inflation and other changes in value. Your Will is personal and should reflect your wishes. A solicitor, financial advisor, or professional Will writer - like Farewill - can help ensure it meets your needs. Download Our Free Will Writing Guide “Our party is driven by the commitment, passion and generosity of members, activists and supporters like you, who have dedicated vital support to the Liberal Democrats. “Leaving a gift in your will to the Liberal Democrats is one way to recognise and protect the values and beliefs you have championed as a committed Liberal Democrat.” Ramesh Dewan, Chair of the Liberal Democrat Future Fund & Legacy Society How leaving a gift in your Will makes a difference Without the incredible kindness and support of legacy pledgers, we would not be able to continue supporting the candidates and campaigns which protect the future of the Liberal Democrats. Gifts in Wills can take many forms - they can be a fixed amount, a percentage of your estate, or the proceeds from a specific gift, like a piece of jewellery or stocks and shares. Leaving a percentage of your estate is an approach that reduces the need to revise your will in line with inflation or other changes in value. 5% of the average UK estate, could fund a professional campaign organiser for a year to help elect a new MP or take control of a council. 10% of the average UK estate, could fund two rounds of letters to key swing voters across a council area, delivered by Royal Mail. 20% of the average UK estate, could fund a marketing plan for a target constituency for a whole year with leaflets, letters and digital advertising. 50% of the average UK estate, could fund a professional campaign organiser and marketing plan for a full five year parliamentary cycle Join our Legacy Society When you leave a gift to the Liberal Democrats in your Will, you’re entitled to join The Legacy Society.

We may also collect information when you interact with the Party’s website and social media pages. This may include data in addition to that above, such as: Your IP address Your device, browser or operating system Details of the links that you click and the content that you view Your username or social media handle Any other information you share when using third-party sites (e.g. sending a tweet or using the Like function on Facebook). We may also place one or more cookies on your device. For further details on this, see below. If you interact with our websites or provide us with your email address or telephone number we may use it to create custom audiences to ensure the online political messaging adverts you receive from us is relevant to you. We may also use those audiences to create lookalike audiences . You can opt out of personalised online advertising by completing our Opt Out form. It may take up to one month for requests submitted this way to become effective on our systems. We will respect any registration you hold with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) except where you have opted in to receive phone calls from us to that number. You may opt out of communications from us at any time. Who we may share your data with and transferring your data outside of the UK and European Economic Area The Party will not sell your personal data to third parties. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data, it may be shared within the Party (i.e. between local, regional and national parts of the Party and with our elected representatives) or with companies that provide services to the Party (“service providers”). For more information on service providers, please see: Who we share data with . We may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data (including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service), fulfilling their legal obligations and assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject. With your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you. Some of our service providers are based outside of the UK and the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA and that country has not been deemed ‘adequate’ by the UK or European Commission, we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld. In almost all cases, we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain either the UK Addendum to EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or an International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA). This means your personal data will be treated as if they themselves were based in the UK. In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police, where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records (including personal data) of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some donation details are made public. For more details about this, please contact us. However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so. For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party. Why the Party is allowed to use your data in this way Access to the full Electoral Register As a registered national political party in the UK, The Liberal Democrats are entitled to a copy of the full Electoral Register under the Representation of the People Regulations 2001. The full Electoral Register is different to the open Electoral Register as it contains details of all voters in the UK, including those who have opted out of the open register. We do contact voters outside of election periods we do this using the legal basis of Legitimate Interests (UK GDPR Article 6(f)), however, we will honour opt outs for this type of communication upon request. During Parliamentary election periods, we are also permitted to send one Freepost mailing to all voters under Section 91 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. Legal basis for processing your data The UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 provides a list of reasons that an organisation may use to permit them to process personal data. These reasons are known as ‘Legal Basis.’ Please refer to the tables above which give the details on our legal basis for processing your data. You do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes and can find further details about those rights here. In addition to the above, we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to. For example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract. Similarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by email (or similar mediums) which promote our work - we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications, we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legal obligation in holding your data in that way. We will only hold data about you if we have a legal basis for doing so. If we find that we no longer need your data for the purpose it was acquired, or we can no longer establish a legal basis for holding your data, then we will delete it as soon as possible.

Where permitted by law, we may also save personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, including historical research. This may involve passing such data to third parties who run historical archives.

Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase, we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request. Right to Restrict Processing Where we process your personal data on the legal basis of us having a legitimate interest to do so, you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.

If for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it.

And we will pay for it fairly, too. After years of Conservative chaos and neglect, there is no doubt that our NHS, social care, schools and other public services desperately need more investment. GPs are overstretched, hospitals are overcrowded and school buildings are crumbling. At the same time, families and pensioners are struggling in the face of a cost-of-living crisis. The Conservatives have already put up their taxes by freezing income tax thresholds. It would be wrong to ask them to pay more to clear up the Conservatives’ mess. That’s why we will fund our fair deal without raising income tax, national insurance contributions or VAT. Instead, we will focus on tax changes that make the system fairer – such as reversing the Conservatives’ tax cuts for the big banks and imposing a proper windfall tax on the super-profits of oil and gas companies. Responsible public finances are essential for the stability, certainty and confidence that drive economic growth, and for getting mortgage rates under control. The Conservative Government has shown all too clearly the damage and pain caused by fiscal irresponsibility. Under our plans, we will get the national debt falling as a share of the economy and ensure that day-to-day spending does not exceed the amount raised in taxes.

He describes the core values that drive him as compassion, community and fairness. Ed has been a carer for most of his life: first for his mum, who died of cancer when he was a teenager; then for his Nanna in her final years; and now he and his wife Emily care for their severely disabled son John. Ed was first elected to Parliament by the people of Kingston and Surbiton in 1997. Since then he has helped tens of thousands of people across the constituency, winning investment in Kingston’s A&E and maternity unit, getting new health centres built, and securing a new service to support family carers. When he became Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed vowed to be the voice of carers. He draws on his long experience of caring to stand up for other family carers and fight for investment in the NHS and social care. Ed has led the Liberal Democrats to a record number of MPs at the 2024 General election, following on from four historic by-election victories over the Conservatives in the 2019-2024 Parliament in Chesham and Amersham, North Shropshire, Tiverton and Honiton and Somerton and Frome. He is fighting to transform British politics, so that we can fix the health and care crisis, get our economy back on track, end the sewage scandal and give people the fair deal they deserve.

LGBT+ people have always existed. From artists, activists and athletes to scientists, innovators and pioneers, they have helped shape our country and our world, even when their sexuality and stories were erased. This year’s theme, Science and Innovation, highlights the vital contributions LGBT+ people have made to fields from healthcare and engineering to environmental science and technology and reminds us that diverse voices have driven progress for everyone. From Barbara Burford, a medical researcher who established NHS equality and diversity guidelines to Alan Turing, a mathematician who conceived modern computing and played a crucial part in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, to Robert Boyle, a founder of modern chemistry and the modern scientific method, history is littered with the contributions of LGBT+ scientists. However, this month also calls for honesty. For too long, science has been misused to pathologise and marginalise LGBT+ identities, causing real harm. Still today, many LGBT+ people face discrimination in healthcare, education, housing and employment, as well as being victims of hate crime and hostility. No one should be made to feel unsafe, invisible or lesser simply because of who they are. The Liberal Democrats have a proud legacy of leading the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. From repealing Section 28 - the Conservatives’ law which prohibited the \"promotion of homosexuality\" by local authorities, to Lynne Featherstone’s tireless efforts to legalise same-sex marriage, and the former Liberal Democrat MP John Leech securing pardons for those unjustly criminalised for their sexuality, our party has always stood on the right side of history. That same commitment drives us today. The Liberal Democrats believe that everyone should be free to live authentically, without fear or prejudice. That is why, through our policy Free To Be Who You Are, we remain committed to banning all forms of conversion practices, strengthening protections against discrimination and hate crime, improving access to inclusive healthcare, and delivering a new LGBTQ+ Action Plan to drive progress across government. Because everyone deserves full and equal access to healthcare, education, workplaces, and the protections and freedoms every citizen enjoys. This LGBT+ History Month, we honour the trailblazers who came before, celebrate the contributions of LGBT+ people today, and stand with the next generation as they push for a fairer, more inclusive future. Our message is unwavering: you belong, your history matters, and we will continue fighting for a country where everyone is truly free to be who they are.

We honour the survivors and their testimony, and we renew our commitment to building a country where Jewish people - indeed, all people - can live, worship and gather in safety. For so many of Britain’s Jews, today is deeply personal - a day of grief, remembrance and resilience. We are proud of the role Britain played in standing against Nazism and helping to bring an end to the Holocaust. That legacy brings with it a responsibility to remember the past honestly and to ensure that the warning signs of hatred and dehumanisation are never ignored again. Sadly, this year, Holocaust Memorial Day comes at a time when antisemitism continues to be on the rise. Jewish people in the UK are facing unacceptable levels of hatred and violence. Synagogues and community centres require security simply to function day to day. Jewish communities have suffered horrifying attacks, both here and abroad, that have left them grieving and shaken. Today, our thoughts are also with the families and loved ones of all those who lost their lives in these senseless and devastating acts of violence. Jewish communities should not have to endure this before the seriousness of the threat they face today is fully recognised and acted upon. Holocaust Memorial Day is also about responsibility. It asks each of us what we will do to confront prejudice when we see it, to speak out when hatred is excused, and to stand alongside those who are targeted, so that one of the greatest horrors in history is never repeated. Today, the Liberal Democrats stand unequivocally with Jewish communities of the past and the present. Antisemitism has no place in our country or abroad. We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure Jewish people can live openly, practise their faith freely, and participate fully in society without fear. Put simply, we will continue to work for a society that has learned the lessons of history.

We are committed to ensuring that people are treated fairly in everything we do. This Privacy and Cookie Notice (“Notice”) outlines: How we may collect personal data about you How we may use your personal data Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way The circumstances under which we may share your personal data or disclose it to others Additional details about cookies and technical information Data retention policies Your rights over personal data How to contact us Where this Notice refers to ‘personal data’ it is referring to data about you (or other living people) from which you (or they) could be identified – such as name, date of birth or contact details. This Notice applies to all personal data processed by the Party about its members and members of the public. This includes data gathered via third parties, such as social media sites, and which is therefore also covered by their own Privacy Polices. This policy was last updated on 2nd May 2018. Any updates will be posted to this version of the policy. If you wish to see a previous version of the policy, or have any other questions, please get in touch . The Party may collect personal data from you via means such as: In person, when you speak to one of our representatives or volunteers Through a telephone call, either where you call us or we call you On paper, such as if you return a printed survey or a reply slip on a leaflet Digitally, such as if you fill in a form on a website or interact with the party online When you offer or ask about volunteering, or take part in party activities When you enter into a transaction with the party, such as donating, joining, purchasing a product or paying for an event Indirectly from other public records or sources, including the full electoral register which the party is legally entitled to On social media platforms, where you have made the information public, or you have made the information available in a social media forum run by the Party We may collect personal data about you such as: Name Contact details (e.g. email address, address, telephone / mobile number) Date of birth Future communication preferences Information about your financial transactions with the Party Racial or ethnic origin Family details Political opinions Religious or other beliefs Other demographic information Information about your home (e.g. whether it is a flat or house) Issues you raise Topics you are interested in We may also collect information when you interact with the party digitally, such as by visiting one of our websites or communicating with one of our social media channels. This may include additional data to that above, such as: Your IP address Your device, browser or operating system Details of the links that you click and the content that you view Your username or social media handle Any other information you share when using third party sites (e.g. sending a tweet or using the Like function on Facebook) We may also place one or more cookies on your device. For further details on this, see below . We may also collect information about you from other public sources, such as the Land Registry, Companies House or other commercially available sources. We only do so where those sources are lawfully permitted to share the data with us and where we have a legal basis to process data from such sources. This may include, for example, checking the eligibility of a potential donor and may include additional data to that above, such as: Lifestyle and social circumstance Goods or services purchased Charities you support How we may use your personal data We may use your personal data to further our objectives, share it with our elected representatives and/or contact you in future. Examples of the way we may use your data include to: Contact you to canvass for political support Understand your views and issues important to you Process surveys you have participated in Tell you about policies, campaigns or individuals that may be of interest to you Respond to queries that you raise with us Administer offers or applications to volunteer for the party or to become, remain or cease being a member of or candidate for the party Conduct fundraising activities, including checking your eligibility to donate Manage our sites and services For more specific information about how we use your data for these activities, and the legal basis on which we rely to process your data in this way, please see the ‘Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way’ part of this Notice. If you have provided us with your email, mobile phone number or landline phone number and we have a legal right to use them for such purposes, we may use that information to contact you to promote causes and campaigns that we support, such as by sending you an email, online advert, or a text message. We will respect any registration you hold with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) except where you have opted in to receive phone calls on that number from us. You may opt out of communications from us at any time. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (i.e. between local, regional and national parts of the party and with our elected representatives) or with companies that provide services to the Party (“service providers”). For more information on service providers, please see here: https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-sharing . In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so. For example, where you have signed a petition and are clearly informed that this petition will be presented to a third party. Why the Party is allowed to use your information in this way The Party is a registered national political party in the UK; our work is designed to promote our values and to engage UK citizens in the democratic process. Accordingly, our work is considered to be of substantial public interest. Because of that public interest basis we are entitled to process sensitive personal data which relates to your political opinions, and your personal data more generally, for the purposes of enabling us to perform our work effectively. Specifically, that processing may include using those aspects of your personal data to help us to plan and execute political campaigns, canvass for your support (such as by visiting or calling you), raise funds, and perform casework that relates to you and your local community. You do have rights to ask us to stop processing your data for these purposes, and you can read details about those rights here . In addition to the above we may also process your data for other purposes where you ask us to, or enter into a relationship with us that requires us to. For example, if you choose to join us as a volunteer we will need to process your personal data to record that you have given us your support in this way. A contract will be put in place between you and us and we will process your personal data to the extent that we need to in order to fulfil our obligations under that contract. Similarly, you may from time to time give us your consent to send you communications by e-mail (or similar mediums) which promote our work. Where you do that we will use your details to send you those kinds of communications until you tell us otherwise. Should you ever ask us to stop sending those kinds of communications we will hold your details on file to ensure that we respect that request – we justify that retention on the basis that we have a legitimate interest in holding your data in that way. Finally, where we have received your personal data in the various ways described above, we may continue to hold it as part of our records after the relevant processing has stopped. We hold data in this way because we have a legitimate interest in doing so. Specifically, where you have been a member or a volunteer (or have otherwise engaged with us such as by attending a conference or event, or by responding to a survey or questionnaire) we have a legitimate interest in holding your personal data to help us to monitor the numbers and the diversity of people who engage with us, as well as a legitimate interest in making sure that we can follow up any complaints or grievances which you may raise (or which people may raise about you). The circumstances under which we may share your personal data or disclose it to others The Party will not sell your personal data to third parties. Depending on how and why you provide us with your personal data it may be shared within the Party (e.g. between local, regional and national parts of the party) and our elected representatives. It may also be shared with those who provide services to the Party (“service providers”). We may use service providers to undertake processing operations on our behalf to provide us with a variety of administrative, statistical, advertising and technical services. We will only supply service providers with the minimum amount of personal data they need to fulfil the services we request. We oblige all of our data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual rights, protecting your personal data – including not using it for any purpose other than providing us with an agreed service or fulfilling their legal obligations - and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject. With your consent, service providers may hold personal data about you in order to facilitate the provision of future services or financial transactions to which you have agreed, such as a payment processor retaining your payment details in order to process agreed future payments from you. Please note that some of our service providers are based outside of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). Where we transfer your data to a service provider that is outside of the EEA we seek to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to make sure that your personal data is held securely and that your rights as a data subject are upheld – in almost all cases we do this by ensuring that the agreements between us and our chosen service providers contain what are called the ‘model clauses’ that oblige them to treat your personal data as if they themselves were based in the EEA. In addition, we may share your personal data with third parties when we are required to do so by law (for example, with the Police where they ask us to assist them with their investigations). In some cases, this may result in your personal data becoming public. In particular, the Party and our candidates are required to submit records, including personal data, of donations above certain thresholds to the relevant regulatory authority. In some cases, some of these donation details are made public. For more details about this, please contact us . However, save for the limited circumstances noted above, we will never pass your personal data to any unrelated third parties unless you have given us your permission to do so.

Data retention policies We only keep your personal data for as long as required to meet the purposes set out in this Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law. For example, this may include holding your data after you have ceased to engage with the party (such as by resigning or ceasing to be a member) where we have a legitimate interest in doing so, such as to enable us to respond effectively to grievances that may arise after you cease to engage with us. Where we collect and hold your details as part of our public interest work, this may also include retaining those details for as long as you remain a registered voter in the UK. Where permitted by law, we may also save personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, including historical research. This may involving passing such data to third parties who run historical archives . The exact details of this are set out in our Data Retention Policy, a copy of which is available here ( https://www.libdems.org.uk/data-retention ) and all the above is subject to your legal rights, such as to have data in certain cases deleted or corrected, as set out below.

You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not believe that we need to continue retaining it (sometimes called the right to be forgotten). Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is accurate. Further, we are not always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase we will tell you what that reason is at the time we respond to your request. Right to restrict processing Where we process your personal data on the legal basis of us having a legitimate interest to do so, you are entitled to ask us to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid. You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify its accuracy; (b) where it has been established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. If for any reason we believe that we have a good legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider and investigate it. Right to opt out of processing relating to your political opinions You may, at any time, write to us to ask us to cease processing your personal data which relates to your political opinions (such as how you have voted in the past, and things that you have told us about how you are likely to vote). Please note that these requests can only be made about data which relates to your political opinions; they will not affect our right to use other aspects of your personal data.
