The UK economy has been performing better than all other large European countries as well as the United States.\nI saw the impact of this locally when I visited three new businesses which have recently opened on Chelmsford High Street. Gaia is a family run jewellery business, specialising in 14 carat gold with beautiful modern designs. Zambrero makes the scrummy burritos based on Mexican cooking, for every burrito ordered they donate a meal to someone in need and Flannels, specialising in luxury designer fashion have taken on the old Top Shop location at the entrance to High Chelmer. It is great to see such diverse businesses choosing to locate in Chelmsford.\nAnother sign of the economy doing well is Chelmsford’s low unemployment. There are now record numbers of people in work locally. There has also been significant increase in support to help people into jobs.\nI met with the new “Individual Placement and Support” team. This service is aimed at helping those with common mental or physical health illness to gain and sustain meaningful paid employment. It was extremely moving to hear from people who are now back in jobs and the positive impact this has had on their mental well-being. If you do know anyone who could benefit from this service they can find out more online, via their GP or at the Job Centre Plus.\nAt Beaulieu Park station construction teams have been hard at work lifting the two station footbridges into place. You may have seen a very large crane in action. Once this is completed there will not need to be any further weekend possessions over the summer months. Passengers will be able to enjoy travelling by rail across the region and beyond over June, July and August.\nWe also got the excellent news that Chelmsford’s Medical School at Anglia Ruskin University will expand its places to train even more doctors each year. I campaigned hard for Essex’s first medical school to open in Chelmsford a few years ago. The first students graduated last summer and many of the new doctors chose to stay working in our local NHS. The news that the school is to be expanded is great for our local health service.\nThank you to those who vote in the recent elections to choose the Police Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex. I was delighted that Roger Hirst has been re-elected. I have worked closely with Roger to increase the number of police officers in Essex to record levels. Latest data from the police shows that knife crime dropped by 11.7 % in Chelmsford last year and Anti-Social Behaviour is down by 29.7. Thank you to the Police for their recent Operation Stronghold all across Chelmsford and for making tackling car theft a top priority.\nI have been delivering my crime and safety survey all over Chelmsford, the responses have helped me to get police to focus on the issues that concern local people most. If you have had a copy of the survey please do help by filling it in.\nAs ever, if you require any assistance with an issue or a problem, do not hesitate to get in touch with me on [email protected]",

Record number of doctors, nurses and paramedics are being trained in Chelmsford. The first cohort of new doctors have graduated from Anglia Ruskin University Medical School this summer.

  "http_www_vickyford_uk_/http_www_vickyford_uk_news_moulsham-times-aprilmay-2024/content_10.html": "The expansion of government funded free childcare for two-year-olds started in April and it will be rolled out to younger children over the coming year. This will be a big help to many families in Chelmsford. I visited one of Chelmsford’s Outstanding nurseries and was enormously impressed by how happy the children were. Like many other nurseries they are looking to expand so they can take on more children.\nI have had very senior level meetings with Essex County Council on improving services for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). There has been a great increase in the level of need, with more children presenting with SEND than ever before. Government funding to meet SEND needs has increased by 60% over the past five years, and now is around £10.5 billion each year.\nIn Essex, the number of children with an education, health and care plan (EHCP) is more than double previous levels. Around 400 new EHCP applications are received each month which has resulted in a backlog. The council has recruited 46 members of staff and plan further steps to significantly increase capacity and reduce the backlog.\nFour new state funded Special “Free” Schools are being built in Essex, including two in Chelmsford. The Government has allocated Essex a further £20 million of capital funding which can be used to build more specialist hubs in mainstream schools.\nOn the subject of building works, the construction of Beaulieu Park Station is progressing well and it remains on track to open next year. Once open, fewer cars will need to drive into central Chelmsford to access the main station. This project is funded using part of a £250 million grant which I worked to secure from Government. Also underway is the new Army and Navy junction which is going through planning, and a new North East Bypass.\nLocal GPs have told me how the new online appointment booking service and new “Pharmacy First” service are both helping patients. 15 Chelmsford pharmacies have signed up to the scheme, including all pharmacies in the Moulsham area which means you can now go direct to your pharmacy for a range of common conditions. In the Chelmsford constituency, there are 40 more full-time-equivalent direct patient care staff working in general practice than pre pandemic. Waiting times at Broomfield and other local hospitals have also decreased considerably compared to 12 months ago.\nI have been working with our Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner, Roger Hirst, on tackling the organised criminal car theft gangs active in Essex. Fords and Range Rovers are particular targets. From April 1, car theft is a specific priority crime for Essex Police with a new dedicated serious crime unit and a stolen vehicle intelligence unit. Essex Police have successfully recovered over 650 stolen vehicles worth over £14 million in the past six months and made many arrests.\nThe following measures can deter car thieves: De-activate passive entry systems, keep keys in a Faraday bag or tin, lock gates or bollards, use a “sleeping fob” battery or park a more valuable car behind a less valuable car. Please do report all suspicious behaviour or theft immediately as this makes a significant difference to disrupting gangs and making arrests.",

In Chelmsford, I popped in to visit three recent arrivals on our High Street.\nGaia Jewellery is a family run business near the Stone Bridge specialising in in 14 carat gold. The modern designs are stunning. Zambrero, opposite Metrobank, makes the most scrummy burritos based on Mexican cooking. They are a newly formed chain with10 locations across the country. For every burrito ordered they donate a meal to someone in need - over 78 million meals donated so far. Flannels specialise in luxury designer fashion and have taken on the old Top Shop location at the entrance to High Chelmer.\nIt’s great to see new businesses putting their faith in Chelmsford. Gaia and Zambrero have been shortlisted for the Chelmsford For You business awards. Good luck to them all for the rest of the competition.\nAnother sign of the economy doing well is the low unemployment. There has been significant increase in support to help people into jobs. At County Hall I met with the Individual Placement and Support team. This is a new service aimed at helping those with common mental or physical health illness to gain and sustain meaningful paid employment. It was extremely moving to hear from people who are now back in jobs thanks to the service. This has helped their mental well-being.\nI also visited the Springfield Bees Nursery and Preschool where I met children and staff. The new increased support for Government funded childcare is making a huge difference to many working parents in Chelmsford.\nAt Maltese Road Primary School, I was delighted to hear that they have sailed through their recent Ofsted inspection with another “Good”. Every single one of the schools in the Chelmsford Constituency is now Good or Outstanding, compared to 14 years ago when one in three of our children went to schools that were not even good. It was great to meet with lots of the children including some very thoughtful questions from year 6.\nThe head teacher Faye White and I had a long chat about the impact of screen time on children. She is concerned that the habit of constant scrolling through short videos or different content is impacting on the concentration of very young children and that this may be resulting in more ADHD amongst children.\nIn Parliament, I hosted a large roundtable of cross party MPs and Peers to discuss the latest stage of rolling out the new laws to protect children online. We heard from the team at Ofcom who are working on implementing the detailed legislation. Once finalised, this will require social media companies to put in place stringent measures to prevent children from accessing the most dangerous forms of online harms. Failure to do so can face substantial fines, and potential criminal convictions for company bosses.\nOur local police have also been running intensive safety operations across Chelmsford this week. Operation Stronghold focuses on the issues raised by local people in every district of the country. I joined the police at High Chelmer to see the work the knife arch operation in action. Knife crime was down by 11.7% in the Chelmsford and Maldon district last year.\nI was also deeply impressed to hear that over 60% of reporting shoplifting crimes in the city centre were solved in the past 12 months. Our local police have been working to identify linked offences and investigate these as a series. This puts a clearer offending picture in front of the court, helps the police to get orders placed on offenders, improves the chance of a positive outcome for victims and reduces crime.\nDisappointingly, another political party has been putting leaflets through people’s doors trying to take credit for other people’s work. For the record, on GP surgeries, the expansion of Sutherland Lodge Surgery and the building of the new mega surgery at Beaulieu Park are thanks to decisions made by Chelmsford City Council when it was controlled by Conservative councillors.\nThe new Train Station at Beaulieu and North East Bypass has been funded by the £250,000,000 grant from the Conservative Government thanks to campaigning led by me and supported by largely Conservative MPs all along the Great Eastern Mainline. It is being delivered by Essex County Council which is Conservative led.\nRecent investment in additional CCTV, lighting and street safety improvements have largely come from the government’s safer streets funding initiative, led locally by the Conservative Police Fire and Crime Commissioner, Roger Hirst, with whom I work closely. I will always fight for our fair share of investment in Chelmsford and often to get things done it is important to work in partnership with others.\nFinally, a huge thank you to the Sikhs of Chelmsford for bringing joy to so many people for their celebration of the festival of Vaisakhi in the High Street. Music, dancing, bhajis and a free health check – what’s not to like!",
