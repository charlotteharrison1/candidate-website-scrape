Well done to Paul Osborn, Marilyn Ashton, Hitesh Karia Janet Mote, Christopher Baxter and all at Harrow Council Conservatives.\nI will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure we deliver on the SEND school in a timely manner.\nThe government has today also announced a record £850 million cash boost to deliver up to 60,000 more special needs places.",
  "https_www_abbasmerali_uk_/https_www_abbasmerali_uk_about-abbas-merali/content_25.html": "Harrow is close to my heart, its culture and communities shaped my life and where I am today. Arriving from Kenya at the age of 14, my family and I were welcomed by the people of Harrow.\nI was the 'new boy with a funny accent' at the John Lyon school and worked in my family's care home on Manor Road from a young age. It was here that the values of family, education, hard work and community were instilled in me. I have fond memories of playing tennis in Cunningham Park and five-a-side football at Harrow Leisure Centre.\nI studied economics at the London School of Economics, qualifying as a chartered accountant and embarking on a successful career in the City. 10 years ago I returned to help run the family business, and today we are for over 250 people living with dementia and employ local people. I am proud to lead an award winning team that did not lose a single person in our care to COVID.\nA community worker at heart, I have volunteered through local charities supporting people living with dementia and the homeless. AS a keen sportsman and a leader in Middlesex Tennis, I have organised multi-generational sports festival encouraging an active lifestyle and promoting sports as a force for social good, especially for young people. My proven local government experience as a councillor will be an asset working with the Conservative and Harrow Council to deliver for our residents.\nIt is the honour of my life to stand to become Harrow West's next Member of Parliament, and I am determined to restore pride back to our local area.",
  "https_www_abbasmerali_uk_/https_www_abbasmerali_uk_ourplan/content_10.html": "- Fight Rising Crime and Anti-Social Behaviour – Crime is out of control. Everyone deserves to feel safe. Harrow needs more police on the streets and a zero tolerance to violent crime. I will be campaigning for Harrow to get its fair share of police officers and tackle the rise in knife crime. I will continue to work with the Council to tackle anti-social behaviour, fly-tipping and littering on our streets.\n- Build affordable houses, not high-rise developments – We all want our children to be able to afford a family home locally when they start a family of their own. High-rise overdevelopment of small flats is not the answer. I am campaigning to ensure affordable family homes in appropriate locations and that the right infrastructure is in place to support our growing community. Zero tolerance to homelessness in Harrow.\n- Scrap unfair tax on motorists London Mayor’s war on small businesses and motorists continues. I will continue to campaign to scrap the ULEZ expansion and stop Labour’s further tax on drivers. I will campaign for continued investment to resurface roads, repair local potholes and achieving step free access at Rayners Lane and South Harrow stations.\n- Secure funding for local schools and deliver SEND provision - All our children deserve the best education. I am working with the Conservative-run Harrow Council to deliver a new SEND school on 265 Ridgeway which will provide the best support and education to children and their families. I will campaign to secure even more funding from the government for schools in Harrow.\n- Improved access to physical and mental health support -. I know first-hand the pressures on GP appointments and Northwick Park. I am campaigning for greater investment to improve Northwick Park, deliver local diagnostic centres, promoting pharmacy services, ensuring more GP capacity and timely access to physical and mental healthcare services for all. I will promote preventative healthcare education in ethnic communities and address health inequalities.\n- Champion a thriving local economy. As a small businessman, I know that small businesses drive our local and national economies. I will work with stakeholders at all levels to create opportunities for future generations, drive growth and investment into our high streets and campaign to revitalise Harrow town centre. I will support our traders in dealing with shoplifting.",

His strong local message is landing well in the community as is the fantastic positive impact of the Conservatives-run Harrow Council. Some of the highlights have been:\n- Talking to small businesses and seeing the positive impact of 1-hour free parking and the anticipation of the enhancement in Harrow Town Centre.\n- Being invited by various faith communities and understanding their needs. Community cohesion and unity are something to take very seriously and Abbas's ability to speak several languages spoken in Harrow helps bridge and relate to the diverse communities.\n- Meeting with various social care providers, and learning disability charities and understanding Harrow Council's plans around working with ICB's on providing wider access to mental health services.\n- Attending a meeting with Cllr Thaya Idaikkadar to address the concerns of fly-tipping in alleyways in Rayners Lane.\n- Attending several local community events welcoming the festive season!\n- Listening to residents and businesses frustrated and angry with the London Mayor's record on crime and his #ULEZ extension!\n- Grateful for the lovely welcome and warm reception on the doorsteps across Harrow West. We need to restore the pride in the Harrow Abbas came to 33 years ago!\nMerry Christmas to you and your families and look forward to working with you in 2024 for a better Harrow!\nHarrow West ConservativesHarrow on the Hill ConservativesCommunity ConneXAsian VoiceSangat Advice CentreHarrow Town CentreWest Harrow ChoirFriends of West Harrow ParkManor LodgeInternational Siddhashram Sadhak Parivar",

I look forward to working with the Conservative-led Harrow Council and London Mayor candidate Susan Hall to make Harrow West a safer and more thriving place for its diverse communities to live, work and be healthy. I can’t wait to turn Harrow West blue again and restore the Harrow I first came to from Kenya 33 years ago with an attractive town centre!"
