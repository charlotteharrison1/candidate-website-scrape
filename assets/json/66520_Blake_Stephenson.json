They are only able to deal with issues raised by people who live in their constituency, called constituents.\nTo check if you are one of my constituents, please enter your postcode on the Parliament website.\nMPs consider and vote on legislation and use their position to ask government ministers questions about current issues.\nWe split our time between working in Parliament and working in the constituency. In Parliament, I spend my time fighting for the interests of all my constituents, attending debates, scrutinising and voting on legislation, and attending meetings. I hold advice surgeries for my constituents (where they can come and talk to me about any local issues and problems), attend meetings and community events, as well as visiting local organisations and businesses across the constituency.\nWhen a constituent writes to me, I will write to the relevant department or official or the Minister involved. Many problems are solved in this way and I always aim to respond within 10 working days although sometimes more complex cases may take slightly longer.\nAlternatively, if a constituent is happy for the issue to be made public, I can ask an oral or written question, secure a debate or even petition Parliament itself.\nOral or Written Questions\nOnce a month each minister from each government department answer questions from MPs at the Despatch Box in the Chamber of the House. There is a limit to the number of questions that can be asked but I can also table a written question to the relevant government department, which are published in Hansard.\nAdjournment Debates\nMPs may be able to raise a constituent’s issue in a half-hour Adjournment Debate. To get an Adjournment Debate, MPs must be successful in a ballot of Members of Parliament or have the subject chosen by the Speaker. The debates are usually the last business of the day and a government minister responds at the end of the debate.\nPetition\nMembers of Parliament can present a petition to Parliament on behalf of their constituents.

They put food on our tables and with global instability food security is more important now than ever before. We should not be putting family farms at risk.\n\"We had a really productive conversation and I'll be taking their feedback onboard to do my best to influence the Government to make better policy for our local farmers.\nI have also signed the Stop The Family Farm Tax petition which will be delivered to 10 Downing Street.\"\nYou can sign the petition here: http://stopthefarmtax.com/",

Whether it is undelivered road projects, non-existent GP surgeries, crowded schools, or something else, too many of our communities have suffered from bad development.\n\"I believe that the golden rules on infrastructure set out in the consultation are sensible, but I would like to see them reinforced by a requirement that necessary infrastructure is delivered early on in development – preferably before the first houses can be occupied. I would like to see the Government commit to reforms to the way infrastructure is funded in new developments.\n\"Specifically, I believe that the Government should provide local authorities with upfront capital funding to deliver necessary infrastructure like GP surgeries, schools, and hospitals. This funding could then be claimed back by the Government through developer contributions once housing has been delivered.\""
