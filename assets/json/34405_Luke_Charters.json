This is due to the hard work of the Executive since winning the council in 2023 to balance the books and restore financial stability within the council.\nThe previous Lib Dem-Green coalition left a complete financial mess, this Labour administration has worked tirelessly to clear the mess and bring spending under control.\nIt is disappointing to see Conservative and Lib Dem councillors vote against a budget that presents no new cuts, whilst keeping the administrations ambition for the city and listens to what residents have told us they want.\nThe amendments to the Budget proposed by the Conservative and Lib Dem councillors this evening was from a world of cloud cuckoo land economics, certainly not a realistic one that will deliver for the people of York.\nWhether it’s the extra 8 million pound investment in adult social care or a crucial boost in cost of living support for residents, this Labour budget is one that is ambitious for York and listens to residents at its very core.”",

This follows a campaign by residents supported by pressure from the York Outer MP.\nMr Charters said: “In 2021 Yorkshire Water took the pump away, but ever since it’s created worry every time there’s been a large amount of rain and until recently we were getting nowhere with them.\n“I raised the issue in parliament and met with Nicola Shaw head of Yorkshire Water and we have finally got there.”\nBarbara Boyce, a former Lord Mayor of York and one time city councillor, now herself a Hartrigg Oaks resident thanked Mr Charters for taking up the issue.\n“I’m so grateful we don’t have an MP who sits on his bum, all day doing nothing,” she said.",

  "https_www_lukecharters_co_uk_/https_www_lukecharters_co_uk_luke-charters-mp-speaks-out-on-rogue-bailiffs/content_20.html": "On Tuesday, I held a Westminster Hall debate on the pressing need for regulation of the bailiff sector.\nI spoke about distressing instances where vulnerable individuals have suffered due to aggressive and unregulated bailiff practices.\nOne particularly troubling case I mentioned was a disabled individual who, upon answering his door with the chain secured, experienced a bailiff forcibly entering his home. The bailiff proceeded to demean him with terms such as “waste of a life,” “loser,” and “scum.” The bailiff wrongfully seized his equipment provided by the local authority to assist with his disability.\nSuch reports are not alone, I shared other harrowing stories such as the impact on mental health, with individuals driven to the brink of suicide and one woman enduring a late-term abortion after relentless harassment by bailiffs. These accounts underscore the urgent need for systemic change.\nCurrently, the Enforcement Conduct Board (ECB) serves as the industry’s oversight body. However, its voluntary nature means that not all firms are compelled to adhere to its standards. This lack of mandatory compliance allows appalling behaviours to persist unchecked.\nOne of my recommendations in the debate, a “vulnerable customer charter” would set out minimum standards of care for those in such intimidating scenarios. Where there has been misconduct, I recommended a bailiff services compensation scheme to provide clear pathways to address misconduct from rogue bailiffs, including historic misconduct.\nI am grateful to Victims Minister, Alex Davies-Jones for attending the debate who expressed her shock and emphasised the critical importance of addressing these issues. She assured that the government is actively considering the establishment of a robust independent regulator to ensure accountability and protect vulnerable individuals from such abuses.\nI’d also like to thank the charity Step Change for their support on bringing pertinent topic to light.\nThe harrowing stories heard in the debate demonstrate why this is so critical, and I will continue to work with the government to ensure that much needed regulation is brought in",
