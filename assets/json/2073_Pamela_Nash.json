Without it, the sickest and most premature babies would have to be moved and treated in Glasgow, Edinburgh or Aberdeen, depending on capacity on the day. This means separating babies and mums from their loved ones when they need them most.\nIt is time for this ridiculous decision to be reversed.\nMy Pledges\nFight for real help now to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\nCampaign for better services to make our NHS fit for the future.\nWork to create new high quality local jobs and opportunities.\nPromote our high streets and local businesses.\nOppose SNP tax hikes and Tory mortgage bombshells.\n© 2024 Pamela Nash.
