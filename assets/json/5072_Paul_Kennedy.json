I’ve been self-employed; worked for a major UK insurer and a global accountancy firm; and in Westminster, at HM Treasury, for UK financial regulators and in local government. I’ve undertaken public reviews and taken legislation through Parliament.\nI love St Ives. My great-grandparents joined the artists colony in the late 19th Century and their descendants now run many local businesses in the town, as well as farming in Zennor and horseriding in Halsetown.\nLast year I joined the Lib Dem campaign to get Andrew George back as our MP, so we could get a better deal for St Ives and West Cornwall at Westminster. Now I’m campaigning with the Lib Dems to get a better deal for our area locally and at Cornwall Council as well.",
