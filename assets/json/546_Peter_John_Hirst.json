The Government Minister, Lord Bethell of Romford, assured the House that it would act with proportionality \"at all times\".\nIn response to a separate amendment tabled by crossbencher Lord Anderson of Ipswich, a former Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, and co-sponsored by Baroness Ludford, the Government conceded that it would provide \"evidence and explanations\" for keeping the emergency powers in force in its two-monthly reports to Parliament, beyond what was explicitly required in the Bill.\nFollowing the debate in the House of Lords, Liberal Democrat peer Sarah Ludford said:\n\"We are pleased to have secured these assurances from the Government during what has been an incredibly important legislative process.\n\"We understand the need for wide-ranging emergency powers to deal with this crisis, but the Government must only use those powers when they are necessary and proportionate.\n\"Liberal Democrats will remain vigilant to ensure that any restrictions on civil liberties are only temporary.

In reply, Kent were dismissed for 176 in dramatic fashion. The final wicket, that of ex-county cricketer Kevin Masters, fell to the penultimate ball of the match, the Kent captain being caught on the boundary for 45 while attempting to hit a match-winning six runs.\nMiddle-order batsman Stevens, who scored 12 in the final, has amassed over 300 runs, at an average of over 30, for the county over-50s side this season, including knocks of 50 and 37 against Norfolk and Wales respectively in the knock-out stages of the competition. This after Derbyshire had scraped through the group stage in third place.\nStevens, who missed only one of the 12 games played in the competition, said: \"It has involved an awful lot of commitment, but they are a superb bunch of lads. And the games themselves are played in a very good spirit.\"\nStevens played for Didsbury and Whalley Range as a professional in the Lancashire and Cheshire League, as well as for Lancashire CCC's 2nd XI, before joining Cheadle in 1987. He has also coached in New Zealand.\nHe joined his present club New Mills in 1992, where he is the current club president, and was also captain of the second team which recently won promotion back to Division Three of the Peak Sports Derbyshire & Cheshire League.\nReflecting on the county success, Stevens added: \"This is the best feeling I have ever had. I played second team cricket at Lancashire several years ago, but to get the opportunity to play at this level and then go all the way in the competition and win is just unbelievable. It just caps off a fantastic season for me.\"",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_the-lib-dems-have-rediscovered-their-byelection-mojo-can-they-capitalise/content_393.html": "The constituency was a Lib Dem stronghold for over 40 years (until the vote collapsed, like almost everywhere else, in last year's general election) where over 70% of voters had voted to remain in the EU, putting it in the top 10 pro-EU constituencies. Local Labour voters were long used to voting tactically for the local Liberal Democrat. All the party had to do was to turn this unusually propitious set of circumstances to its advantage.\nBut that does not mean that its victory can simply be dismissed as \"a little local difficulty\". Not so. Because ever since Nick Clegg shook hands with David Cameron on the steps of 10 Downing St and formed the coalition, doing well in byelections - hitherto the Liberal Democrats' forte - has been beyond them.\nEven its success in retaining Eastleigh in 2013 masked a 14-point fall in the party's vote, one of the biggest drops in support it had suffered in any post-second world war byelection. The party was saved from defeat by a Ukip surge at the expense of the Conservatives. But Richmond indicates that although the party is still languishing at just 8% in the national polls, it has at least put the searing experience of the coalition sufficiently behind it to restore its ability to make the best of a byelection.\nMoreover, the Liberal Democrats' success in Richmond is not an isolated one. It increased its share of the vote by 23 points in the Witney byelection in October. In local government byelections during the past three months, the party has on average enjoyed a 10-point increase in support, and has pulled off a number of seemingly remarkable victories.\nNow the crucial question is whether the party can use the favourable publicity generated by its byelection victory in Richmond to begin to put itself back in the electoral frame more widely.\nThe last time the party was in anything like as much electoral trouble as the last few years was in the late 1980s following the acrimonious Liberal-SDP merger. And on that occasion it was a spectacular byelection victory, in Eastbourne in October 1990, that helped put the party back on the road to recovery.\nThe Liberal Democrats now need to use the publicity generated by Richmond to get voters to think afresh about the party once more. Any such a development would be unwelcome both to the Conservatives - who have the most seats that are potentially at risk from a strengthened Liberal Democrat challenge - and to Labour, who might fear that those of its supporters who are disillusioned with Jeremy Corbyn might begin to think they finally have somewhere else to go.\nBut if Thursday's byelection could help open a new chapter in the story of British domestic politics, it is much less likely that the victory for an anti-leave candidate will have any immediate impact on the government's pursuit of Brexit.\nIn arguing the case for holding a second referendum on Brexit, the Liberal Democrats are aiming at no more than a niche market. Polling from YouGov suggests that only around a half of those who voted to remain believe the government should hold a second referendum. However, thanks to the party's long-standing pro-EU stance this is a niche that it is well-placed to win over.\nHowever, it is not a big enough market to deflect a Conservative prime minister who knows that a majority of her voters backed leave, and only 26% of whom back a second referendum at the end of June.\nIndeed, if the prime minister looks closely at the result, she will note that the 50% share won by the Liberal Democrats in Richmond is well below the 72% who voted to remain in June. Her job is to ensure that when the Brexit negotiations are over, most Conservative-inclined remain voters are sufficiently happy with the outcome that they will not be looking for a second referendum.\nBut that was already her task long before Zac Goldsmith opted to call what for him, at least, has proven be a fatally damaging byelection.\n'Richmond Park was a byelection made in heaven for the Liberal Democrats. Their opponent - a prominent leave campaigner whose father had funded the anti-EU referendum party in the 1990s, and who upset many of those of a small \"l\" liberal disposition with the style and tone of his London mayoral campaign in the spring.",

But the story has the ring of truth about it -- certainly, many disgruntled Lib Dems would sympathise if he has -- and as the news originated in a post by my old friend Mark Seddon, former editor of the Tribune and one-time member of Labour's NEC, I'm inclined to believe that there's something in it.\nBut here is why Charles Kennedy should not split the Lib Dems and defect to the Labour Party.\n1. Iraq. The obvious one -- Kennedy was the only party leader to oppose the illegal war in Iraq, while of Labour's leadership contenders, David Miliband and Andy Burnham voted for it, Ed Balls wasn't an MP but says he would have voted for it (although he admits it would have been wrong to do so!) and Ed Miliband says he was against it -- but nobody noticed because he was out of the country at the time. The sole contender to have voted against the Iraq war, Diane Abbott, is the one candidate we know definitely won't win. That's the party Kennedy would be joining.\n2. Tuition fees. In 2001, Charles Kennedy called the introduction of university tuition fees \"one of the most pernicious political acts that has taken place. It means that people from lower-income backgrounds are discriminated against.\" He was right. Who introduced them? And who later added on top-up fees, thereby breaking a manifesto promise? Labour governments.\n3. Civil liberties. Again, as party leader, Kennedy was on the side of the angels, especially against one of the most authoritarian home secretaries in living memory -- David Blunkett, whom he accused of using the threat of terrorism to force through \"the abandonment of some of the liberties that generations of Britons have relied upon. Hard-won rights, once lost, may never be regained.\" Which party did Blunkett belong to? Labour.\n4. Lib Dem votes don't belong to Labour -- and Kennedy should not encourage the belief that they do. The cries of \"betrayal\" after this year's general election showed very clearly that many Labour politicians believe that votes for the Liberal Democrats are in some sense \"mislaid\", and that they really belong to them. They don't. There was no betrayal because there was no promise -- the Lib Dems had the right to form a coalition with whichever party they wanted. In any case, why should Lib Dems turn to Labour after the way Tony Blair led Paddy Ashdown and Roy Jenkins down the garden path? Kennedy above all knows that. He was the leader who abandoned Ashdown's policy of cosying up to a party that, not so secretly, has always despised Liberals.\n5. He should fight his corner within the Lib Dems. Kennedy is not alone in worrying about the right-wing tendencies of the Orange Bookers at the top of the party -- the former Treasury chief secretary, David Laws, in particular. But their position will only be strengthened if the left of the party defects.\n6. Kennedy is a Liberal, not a Social Democrat. Yes, I know he was a member of the SDP -- but both he and his mentor, Roy Jenkins, could happily have found a home in the old Liberal Party. After the merger between the two parties of the Alliance in 1988, neither opted for the continuing Owenite SDP, which prefigured New Labour not only in its enthusiasm for the market but also in the cult of the leader that surrounded both Owen and Blair. Labour, which always places equality above liberty, is prone to conformist, controlling tendencies -- that awkward, cussedly individualist Liberals such as Kennedy automatically reject.\n7. Class warfare. New Labour may have had a (very) soft spot for plutocrats and Tuscan holidays, but the party retains an undignified chippiness and weakness for class warfare gestures -- such as the ban on hunting, which was never about helping foxes but about savaging toffs. Not only has it been completely ineffectual, it was philosophically incoherent, too. If foxes should be saved painful deaths during the course of a countryside pursuit, what about the millions of fish speared through the mouth for sport every year? Kennedy did actually vote for the ban -- but as a Liberal he must view Labour's low-politics class gestures with distaste.\n8. Sectional interests. Trade unions provide far too much money and hold far too much influence within the Labour Party. Liberals do not believe in being beholden to any special or sectional interest groups.\n9. Kennedy won't want to destroy the party he once led. The formation of the SDP damaged the Labour Party and was partly responsible for its disastrous showing in the 1983 general election. Could Kennedy possibly want to inflict similar damage on the Liberal Democrats -- or even worse?\n10. He could be the leader again. If the coalition falls apart or the Lib Dems are wiped out in local elections, the party may wish to be open to negotiations with Labour, especially if the next general election results in another hung parliament. Ed Miliband rules out dealing with the Lib Dems if Nick Clegg is still leader in the current NS, and whoever wins Labour's contest may well take the same view. Who could they talk to in his stead? Step forward, Charles Kennedy, who, when asked in 2006, refused to rule out standing for the Lib Dem leadership at some point in the future. Given his opposition to the Lib-Con coalition, he would be the obvious choice.\nSo don't be a Charlie, Charlie: the Labour Party doesn't deserve you -- you're way too good for them.",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_alistair-carmichael-writes-for-allowing-mixed-sex-couples-into-civil-partnerships/content_296.html": "Alistair Carmichael writes: for allowing mixed sex couples into civil partnerships\nThe late great Groucho Marx once said, \"Marriage is a wonderful institution - but then, who wants to live in an institution?\"\nI have no problem in answering \"I do\" - coincidentally the same words I spoke on September 19th 1987 when my wife and I got married.\nLike everyone else, our marriage has had its ups and downs but when we got married I had no doubt that it was the right thing to be doing and I have never doubted it for a second since. I like being married. For us, marriage is a good thing. In fact I would recommend it to anyone in a long term stable relationship and am still immensely proud of the role that our party played in dragging our country into the twenty-first century so that I can offer the recommendation to my friends in same sex relationships too.\nThat said, I realise that marriage is not for everyone. I know many people who are in long term relationships that are every bit as loving and as stable as our marriage but who remain unmarried. Some people are uncomfortable with its religious roots, some dislike the \"baggage\" that comes with it. Others may just have been a bit busy with other stuff, never found the right date or venue or dress or whatever.\nDoes this matter?\nYes, actually, it does. It matters because for centuries society has accorded special status to marriage. To be married opens the door to all sorts of rights and protections in law. These same rights and protections are also available to same sex couples who wish to register their relationship as a civil partnership but, irony of ironies, not to mixed sex couples. That is right - the law now offers a greater range of rights and opportunities to same sex couples than it does to mixed sex couples. That has got to be wrong.\nOne of the arguments advanced by opponents of equal marriage was that it \"would change the nature of marriage\". I thought it spurious at the time and nothing has changed my view since we accepted marriage equality.\nWhat equal marriage did, however, was to change the nature of civil partnership - or, at least, how we saw it. To compensate for the lack of equality in marriage we constructed a ceremonial infrastructure around civil partnership to make it look like marriage and for a time we quietly ignored the fact that it was not as there was one main difference.\nMarriage requires a public declaration of intent, a vow. Civil partnership does not.\nStrictly speaking, civil partnerships can be entered into by rocking up at your local registry office with a couple of witnesses and registering your relationship. Thus those who register their relationship in this way can acquire all the rights and protections that come from being married.\nSo you can see the attraction for those who dislike what I refer to as \"the baggage\" that goes with marriage. Equal marriage was an enormous step forward, now we need to finish the job and extend the same equality to civil partnership.\nA Scottish government consultation found that more than half of respondents wanted civil partnerships extended. The Isle of Man introduced different-sex civil partnerships this summer. Findings from the Office of National Statistics show that there are 3 million cohabiting different-sex couples in the UK and the number is rising fast. That means 1 in 5 households are a different-sex cohabiting couple: surely it is only a matter of time before the government has to realise that we cannot cling on to old traditions while the world around us changes.\nBut perhaps the biggest thing that has given me so much hope is the news that prompted me to write this post. In 2015 Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, a London couple, took the government to court over its refusal to allow different sex couples the right to get a civil partnership. Though their case was rejected at the first stage, their appeal is being heard this November and I understand their legal team remain optimistic of winning. Should they succeed in getting a ruling that the ban on different-sex civil partnerships is unlawful I can't imagine the government will be slow-footed in lifting that ban.\nEven if they do not win Charles and Rebecca's case has already captured the support and attention of a vast swathe of people inside and outside of Westminster. Politicians from all parties support the campaign set up in their honour - the Equal Civil Partnerships Campaign - and over 70,000 people have signed a petition backing their cause.\nChange is on its way. Just like in 2013 I want the Liberal Democrats to lead that change. I hope that you will join me in supporting Charles and Rebecca in their campaign and pursuing all the legislative means possible to finish the job we started three years ago.\n* Alistair Carmichael is the MP for Orkney and Shetland and Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesperson",

Less than two months ago, we passed a policy at Conference that committed the party to remain inside the European Union. Our reputation for many years has been that of a Europhile party, and nearly all of our votes are aware of this fact. So too are the thousands of new members who joined after the referendum. To not vote against would not only be betraying party members, it would be betraying our voters too. After a bruising period in coalition in which we lost the trust of many of our members, I fear that retreating from our pro-European principles poses an existential threat to the party.\nMake no mistake, the expressed will of the party is to clearly oppose the triggering of Article 50. The government have a mandate to trigger Article 50, but we are evidently not bound to vote for such a motion, just like we are not bound to vote for other government pledges that we stand resolutely opposed to, such as the Snooper's Charter or the repeal of the Human Rights Act.\nWe must escape from this idea that the referendum result means the democratic process has ended. We have the right and the responsibility to scrutinise and oppose the Conservative Brexit plans, and we have the right and responsibility to not only believe that Brexit remains against the national interest, but to promote that idea and campaign upon it.\nJust because you lose a battle doesn't mean you stop fighting for what's right; just ask Labour how it worked out for them. We cannot afford to triangulate ourselves into bland centrism. We must stand up for our principles now more than ever.\nAlready, there are dozens of party members who are so concerned that they have signed a request for a Special Conference to ask if our MPs to stick to the crystal clear policy we passed in Brighton: no to Article 50, no to Brexit.

She concluded with an analogy \"The EU is like a football team. The UK is a big player which, when playing with the other 27 players, can win in the League. On its own, it will not be as successful. That's why I want the UK to continue to lead and be part of the one of the greatest teams of modern world history.\"\nSuzanna Austin spoke passionately about the freedoms we enjoy. She recounted attending a wedding with a friend who is a member of the LGBT community in Tunisia. They knew that disclosing her friend's sexual orientation could have serious consequences. That's what makes her so passionate about the European project. She said: \"we stand for equality, for freedoms which I don't take for granted, for progressiveness in our society.\" She also mentioned the oft repeated view that the Commonwealth could replace much of the trade the UK does with the EU. \"Most of the countries in [the Commonwealth] see the UK as the entrance to the EU and post-Brexit, they would ask a higher price to trade with us.\"\nMichael Mullaney closed by stating \"Brexit parties have betrayed the UK. All their promises have been broken. People have now realised they have been deceived and want to stop Brexit.\" Mr. Mullaney spoke on the recent electoral successes of the Liberal Democrats in the local elections and recent opinion polls reflect changing attitude of voters approving the message 'Stop Brexit'.\nThe candidates concluded with the message that Liberal Democrats have shown leadership at all levels of government and have a consistent message for voters in the East Midlands: a vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to Stop Brexit. Loughborough PPC Ian Sharpe closed the meeting by thanking the speakers and encouraging activists and the audience alike to help the Liberal Democrats achieve another electoral success story.\nVoting will take place on the 23rd of May across the United Kingdom. Postal votes have already been sent out, and polling stations will be set up across the East Midlands. We urge all voters to check where the nearest polling station is and make sure their voices heard.",

Newton Dunn was one of the EU's official representatives alongside 150 heads of state and government at a three-day UN summit to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, a planetary roadmap to fight hunger, disease and maternal and child mortality, provide basic education for all and protect the environment.\nAlthough many of the targets contained in the MDGs are currently off-track, Newton Dunn welcomed the great progress that has been made over the past decade.\n\"The MDGs are achievable - we are on track to halve the number of people globally living below the poverty line, and have made real progress on treating and preventing malaria and HIV, for example. But other targets, particularly concerning infant mortality and maternal health, are not being met.\n\"Rich countries - including EU Member States - must not falter. Even in these tough economic times, it is imperative that we keep our promises to the poor and commit 0.7% of GNI to development aid. When it comes to development and the MDGs, we are talking about the very poorest people in the world. Their nations are often the most fragile when it comes to coping with international crises, yet it was not their bankers and mortgage brokers who caused the recent financial and economic turmoil. We cannot turn our backs on them now. The need to stay committed is actually greater than ever.\n\"I was pleased to note the findings of a recent survey of European citizens1, that despite our own troubles, a resounding 80% of Europeans support our commitments to the 0.7% GNI figure. As the world's largest donor, the EU is well placed to take on this call from its citizens and to continue to lead the MDG agenda.\n\"It is also absolutely clear that public aid alone will not be enough. We have to bring the private sector on board, work together with emerging development partners - especially China, and look at new funding sources. And, all aid and other assistance must be used as efficiently and effectively as possible.\"\n\"We must seize all available means in the remaining 5 years, to ensure all the goals become reality.\"",

The result was entirely predictable.\nThe party then spent four years in the wilderness. A steady, but uninspiring, leadership from Vince and hard work from our local government activists saw the party slowly improve its position.\nIn the 2019 Euro Elections the Remainers put their faith in the Lib Dems, only to be let down again at the General Election. This time a combination of a terrible campaign, inexperienced and badly advised leadership, fear of Corbyn and First Past the Post ensured that faith in the Lib Dems was once again misplaced. Not all our fault, but with a good campaign and steady leadership we should have made 50 seats, and the picture today would have been different.\nThe next challenge is more critical than Brexit. It is not our future in Europe at stake, it is the future of the planet. The youth have shown that they are concerned about Climate Change, but what about the political parties? In the UK the Green Party, with their Green New Deal, are ahead, the Lib Dems are not far behind and Labour is pushing us. The Tories are way behind - leave it to them, and our grandchildren are in for a very rough deal.\nOn Housing and Transport they have little to say, and on Industrial Strategy nothing.\nWe must not let the public down again.\nIgnore the calls that there are no votes in Green Policies. Australia is on fire; the BBC are about to launch a series of programmes on Climate Change and our current wet weather will wreck our food supply.

If she wins, we could provide a home for the refugees. We are years off a General Election so at this stage we do not have to worry about guidelines for standing in individual seats.\nOne of our policies is to avoid trade deals with countries that have policies counter to the Paris Agreement.

After all, it's a big country, with an emerging middle class who want to travel, buy luxury goods and send their children to good universities overseas. Why wouldn't we want to build stronger links with a Commonwealth country that is likely to be one of the world's largest economies before too long? And yet, the attention of our politicians and diplomats often seems biased towards China.\nFrankly though, after Theresa May's trip to New Delhi and Bengaluru, I almost wish that she hadn't bothered. Yes, I acknowledge that she has a number of problems in attempting to build a stronger relationship with India - the fact that she is trying to implement a Brexit decision on the basis that migration was a key factor, whilst some Leave campaigners were claiming that Brexit would mean easier access for Indians (and others) wanting to visit family here, is a contradiction almost impossible to square. But she seems determined to reinforce the fears that many Indians have about Britain and its attitude towards them.\nContinued downward pressure on the number of Indians allowed into Britain to study has led to a surge of young people travelling to the United States, Canada and Australia instead, denying our universities valuable revenue, and all because an unknown number overstay their visas. A concession allowing very wealthy Indians into the \"GREAT Club\", a VIP visa service aimed at those likely to be able to invest significant sums of money, is merely a pinprick in the numbers of those wanting to come to Britain, either on holiday or to visit family. There has been no movement on making it easier to get a British visa generally, and it is fearsomely difficult to get one at present.\nNarendra Modi, the Indian Prime Minister, has made it clear that greater freedom of movement for Indians is a key part of any trade deal post-Brexit, and until Theresa 'gets it', there isn't likely to be a deal. Indian politicians won't easily forget that she has been one of the prime obstacles to a trade deal between the European Union and India, either.\nSome of the supposedly free-trade, pro-Commonwealth Conservative MP's need to be challenging their leader to deliver upon some of the promises made by the Leave campaign. Daniel Hannan, who called for a level playing field for non-EU nationals, might like to campaign for just that. After all, he did try to persuade Asian voters that Brexit would lead to enhanced opportunities to come to Britain.\nOr, more likely, it's just another broken promise, never likely to be redeemed.\nComments on Theresa May went to India, and all I got was a lousy T-shirt…",

Was the cost, personal and political, worth it?\nI'm standing on the edge of a one-horse town in the middle of nowhere, blinded by the mid-morning sun. Nothing to the left of me, nothing to the right. Just heat and dust. Ennio Morricone's theme tune to The Good, The Bad And The Ugly plays on a loop in my head. Eventually, a man hollers and strides over. He is wearing shorts and shades, and has a salt-and-pepper beard. He could be a reclusive former pop star, who walked away from fame and gave up on the niceties of life.\n\"I think you're the first Brit ever to come to Olmedo,\" Nick Clegg says, forgetting he is one himself. \"And I hope you're the last.\" Silence. He apologises; he doesn't mean it like that. It's just that he values his privacy, and this town 150km from Madrid is where Clegg's wife, Miriam González Durántez, grew up, and where they come every summer with their three boys to stay with her mother. A sanctuary.\nHe takes me on a brief tour. From the bridge, we can see sugar beet fields in the distance; here is the only hotel, there the town hall. Here is the church where he and Miriam got married, there the bust of his father-in-law, the first democratically elected mayor of Olmedo (though he was also in office under Franco). We continue walking. I wonder if we are heading towards the family home, but we end up at a cafe. Clegg orders two milky coffees in Spanish. \"You're not hungry, are you?\" he asks. But it's more a statement than a question.\nFew have experienced the extremes of political fortune quite like Nick Clegg. In 2010, there was no politician in the land as popular as the then leader of the Liberal Democrats. He appeared so much fresher than David Cameron and Gordon Brown in the televised election debates. He answered directly, remembered the names of people who asked questions, and promised change. He represented the radical centre that, given half a chance, would introduce proportional representation, elect the House of Lords, save the planet. The young loved him, not least because of one crucial pledge: the Lib Dems would not increase university tuition fees. Five years before Corbynism, there was Cleggmania, and it was just as giddy.\nPerhaps it was easy for Clegg to make his promises: after all, the Lib Dems were never held accountable because they never won general elections. Only, this time, they grabbed 57 seats and formed Britain's first coalition government sinceChurchill's war ministry in the 1940s. Cameron was more than willing to work with the Lib Dems - he was desperate to: Clegg gave him the numbers and provided likability. But six years is an eternity in politics. The deputy prime minister became better known as Calamity Clegg, Cameron's puppet, the ultimate political Judas.\nClegg has just written a political memoir, baldly called Politics. We are spoilt for choice when it comes to personal nadir: there's the 2014 poll that reveals he is the least popular leader in modern British history; the occasion when his security guards told him to lie flat in his car to hide from protesters; the 2015 election, when the Lib Dems lost all but eight of their seats; and, my personal favourite, his then nine-year-old son Alberto walking around the supermarket singing the spoof song I'm Sorry, based on the apology his father issued after the coalition tripled tuition fees.\nHow did Alberto come to be singing it in a supermarket? \"I can't remember! This is… four years ago! It's a very catchy tune.\" Clegg laughs through gritted teeth. Remind me how the song goes, I say. \"I'm not going to sing the bloody song. We were in quite a crowded supermarket in Putney, and he just started singing it. I quickly gave him some sweets and he stopped - they weren't gobstoppers, but they had the same effect.\"\nWas Alberto the only one of his three boys who sang it? \"I don't quite know what the relevance of this is.\" His voice rises. Well, I say, it's in your book. \"Have the other kids ever sung it? Yes, of course.\" Has Miriam? Now his voice rises to an incredulous squeak. \"I don't know, Simon!\" Well, I say, if ever a song was written taking the piss out of me, I'm sure my whole family would sing it loud and proud. He relaxes. \"Exactly! Exaaaactly! So they all sang it. Whether Miriam sang it as well… I'm sure she hummed along.\" He pauses. \"I'm bristling because there was a lot of piss-taking, obviously.\"\nHe's not wrong there. It's only now, a year on and since Cameron's resignation, that Clegg's legacy is beginning to be reassessed. Perhaps he was a moderating influence on the Tories, after all. Perhaps we didn't give him the credit he deserved. That's what he claims in his book, at any rate. An examination of the nature of coalition and liberalism, it is also a rage against the populism of the Brexiteers and Corbyn and, more than anything, a defence of his five years holding Cameron's hand - and occasionally slapping it.\nWhy write it? \"The turbulence in politics right now is so great, and accelerating at such a pace, that I wanted to have a stab at understanding what's going on. And, crucially, given that liberalism is on the defensive everywhere, it's: how can you get back in the ring?\"\nClegg's is a memoir that reveals itself by stealth; a book by a man wounded by his experience. One leitmotif is the lack of credit the Lib Dems, and Clegg in particular, got for the coalition's successes, from putting a brake on austerity to taxing plastic bags. If the Tories liked a policy, he says, they simply claimed it as their own. Today, it's the plastic bag tax that irks him. \"What did I see last week? There was a great deal of stuff in the press about the plastic bag tax. I personally insisted on that, and the Conservatives were ferociously opposed. I remember Osborne saying, 'This is ridiculous - I'm not going to accept it.' Did you see any mention…?\"\nClegg is so worked up, he can't complete his sentence. You sound really pissed off, I say. He instantly recovers his cool, and insists he's anything but. \"No, it's not my nature to be angry, but am I a bit frustrated? Yes. I did not cater for the sheer brazen ruthlessness with which the Conservative party would hoover up any good news.\"\nWhy did he want to form a coalition: to soften austerity or because he wanted power? Simple, he says: power. \"Fashionable parts of the left now sneer at government, and I've never understood that. I can understand it if you're a philosopher or a religious figure, but if you're in the secular world of politics, which is a grubby, tough, volatile business, why on earth would you not want to try and do shit? I just don't understand what this whole Corbyn thing is for, if it doesn't do anything.\"\nThe problem is, Clegg says, he didn't understand the importance of the political symbols, from the Rose Garden press conference with Cameron (which came across as more bromance than business) to his acceptance of a nothingy office with no front entrance (Cameron refused to allow him to use Downing Street as a backdrop for media interviews).\nClegg was so busy justifying the Lib Dems' role as a restraining agent that he forgot to tell the public they were in power. \"It is something I mistakenly played up to. We portrayed ourselves as a political prophylactic, rather than an agent of change.\" Actually, he says, the coalition negotiations were a triumph. The Tories agreed to virtually all the Lib Dems' demands: fixed-term parliaments, scrapping ID cards, a referendum on electoral reform, measures to tackle climate change. \"At the outset, it felt like a genuinely composite government. We got more of our policies into the coalition agreement than they did. And that shows both the strengths and weaknesses of me as a leader, and us as a party, in that we were diligently ticking off the number of policies. But we learned in hindsight that you can get as many of your policies in, but if there's one policy you don't, notably tuition fees, that's the thing people remember.\"\nBut reading the coalition agreement, it looks as if the Lib Dems knew from the start that they would be screwed on tuition fees. The final paragraph, under the heading Education, reads: \"If the response of the government to Lord Browne's report [the review into higher education funding] is one that Liberal Democrats cannot accept, then arrangements will be made to enable Liberal Democrat MPs to abstain in any vote.\" In the event, Clegg did not abstain on the vote to increase tuition fees (from £3,290 a year to a maximum of £9,000); six months into government, he voted in favour.\nIn his book, Clegg accuses Cameron, whom he broadly likes, of hypocrisy, claiming to care about climate change and Europe and the poor, then kowtowing to the right wing of his party. Is it true that when Clegg suggested there needed to be more social housing, Cameron told him it only turned people away from the Tories? \"It would have been in a Quad meeting [the committee of Cameron, George Osborne, Clegg and Danny Alexander], so either Cameron or Osborne. One of them - I honestly can't remember whom - looked genuinely nonplussed and said, 'I don't understand why you keep going on about the need for more social housing - it just creates Labour voters.' They genuinely saw housing as a Petri dish for voters. It was unbelievable.\"\nBefore long, he says, he was dealing with a very different Tory party from the one with which he went into government. He initially found Osborne bright, funny and empathetic. \"One of the gifts he has is the ability to think of politics from someone else's point of view, which is genuinely unusual, and why he was such a consummate dealmaker.\") But their relationship soured. \"What I found offputting was the callousness to his political calculations, particularly around welfare. Welfare for Osborne was just a bottomless pit of savings, and it didn't really matter what the human consequences were, because focus groups had shown that the voters they wanted to appeal to were very anti-welfare, and therefore there was almost no limit to those anti-welfare prejudices. I found that very unattractive, very cynical.\"\nHe also accuses Theresa May of distorting figures to stoke up anti-immigrant feeling. \"The Home Office produced a report called Free Movement. It was all about giving red meat to their backbenchers on Europe. She kept saying there was this terrible 'abuse' of freedom of movement, when simply describing EU citizens exercising their right to come and work in the UK. They tried to insert statistics suggesting the number of UK citizens living and working in other EU countries was half a million lower than any other mainstream estimate.\"\nWho does he think comes out worst in his book? Clegg looks appalled: \"It's not that kind of book.\"\nIt is, I say.\n\"No, it's not,\" he says, firmly. \"I don't know. You tell me.\"\n\"M…\" I begin.\nHe grins. \"Oh, gosh, yes, Michael Gove. Yep, you're probably right. Fair enough.\"\nThe stories are endless: from Gove hiding in the toilet when Lib Dem education minister David Laws visits him, to Gove leaking apocryphal stories about González Durántez to the press, and announcing the return of O-levels on a whim. Clegg tells me Gove was cultured and often had him in stitches, but then he goes for him.\n\"The more I governed with Gove and his team, the more I realised he was just striking a series of superficial poses. You've got a generation of politicians very close to the media, people like Boris Johnson and Gove, and the problem is, the skill of tossing off 800 words on one subject and then on another a week later is completely different to governing. With Cameron and Osborne, there was a seriousness about what they were doing - a deadly seriousness I often didn't like. But with Gove it was just a series of throwaway poses about our kids' futures. There's this ersatz intellectual heft that Gove and his people have that I don't think is merited.\n\"People such as Gove and Johnson have elevated striking poses into a political art form. Their apogee was the referendum. I wanted Gove to win the party leadership. He won the argument, and he should have been in a position of power to face the music.\"\nClegg recently revealed that Gove was responsible for leaking a story about a supposed conversation Clegg had with the Queen (with Gove present), in which she tore a strip off him for being so unquestioningly pro-European, and suggested she was a Brexiteer - a conversation Clegg insists never happened. \"It was complete rubbish. I was lucky enough to be president of the privy council, so I had the huge honour of meeting the Queen pretty well monthly for five years. I don't remember every conversation we had, but would I remember if I had received this tongue-lashing? Of course I would. And I don't.\"\nHow does he know the story came from Gove? \"The other source of the Sun's story told me.\"\nOf all our recent British political leaders, Clegg is the most bracingly European. He speaks fluent Spanish, Dutch, French and German. His half-Russian father, a descendant of Tsarist nobility, was a successful banker; his Dutch mother had lived in Indonesia, where she and her family were interned in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp during the second world war. Clegg attended Westminster public school, where he was a keen actor, appearing with Helena Bonham Carterin a production of The Changeling (she accidentally kicked him in the balls). He studied archaeology and anthropology at Cambridge university, where he appeared in a play about Cyrano de Bergerac under the directorship of Sam Mendes. There is still something actorly about him. At times, when he asserts himself, his voice shifts from urbane political class to a rasping Ray Winstone.\nClegg went on to study at the University of Minnesota and then the prestigious College of Europe in Bruges, where he met Miriam, today regarded as a leading expert on European trade law. After working for the European Commission, Clegg became a Lib Dem MEP for the East Midlands, and in 2005 won a seat as MP for Sheffield Hallam. Astonishingly, two years later he was leader of the party. Now 49, he looks both young and old for his age - boyish but jowly, with white chest hair prodding through his T-shirt, and surprisingly hairy ears. He has a bad back, and regularly asks if we can stand up or walk around to ease his discomfort.\nAgain, he talks of the viciousness of the personal attacks on him. At one point, Labour MP Barry Gardiner stood up in parliament and called him a quisling. (Vidkun Quisling was the head of Norway's government who collaborated with the Nazis.) Did he challenge Gardiner? \"No,\" Clegg says quietly. \"I think I should have. The advice you get in the frontline of politics is, don't answer back.\"\nAre you saying that if you had somebody round for dinner and they called you a quisling, you wouldn't fight back? He smiles apologetically. \"I'd probably get up and lamp them,\" he says. \"With hindsight, I should have been more outspoken. There's a very British culture in Westminster where people say unspeakably beastly things to each other in the Chamber, then, when they shuffle next to each other for a cup of tea, they talk about the weather. I'm too Dutch for that.\" Only he wasn't: he took it on the chin.\nDoes he feel a bit sorry for himself? He pulls himself up, straight-backed, and momentarily morphs into the Major from Fawlty Towers. \"No. Never have done. Wasn't brought up like that. You get on with things and take the knocks. Look, it was a fantastic privilege to do what I did. I'm very lucky. I'm absolutely besotted with my kids, and I survived more or less with my limbs still attached to my body.\"\nAs if on cue, a procession of mini-Cleggs strolls by the cafe. His gorgeous boys (14-year-old Antonio, 12-year-old Alberto and seven-year-old Miguel), accompanied by Miriam and her mother, stop to chat. Miriam asks how my flight was, Antonio tells me Manchester United will win the league now that they've signed Paul Pogba. And then they are on their way. \"See you later,\" Miriam says. Clegg looks at Miriam adoringly, as if he still can't quite believe his luck. \"I was smitten by her the first day,\" he says. \"Bowled over. Love at first sight. She didn't speak a word of English; our early courtship was in French. She kept telling me stories I couldn't quite follow. I was so bewitched, it made no difference.\"\nMiriam recently wrote a warts-and-all cookbook, Made In Spain, in which she revealed that the Camerons had wanted to be friends, but she wasn't really up for it; that Samantha Cameron had served the Cleggs roast chicken with a tube of Hellmann's mayonnaise, rather than making her own; and that she had refused to be in the house, let alone cook, when Osborne visited (Clegg and the then chancellor had a takeaway). Was it embarrassing when Miriam refused to stay around for Osborne? \"Not at all,\" Clegg says, his voice rising again. \"My embarrassing thing is that I've not actually read what Miriam said in her book,\" he says by way of a diversion. \"I remember her leaving as George came. But she didn't stalk off. She went out with friends, having put the kids to bed.\"\nWhere does he stand on Hellmannsgate? \"To be fair to Miriam, unless you're very sensitive about your own mayonnaise, I don't think that counts as score-settling.\"\nIn 2014, Lib Dem peer Matthew Oakeshott suggested the party would do better under a new leader and attempted to orchestrate a coup against Clegg. Others, no more favourably disposed, told the deputy PM that he'd made his bed and had better lie in it. How much did it take out of him? A lot, he says. In the book, he writes that by 2011 he was working long hours, smoking too much and putting on weight. How many cigarettes? Sometimes three to five a night, he says. There's something touching about the fact that even his excess is so modestly calibrated. How much weight did he put on? \"I didn't weigh myself, Simon! But Paddy Ashdown told me very sternly, 'You're too fat.'\" Did he have to get bigger trousers? \"Yes.\"\nDid he consider resigning? \"I didn't think, in spring 2011, when I was feeling so shit and was fat and whatever, that I should quit. But there were several times in the last two or three years when I thought long and hard about whether that was the right thing to do. In the end, I thought, it's the worst of both worlds: you've created a government that lots of people heap opprobrium on you for, and then you quit when you've got nothing to show for it.\"\nHe felt that leading players Vince Cable and Chris Huhne failed to give him their full support. (Cable seemed to be preparing to take over the leadership, while Huhne didn't help matters when he ended up in prison for perverting the course of justice.) \"Well, I don't think Vince and Chris would ever count themselves as great team players,\" Clegg says.\nIf I was skippering the Lib Dems, I say, I'd want team players on my side. \"Well, it's not like that, is it? Vince's strength, and the reason he's liked by the public, was precisely because he stood apart. So there was no point in me saying, 'Oh, Vince, can you put in a shift in the boiler room with the rest of the team?' What I did was give them both big departmental responsibilities.\"\nHowever much Clegg points the finger at a treacherous Tory leadership or the recalcitrant big beasts in his own party, he knows that ultimately there is one person to blame for his failures: himself. The day he agreed to triple tuition fees, he lost credibility. Isn't it easy to promise to freeze fees when you think you'll never be in power? \"Yes, clearly,\" he concedes. \"And when we made that commitment, I didn't think it was very sensible. Nor did Vince.\"\nYou sold yourself as the politician youngsters could trust and you ended up being defined by…\nHe finishes my sentence: \"A lack of trust.\"\nClegg argues there will always be something on which the smaller party in a coalition fails to deliver. But this is different, I say. It wasn't about failing to deliver, it was about doing something you expressly promised not to. \"Yes. Right. Yes, I see what you mean. My hunch is, the reason why the tuition fees thing enraged people as much as it did - and for some people still does, because it's so personal to people - is that it's their sons, their daughters. Getting your kids into university, seeing them in a gown on the mantelpiece, it's the distillation of a better life for your children. I have spent a lot of time thinking about the emotional pungency of it. It's like a politician coming out of the television going 'Bang!' [he makes a fist with one hand and delivers a knockout blow to the other] to my face as a parent. That's my explanation.\"\nDoes he replay the conversation he had with Cameron when he agreed to the increase, and come up with alternative scenarios? \"Yeah, of course. One of the many lessons I've learned is that you can't just spring things on people if they don't see there is a problem in the first place. We just sprung this massive change on how we were going to fund our universities, without explaining there was a crisis in university funding. So often I do wonder what would have happened if we'd just pushed the university sector over the edge and said, we're not going to help you out, we're not going to give you a perfectly formed solution.\"\nSo he conceded to Cameron too quickly? \"Far too quickly. We should have let the universities talk about it, and yes, there would have been egg on my face, I would have had to swallow my pride. But at least we could have said, 'Listen, we are responding to an urgent problem.'\"\nSo many of those students who placed that hope in him have since dumped him for Corbyn. They could have been his, I say. \"Yes. Yep.\" Is that his biggest regret? \"Yes, of course it's a huge regret, but that is not just a phenomenon in Britain. What you're seeing across the developed world, particularly among university-educated youngsters active on social media, is a movement from one figure of hope who can deliver the next Jerusalem to the next.\"\nNow he has to look to his own future. \"My days of leadership are over. I promise you, having been as battle hardened as I have - do you mind if I stand up? - I'm not hankering for another go in the trenches.\" Tim Farron, the current Lib Dem leader, has given Clegg the job of scrutinising the government's Brexit strategy and holding it to account. He is keen to do that, and says that if there is a snap election, he will defend his seat in Sheffield Hallam. Beyond that, he doesn't have a clue; he's too young for a bit-part life and wants a new career.\nI ask if the day after the 2015 general election was his lowest point. \"Well, you can't get much lower than that,\" Clegg says. But no, it wasn't. \"I felt more wretched after the referendum than after the election. Political parties go up and down. Dare I say it, it's not the end of the world. I immediately fell on my sword after the election, took responsibility, but we will come back. We already are. But on the 23rd of June we lost something for good as a country, which I feel much more strongly about. You can't undo a lot of that damage.\"\nHe walks me back to the bus station at the edge of town. I tell him I still think his biggest regret is the fact that all those young voters now feel he betrayed them. No, he says, I'm being sentimental: he's more ruthless than I want to believe. His real regret is failing to deliver constitutional reform. As for tuition fees, if it hadn't been that, it would have been another issue that would have killed off Cleggmania. But the people he is interested in are those still convinced that coalition government can work - messy, compromised and occasionally shaming, but always serious politics. And if you believe in governing alongside parties you disagree with, as he does, you can never hope to emerge blemish-free. Actually, he says, the reality, is even less heroic. \"There is absolutely no way that you can maintain a steadfast reputation for integrity.\"\nDavid Cameron seemed a little on edge. We were alone in his study in Number 10, very shortly after the formation of the coalition, and he wanted to ask me something that had clearly been preying on his mind. \"This is terribly awkward,\" he admitted. \"The thing is… George has for so long had his eye on Dorneywood… He's very close to me… Would you mind if he used Dorneywood instead of you?\" He then proposed that I share the foreign secretary's traditional grace-and-favour countryside retreat, Chevening, rather than Dorneywood, which was ordinarily used by the number two in government.\nI was a bit taken aback. I thought he wanted to ask me something important. It hadn't really occurred to me that I might get a retreat to use at weekends, still less that there was any great distinction between one or the other. Cameron's plea suggested that George Osborne had been measuring up the curtains for years.\nI accepted the new arrangement and found myself sharing Chevening, a grand mansion in the Kent countryside near Sevenoaks, for the next five years with the foreign secretary, first William Hague and later Philip Hammond. Not at the same time, I hasten to add; that would have been taking coalition a little too far.\nWhether or not occupying Dorneywood made any difference to anything, I couldn't say. But, like Westminster itself, many of the so-called trappings of power - grace-and-favour mansions, grand offices, ministerial Jaguars - can seem completely alien to people who have not spent their lives preparing for power. As such, it is easy to underestimate their importance.\nWhen it was suggested that I take an office with no publicly recognisable entrance of its own, I didn't mind, as I thought I wouldn't need an equivalent of the Number 10 door at which to receive guests. When it was decided where I would sit in the House of Commons at Prime Minister's Questions, I thought it made sense to sit supportively next to the PM, to show that the coalition could work smoothly.\nBig mistakes. All of them.\n***\nFrom the outside, the first day of the coalition government looked just about as smooth a transition of power as you could wish for, but behind closed doors it was anything but. With the negotiations wrapped up in just five days, the prime minister and I spent the morning of Wednesday, 12 May 2010 in Downing Street, appointing ministers to our first cabinet, before sharing the stage in the sun-drenched Rose Garden. When Cameron turned to me shortly afterwards and told me that, \"We may have overdone it a bit\", he was probably right. It was easy to get a little carried away with the \"new dawn\" feel of the occasion. But I soon found out that not only was I physically unprepared for government; government was physically unprepared for me.\nOn that first day in Downing Street, there was no office waiting for me. The in-house team at Number 10 quickly switched into gear for the incoming prime minister, but had little idea how to handle a deputy prime minister sharing power at the top. I was ushered upstairs to one of the first-floor state rooms. There I spent several hours, accompanied by Danny Alexander and a small number of my closest advisers, while the civil service buzzed around the building, supporting the new PM and largely ignoring us. There wasn't even a phone.\nWhile the 200 or so staff in Downing Street leapt into action to support the new prime minister, I was given just a single civil servant. My mistake, at least at first, was to accept the model presented to me. Having negotiated the coalition agreement without the help of civil servants, and with no experience in government myself, I simply didn't see the need to surround myself with teams of officials. And having witnessed the infantile Whitehall turf war waged by Gordon Brown's courtiers against Tony Blair, I thought it best to avoid rival power centres.\nThe most unforgiving consequence was the tsunami of paperwork that fell directly to me to contend with. I was asked my opinion on things I didn't have the remotest clue about - dense, technical issues to do with the mechanics of everything from local government finance to energy subsidies. Every evening I would plonk myself on the sofa at home with my box and sit there dutifully wading through it, as family life happened around me. I would stay there virtually every night until the early hours. Then I would grab a few hours' sleep, which were disturbed most nights by our then one-year-old son Miguel, only to get up early to help get our two older boys fed, changed and packed off to school.\nThe effect was not only physically draining, it was politically debilitating, too. Very quickly it became obvious that the central nervous system of Whitehall lay in the daily negotiations between me and Cameron. At the same time, the two most senior Liberal Democrats in the cabinet, Vince Cable and Chris Huhne, were, notwithstanding their obvious intellectual strengths, not known as nature's keenest team players. From the outset, their focus was devoted to their own departments - and their own political reputations. While they did this to great effect (and I encouraged them to do so), it meant I was unable to rely on others to defend in the media what we were doing. I soon became such a focal point for anger that I felt the impulse to defend myself publicly. No wonder Osborne said, somewhat smugly, in an interview in 2011 that, having expected to become British politics' public enemy number one, he \"hadn't reckoned on Nick Clegg\".\nI never contacted newspaper editors in response to negative coverage about myself. My only exception to this rule was when my family was affected. Every few weeks, Miriam and I had to devote a fair amount of time and emotional energy to rebutting ludicrous claims: that Miriam was somehow responsible for human-rights abuses in Western Sahara; that she was guilty of tax irregularities in her law firm several years before she was even employed by it; that our decision to send our Catholic children, who had attended a Catholic primary school, to a Catholic secondary school was a sign of hypocrisy. And so on.\nI mistakenly assumed that if I worked hard within government, did my homework and took decisions on their merits, then, one way or another, the truth - that the coalition was acting out of reasonable motives - would become plain to see and political dividends would follow. What I did not anticipate was what actually happened: I did all that - and no one knew about it. This enabled critics from the left to lampoon the Liberal Democrats as spineless, and critics from the right to lambast us as illegitimate irritants who shouldn't have been in government in the first place. The public readily turned away from us. I failed to realise an interesting paradox of modern politics: in an age of unprecedented transparency, the reality of power can still remain obscure to the public.\nBy the spring of 2011, I was both drained and physically unfit. I smoked several cigarettes a night. I got virtually no exercise. Since becoming leader of the Liberal Democrats, I had dealt with pneumonia, chest pains, a broken toe, chronic coughs and bronchitis, while trying to look perky in public at all times. And throughout all of this, I would regularly crisscross London in the early evening to help put our three young boys to bed before returning to Westminster. No wonder there was a Nick Clegg Looking Sad website. They could have added Nick Clegg looking fat, pale and unhealthy, too.\nOver time, I worked out a better balance. I employed a larger team; I took up weekly kickboxing classes and had a rowing machine installed in a cubbyhole near my office; I cut down on the cigarettes and started to eat better. I handled the vast amount of paperwork more effectively by tackling most of it early in the morning instead of late at night, a switch of technique I later discovered Cameron had adopted, too.\nI discovered that one of the best ways to master the dysfunctional worlds of Westminster and Whitehall was simply to work outside them as much as possible. I restarted my pre-election habit of holding public question-and-answer sessions. I even started my own call-in show on LBC Radio with the veteran presenter Nick Ferrari. It was condemned as a foolish risk by many in the Westminster village, yet quickly proved to be sufficiently popular that a number of other politicians followed suit.\nMuch of what I have described might seem like the footling ephemera of political life. But I believe it lifts the lid on something more serious: politics is already populated by a surfeit of political professionals and apparatchiks; if we want people with an independent turn of mind who have led normal lives to represent our country in the future, there will need to be a shift. If every youthful misdemeanour is recycled on social media for ever, if the dysfunctional operation of Whitehall continues to expect too much of people at the top, and if politicians cannot protect their loved ones, we should not be surprised if in future parliament is populated by robots, monks and nuns.\n• This is an edited extract from Politics: Between The Extremes, by Nick Clegg, published on 15 September by Vintage at £20.

When I came back from Witney, I found my husband very seriously ill. An ambulance dash and some very scary moments later, my worst fears were confirmed and then some.\nThings have now settled down considerably. We've had a couple of boring days without medical drama now and we'd like things to stay that way. He will be in hospital for a wee while yet, though, so please bear with me if it takes me some time to respond to things. The rest of the team have been fantastic - so many thanks to them for stepping in while I've been preoccupied.\nThe reason for telling you all of this is to help you to understand how utterly furious I was to see that Liam Fox had actually said this out loud when asked about the rights of EU citizens following Brexit:\nTo give that away before we get into a negotiation would be to hand over one of our main cards in that negotiation and doesn't necessarily make sense at this point.\nYou just can't go changing the goalposts when people have made their home, maybe fallen in love, settled, had children, built lives and support networks. That is so wrong. It is simply not fair to put EU citizens in a situation where they won't know what's happening to them until the Brexit deal is stitched up behind closed doors.\nThe team caring brilliantly for my husband includes people who have moved here from other parts of the EU. I don't want to think of any of them being used as a negotiating card. They are working hard, in very difficult, under-resourced circumstances, giving outstanding and compassionate care to people at their most vulnerable.\nMy neighbours come from Poland. They've settled here, they pay taxes here, they've bought a house here, they've established themselves in the community. Their daughter was born here. Why should they face the stress of not knowing what their status will be? It is no way to treat people.\nOther friends, a UK and Belgian citizen, have just got married. They should not have to worry about whether one of them will be able to legally live here in two years' time.\nWe will all know somebody in this situation. That makes it personal and we must act.\nOne bit of campaigning I was able to take part in was this video. I recorded my bit sitting on my sofa in my pyjamas at about 11pm on Tuesday. How many of the others can you recognise?\nIf you wouldn't like your life to be disrupted in this way, don't inflict it on somebody else. This is one of these occasions when good people must do something. Signing the petition is just the start. We really need to stand up and be counted and fight for the rights of our EU friends, neighbours and colleagues who are paying taxes and contributing to our society. If we allow the government to treat one group of people badly, then we might find that we are next. We need to turn public opinion against the Government's cavalier attitude to these people's lives.\nThis is an argument we absolutely must win. It is not what I think of as British to muck people about in the way that Liam Fox suggests. I am thoroughly ashamed of a government that can even think of behaving like this.\n* Caron Lindsay is Editor of Liberal Democrat Voice and blogs at Caron's Musings",

A majority Liberal Democrat government would not renegotiate Brexit, we would cancel it by revoking article 50 and remaining in the European Union.\"\nShe will take the proposal to a vote at the party's autumn conference in Bournemouth, which starts on Saturday.\nSenior party figures have been toying for months with backing the revocation of article 50, but up to now only as an alternative to a no-deal Brexit. A source said the shift in policy was to back cancelling Brexit \"in all circumstances\".\nIt is understood that under the proposal the party would back immediately revoking article 50 in an election campaign. Should the party not win the election, it would then go back to supporting a second referendum and campaigning to remain.\nThe Lib Dems have been buoyed in recent weeks by the defections of the former Tories Phillip Lee and Sarah Wollaston and the ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Angela Smith. The former shadow frontbencher Chuka Umunna joined the party in June and the total number of Lib Dem MPs now stands at 17. The party has 120,000 members, its highest number ever.\nAt a potential election the party expects to take seats in remain-voting areas that have Labour and Tory incumbents, in line with its success at the European elections where it increased its number of seats from one to 16.\nSources in the Lib Dems said it was time for the party to set itself apart from Labour's \"renegotiation\" position on Brexit and make itself an unequivocal remain option for voters.\nThe move effectively closes down pre-emptive conversations around an electoral pact with Labour. Swinson angered many within Labour just a month into her new role when she criticised Jeremy Corbyn's suggestion that he should become a caretaker prime minister to stop a no-deal Brexit.\nInstead she said someone like Ken Clarke, who lost the Tory whip last week after he voted against the government, or the former deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman, would be better suited to the role. The shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, described her dismissal of Corbyn as \"extremely petulant\".\nUmunna said the decision to campaign to cancel Brexit made the Lib Dems the UK's \"biggest and strongest\" remain party. \"The Liberal Democrats are the number one choice for people at the next general election who are opposed to Brexit. Our position is clear and unambiguous. A majority Liberal Democrat government would not renegotiate Brexit, we would stop Brexit,\" he said.\n\"Ploughing headlong into a no-deal Brexit will be a huge, reckless gamble with people's jobs and livelihoods. Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong Brexiter and will be intensely relaxed if Brexit happens - indeed, he has spent years campaigning for it,\" Umunna added.\n\"By contrast, the Liberal Democrats under Jo Swinson's leadership are the UK's biggest and strongest remain party. We are determined to do all we can not only to stop a no-deal Brexit but to stop Brexit altogether.\"\nThe party has had a meandering journey to its now staunchly pro-EU position. In 2016 the then leader, Tim Farron, faced criticism from Sir Vince Cable, who went on to become his successor, for attempting to get the party to back a second referendum. Cable said the plan raised too many questions and would not be a \"panacea to anything\".\nCable shifted to a more pro-remain position during his two-year leadership of the party, eventually making support of a public vote his party's stance this year.\nHowever, he bitterly resisted a challenge from Umunna, then with Change UK, to back revoking article 50. He said it would be \"unsatisfactory\" and not the \"best outcome\" and the party should instead put its energies into trying to secure a second referendum.\nSwinson's change of direction is likely to be welcomed by the party's membership, but it will be subject to scrutiny as one of 19 motions due to be debated and voted on at the conference. There may be questions about the influence of Umunna, who is now the party's foreign affairs spokesman.",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_jo-and-ed-leadership-questions/content_540.html": "We put in a request to the Liberal Democrat leadership candidates to answer our questions and these are their responses.\nA. Social Justice\nThe Preamble to our Constitution commits us to \"upholding .. values of individual and social justice\" and seeking \"the widest possible distribution of wealth\". Conference agreed a strategy which asserts that: \"we stand for an open society, social justice including an economy which challenges inequality and for powerful communities at every level\".\nQ1 Do you agree that social justice is a central element in our Party's Values?\nJo. Yes. The first sentence of the preamble our constitution really says this best - that \"we exist to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality and community, and in which no one shall be enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity\".\nThese words just can't be achieved without actively championing those in need and holding the powerful, including the wealthy, to account. It's the foundation upon which we build a society that we can all be proud of. Social justice should form the foundation of everything we do: that way, we can work to ensure that the balance between individual liberty and fairness across society is achieved.\nEd. Yes, completely. Social Liberals such as Hobhouse, Hobson and Beveridge always placed liberalism within its social context and this was then further reflected in the concept of community politics where an individual's freedom has to be seen in its social context.\nTherefore, the pursuit of social justice and avoidance of enslavement by poverty has to be at the heart of the Party's values, policies and campaigning.\nSadly too many people in our country are currently enslaved by poverty and it was the feeling that the current economic system is not fair which drove much of the resentment which led many to vote for Brexit.\nOne of the party's core messages in the Brexit debate ought to be, the need to fix the economic causes of Brexit - including Britain gross personal and regional inequalities.\nQ2 What are the headline policies and big messages which communicate our commitment?\nJo. Firstly, we need to focus on rebuilding the social contract and the safety net that we all need at one point or another. We can all see that the system has broken down - over many years and under many governments. It's just no longer true that if you work hard and contribute when and where you can, that you will be rewarded with a job that pays enough to live on, a secure and affordable home, or the support of our welfare system when you need it. In this country in 2019, that's simply not good enough. Liberal Democrats should be clear that we are a party that is focused on fairness and generosity - on rebuilding a society that looks after those who need it and which rewards the people who support and contribute to it, not those who try to undermine it to make a fast profit.\nI also believe as a party one of the biggest policies and commitments we have made throughout our history is the belief that decisions should be made as close as possible to the people that they affect. That communities are best placed to make the right decisions. I want to make sure that Government supports this, firstly, by ensuring we are measuring the right things as a country - looking beyond GDP to understand the issues that matter to people - whether there is decent work, good homes and access to strong local services. Secondly, by reshaping our economy to put people and planet first - for example, making the largest companies to publish their climate risk exposure to incentivise decarbonisation and ensuring they report on staff wellbeing in addition to profits in their Annual Financial Statements.\nThese messages are, of course, looking beyond Brexit - but we all must be clear that stopping Brexit and working strongly with our friends in the European Union has to be at the heart of our party's message in this leadership election and beyond. Our position is unique, it's popular, it reaches out beyond our existing party members - but most importantly it goes to the heart of who we are as a party. Never have Charles Kennedy's words to conference in Glasgow in 2013 rung more true - \"A lot of the responsibility now rests with us… If the voice of rational pro-Europeanism is going to be heard, there's only one place it can come from and it should be us and it will be us.\"\nEd. To achieve social justice requires a government-wide approach, on everything from economic policy, tax and welfare to housing, education, health and much more - and we should say that: the system is broken, it needs to be fixed.\nHowever, the question is rightly about \"headline policies and big messages\" because politics (regrettably) works that way. So here's three specific policies I would want to lead on, and why:-\n- The biggest council house building programme in over 50 years\n- Give a decade-long spending boost to Britain's 6 poorest regions to help narrow the gap with Britain's richest regions\n- Make the UK the best educated and skilled nation in the world, within a decade\nI've chosen these for specific reasons.\nHousing costs and quality remain key factors in people's well-being and finances. Unless and until we provide more affordable housing, of greater quality, people will continue to have huge health problems due to everything from damp to overcrowding, and will continue to struggle to have much money left over when they've paid the rent (or mortgage). And housing benefit as a good housing subsidy has proved a failure. We need a radical shift.\nRegional inequality is utterly shocking in the UK. We have 2 of the top 10 richest regions in northern Europe, and 6 of the poorest regions. While this will need a myriad of different solutions, none will be cheap - and all will need a long term commitment.\nEducation remains the best chance to help a child make the best of their lives. The pupil premium has been an amazing success, but we still need significant new resources to ensure all disadvantaged children get the extra help they need. So we need a national mission that includes every child and young person, not just the \"majority\".\nThere's so much more that could be said - on benefits and tax in particular - but I personally think this type of policy programme conveys more to more people about our commitment to practical social justice.\nB. Disruption\nThere is greater disruption in the UK Party system than at any time in a century.\nQ3 How should the Liberal Democrats position ourselves to promote and gain maximum benefit from that disruption as a party and as a liberal movement?\nJo. I want the Liberal Democrats to become the rallying point for Britain's liberal movement - not focused on centrist populism but on making the liberal case in society. The amazing results we saw across the country in the local and European elections go beyond our message on Brexit. People are fed up with our broken politics and want something new. Throughout my political career I have worked with others who share our values to make progress and secure change. We can build on the momentum of the recent elections, to become the home for all those who share our values: who believe immigration is a good thing, who want to stop Brexit and who believe we must work together to solve the biggest issues facing the world like the climate emergency and ageing populations.\nEd. Between a nationalist right wing Tory party and a statist, sectarian Labour party there is a huge gap in the political spectrum for those like us with liberal, internationalist values.\nWe have the opportunity to set up camp firmly in that space and attract those with similar values to ours who have previously felt that the first past the post electoral system means that they must be a supporter of either Tory or Labour.\nOur pitch to maximise the benefit must start with our \"Stop Brexit\" message - we must never forget that our current success, and our relevance at the critical moment, is down to our principled and consistent anti-Brexit message.\nBut if we are to attract and keep both lifelong Conservative and lifelong Labour voters in our fold, we have to package a range of long held Lib Dem messages in ways they've not heard before.\nSo, for example, for former Tory \"business-friendly\" voters, our messages on everything from business rates reform to a green industrial strategy will carry weight.\nAnd for Labour-inclined folk, see my answer to the last question!\nQ4 What is the Leader's role in making that happen?\nJo. A leader needs to be able to get cut through, to speak passionately, convincingly and directly to those who do not yet consider themselves Liberal Democrats. This is not about who can get us from eight to twenty percent in the polls - we have already done that thanks to our wonderful members. This is about breaking through twenty percent. This means working with our members on the ground, supporting our campaigning, and working to once again get us the coverage we deserve. I have demonstrated my ability to get on the media to make the case for Liberal Democrats. In the 24 hours after I appeared on Question Time, 1500 people joined the party. I am the Leader that can take us beyond twenty percent - I will not put a cap on the Liberal Democrats' ambitions.\nEd. Policy comes from Conference - and any Leader must always recognise that and embrace that.\nYet the Leader must be the lead Lib Dem articulating our policies and values in a clear way - and with the discipline to focus on and repeat just a few simple messages.\nIf we say everything, we say nothing - so repetition of very few strong messages is a key part of the Job Description and requirements for the Leader in my view.\nOf course the Leader has many other tasks beyond the media - from driving forward on our diversity agenda, especially our relative failure to select many BAME candidates, to leading the fundraising efforts. But in positioning our party to maximise electoral benefit, it is absolutely simple messages and themes, repeated often.\nQ5 What should be the Party's strategy for breakthrough?\nJo. We do not have twenty years to build up slowly. The country needs a strong liberal voice now - to stop Brexit, yes, but also to build a prosperous future where we harness the technological revolution for the benefit of the people. That is why the strategy for breakthrough has to be one that reaches out to everyone who will listen, to have a bold message that is clear and unequivocal. This means not just appealing to our existing membership - important as you are - but reaching out beyond our supporters to those who feel let down by the current political system and the failure of the other parties. I am the leader to deliver that message and to build a broader liberal movement.\nEd. First, we should be very open to working closely with other parties to achieve specific aims like stopping Brexit and electoral reform. Such close co-operation is already taking place in Parliament, over Brexit, but it must be extended - and I have written extensively about my ideas for this, including a temporary Government of National Unity. We need to be planning how we do this at the next General Election - from tactical voting to even standing down for people like Caroline Lucas, as we did in 2017.\nSecond, we should avoid any Coalition with Brexit Tories or Brexit Labour - plus I don't see how we could work with either Johnson or Corbyn if they become/remain leaders of their parties. But we should use our - hopefully - much greater number of MPs, to pursue our objectives from the Opposition benches, as happens so often in other countries.\nC. Realignment\nWe want to see a re-alignment in UK Party politics to reflect the real issues and choices in the modern world.\nQ6 What do you say to people who are leaving Labour because of Corbyn and Brexit?\nJo. I say that you will find a welcoming home in the Liberal Democrats. We share your commitment to social justice and a fair and open society within our borders and beyond. We understand your frustration - your sense that even though the Labour party members are pro-Remain, your leader is refusing to listen and shutting the door to our European friends We agree that a leader should say what they really think rather than trying to hide their view in an attempt to be all things to all people.\nAs leader, I'll say the same things I have been saying for years - Liberal Democrats welcome everybody who believes in building a fair, free, and open society, and everybody who wants to see a stop to Brexit. That includes you.\nEd. If you want to be part of an internationalist, pro-European, pro tackling climate change party, that shares traditional Labour objectives for tackling inequality and investing in public services - and can sign up to the preamble of our constitution - come and join us and you will be most welcome.\nIf you can't, but like us you want to fight to stop Brexit, then let's work together to stop Brexit and change our electoral system so you can be true to your own beliefs.\nQ7 What do you say to people thinking of leaving a Boris-led Tory Party?\nJo. That if you were a Conservative because you believed in freedom of movement and a single market that supported British businesses and consumers, we understand you. If you're leaving because Boris Johnson's casual racism and loose relationship with the truth, we agree with you. If you were a Conservative who welcomed David Cameron's support of same-sex marriage or the introduction of a higher minimum wage to force businesses to put their employees before their owners - you will find allies in the Liberal Democrats. We're not a party where the leader dictates our policy.\nWe're a party of our members, of debate, and a great many people with a great many backgrounds. But most importantly - whether or not you join us, we can all focus on building cross-party support to stop Brexit, regardless of where we started out.\nEd. If you want to be part of an internationalist, pro-European, pro tackling climate change party, that shares traditional Conservative objectives for promoting business and investing in public services - and can sign up to the preamble of our constitution - come and join us and you will be most welcome.\nIf you can't, but like us you want to fight to stop Brexit, then let's work together to stop Brexit and change our electoral system so you can be true to your own beliefs.\nQ8 What should the Liberal Democrats be doing to involve new members and supporters in understanding and feeling at home with liberalism and committing to our Party's wider values and strategy?\nJo. In recent years we've seen a change from people joining a local party because of what we're doing in their area to joining us because they see what we're doing nationally and they want to support our values and ideas. I believe that's just as true of the people who joined post-2015 and post-Referendum as it is of people joining in the last few weeks. I really welcome the work local parties have done to become more of a social hub - bringing in new members and making friends with them before luring them into a Focus delivery round!\nI do think - however - we need to recognize that not all people will want to be involved locally but would love to get involved with campaigns nonetheless. As Leader I would like to see an increased focus on national issues campaigning - doing precisely what you're suggesting and bringing in new members and supporters, making them feel at home and broadening their commitment to our party values. This would help us build a core vote, even in places where our on the ground campaigns are weaker, and strengthen public understanding of our values.\nEd. Firstly, we need to be clearer in communicating in clear simple messages our values in a way which people can identify with.\nSecondly we need to make them feel welcome. Too often I hear that people have joined the party but then hear nothing. We need to find ways to open up policy making so that they feel that they can make a difference.\nAnd we should celebrate the progress we have already made. I am heartened by how many people who have joined the party relatively recently have already made their mark in the party - Sarah Olney in Richmond Park, Caroline Voaden our great new MEP in the south West and Siobhan Benita as our London Mayoral candidate - as well as and countless PPCs in winnable seats and Councillors running local authorities up and down the country.\nSo there has been some progress, but we need to do lots more, because we've got so many new members!\nD. Leading, Managing,\nJo. The tabloid press call Leaders \"bosses\" of their Party. But Liberal Democrats don't have a boss; we have a democratic structure defined by a Constitution in which the Leader has a place amongst others. The key roles are Leader (usually Policy Committee Chair), President, Chairs of the Finance and Resources and Campaigns & Elections Committees and State Party leaders.\nEd. Firstly, we need to be clearer in communicating in clear simple messages our values in a way which people can identify with.\nSecondly we need to make them feel welcome. Too often I hear that people have joined the party but then hear nothing. We need to find ways to open up policy making so that they feel that they can make a difference.\nAnd we should celebrate the progress we have already made. I am heartened by how many people who have joined the party relatively recently have already made their mark in the party - Sarah Olney in Richmond Park, Caroline Voaden our great new MEP in the south West and Siobhan Benita as our London Mayoral candidate - as well as and countless PPCs in winnable seats and Councillors running local authorities up and down the country.\nSo there has been some progress, but we need to do lots more, because we've got so many new members!\nQ9 How would you create a united team at the top of the Party to bring the Party together to define and deliver our strategy and goals? What's the Leader's role in that team?\nJo. We have a strong constitution for the party but the reality is that success in the top team is not based on what's on a sheet of paper but about people's attitudes - what we want, how we get it, and the relationships we build with others along the way. A good leader doesn't need a perfect system to drive the party forward - they need good people who understand how the system works, and the energy and commitment to make change happen.\nThat's why I will focus on building relationships that have been lacking in recent years - working with the party, not detached from it. Our greatest asset is our membership and to be a success a leader needs to know how to work with you, how to listen to you, and how to build a team that keeps us all pushing for the same thing.\nEd. My political hero is Paddy Ashdown and he was a great leader of our party.\nPaddy led from the front and sought to seize on issues and promote policies which emphasised our liberal values in simple messages. The policy of a penny on income tax to fund education or his stance to give the right to Hong Kong Chinese to come to the UK. Paddy led from the front and he inspired many people, including me to follow him. I didn't always agree with him, particularly concerning his dealings with Tony Blair, but nobody could doubt that he was a liberal to his fingertips.\nOne of the reasons he was so successful as a Leader was because he surrounded himself with a great team and always listened to people even if they profoundly disagreed with him. That is a sign of a great leader.\nE. Social Liberal Parties\nAmongst the world's liberal parties, the UK Liberal Democrats are a leading social liberal party along with the Canadian Liberal Party, South Africa's Democratic Alliance and the Dutch D66.\nQ10 Are the Liberal Democrats a social liberal Party?\nJo. I think we are, and I'd go further than that and say I think a large proportion of society is too. Although we see the tide of populism and nationalism rising, what I have found most reassuring in recent months is the push back around the world of liberals against the nastiest of politics. Just as the Liberal Party at the turn of the 20th century discovered that classical liberalism was an insufficient answer to the pressing issues affecting the UK then, we are now finding that economic, laissez-faire liberalism has proven insufficient as we continue into the 21st.\nWe're liberals and we have moved with the times - in the current system there's just no way that standing back and hoping for the best from businesses and markets delivers fairness, liberty, and equality of opportunity. This is as true regarding social justice as when it comes to meeting the challenge of the climate emergency.\nEd. I am very clear that we are a social liberal party but I want to sign a note of caution.\nWe cannot and must not be too purist in who we welcome into the Liberal Democrats if we are to seize the opportunity to unite those with liberal values within the Liberal Democrats. Particularly under a First Past the Post elect",

However, Professor Curtice said polling, notably from YouGov, did not support that assumption. Instead, he highlighted three conclusions about the election result based on his research:\n- It was not clear that the decision to back revoking Article 50 without a referendum was electorally costly;\n- Jo Swinson failed to make a favourable impression on voters and thus provide a point of attraction in contrast to Jeremy Corbyn;\n- The Party failed to communicate what a \"brighter future\" for Britain might entail.\nOther points from John Curtice's brilliant presentation which particularly struck me were that the Liberal Democrats drew most of their support from the educated middle class, but unlike the other parties had an almost equal level of support across all age groups.",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_page-40/content_488.html": "How can Britain stage an economic recovery after the Brexit crisis?\nFrom his booklet, 'Beyond Brexit: Liberal Politics for the Age of Identity', Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable explores how the UK can prosper socially and financially in the 2020s Without an effectively functioning economy, such objectives as \"fairness\" cannot be realised, and political extremes flourish. What Britain needs to prosper socially and financially in the 2020s is a longer-term strategy for sustainable growth which addresses the country's deep failings in respect of skills, short-term financial horizons and housing. And, now, those of us who oppose Brexit and economic nationalism generally face the challenge to say how we would improve the functioning of an economy damaged by the financial crisis and then, again, by Brexit. Good economic management will be more critical than ever.",

There is no fixed timetable, leaving the timing in the government's hands. The current session, which began after the 2017 election is already the longest for many centuries, after Ms May stretched it to the limits in the hope of getting her Brexit deal through.\nWith the new prime minister expected to be installed in No 10 just days before MPs leave Westminster for their summer break in July, and with a further three-week break for party conferences in late September and early October, parliament is anyway scheduled to sit for only a few weeks under the new regime before the Halloween deadline.\nSir Ed said he was concerned that a no-deal prime minister, elected by a deeply anti-EU Tory membership of around 125,000, could use prorogation to ensure that MPs are not present in Westminster to stop them driving the country over the cliff-edge.\n\"This is a genuine worry,\" he told The Independent. \"I think people from across parties ought to put pressure on the PM to put forward a piece of legislation as prime minister to put into law that there can't be an exit from the EU of any nature without a vote in parliament.\n\"We have to have a procedure to prevent a no-deal Brexit being imposed on our country by a small number of MPs from a party with a leader who has effectively been elected prime minister by a very, very small and unrepresentative portion of our country.\"\nHe called for cross-party talks to draw up and pass legislation in the few weeks left to Ms May.\nAnd he said that the prime minister would be able to push such a bill through with the support of Liberal Democrat votes as well as many Labour and Tory MPs who fear no-deal.\n\"I think there needs to be some good cross-party talks,\" he said.\n\"I would prefer legislation to go through which would require a People's Vote on any final outcome, with the option of Remain on the ballot paper.\n\"But I think she should at least work across parties to put a law in place that would prevent any government taking Britain out of the EU without a parliamentary vote on that proposition, so it would be impossible for a no-deal Leaver to prorogue parliament and say we are going whether you like it or not.\"",

Not happy at all. Last week, the World Health Organisation published a report about the link between red processed meat and cancer. What the scientists behind the report did not realise was that in Spain they had unwittingly insulted a national treasure: Iberico ham.\nMy in-laws, like most Spaniards, take their food very seriously. On a half-term break last weekend, I drove several hours across the Spanish countryside in a family convoy until we found exactly the right wood to pick exactly the right wild mushrooms. Back in the village where my wife Miriam grew up, we spent hours discussing, preparing, cooking and eating the mushrooms. And eating lots of delicious, thinly sliced Iberico ham too.\nAround the table the report was greeted with disbelief. Jamón bad for you? Come off it. The scientists, it was concluded, need to get out a bit more - less time in the laboratory, and more time relishing the delights of Spanish cuisine.\nJust as any Spaniard is addicted to jamón, most Brits these days are addicted to sugar. The problem is, most of us don't even realise it.\nThe average Brit consumes a pound of sugar every week - and it's not just fizzy drinks and chocolate. What is particularly insidious about our addiction to sugar is that it is present in the vast majority of food products we eat - hiding in plain sight.\nIn his remarkable documentary That Sugar Film, released last year, Australian film-maker Damon Gameau revealed the full impact of sugar on his countrymen and women's diets. His mission in the film was to eat the equivalent of 40 teaspoons of sugar a day - apparently the Aussie average - without trying any obviously sugar-laden sweets or soft drinks.\nOn his first day he found he had consumed half that amount over breakfast - and he only had cereal, yoghurt and apple juice. On one occasion he ordered a fruit smoothie - advertised as a health food - and found it contained 35 teaspoons in one cup.\nThe upshot is there for all to see. An obesity epidemic. Diabetes. Liver damage. Heart disease. We are eating our way to an early grave and most of us don't even realise it.\nHow did we get here? Ironically, it is in large part because we tried to get healthy. In the Seventies, evidence about the impact of fatty foods on our health changed the food industry and sugar came into its own. It was used as a taste replacement for fat - as was its cousin corn syrup, which lurks under pseudonyms such as \"glucose-fructose syrup\" or \"isoglucose\".\nWe then started to exhibit classic addictive behaviour - the more we ate, the more we wanted. As a result, since 1990, sugar consumption in Britain has increased by nearly a third.\nNow, finally, we are beginning to have a proper debate about what we can and should do about it. A recent report by Public Health England proposed a number of measures, as has the ever- compelling Jamie Oliver.\nReducing two-for-one deals, clamping down on advertising targeted at children, reining in the marketing of high-sugar food and drinks, reducing sugar content and portion sizes, and introducing a tax on sugary drinks and food have all been called for.\nI always used to take a classical liberal view of these things - if you want to mess up your own health you should be free to do so. It's not for the state to tell you how to live. I was even ambivalent about the smoking ban when it was debated nearly a decade ago.\nBut I've become progressively more illiberal when it comes to sugar, precisely because so much of it is eaten involuntarily - or at least unknowingly. If you don't know what you're really eating - or you have to have a PhD to interpret the information on the packaging - it's harder to exercise true freedom of choice.\nSo, much as Jamie Oliver's campaigning zeal persuaded me some years ago of the need for healthy, universal free school meals for young children at school, I'm now convinced action is needed to help us kick our sugar habit. Stopping targeted advertising at children seems like a no-brainer. As do limits on heavy-handed marketing, reducing portion sizes and giving consumers simpler descriptions so that we can see how many teaspoons of sugar are contained in the cereals or soft drinks we buy for our children.\nInevitably, the proposal for a sugar tax has attracted the greatest attention so far. It's also the one where the effects are most open to debate. Some studies have suggested that we'd need to clobber sugary products with a pretty high tax to have any meaningful effect. It could have a disproportionate effect on poorer families. In France a new tax initially led to a drop in sugar consumption which then went up again. Belgium and Denmark have recently rejected a sugar tax, yet in Mexico a \"soda tax\" seems to have had some impact.\nBut just because there's an ongoing debate about a sugar tax, that shouldn't be an excuse for inaction on other fronts. Public Health England suggested, in any event, that changes to the way sugary products are marketed could have the biggest impact of all - some \"end of aisle\" displays in supermarkets have seen an increase in sales by as much as 50 per cent.\nWhatever the solution, it is a real breakthrough that we are finally having the great sugar debate. Government action must now follow. If we managed to introduce free school lunches in the last Parliament we can take action against sugar in this one.\nI reckon my in-laws will, over time, reconcile themselves to the idea that there are some downsides to the delights of Iberico ham.\nBut they'll keep eating jamón, just as we'll all keep eating sugar. We'll just have to have that much less of both.",

However at the same time by being part of Government the Liberal Democrats have succeeded in delivering by far the larger part of the commitments in our last manifesto, something the Liberal Democrat party and its predecessors have not been able to do for a generation. A success made all the greater against the backdrop of the Conservatives' move away from the modernising agenda proclaimed in their manifesto.\"\nConcerning local issues Stephen added, \"Locally, with no party having an overall majority on High Peak Borough Council, the influence of our fantastic Liberal Democrat Councillors has often been critical. It is vital for High Peak that we not only maintain our hold on council seats in the central part of the Borough, but extend our numbers and influence. I personally will be campaigning hard to make sure this happens and I know that my fellow High Peak Liberal Democrats, who I must thank whole heartedly for giving me this opportunity, will join me in the fight.

Last night the Liberal Democrats achieved the same, but this time in the lovely villages of West Oxfordshire.\nAt the General Election, we came a distant fourth with just 6.8% of the vote. In the recent by-election we dominated the campaign with a positive and upbeat message. A lot of praise should go to our brilliant candidate Liz Leffman. I am immensely proud of her and the hundreds of activists who campaigned day after day.\nBy-elections are usually stand-alone events, but their effects ripple out throughout the country and you can draw informative conclusions from some of the results. If the huge swing to the Liberal Democrats of 19.3% was repeated across the country, it would wipe out Theresa May's majority and hand 26 seats from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats. The swing rivals those of many that were seen in our famous by-election wins under the leadership of Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy.\nThe result not only signals that the Liberal Democrats are back in the political big time and the return to third party politics, but also a clear rejection of the Conservative Brexit government's plan to take Britain out of the Single Market.\nDon't underestimate what we have achieved. We started here in fourth place but have blown Labour and UKIP out of the water. Voters rejected Labour because it has no economic credibility and is unfit for government.\nThis was the tenth safest Tory seat in the country with a massive 25,000 majority, yet the Conservatives were seriously rattled. They are riding high in the polls, but my sense is that has largely been because people did not feel there was a credible opposition. Witney proves there is now a credible opposition - and that opposition is the Liberal Democrats.\nReal election results are proving that this party is revitalised, with amazing campaigning strength. Since May we had gained 21 council seats, and in Witney we proved that the Liberal Democrats are the real opposition to the Conservative Brexit government.\nAdded to those 21 seats were the ones we won in May, when we gained more seats in the local elections than any of the other main parties. This is a trend I intend to continue.\nVoters who used to support David Cameron are now starting to worry about a Conservative Party that is divisive, uncaring and extreme. The pressure on Theresa May will now be intense to abandon plans for a Hard Brexit, and instead to give parliament a vote on the terms of our negotiations.\nBut whatever happens to the Conservatives now, the Liberal Democrats are back.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_in-memory-of-peter-ashenden/content_104.html": "In memory of Peter Ashenden\nMost of you will know that Peter was a long term and active supporter of the Liberal Democrats. He had an abiding interest in politics, though he wasn't most people's idea of a politician, and he was all the more effective for that. When the Social Democrat Party was started by the Gang of Four, Peter was one of the very first members, and proud of it, and that was how we first met.\nThe initial SDP bubble was soon pricked, but Peter succeeded in getting elected to High Peak Council to represent Blackbrook. He was re-elected several times, under various banners, the 'Social and Liberal Democrats' finally becoming the Liberal Democrats. There were ups and downs, but Peter kept winning. Locally everybody seemed to know Peter, and he knew about their concerns and worked hard to try and help.\nBut it wasn't just local issues that interested him. He took on the thankless task of standing for Parliament in the Stalybridge & Hyde constituency, where he had the support of one man and possibly a dog. As always he threw himself into the campaign, and famously he literally knocked himself out while delivering leaflets when he tried to save time by jumping over a wall between properties in the dark.\nIn 1998 Peter decided to resign from the Borough Council because he was then working in the north east, only coming back to Chinley at weekends, and felt he couldn't represent local people properly. But in the north east he discovered there was also a local council election, with no LibDem candidate, so once again he put his name forward. When asked about this compulsion, he replied that he loved the 'cut and thrust' of elections. This never quite seemed to fit with Peter's quiet modesty and very British gift for understatement.\nBut Peter had not quite finished with elections. By the time of the 2001 General Election he was back home and was selected to stand for the Liberal Democrats in the HighPeak constituency, which he did with his usual quiet distinction. And simultaneously he stood for the County Council, though the odds were stacked against him in both contests. Thereafter he was always willing to put his name forward for any council election where there was a gap to be filled, to give as many people as possible the chance to vote Liberal Democrat.\nFor much of this period we also had the benefit of his accounting skills as constituency Treasurer. He also did more than his share when it came to fundraising, and he could demonstrate another of his skills. On several occasions he and Veronica entertained a crowd of us to a buffet meal at their house, and Peter did most of the cooking, to a very high standard. He also provided a steady supply of his notorious homebrew! He could also bake very good cakes, which were much appreciated at Coffee Mornings.\nI couldn't begin to calculate how many leaflets Peter must have delivered for the Liberal Democrats over the years. He continued to deliver his regular route along Western Lane when his illness was already well advanced, and it was only very reluctantly that he eventually, for the first time ever, had to say no.\nIt is hard to overstate the contribution that Peter made, not just to the Liberal Democrats, but to the whole community. In any discussion we could always rely upon his blend of quiet common sense and good humour. His presence is very much missed, as both a political kindred spirit and a friend.",

It is clear the Liberal Democrats made good progress in terms of seats: a 50% increase from 8 to 12 MPs compared to 2015; and, agonisingly, fewer than 500 votes away from doubling our seats to 16. (1) This was achieved, however, against a slightly lower vote share of 7.4%, compared to the already-low point of 7.9% in 2015, and an accompanying further decline in our vote in many seats.\nSeats\nOn the seats front, we succeeded in gaining 8 seats. All 8 were in Scotland, the South, and London. 3 were in Scotland, 2 in London, 2 in the South East, and 1 in the South West. Here, the party's Pro-EU platform paid off in terms of seats. Whilst only an estimated 1 in 3 British constituencies voted to Remain in the EU referendum, 7 out of 8 (87.5%) of our gains are believed to have voted Remain. (3) The one exception was Eastbourne in the South-East, where the phenomenally popular Stephen Lloyd avenged his narrow defeat in 2015, though did so by explicitly rejecting the party's policy of a second EU referendum. (4)\nOf the 8 seats we had won in 2015, we comfortably held the one seat we were defending in Scotland, Orkney and Shetland; held onto our one London seat in Carshalton and Wallington, and Norman Lamb held North Norfolk in East Anglia, though in his Leave-voting constituency, he did so on a platform of rejecting party policy on the European Union. (5) We lost our last seat in Wales, Ceredigion, by a painfully narrow 104 votes. During the party's last really dark period of the 1950s, it was Welsh seats that helped keep the party in business; (6) sadly for the first time since at least the early 19th century, we are now without a Welsh seat.\nThe remaining 4 seats we were defending were all in the north. We lost ex-leader Nick Clegg's seat in Sheffield Hallam, lost Leeds North West, and fell to third place behind Labour in Southport. In only one of our four seats in the north did we hold on, leader Tim Farron's seat in Westmorland. Farron's majority was way down from his nearly 9,000 majority in 2015, then our safest seat, to just 777 votes. Without Tim's phenomenal personal popularity there we would almost certainly have been totally wiped out in the north.\nSecond Places\nWhat of the second places we were defending? The party went into the election first or second in 71 seats, 11.2% of all seats in Great Britain (8 firsts, 63 seconds). Following the election we are in the top two in just 50 seats, 7.9% of all seats in GB (12 firsts 38 seconds).\nOf the 63 seconds from last time, the good news was that 8 second places became firsts as we gained seats. (Though 3 firsts became seconds in seats we lost) Of the remaining 55 second places we kept 33 but lost 22 second places. We gained just 2 new second places. In heavily remain voting Vauxhall in London and heavily remain voting St Albans in the South East. The 22 lost second places were spread across the country, but included our last 2 second places in the North East region and all 3 second places in the Midlands were lost. We lost the majority (9 out of 16) of the remaining second places we were defending in the North, the Midlands, Wales and East Anglia.\nDeposits\nA further bitter blow at the election was lost deposits. At the last election we lost 341 deposits, 54% of the deposits we were defending. This time round we lost 375 (59%). In Wales, which in the 1950s had been the last stronghold of the party, we lost a staggering 90% of deposits at this election.\nThere was some progress in saving 21 deposits this time that had been lost last time. These were heavily concentrated in London, Scotland and the South (71% of newly-saved deposits being in those areas). Conversely, we lost over 50 deposits in seats where we had saved the deposit in 2015. These new lost deposits were overwhelmingly concentrated in East Anglia, the Midlands, the North and Wales (72%).\nVote Share\nWhen we look at changes in Lib Dem vote share compared to 2015, we see similar disparities between regions and countries. Our vote rose in roughly one-third of constituencies, and fell in two-thirds. Of the minority of seats where our vote share rose, again the vast bulk of increases were in London, Scotland, the South East and South West. Over 75% of seats where our vote share rose were in these areas. (7) Some of the vote share rises were fairly minute, in seats where we were starting from a very low base; for example, seats where our vote rose from 2.1% to 2.2% or 3.2% to 3.4%. If you examine just those seats where our vote share rose by a more significant amount, at least 1% or more compared to 2015, we find there are 111 seats where this happened. The vast bulk of these rises (96 seats, or 86%) were again in London, Scotland the South East and South West. In just 15 of the 325 seats (fewer than 5%) we contested in East Anglia, the MIdlands, the North and Wales, did we achieve a vote rise of 1% or more compared to 2015.\nThe party's vote share fell in over 85% of the seats we contested in East Anglia, the Midlands, the North and Wales compared to the already-low vote share from 2015.\nFollowing the incredibly successful results in the Witney and Richmond by-elections, the party followed a strategy of heavily targeting Conservative Remain areas. This appears to have paid dividends, with our seats rising from 8 to 12, and Richmond itself nearly being held (Tory majority of 23,015 in 2015 down to just 45 votes this time, with a swing to the Lib Dems of approaching 20% compared to the last general election). At the same time, though, we suffered falling support, and a near-wipeout in the North and Wales. Meanwhile, our already-low vote share was hit further in the Midlands. Here in Bosworth, where I stood, we were disappointed not to win, but grateful we did manage to secure nearly 10,000 votes in a heavily Leave-voting East Midlands constituency while sticking to the party line on the EU. It is a base vote that we can build on to recover in future local and general elections.\nThe leadership dimension\nSince the election we have seen the resignation, forced or otherwise, of Tim Farron. Tim Farron inherited a tougher situation than any recent Liberal leader. Not only did he inherit fewer MPs than any leader since Jo Grimond took over in 1956, but for the first time in 2015 the party lost its unquestioning position as the third political party across Britain, with UKIP outpolling us by 13% to 8% in the national vote. Farron was denied the oxygen of publicity that every previous Liberal leader has had.\nNo longer could he rely on the near-parity of coverage with the leaders of Labour and the Tories, which every other recent Liberal/Lib Dem leader had benefitted from at general elections. UKIP were given huge coverage during the election, despite the progress Farron had made since 2015 to turn the Lib Dems into the undisputed third, Britain-wide, party again.\nBy the time of the general election:\nIn terms of seats under Farron, the Lib Dems went from a ratio of 8:1 over UKIP, to 9:0, with the Lib Dems gaining Richmond and the sole UKIP MP Douglas Carswell being driven out of their party\nIn the local government elections in May, the Lib Dems won 18% of the vote - the best vote share for the party since the coalition was formed; and it elected over 400 councillors, whilst UKIP support collapsed to 5% and they won just 1 council seat in the UK. (8)\nIn terms of parliamentary candidates, Lib Dems stood in almost every seat in Great Britain, some 629 constituencies, whilst UKIP stood in only 377.\nAnd in the opinion polls by the beginning of May, the Lib Dems were averaging 9%, consistently ahead of UKIP who averaged 6%. (9)\nYet despite this progress, Tim Farron was still denied the large-scale media exposure that may have allowed his passionate, driven personality to break through. As Tim Farron leaves the party leadership, he can at least take comfort in handing on to his successor more MPs than he inherited; and thanks to comfortably outpolling UKIP this time, the next leader should get a fairer crack at the publicity whip come the next general election, whenever it is called, than Tim Farron did at this one.\nHow to recover?\nHow do the Lib Dems recover support then? After the Liberal Party's crushing defeat in the 1970 general election, the party turned to \"Community Politics\" as a means of recovery. (10) Continuing with this approach, local campaigning to carry on the re-building of our local government base, win council seats, and thus help turn lost deposits into saved deposits and secure more seconds and firsts at the next general election is essential.\nIn addition to local campaigning, community politics style, we also need as a party to re-connect with people nationally, by speaking about the issues that most concern them. We need to talk about down-to-earth, basic issues of the poor state of our public services, and how we as Liberal Democrats will improve them; and in doing so, how we will improve the lives of people across Britain. We have great policies to solve the funding crisis in both health and education. The Conservative government's record is abysmal: hospitals threatened with closure up and down the country, GPs massively overstretched, people having to wait weeks for doctors' appointments; schools underfunded, with most schools facing further budget cuts and the prospect of teachers and teaching assistants being made redundant. These are issues people care about, which we can hammer relentlessly against this already-weakened Tory government in the months and/or years before the next general election.\nUsing our national publicity opportunities, including our party political broadcasts, to set out our positive policies on the NHS and education, whilst laying into the appalling Conservative record, can help us connect with people again. Strong national campaigns can be localised, as most areas are facing education and health cuts. National campaign packs sent to local parties to adapt these messages, can help future target seat council candidates and PPCs to establish themselves, as local champions for their local health and education services.\nConclusion\nWhilst increasing our MPs, and having four narrow misses, we have at this election still suffered a further loss of second places, a further loss of deposits, and a continuing fallback in large parts of Britain, particularly the North, the Midlands and Wales. We must urgently reconnect with people, particularly in those areas of Britain, if we are to be a substantial party again. In the four general elections between 1997 and 2010, we secured around 50 seats at each election (between 46-62). To secure 50 seats next time requires us to secure a staggering swing of 17.2%. Massively increasing the breadth of our appeal is essential.\nWe have the opportunity. A yawning chasm is opening up in British politics. With the Conservatives moving even further right with their new alliance with the hard-right, sectarian Democratic Unionist Party, and Labour still on the radical-left under Corbyn, there is a large potential market place for centre-left progressive politics.\nThis gives us the opportunity at the next election to present the public with a progressive, social liberal agenda, committed to fighting for quality public services; an agenda which can hopefully command the support of millions of moderate voters next time, and give our party the revival it needs in all the countries and the regions of Britain.\nNotes\n(1) All results analysis, unless otherwise stated, carried out using \"The Times Election 2017\" supplement, The Times, Saturday 10 June 2017.\n(2) Giles Radice, Southern Discomfort (London: Fabian Society, 1992); Giles Radice, More Southern Discomfort: A Year On - Taxing and Spending (London: Fabian Society, 1993); Giles Radice, Any Southern Comfort?

However, largely due to 5 anomalous results in seats that had been held by the Lib Dems until 2015, but which at this election saw massive tactical voting in favour of the Scottish Conservatives, there was a fall in the party's overall vote share across Scotland, of -0.8%. The seats with the heaviest falls were Aberdeenshire West and Kincardine (-12.8%); Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (-14.0%); Gordon (-21.1%); Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch & Strathspey (-19.0%); and Ross, Skye and Lochaber (-15.0%). In the South West of England, the results were more patchy in terms of Lib Dem performance than they were in London and the South East. The party had undoubted successes in the South West, with the re-gaining of Bath and impressive rises in the vote in a number of the party's traditional stronghold seats - Cheltenham, North Cornwall, North Devon, St Ives, Taunton and Wells all saw vote share rises of between 5-10%. Due to fallbacks in some seats in the South West, notably in the Labour-leaning urban areas Bristol, Exeter and Plymouth, and in seats where the tactical vote seems to have gone Labour, our vote share was down fractionally (-0.2%); but at 14.9%, the South West was still clearly the strongest Lib Dem-voting area in Britain.\n(8) 'United Kingdom Local Elections 2017', Wikipedia, last updated 15:45, 15 June 2017.\n(9) 'Voting Intention Since 2010', UK Polling Report, last updated 7 June 2017.\n(10) Stuart Mole, 'Community Politics', in Vernon Bogdanor (ed.), Liberal Party Politics (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), pp. 258-74.\npublication",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_nick-clegg-on-the-impact-of-brexit-on-food-prices/content_288.html": "Nick Clegg on the impact of Brexit on food prices\nNick Clegg has given a speech at the National Liberal Club today to launch his third report in the Brexit Challenge series. In this one he looks at the impact of hard Brexit on food prices. Here is his speech in full:\nNearly 4 months on from the vote to leave the European Union, we are finally starting to understand the early consequences of Brexit.\nIn the last week we have seen the government on the back foot, pressed by Conservative MPs to give parliament a say ahead of the triggering of article 50.\nWe have seen Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, issue the hardest statement yet against giving the UK a sweetheart deal.\nAnd we saw the strongest ripples yet in the currency markets and in business. According to the Financial Times the pound's effective exchange rate, weighted to reflect the UK's trade flows, fell to a 168-year low last Tuesday - weaker than the lowest point in the recent financial crisis, weaker than when Britain was ejected from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, weaker even than when we left the Gold Standard in the 1930s.\nPerhaps most significantly, the markets seem to have woken up to the looming danger of Hard Brexit, and investors are using their money to punish the government for every perceived misstep, while rewarding decisions that raise the chances of a better deal.\nThe markets are a powerful new player in this story. They are becoming increasing sensitive to relatively small policy changes. Hence the pound rallied sharply last week as soon as the Prime Minister announced there would after all be a debate ahead of the negotiations, but slipped back again when David Davis put in another Commons performance devoid of any meaningful content.\nLet me set out my own position at this point.\nTim Farron has made it clear that the Liberal Democrats remain proudly pro-European. It's in our DNA. The Liberal Democrats will respect the outcome of the referendum, but we're not going to stop arguing for what we believe in. We're not going to give up on this country's proud history of liberal internationalism. And we're not going to give up on the idea the Britain's place is at the heart of Europe.\nThat's why I have set myself the task of producing a series of papers which I'm calling the Brexit Challenge. The purpose is to explore and unpack the complexities of the process we're now facing, in as dispassionate and rigorous manner as possible to understand the tensions and the trade-offs, and to pose the thorny questions that this Conservative government - having got us into this mess - now has a duty to answer.\nAnd yet what we're seeing is a rudderless government whose defining characteristic seems to be its determination to dodge the difficult questions. The only leadership provided by No 10 seems to consist of slapping down secretaries of state when they dare to say anything at all about the government's objectives.\nInto the vacuum occasioned by Theresa May's iron silence come Davis, Johnson and Fox, who are driving this government towards the most extreme interpretation of the 23rd June vote.\nLet's be clear: the referendum provides a mandate to leave the EU, not a mandate to leave the Single Market. People voted for a host of different reasons, but they only spoke with one voice on the specific issue that was written into the referendum question. Leave we must, but that leaving could take several different forms, from the 'soft Brexit' option of joining Norway as a member of EFTA, to the 'hard Brexit' route of exiting without any alternative trading relationship in place and relying instead on WTO rules.\nThe most important decision of all is whether to remain a member of the Single Market, where we benefit from zero tariffs and can help to shape the harmonised non-tariff rules that ensure that goods and services can flow smoothly across borders. To reiterate: it is completely possible to be a member of the Single Market while standing outside the EU: Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway all do so.\nThe choice we make will determine the character and prosperity of this country for generations to come.\nSo who decides which version of Brexit should prevail? The Conservatives - extraordinarily - say it should be a handful of Ministers, acting behind closed doors, using medieval Royal Prerogative powers, and without reference to parliament.\nWhere is the mandate for that? The referendum doesn't provide it, and their own 2015 election manifesto actually says the opposite, committing Conservative Minsters to \"say yes to the Single Market\".\nCan it really be that they have developed the ability to mind read on a mass scale, allowing them to know exactly why every leave voter made their decision?\nWhere there is such uncertainty, and where so much is at stake, parliament must be the arbiter. We shouldn't be arguing about this: it is the essence of our parliamentary democratic system. What the Conservatives are doing is autocratic and unconstitutional, and totally contrary to the mantra of the Leave campaign that Brexit is about \"taking back control\".\nIt is also richly hypocritical of the Conservatives. Let us remember the passionate radicalism of the \"Parliamentary Control of the Executive Bill, 1999\", authored by one David Davis in an attempt to get rid of the very Royal Prerogative he now relies on as Secretary of State.\nOr this from the Shadow Leader of the Commons in 2008:\n\"We should have a statutory scrutiny reserve so that ministers would have to gain parliamentary approval before negotiations in the Council of Ministers.\n\"The scrutiny reserve should be put on a statutory basis so that ministers are required to come to the committee before negotiations at the European Council and cannot override it.\"\nThe speaker? Theresa May.\nI confirmed yesterday that I will be working in the coming weeks with Ed Miliband, Kier Starmer, Nick Herbert, Stephen Philips and other senior figures across all parties to force a vote on the the government's negotiating mandate before article 50 is triggered. In doing so we will be following ample precedent, including the example set by John Major in 1991 when he held a 2-day debate and vote ahead of the negotiations that ultimately led to the Maastricht Treaty.\nAnd what of the preparations with other European countries to ensure we get the best deal when we leave? In France, Germany and Spain the newspapers are conspicuously not full of Liam Fox's clever negotiating tactics, David Davis' fine speeches, and Boris Johnson's diplomatic prowess. Instead, they are looking on aghast at the clumsy and occasionally xenophobic rhetoric, not least at the Conservative party conference earlier this month.\nThe Government's approach seems to be based on gridlock in Whitehall, secrecy in parliament and offending our partners around Europe. This cannot be allowed to continue.\nWhich is why it is all the more important to set out for the public what 'hard Brexit' would entail. Because if we want to stop it, we only have a few short months to do so.\nIn the first two papers of the Brexit Challenge, which are available on the Liberal Democrat website, I explained what leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union in 2019 will mean for trade.\nThe single most important thing to say is that the 2-year timeframe afforded to us by article 50 is woefully inadequate to the scale of the challenge. Article 50 is deliberately designed to make life hard for a member state that has decided to leave. It's primary purpose is the negotiation of the terms of the divorce. While it requires any agreement to \"take account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union\", it is essentially about unpicking the past, not formulating a new relationship for the future.\nSo while some outline may be reached in parallel with the article 50 talks on the priorities for a future Free Trade Agreement, the FTA itself will take much, much longer. Canada's trade with the EU is far simpler than our own: their primary exports are raw materials where ours are services or complex manufacturing. If we want an indication of the time it will take to broker a comprehensive deal with the EU, remember that the Canada-EU process was launched in 2007, and nine years later it is still not ratified.\nSo what happens in the interim? In a word: turmoil.\nBusinesses that haven't had to deal with customs checks for 43 years will suddenly have to navigate them.\nTariffs will be automatically slapped on exports to the Continent - something the Brexiteers will tell you isn't going to happen when it is in fact a legal requirement once we stand outside the Customs Union.\nCompanies that have relied on the EU's single rulebook to determine everything from labelling to safety standards will find that adherence to those rules is a precondition of trade, but will no longer be able to influence them.\nAnd more than 50 trade agreements with other parts of the world will fall into abeyance, and will have to be painstakingly renegotiated - something that is only likely to happen once the EU talks are complete and we have established ourselves as an independent trading nation at the WTO.\nToday I am launching the third of a series of Brexit Challenge paper, on Food and Drink - everything from farming and fishing to high value-added foods made with imported ingredients. It is our biggest manufacturing sector by value, larger than car and aerospace manufacturing combined, and employs 850,000 people. And it is highly dependent on access to EU markets and to EU migrant labour.\nSeen through this lens, Hard Brexit is not a sunny upland; it's a cliff edge.\nFirst, exporters. Food and drink products are currently traded across borders with no forms or checks. Once we leave the EU, products will have to go through customs checks at the EU border which include applying for relevant import licences, costly export health certificates to show that the product meets EU public health standards, and veterinary inspections. Major markets for key exports like whisky (which brings in £4bn a year) will become more challenging as tariff-free EU-negotiated FTAs fall away.\nFor farmers, the next few years are extremely worrying. Profit margins are already squeezed to the barest of minimums. Come 2019, farmers will face average tariffs on their wheat, milk, and other agriculture produce of 22.3%, and the following year they will most likely lose some of the £3bn in subsidies they currently receive from the EU. In the face of stiff opposition from abroad, the logical conclusion is that smaller operators will go out of business, while only the larger more industrial farms are likely to survive.\nManufacturers further up the food chain face the prospect of big price hikes in raw ingredients, both from domestic production and from the increased cost of imports once tariffs are applied. 70% of imported food comes from the continent.\nConsumers will inevitably have to bear the knock-on cost of these pressures, while also seeing the price of imported foods rise, including popular products which we are accustomed to buying cheaply.\nFor example, Chilean wine faces a 14% tariff, while for New Zealand Lamb the additional cost for importers will be 40%, while chocolate and beef will face whopping tariffs of 38% and 59% respectively.\nThese are daunting tariffs for importers and for consumers, but the problems start well before Brexit actually takes place. The recent drop in the value of the pound and its impact on sales of Marmite and PG Tips is only a foretaste of what is to come in the next 12 months.\nThere are two problems. First, many importers and producers reliant on imported ingredients are currently hedged against currency fluctuations, but those hedges will start to expire soon, exposing them to the full effect of the weaker pound.\nSecondly, supermarket suppliers are tied into long-term contracts, usually for 12 or 18 months. Producers who signed contacts before the devaluation of sterling are stuck with fixed supermarket prices, while the cost of their raw ingredients has risen sharply. One shortbread producer in Scotland recently warned that he risked going out of business due to a 75% rise in the cost of butter since June. When those supermarket contracts expire, suppliers will be able to negotiate at a higher price. Good news for them, but bad news for shoppers.\nOf course we don't exactly know what effect all of these factors will have on supermarket prices. As Ian Wright, the chair of the Food and Drink Federation said the other day, retailers only have three choices: either absorb the costs into their margins (which is difficult given the ultra-competitive nature of the supermarket industry); pass it onto consumers (similarly unattractive when discount supermarkets are nipping at your heels); or stop stocking certain products altogether. No wonder the Federation also found in a recent survey that close to 70% of their members are pessimistic about the future.\nPrice rises therefore seem inevitable. One study conducted for the National Farmers Union in April this year estimated that Hard Brexit would lead to average food price increases of around 8% by 2025. And in May this year the Treasury predicted that a fall in the value of sterling of 12% caused by uncertainty after a vote to leave would mean that a family of 4 would see their bills go up by £123 after 2 years. Given the fall in the value of sterling is now 17%, the final bill will surely be higher.\nTariffs and transaction costs are not the only concern though. EU rules govern every corner of food and drink, from hygiene standards to nutritional labelling, disease control to animal welfare. Consumer confidence in the quality and safety of our food hinges on these standards. All of these rules will therefore need to be brought into UK legislation and some of them will be hotly contested, with consumer groups and industry arguing about the correct balance.\nThe heavily EU-dependent food and drink industry really is the bellwether for a successful Brexit. If the government can't get it right for them, then they won't be able to get it right for other sectors.\nAt the moment we are being led into a crisis of the government's own making.\nBut there is an alternative. In fact, it is the only alternative to the scenario I have outlined today. That is for the government to opt to keep us in the Single Market by pushing for a Norway-style deal, either as an end point or as a transitional status pending the ironing out of all our new trading relationships.\nThat is not without its serious drawbacks, as I set out in my first paper in July, but it is by far the least worst of the options on offer. It would provide continuity of access to European Markets while opening up the ability to strike our own independent trade deals with third countries. It wouldn't be popular with the Eurosceptics, and it certainly wouldn't be easy to negotiate with our European partners. But this government has a duty to try.\nSo I call on the government to have the courage to stand up for the Single Market. If they don't, then parliament may just force them to do so.\nYou can read the full report here.\nComments on Nick Clegg on the impact of Brexit on food prices",

Witney has had a Tory MP since its creation in 1983, and at no time has the candidate had less than 43% of the vote share.\nHowever, as an affluent, liberal part of the country that recorded a strong remain vote in the EU referendum, senior Lib Dems said they saw west Oxfordshire as a test ground for more winnable seats. The party hoped to capitalise on the fact that Cameron's chosen successor had voted for Brexit.\nLiz Leffman, the Lib Dem candidate, said the result was a \"shot across the bow\" of Theresa May. \"People here don't want to come out of the single market, they don't want jobs at risk and that's what we were voting on today. People who voted for me are traditional Conservatives, who have voted Conservative for decades. Mrs May is the new Ukip and people are not comfortable with a party lurching in that direction.\"\nWatching the count in the Windrush leisure centre, Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Alastair Carmichael said the result should not be taken in isolation. \"What we are getting very strongly here, as a part of the country that voted to remain, is that the idea of walking away from the single market, the unpleasantness from Amber Rudd at Tory conference, these things have not played well in a constituency like this.\n\"These people liked David Cameron, his brand of centre-right Conservatism and the modernity of it. And they look at what they've got now instead and they don't like it.\"\nThe party threw extensive resources into the fight, shipping down more than 1,000 activists one weekend and with Lib Dem leader Tim Farron visiting the constituency five times.\nIn the hall, several other candidates from more minor parties complained they had had a hostile reception on the doorstep, because locals complained of being besieged by Lib Dem canvassers. \"I'm not sure if that might have actually put some people off,\" one candidate grumbled.\nTory sources began briefing early that they were expecting to lose a significant share of the vote, and last Saturday May joined Cameron on the stump in Oxfordshire, breaking the convention that prime ministers do not campaign in byelections.\nHome office minister Brandon Lewis said the party considered it a good result. \"This is almost exactly the same as David Cameron got when he first stood. We've seen Labour crashing, Ukip crashing and the Lib Dems benefiting from that but the reality is Robert's got a very good majority and a clear win for the Conservatives.\" He denied it was unusual for Courts to have left the count abruptly.\nLabour's candidate, local councillor Duncan Enright, slid from second in 2015 to third, though party sources said vote share in Labour pockets had held up well. Allies of Enright, who had called for Jeremy Corbyn to step down as Labour leader during the crisis in the party over the summer, said they had expected to fall behind the Lib Dems.\nGreen candidate Larry Sanders, brother of the US presidential challenger Bernie Sanders, beat Ukip for fourth place.",

But the following is, for the reasons set out, crucial to deciding who to vote for - whichever candidate you are leaning towards.\nP.S. There is still time for party members to take part in my leadership election survey.\nVince Cable's approach to working with other parties\nDuring his time as Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable had a triple-track approach to working with those who share (some of the) party's values but are not in the Liberal Democrats.\nOne track was party reform, with the introduction of a registered supporters scheme as a way of making it easier and more effective for the party to work with those for whom full membership is a step too far for them.\nThe second track was making very positive public noises about those who might leave other parties - hence his warm words about those who initially formed The Independent Group and an openness to working with other parties ahead of the European elections, even though that came to nowt.\nThe final track was an encouraging attitude towards any local parties who wanted to do deals with other parties. He didn't use the powers of a party leader to try to discourage or even hinder such arrangements, and indeed championed a local deal with the Greens in the London Borough of Richmond. A slow spread of grassroots election pacts took place during his time as leader.\nThe options for the next Lib Dem leader\nFor the next Liberal Democrat leader, continuing this sort of approach is definitely an option - continuing to change how the party works to better engage with those outside the ranks of formal members and seeking to encourage in a relatively hands-off way more arrangements with other parties.\nBut under the next leader, the party has two alternatives: to do more, or to do less.\nWork more closely with others?\nDo more, as in going beyond welcoming a spread of local deals by instead actively seeking out more of them. That could be particularly attractive if there is a general election triggered later this year by a Brexit crisis - making deals to ensure there is a (fairly) united Remain ticket in the election rather than risk splitting the Remain vote under first past the post.\nWhat's more, if the idea of uniting the Remain vote behind a cross-party mix of candidates in different seats is taken as a serious runner, the best way to do this requires some specific administrative work to be prepared.\nAs I wrote before about how to create a pro-European umbrella operation, the way to do this is:\n… to make use of a detail in election law created to help the Co-operative Party.\nThis allows a candidate to stand as the joint candidate of two different political parties, with the news that they are a joint candidate reproduced on the ballot paper.\nThat ballot paper point is crucial because it means that right at the point of voting, people know exactly which candidates have the backing of parties. No messing around with hoping people will look up preferred candidates on a tactical voting website. Instead you get the message right in front of every single voter at the point at which they vote.\nYet by backing candidates of existing parties you also get the benefits of their existing organisations and voter loyalty.\nSo, you create a new pro-European political party, but rather than try to make it in a fully functioning traditional party, you instead make it an umbrella coalition. Offer any candidate of any party the chance to get an official endorsement from the new party if they agree to a certain number of basic principles (European policy most obviously). If a candidate signs up, give them the right to use the logo and name on the ballot paper.\nThis idea of group acting as minor political party in order to win coverage on the ballot paper and hence increase its electoral leverage - both to get candidates to agree to its policies and then to win votes for those candidates who do - is something aficionados of American politics may recognise. It is what US political parties such as the Working Families Party do, with a few wrinkles due to the different electoral law their but the same underlying purpose and method.\nTo do that requires a deliberate choice by the Liberal Democrats centrally, going well beyond the benign oversight of the spread of a few local deals.\nOr work less closely with others?\nBut instead, under the next leader, the Liberal Democrats could instead do rather less in the way of cooperating with those outside the party.\nFlush from the local election success, the Euro elections triumph, the failure of other would-be new parties and another surge in membership, the party could take a much more bullish line: the Lib Dems are the effective, growing Remain choice, so if you want Remain vote for us and join us. No deals or pacts required.\nThe choice for party members\nThat choice - to double-down on cooperation or to double-down on focusing on the party - is one which the Lib Dem leadership contest offers. Although at times the rhetoric of Jo Swinson and Ed Davey get rather close on this topic, the overall tone and direction of their views are clearly different. Swinson is the one keenest on maximising cooperation with others, Davey the one keenest on minimising it with a focus on the party itself instead.\nCuriously, neither seems to want to make as much of this difference as they could. Even though many party members are struggling to see that much of a difference between the two, neither is using it as an issue - so far at least - which to clearly say 'what you'll get with me is different from what you'll get with them'. Jo Swinson, for example, at most refers to this difference only obliquely in her vision. Ed Davey even told Mumsnet that. \"I've not noticed any difference between Jo and me on this\".\nPerhaps both think they are the frontrunner and want to play safe. Perhaps both think the party is too divided on the issue for taking a clear stance to be a winner. Perhaps both have been too busy to really crystalise in their own minds their strategy for the party.\nWhatever the explanation, there is a substantive difference between them, and it's one we've seen for a fair while now, including going back to pre-Christmas and how much keener Jo Swinson was on creating a registered supporters scheme than Ed Davey. She promoted the idea in advance of the conference debate and then spoke in it, for example, whilst he did neither.\nOr in the last few days with their contrasting media comments:\nJo Swinson has said if she was leader of the Liberal Democrats the party would work with other parties and put up joint candidates that support a second referendum…\nBy contrast her rival Ed Davey appeared to dismiss the idea by saying: \"Anyone on our side who suggests a pact would be selling the Liberal Democrats short. A pact would simply blunt our clear anti-Brexit, pro-environment message.\" [The New European]\nThat reflects the differences that have also come through clearly when I've spoken with them over the last year. I'm sure each could serve happily under the other, but it will be a different approach the party takes depending on who is leader.\nExactly how those different approaches would play out under a Davey or Swinson leadership depends to a significant extent on wider circumstances, such as the level of interest from other parties or the defection choices of other MPs.\nYet each would head off into that uncertain terrain with rather different priorities, instincts and preferences.\nThat makes the choice between them in the leadership election a crucial one, especially as this is one area where it is hardest for party members to subsequently influence what a leader does through conference votes and the like. Not impossible, but harder than other areas. The up-front choice of who is going to be leader is more consequential than it is for the party's policy, for example.\nThat's why this issue of how to work with those who share (some of) the party's values but are not in the party should be a defining one for members choosing who to back as party leader.\nThe 2019 Lib Dem leadership election is being covered by me both in podcast form with Stephen Tall in Never Mind The Bar Charts (subscribe here) and in email newsletter form with Liberal Democrat Newswire (sign up here).",

That was ALDC's latest Kickstart residential training weekend from which I'm returning as I type this.\nThe mix of the old faces and new talent, not to mention the number of people in power in local government, meant there was much to be hopeful about regarding the party's future.\nThat future requires us to fix an awful lot with the party when it comes to general elections in particular. Some of those fixes will take some time to figure out, apply and start showing benefits.\nBut that should be no excuse for dallying as the next set of elections - the big elections this May, the contests in Scotland, Wales and country councils next May and so on - are never far away.\nAlongside what we fix centrally, our local activism is vital. That's why for all the jokes about Liberal Democrats pointing at potholes, there is a serious side to potholes too,\nOne is that they symbolise that batch of local issues - the potholes, the dumped rubbish, the broken streetlights - all of which make a real difference to people's lives, which often have significant knock-on effects on other issues and which active Lib Dem campaigners can make a real difference to.\nThe other is that they are as a result at the heart of building our local infrastructure in a way that enables the party to campaign on issues on a larger canvass too. To win on topics such as climate change or Britain's place in the world, we need that grassroots army of liberals whose creation and sustenance so heavily involves potholes and their sibling pieces of casework.\nMany people campaigned for the first time for the Liberal Democrats in December, motivated by Brexit. The challenge for us longer-standing activists is to ensure that as many as possible of them see these May elections as part of the same picture. Different elections, often different issues but still a similar opportunity to promote our values and to turn them into practical action to improve people's lives.",

May's decision to scrap it when she became prime minister was widely criticised by environmental campaigners, with Friends of the Earth branding it \"shocking\".

Liz Leffman and her team did an outstanding job, and the party was clearly ready to rally to the cause.\nOver the next few days there were speculations about what that would mean if replicated at a General Election, with estimates of the number of seats likely to switch from Tory to LibDem put between 26 and 51. The statistician in me is wary of those extrapolations: there are lots of unknowns at by-elections, and British politics is especially turbulent at the moment.\nOn the other hand, political parties usually spend a long time building up profiles of voters. Lots of volunteers flooding in at the last minute is not a good substitute for that prolonged work, so there is more to the surge in Witney than simply the number of people who came to campaign. In fact, it will be far easier to win back people who voted LibDem in 2010, now they are able to see the difference between the Tories on their own and the Tories in coalition with LibDems.\nBut at the very least, the sheer numbers of LibDems who went to Witney, and the positive energy around the campaign, show we are in good heart. A recent article in The Economist rightly suggests that this could well be a turning point for the LibDems - proof that we are very much back in business - though it also counsels that this there is a long way to go.\nRight now what is at stake is much bigger than one political party. Labour are manifestly not a credible \"government-in-waiting\". The Conservatives are split, in hoc to their right wing extreme, and concentrating power in the executive (some might say the Prime Minister's office) in a way that is a big challenge to parliamentary democracy.\nWhere do people go who naturally inhabit the centre ground, and are concerned by the increasingly-obvious dangers of Brexit - both in terms of economics and of ideals?\nThe Witney result should unsettle Theresa May. It needs to spark a more conciliar, collaborative and co-operative approach, particularly to the EU. It should also push people to engage with the real reasons for people voting \"Leave\", which seems to have been more to do with frustration at the status quo than a real understanding of the serious consequences of leaving.\nThe tragic irony is that there are a range of inspiring voices for change in the EU, including Guy Verhofstadt, of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and Yannis Varoufakis. I suspect that many of those who voted Leave would have been enthusiastic supporters of some of these reforms if they were more widely known: staying in the EU and supporting changes within might actually be the best way to get what many of those who voted Leave were wanting.\n* \"Mark Argent is PPC for Hertford and Stortford, and was formerly Chair of Cambridge LibDems",

The actual figure could be higher when Labour releases official totals next week.\nMost of the motions submitted are based on a template saying Labour should \"campaign energetically for a public vote and to Remain\" and \"support revoking Article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal\". They say the party should also \"defend free movement and extend migrants' rights\".\nIt raises the prospect of a fresh battle between activists and the party leadership when the motion is debated by delegates at the gathering. The text is likely to be amended during lengthy discussions to hammer out a compromise, with Mr Corbyn's team and some trade unions expected to try to tone down some of the more anti-Brexit language.\nMichael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: \"In an election, Labour needs the space to articulate a radical set of policies that will transform the economy and people's lives. In government, it needs to be able to deliver on its promises. To have either of these things, we need to defeat Brexit and move the conversation on.\n\"The public wants this to be over - any sense that we are going to engage in a lengthy renegotiation will be deeply unpopular. In government, Brexit would be an albatross around our necks - a pointless loss of time and energy, probably a loss of rights and protections and a fracturing of our support base.\"\nLabour MP Clive Lewis, a supporter of the campaign, said: \"As an MP, I know what wins elections for Labour - it's our members, who are more than 90 per cent in favour of Remain.\n\"Our army of volunteers aren't just foot soldiers, they're members of a democratic movement. They need to feel ownership over our Brexit policy, they need to be excited and enthused by it. Yes, the people should have the final say, but for our morale we need a clear anti-Brexit position in Labour. That means we must campaign in any public vote for Remain.\"",

It goes directly into classrooms and will benefit all pupils.\nIt is also a milestone in breaking the link between poverty and achievement, tackling Labour's shocking legacy where the richest 16-year olds are three times as likely to get five good GCSEs as the poorest\nSarah Teather the Liberal Democrat Minister of State at the Department for Education said\n\"This is just the start. We know that some families eligible for free school meals don't claim them, for example, because some don't know they can, and so their schools are missing out on funding. We also need to find out what schools are doing that's really making a difference. If you'd like to help, you could contact your local school to find out how they are using their Pupil Premium funding, and how they are making sure they are reaching every child. Together, we can ensure every child is able to fulfil their potential.\"\nFor further details see:",

In the end the issue that held it up for a while was press regulation, not the powers of the state to intrude into our privacy.\nIn line with party policy, agreed at Lib Dem conference, we tabled dozens of amendments on significant issues that went to the very heart of the bill - while trivial Labour and Government amendments simply tinkered around the edges. Despite the Government's best efforts to close down the debate, we fought hard and achieved close and careful line-by-line scrutiny of the bill in the House of Lords - something we were not given the opportunity to do in the Commons.\nWe were faced with an uphill struggle from day one, when Andy Burnham, Labour's then shadow Home Secretary, declared that the Labour party would not oppose the Bill, including some of the most intrusive measures ever proposed by a western democracy. After that, it was obvious that the Bill would eventually pass but not before we had made the Liberal Democrat position crystal clear.\nWhilst we were unable to achieve substantial change because of Labour's capitulation, we were able improve the bill by insisting on consistency of approach, clarity of oversight and preventing broad drafting that has enabled previous legislation to be used in ways parliament never intended.\nSome of the measures we fought tooth and nail to have removed from the Bill, such as requiring Internet Service Providers to keep a record of everyone's web histories for 12 months so they can be handed over to the police on request without a warrant. The Security Services, our primary defence against terrorist attack, said that they did not need these so-called 'Internet Connection Records' but still neither the Conservative Government nor the Labour Party would help us protect our civil liberties. We came under sustained attack from all sides for opposing this and other unnecessary and disproportionate intrusions into innocent people's privacy, attacks from people who, to be quite frank, clearly demonstrated that they did not understand what was a technologically complex Bill.\nAs I said in the chamber, I am a lousy politician. I cannot stand up and say things that I do not believe just because they are party policy. If I honestly thought this Bill was the best way to keep us safe as a country, I would have backed it and I know the party would to, but the simple fact is, some of it will not work and other parts will be counter-productive.\nThis Act leaves us less free and in some ways, less safe, playing into the hands of the terrorists who despise our freedom and want to take it from us. We forced the Tories and Labour to vote, to make it clear that only the Liberal Democrats were prepared to defend our civil liberties. We forced the Government to state, on the record, what their intentions were and therefore what Parliament's intentions were, in passing this legislation. This might not seem like much now but it will be key when these laws are challenged in the Courts, as no doubt they will.\nIn the newspapers, the newly appointed Labour Shadow Home Secretary called the Bill \"draconian\" and vowed to amend it. Meanwhile in the House of Lords, the Labour frontbench supported the government and Labour peers followed the Tories through the division lobbies to prevent our necessary and important amendments. Is it any wonder people are saying that it is the Liberal Democrats who are the real opposition to this Tory Government and its dreadful legislation?\n* Brian Paddick was Deputy Assistant Commissioner in London's Metropolitan Police Service until 2007, the Lib Dem candidate for the London mayoral election in 2008 and 2012, and a life peer since 2013.",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_the-observer-view-on-boris-johnson-s-sorry-brexit-deal/content_391.html": "Boris Johnson is a prime minister without a mandate. He has never faced an election and has lost every vote he has put to the House of Commons. Yet time and again he has proved his willingness to ride roughshod over parliament in order to get his way.\nYesterday was no different: MPs were disgracefully given just a few hours to scrutinise the terms of the most important decision the country has faced in decades. But he miscalculated badly. Parliament reasserted its sovereignty, voting to withhold approval of his EU deal until MPs have a chance to scrutinise the relevant legislation, effectively forcing him by law to request an extension from the EU.\nJohnson would have us believe that he achieved the impossible in Brussels last week in agreeing a new deal with the EU. But this was no Houdini feat: all he negotiated was a deal that was always possible from the perspective of the EU. In agreeing that Northern Ireland will effectively be part of the EU's customs union and the single market in goods, Johnson has trashed his pledge that he would avoid a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK at any cost.\nHe has used underhand strategy after underhand strategy to evade scrutiny. In September, he tried to shut down parliament for five weeks, an action ruled unlawful by the courts. He left it until the last possible moment to make the concession on Northern Ireland that resulted in a new deal. He clearly believed that his best chance of getting this substandard deal through parliament was to strongarm MPs into voting for it, using the threat of an imminent no-deal cliff edge.\nReading between the lines of the deal, it is clear that Johnson's intended final destination is a hard Brexit with a minimal free trade agreement. Why else solve the Irish border issue by introducing a border in the Irish Sea, rather than keeping the whole UK in the customs union?\nIn doing so, his deal puts the union at risk. The Stormont assembly has not sat since power-sharing broke down in 2016; by undermining the governing principle of cross-community consent, the deal could further upset the fragile political balance in Northern Ireland and make Irish reunification more likely. It will also give further succour to the Scottish independence movement, whose support is growing among Scots who voted to remain in 2016. If provisions can be made for Northern Ireland to remain in the single market and customs union, why not for Scotland, which also voted to stay in the EU?\nThe government has refused to publish an evaluation of the deal's economic impact. But independent forecasts estimate that it would come at a huge cost in growth, jobs and wages. The government's own estimates show that new free trade deals with other countries cannot compensate for more than a fraction of the economic cost of leaving the single market and customs union. Free trade agreements generally cover only goods, yet services make up 80% of the UK economy. And signing an agreement with countries such as the US would likely force the UK into becoming a rule-taker from economies far more deregulated than our own\nNor does this deal \"get Brexit done\"; it will take years to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU, not least because every member state will have a veto. Yet Johnson has refused to commit to asking for an extension to the transition should there be no agreement by December 2020. Former chancellor Philip Hammond was right to warn of \"a heavily camouflaged no deal at the end of 2020\".\nJohnson is evidently happy to sacrifice two pillars of British conservatism - the preservation of the union and responsible management of the economy - on the altar of Brexit in order to maximise his own chances of political survival. But MPs have bought themselves time to scrutinise his deal properly. It does not represent some \"will of the people\". The potential breakup of the UK; a poorer and more unequal nation: this is not what voters were promised back in 2016. For Johnson's Brexit to have any shred of legitimacy, it must be put to voters in a confirmatory referendum.\nSo far, it has been the actions of backbench MPs such as Letwin and Hilary Benn that have stopped Johnson's authoritarianism in its tracks. In squabbling about the timing of any vote of no confidence, and who might take over as a temporary prime minister, opposition leaders have hardly covered themselves in glory. But at the last hour, parliament has created a window in which Labour and the other opposition parties can act. The only way in which Johnson's deal could be legitimised is in a referendum. MPs must deny him parliamentary approval for his deal unless he agrees to put it to voters.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_european-elections-2019-what-will-happen-in-the-east-midlands/content_492.html": "The East Midlands was a UKIP heartland area during the party's peak years of 2013-14, and 59% of its voters backed Leave in the Brexit referendum. UKIP topped the poll here in the last European parliament elections, but their supporters have almost all now switched to the Brexit Party. According to the latest polling, they are guaranteed two of the region's five seats. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are almost certain of a seat each. The last of the region's five seats will depend on whether the Conservatives' vote collapse can be stemmed. If not, Farage's party will likely pick it up. With voters able to cast only a single vote for a party list, the Democratic Audit team reviews likely outcomes and the main potentially electable candidates.\nThe East Midlands region covers the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Rutland, Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire. All but two local authority areas in the region voted Leave in the referendum - the exceptions being Leicester and Rushcliffe. In 2014 UKIP won 33% of the vote and elected two MEPs, with the Tories well behind but still picking up two seats.\nThe extent to which Brexit has cut across traditional party divides is no more evident than in Nottinghamshire and its MPs. The county hosts famous Tory Remainer Ken Clarke (Rushcliffe), and Labour Leavers Dennis Skinner (Bolsover) and John Mann (Bassetlaw). Ashfield's MP Gloria de Piero campaigned for Remain in the 2016 referendum, but now is highly critical of any attempt to remain in the EU. Meanwhile, Nottinghamshire MPs Anna Soubry (Broxtowe) and Chris Leslie (Nottingham East) both left their respective parties to form the pro-Remain Change UK party.\nInitial European Parliament polling by ComRes in early May put Labour and the Brexit Party on top here on 27% and 26%, respectively, but a YouGov poll in mid-May indicates that in recent weeks the Brexit Party has surged into a commanding lead with 37%, while Labour and Conservative votes are haemorrhaging away. Figure 1 shows that these recent numbers would mean the Brexit Party is guaranteed to secure two MEPs, including their number one candidate, Annunziata Rees-Mogg, who is MP Jacob Rees-Mogg's sister. Depending on exactly how strong their support is on the day, they could well win a third seat.\nLabour are still second on YouGov figures, but at 16% they are down 10% on their 2014 vote share. Their top candidate should be assured of a seat, but the party's earlier hopes of winning two MEPs now look unrealisable. Part of Labour's troubles stem from losing strong Eurosceptic voters' support, but part also reflects the renaissance of the Liberal Democrats in this region as a strong pro-Remain party, capitalising on Labour's ambivalence, and buoyed by good local election results. Polls in early May already put Lib Dem support up at 15% and the YouGov poll confirms this. That makes them by far the strongest of the pro-Remain parties and should be enough to see them win one seat here.\nThe Tories were polling at 17% in early May, which would already see them losing one of their seats. But YouGov has them slipping further to 12% - a level that risks their top candidate (incumbent MEP Emma McClarkin) losing out completely and instead the Brexit Party winning the region's final seat, to give them a third MEP. The Conservatives will have to hope that their supporters will be more resilient and turn out more on the day, despite the depressing mood music from the government's travails.\nAlso chasing hard for the last seat are the Greens, the second pro-Remain party in with some chance. They were polling at 5% in early May, but have doubled this level in the more recent YouGov poll. As Green support has grown, Change UK has fallen in the polls, but the Greens would still need a further substantial increment (of around 3%) to be in serious contention for a seat. Some earlier polls put Change UK higher, but their support now seems to have settled back down to a low level that puts them out of the running here.\nFinally, UKIP are polling at 3%, giving them no chance of winning a seat here, and of course representing a catastrophic fall from last time around.\nWith only five seats available, the East Midlands' ballot paper is not as large as in some other regions. However, most of the lower ranked candidates for each party cannot possibly win a seat under proportional representation. (For a full candidate list of all parties and independents see here.) Voters can only vote for a single party list, not specific candidates, and must mark a single X on the ballot paper. In making up their minds which party list to support, voters need only pay attention to the ten candidates in the shaded boxes here.\nFigure 1: Main party candidates in the East Midlands region (with YouGov poll 8-17 May) and possible winners (five seats)\nYouGov poll, 8-17 May, weighted by likelihood to vote, excluding those who would not vote, don't know or refused",

Three months ago this week, in his first speech as prime minister outside No 10, he talked about Britain being the \"home of democracy\" and said our national flag - the Union Jack - stands \"for freedom and free speech and habeas corpus and the rule of law and above all it stands for democracy\". I don't disagree with him on any of those counts.\nIn this home of democracy, the government derives its mandate and legitimacy to govern by being able to command a majority in the House of Commons. Together with the House of Lords, the commons makes the laws and holds the government to account for its actions. The judiciary interprets and upholds the laws passed by parliament and the rule of law. This is how the separation of powers operates in the UK, with the legislature and our judges acting as a check and balance on the abuse of executive power.\nAnd yet Johnson has shown a disregard for free speech and the rule of law and leads a right wing, nationalist Conservative government which, throughout the Brexit process, has attacked the institutions that safeguard our democracy. Sometimes Johnson has joined directly in these actions; on other occasions he lets fellow Brexiters within the nationalist, conservative ecosystem in and around his administration do his dirty work.\nViewed on its own, each attack by them on our democracy can be dismissed as the actions of a bunch of political fanatics; taken together, they are very dangerous and increasingly authoritarian.\nIn the 2016 referendum, just 37 per cent of registered electors (albeit 52 per cent of those who voted) supported leaving the European Union. But the issue of \"how\" we leave was reserved to parliament given it was undefined on the ballot paper. Vote Leave's victory in that campaign was treated by those who were part of it - ie Boris Johnson and many of his current ministers - as a licence to inflict whatever form of Brexit they deemed desirable on the country, no matter how damaging.\nImportantly, they treated that vote - which is already over three years old - as an excuse to disregard the usual checks and balances which apply to stop the abuse of executive power in this country.\nEvery day Johnson and the Vote Leave cabal that run his party and his government invoke \"the will of the people\", not only to impose the most extreme form of Brexit but to justify breaking the law and undermining our democratic institutions. In short, they demand the complete subordination of every democratic institution to their extreme form of Brexit - for which there is no mandate - and are now turning to authoritarian methods in their quest to achieve this.\nSo, in his short time in office - he has been in the post for less than 100 days - Johnson has gone to unprecedented lengths to circumvent the system. Lying is usually the order of the day with the PM (anyone seen that £350m extra per week for the NHS yet?) but he has gone further than any other holder of the office since entering No 10, most notably by unlawfully suspending parliament in the weeks leading up to the possible departure of the UK from the EU without a deal, a crucial time in our history.\nThe Supreme Court performed its constitutional role by stopping him doing this last month and applying the law to the facts before it by reference to relevant statutes and case law. On reading their judgement you can see it is grounded in law and not politics. By convention, their independence is respected by all governments. Not this one.\nThe Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, told ministerial colleagues privately that the judgement of the Supreme Court amounted to a \"constitutional coup\". Kwasi Kwarteng, the minister of state at the business department who also attends cabinet, went a step further and publicly went on the offensive against our judges.\nHe claimed that \"many people up and down the country are beginning to question the partiality of the judges\" and he said that \"the extent to which lawyers and judges are interfering in politics is something that concerns many people\".\nThis follows the accusations, before the Brexit negotiations even started, from Johnson's media cheerleaders (step forward The Daily Mail) that our judiciary are \"enemies of the people\" simply for doing their jobs. In that case the courts forced the government to get the consent of parliament before triggering Article 50. Not content with questioning their impartiality, those cheerleaders went after the judges personally and pored over their private lives.\nJohnson was at it again this weekend, treating the law as something that applies to everyone else but him. The Benn Act required him to send a letter to the EU Council on Saturday evening requesting an extension to the Article 50 process in the event the House of Commons had not approved his withdrawal agreement with the EU, to safeguard against a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.\nWe voted against his agreement so he sent the letter unsigned, with a second letter in essence asking the EU Council to disregard the first letter sent under the Benn Act in an attempt to frustrate that law. Not frustrating the Act was something the government had given an undertaking to do in the Court of Session in Scotland. Whether he has frustrated that Act will be determined by that court in the coming days.\nThen there is work parliament does holding the executive to account generally. At every step the right wing nationalists controlling the Tory party under May and now Johnson have sought to obstruct the people's representatives in parliament from doing their job of scrutiny of Ministers.\nFor example, they repeatedly refused at the outset to publish economic impact assessments of their Brexit proposals, only relenting when forced to do so by the House of Commons. In spite of the campaigning efforts of my Liberal Democrat colleague, Luciana Berger, in parliament to demand they do this in respect of Johnson's withdrawal agreement, they refuse to do so. It is worth remembering that the \"meaningful votes\", whereby the Commons approves the exit terms, were forced on the government at the start of the Brexit process - initially they had sought to exclude parliament from having much of a say at all.\nIt is true that MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate have been subject to abuse and threats for standing up for what they believe is in the best interests of their constituents and the country. This is totally unacceptable - but the intemperate language used by the PM and other ministers has only fuelled this.\nHowever, the right-wing nationalists running the government are now taking things to an altogether different level - this is quite frightening, particularly if they were to get a majority at the general election whenever it comes. They are seeking to persecute and harass MPs by falsely accusing them of colluding with EU governments over Brexit. It is an absurd proposition given that the EU27 and the UK government are all working to ensure the withdrawal agreement Johnson has negotiated with the EU is delivered, and he himself wrote to them over the weekend urging them to ignore parliament's desire for article 50 to be extended.\nIn order to underline the point, his MPs are seeking to introduce a law to ban MPs - save for government ministers - from speaking to our partners and allies in governments around the world.\nThese accusations are made to call into question our loyalty and patriotism. Former Conservative backbenchers and ministers Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve, and Brexit Select Committee chair and former Labour minister Hilary Benn are reportedly under investigation.\nThis has a strong whiff of the 1930s about it - it is a brazen attempt to suppress dissent and persecute political opponents in parliament by this right wing, nationalist government.\nOne foreign office official put it well today when they said: \"Threatening MPs with investigation is something you would expect the government to be stopping abroad, not encouraging at home.\" It represents an attempt to fundamentally breach our constitutional and our human rights - threatening our democracy.\nGiven the gravity of this issue, I have written to the prime minister demanding he clarify whether any such investigation is under way or whether this is over-briefing from Dominic Cummings and friends. I have also demanded he rule out introducing any law seeking to prevent parliamentarians from speaking to other governments - we cannot properly scrutinise government foreign policy if we are prevented from doing so.\nIf he fails to give these assurances, we can take it as a given that another term of a Tory government will be altogether more authoritarian than any government we have seen in a generation. Another reason to vote them out when the time comes.\nChuka Umunna is the Liberal Democrat MP for Streatham",

A small number of Labour MPs have said they share Farron's concerns.\n\"Article 50 would proceed, but only if there is a referendum on the terms of the deal. And if the British people are not respected then, yes, that is a red line and we would vote against the government,\" Farron said.\nThe new poll - for online campaign group Avaaz - finds that 33% of voters support Brexit unconditionally. Almost a quarter (23%) oppose it unconditionally, 32% say it depends on the terms of the deal and 12% are undecided.\n\"Theresa May is wrong if she thinks she has public support for a blind-date Brexit,\" said Alex Wilks, Avaaz's campaign director. \"Two-thirds of people in the country don't back Brexit at any cost, and the prime minister must therefore make her plan fully transparent to parliament and the public.\" The High Court ruled last month that the government could not begin the formal process to leave the EU - triggering Article 50 - before it had allowed parliament a vote on the issue.\nThe court said that once article 50 was triggered it was irreversible. As a result, UK citizens would lose rights granted to them under the 1972 European Communities Act. The High Court said that only parliament - not the government - had the right to repeal a law it had passed.\nThe government plans to contest the ruling in the supreme court. The Guardian reported yesterday that the government may argue that the article 50 proceedings can be reversed at any time before the two-year Brexit process is completed.",

The value of this depends on whether article 50 is revocable - something that is still in doubt. More on that later.\nSome other useful amendments, in the theme of the leave promise of \"of course we can still co-operate where it is in our interests\"\n-\nTo seek to maintain co-operation on crime, policing, terror and intelligence. Theresa May has already indicated she is minded to do this, having already gone through the exercise of choosing which measures are in our interests during the coalition.\n-\nTo seek to maintain membership of scientific research programmes. This is very important to UK universities, and is not even largely about funding, but continued participation in world-class collaborative programmes.\n-\nTo seek some agreement on fisheries management to prevent overfishing, which would lead stock depletion, livelihoods destroyed and hungry people. (The fish don't know where the borders are.)\n-\nTo remain within the scope of EU policy on climate change.\n-\nTo maintain as frictionless as possible trade with the EU.\n-\nTo allow high skill sectors (at least) to recruit without any barrier between the UK and EU.\nBy way of honouring other leave promises, amendments to the goverment's A50 resolution might\n-\nFind £350 million a week for the NHS. (This would involve a net payment from the EU to us. More on that later.)\n-\nAllow greater immigration of skilled people (eg curry chefs - as the curry trade has been promised) from outside the EU.\n-\nReduce total net immigration to the tens of thousands. (This amendment should probably come from somebody who doesn't move the previous one.)\n-\nEnsure that the Good Friday Agreement is honoured and therefore the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic remains open.\n-\nEnsure that Spain does not gain the right to close its border with Gibraltar.\n-\nEnsure that we have control of our borders.\nThese are just a few examples - do post more in the comments. More broadly, we are waiting to see whether the version of Brexit the government intends to seek is the one that was promised to the socialists (ha!), or to the buccaneering capitalists (you'd think) or the isolationists (as it's looking).\nIf the government refuses to deliver what was promised they will be defying the democratic will of the people as expressed in the referendum on June 23rd, and they need to be sent away to try again.\nOne more thing we were promised was that the UK would have the upper hand in any negotiations - because of BMW etc - hence the demand that they pay us for our NHS. This may not be the case if Article 50 turns out to be irrevocable. The power to revoke would protect us from any attempt at brinkmanship that any 1 or 2 blocking EU members sought to engage in. In this case we ought to consider whether Article 50 is the correct route to Brexit.

Other parties are also opposing an election until the EU has granted a three-month Brexit delay, although the DUP hinted on Saturday it could back the move.\nHowever, in a sign that the coalition opposed to an election is under strain, the Liberal Democrats have drawn up a plan allowing Johnson to secure a December poll with a simple majority of MPs, with the support of Jo Swinson's party and the SNP.\nUnder the one-page Lib Dem bill, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act would be amended to state that the next election would take place on 9 December, three days earlier than under Johnson's plans. It states that the new election date would be cancelled should the EU fail to grant a three-month Brexit extension.\nThe party is asking Johnson to adopt the bill and guide it through parliament between Tuesday and Thursday of this week, before dissolving parliament. It believes the timing of its plan means the prime minister would not be able to bring back his Brexit deal to the Commons before the election campaign starts - which he is currently threatening to do.\nSwinson said last night: \"Boris Johnson has missed his 'do-or-die' deadline and is now asking parliament to give him a general election and time for him to ram through his Brexit bill through parliament. That is a bad deal, and Liberal Democrats will not vote for it. We need to get Boris Johnson out of office, unlock the gridlock in parliament and give people the chance to vote to stay in the EU.\n\"A general election on our proposed timetable would take no-deal off the table, and give the public the chance to elect a Liberal Democrat government who will revoke article 50 or increase the number of MPs who support a People's Vote.\"\nParty officials concede that the plan's success lies in whether Johnson takes up the plan. However, it is a move that sees the Lib Dems shift support more clearly behind agitating for an early election.\nIan Blackford, the SNP's leader in Westminster, gave his blessing to the plan on Saturday night. \"I'm very keen that we work together on a mechanism, whether that be with Jo's bill that we will support or any other mechanism - such as a vote of no confidence - to bring parliament to a speedy end and have an election as early as is possible,\" he said.\nThe Lib Dems and SNP are also writing to Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, calling on Brussels to offer Britain a Brexit extension to the end of January next year.\nThe news comes with an Opinium poll for the Observer suggesting the Conservatives have a 16-point lead over Labour, which is split over an election.\nJeremy Corbyn said on Saturday that his party would \"be very happy to fight an election once all vestiges of a no-deal exit from the EU have been taken off the table\". However, it remains unclear how that can be achieved. Figures on the left of the party are pushing to go to the polls, but Nick Brown, Labour's chief whip, has warned Corbyn that scores of MPs would disobey any order to vote through an election.\nJohnson repeated his demand on Saturday night for Labour to back his Brexit deal and vote for an early election and suggested that Brexit could drag on well into next year. He called on Labour to say how much more time it wanted to scrutinise his Brexit bill.\n\"Instead of grabbing this great new deal with both hands and helping move our country forward, parliament chose to ask for more tunnel,\" said Johnson. \"They agreed the deal but then they threw out the timetable. Unbelievably, Jeremy Corbyn then handed over the decision on what happens next to Brussels, so parliament's delay could take us to 31 January at least.\n\"My worry is this parliament will just waste the next three months like it's wasted the last three years.\n\"Parliament cannot hold the country hostage any longer. Millions of businesses and people cannot plan their futures, this paralysis is causing real damage and the country must move on in 2020.\"",

Paul Tyler’s book is well worth a read\nWho Decides? is like an excellent after dinner speaker - not too long, with plenty of laughs and a bit of knowledge imparted.\nThe book intertwines Lib Dem peer and former MP Lord Tyler's amusing recollections of collective decision making during his political career (including Parliamentary committees, candidate selection meetings and party management bodies) with extracts from the guide to understanding, managing and exploiting committees published in 1962 by the former government chief psychologist, Edgar Anstey.\nThough Tyler's recollections are supplemented by a sprinkling of non-political accounts, such as how the Man Booker prize winner is chosen, it is a book with a very strong political flavour.\nThe various, mostly failed, attempts to reform the House of Lords feature particularly prominently, and they do make for a good case study in how a nominal majority in favour of reform has repeatedly run into the sand thanks to the failure to manage the committees and other bodies which would otherwise have translated desire into results.\nIt is a shame that the extracts from Anstey are not greater in number because, amusing and interesting though Tyler's stories are, they work best when used directly to illustrate Anstey's points about how committees do and don't work, and the best tactics for committee members to use. The absence of more extracts therefore makes the book more entertaining than educational, though to be fair it does still impart a fair amount of advice for committee members.\nGot a view on this review?

Do you think spending £100 billion on Trident replacement can be justified?\nNo, with the public spending cuts that have already been implemented and that are projected to continue spending such a large sum of money is not justifiable at all.",

This Thursday brings 10 of these in principal local authorities and a Liberal Democrat gain on Stavely Town Council in the East Midland.\nYesterday saw ten principal council by-elections across the country with Lib Dem candidates contesting all but one of them.\nThe highlight of the night was a Town Council win for Steve Hartley in the Woodthorpe ward of Staveley Town Council in Derbyshire. Steve gained the seat from Labour taking two-thirds of the votes. This is the latest in a series of fantastic wins for the party in the East Midlands! Three key elements of their recent success are: solid hard work, harnessing the enthusiasm of new members and building a culture of going to help each other across the region.\nIn Lib Dem run Eastleigh Nicholas Couldrey held a seat in Fair Oak & Horton Heath, increasing the Lib Dem majority from earlier this year. As usual the Eastleigh team worked their socks off to make sure they won, and some of them are heading to help in Richmond Park this weekend too!\nIn Gloucester we saw a good 10% swing our way in Longlevens ward. Linda Castle leapfrogged Labour and UKIP to finish a very strong second, increasing our vote share by 23.7% after a hard fought campaign.\nIt wasn't all good news though. Sadly we lost a seat we were defending in Inverurie & District, Aberdeenshire, to the Tories. This was partly as a result of how by-elections work in multi-member Scottish seats which are usually fought by STV. Alison Auld actually increased our share of the vote by 5.1% In nearby Banff & District the SNP also lost the the Tories, and Alistair Mason increased out vote share by 8.7%.\nThe other good news of the night is that our Local Parties fielded candidates in Rainham, Medway, and in Gibbonsdown, Vale of Glamorgan, where we didn't stand last time. Thanks to Paul Chaplin and Jennifer Gironi for putting yourselves forwards and giving Lib Dem voters someone to vote for.",

Will fear of Jeremy Corbyn keep them away from the Lib Dems?\nThe first week of campaigning is behind us and the shape of the election is emerging. The critical questions for the next four weeks and beyond are becoming clearer. Among these is whether this election will accelerate a realignment of British politics based on where voters stand on Brexit. The idea that old political tribes are dying has taken hold and increasingly commentators look to the cultural polarisation seen in the US as the trajectory we are following. But, as we've learned over the past five years, things are rarely that simple in British politics. The general election is about much more than just Brexit: a winter election brings different factors to the front, not least the potential for disruptive weather events, such as the devastating flooding experienced by parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire last weekend, and the additional strains on a stretched NHS.\nDespite the apparent strength of newly forged Brexit identities, they are of little use in understanding how people might react politically to other factors; they simply do not allow us to read off a person's political views across a range of issues.\nThe 2017 election saw the highest two-party share of the vote for three decades. The electorate in England was largely sorted between the Conservatives and Labour, but there are important groups within each cohort who are not aligned with their parties' respective positions on Brexit. We have heard recently about the \"red wall\" of Labour leave seats crossing the country through South Yorkshire and the West Midlands, symbolised farther north by the \"Workington man\". Among Labour party voters in 2017, about three in 10 voted leave. We have heard a lot about them over the past three years. They are left-leaning voters who are socially conservative and who had been falling out of love with Labour for some time. More will be written about them in the weeks to come. But there is another group of voters who are also \"cross-pressured\" in the same way and are perhaps even more cast adrift by their party in recent months: among those who voted Conservative in 2017 a similar three in 10 voted to remain in the European Union. We have heard less about this group, but they could also be key to the parties' fortunes.\nWho are they, and will they still vote for a Conservative party that has moved further away from their position over the past three months? In the European elections earlier this year (held before Boris Johnson became prime minister) this group were as likely to vote Liberal Democrat as they were to vote Conservative. More recent polling for the Westminster election suggests that this is a very different competition. Here, those intending to vote Conservative among this group outnumber those intending to vote Liberal Democrat by more than two to one. That said, this group is also more likely than other party/referendum combinations to be undecided, with one in five saying that they had not yet decided how they would vote. Polling this week suggests that Tory remainers are also less certain in their intention to vote Conservative than Conservative leave voters are, or than Labour remain voters are to vote Labour.\nTwo things stand out about the identities and values of this group. They have weaker remain identities than those remain voters who voted Labour in 2017. Among the latter group, more than half have a \"very strong\" remain identity while for Conservative remain voters this is less than one in three. They are also the most \"rightwing\" or economically liberal group of voters in terms of their views on nationalisation, trade union power and taxation. These economic values make this group especially hostile to the Labour party, and \"fearful\" of a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government. Recent polling by Lord Ashcroft found that seven in 10 of this group thought a Corbyn-led government would be worse for Britain than leaving the European Union.\nNigel Farage's decision to stand down Brexit party candidates in Conservative-held seats, and the signal this sends about the positioning of the Conservative party after the election, may give these voters pause for thought. But what the Conservatives are banking on to ensure they hold on to seats such as Putney, south-west London, where the estimated remain vote was more than 70%, is that these voters will be too concerned about a Corbyn-led government, even a minority one, to \"risk\" a vote for the Liberal Democrats.\nMight this change during the campaign? Critical to this will be the expectations people have about what the outcome of the election will be. If Tory remainers expect the result to be close, or if there is even a hint of a hung parliament in the polling, they are likely to be spooked back to the Conservatives at the prospect of Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. But if the polling settles somewhere close to the current levels and a Conservative majority seems more likely, they may feel they are more able to move to the Liberal Democrats to send a message to their erstwhile party that they do not like the direction in which it is moving.\nThere may be a paradox in this. The more the media narrative focuses on how unpredictable the election is, the less likely these Conservative remain voters are to feel they can safely switch their vote, in the end making the election rather more predictable than it first appears, and forestalling the Brexit realignment.\n- Paula Surridge is a senior lecturer at the University of Bristol's school of sociology, politics and international studies",

After serving as the Economics Adviser to Paddy Ashdown, Ed won his seat of Kingston and Surbiton in 1997, when it was 106th on the target list.\nFrom there, Ed has helped Liberal Democrats across the country, at all levels, get elected, including a diverse and majority female group in his home borough.\nEd lost both his parents as a child - and was a young carer for his mum before she passed away when he was 15, So Ed knows how challenging life can be - and how important the NHS is. Caring for the less fortunate has been the hallmark of his political career - for constituents and his campaigns for the bereaved, the disabled and the homeless.\nIn Coalition Ed began as a Business Minister, laying the groundwork for Shared Parental Leave under Vince Cable. In 2012 Ed became the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change where he quadrupled renewable power and made the UK the world leader in offshore wind. In Europe, Ed led climate change negotiations and won ambitious news targets people never thought would be agreed - so directly helping to get the Paris Climate Treaty.\nAfter losing in 2015, Ed campaigned hard for Remain at the referendum, and gained his seat back in 2017. Since then Ed has been fighting for us to keep our place in Europe, pushing for a proper response to the Climate Emergency, and helping Liberal Democrats get elected across the country.\n<iframe id=\"google_osd_static_frame_6242303749782\" style=\"width: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;\" name=\"google_osd_static_frame\"></iframe>\n<iframe id=\"rufous-sandbox\" style=\"padding: 0px; border: medium; width: 0px; height: 0px; display: none; visibility: hidden; position: absolute;\" title=\"Twitter analytics iframe\" name=\"rufous-sandbox\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe>",

The final polls had Clinton about three points ahead in the popular vote and she looks set to end up being about one point ahead. That's a small enough margin to continue to have faith in polls at being able to paint the big picture where margins of more than a couple of points are involved. (It was the same picture in the European Referendum - most polls were only off by a handful of points rather than by dozens.)\nSecond, ask yourself two quick questions. What was Donald Trump's slogan? What was Hillary Clinton's slogan? One had a memorable, consistent slogan. The other lost.\nBig, bold, simple and consistent messaging is key to political success - because most voters don't pay that much attention to politics most of the time. Now try asking someone you know who isn't a party member what the current Liberal Democrat slogan is.\nThird, Clinton had the best ground organisation by some margin and yet lost a series of swing states by agonisingly small margins. Ground organisation matters but it gives an edge rather than transforming completely political prospects. Even Obama's ground game didn't gain him that much.\nStrategy and messaging matters - and hence the core votes pamphlet I wrote with David Howarth came before the much more tactical organisational pamphlet. To help turn those ideas into reality is the main reason I'm running for the Federal Board in this autumn's internal Liberal Democrat elections.\nI'm also running a survey for party members on the party's strategy and messaging. If you're also a member, you're very welcome to take part in the survey here (and by all means share it with other members - thank you).\nWhat other lessons would you draw?That's why the open and tolerant part of the current message is great.

If you unearth any old, broken or unwanted electricals they could win you a cash prize. Dig them out and take them to one of Derbyshire County Council's household waste recycling centres for your chance to win one of fifteen £100 cash prizes.\nFrom hair-dryers to hedge-trimmers, fairy lights to fridges and toasters to TVs, there's a wide range of household appliances you can take to Derbyshire County Council's recycling centres. From Monday 2 March until Sunday 5 April, you can exchange them for a golden ticket - which means you could be quids in.\nSimply ask for your golden ticket from a member of staff at any of the county council's nine recycling centres, type in your unique ticket number online at www.derbyshire.gov.uk/electric and find out instantly if you're a winner. The more items you recycle, the more tickets you'll get.\nDerbyshire County Council's Cabinet Member for Highways, Transport and Infrastructure Councillor Simon Spencer said: \"It's a shocking fact that across the UK we throw away more than a quarter of the electrical items we buy instead of recycling them.\n\"Reducing waste and increasing recycling is one of our key pledges to help reduce carbon emissions. The carbon footprint is much lower when recycled materials are used than when things are manufactured from scratch.\n\"Our recycling contractors salvage precious metals and other valuable materials from the items residents bring us so that they can be recycled. For example one household iron contains enough steel to produce 13 steel cans.\n\"So please bring us those old electricals. We'll put them to good use and as an added bonus, you could win £100.\"\nIt costs Derbyshire council tax payers £43 million a year for the county council to deal with waste in Derbyshire which residents choose not to recycle. But if every Derbyshire household took just one electrical item to one of our recycling centres in March we could recycle an additional 318,000 appliances and help to cut these costs.\nThe competition prizes are part-funded by Recycling Lives - the contractor which works on behalf of the county council to collect and recycle electrical items taken to its recycling centres.

Judging by the reaction of many Lib Dems to the 2019 General Election, that seems a good metaphor for the predicament party members and activists feel themselves to be in.\nThe most common injunction is currently is to go back to basics, build up the local base, immerse ourselves in community politics,set out on the long march again.\nLike Sisyphus we may find this necessary even obligatory- even if tinged with reluctance and a sense of sad futility. We can see it as a consequence of living in this vale of tears where FPTP rules and political power inevitably goes to those with most economic clout. Breaking the mould can seem impossible if you don't control those forces that set the mould in the first place.\nAnd yet there is the nagging doubt that our plight was not and is not inevitable.In the last decade, it can be argued the party has made several, unnecessary critical errors which have turned golden opportunities into dismal defeat.More specifically the leadership of our party has.\nThe troops ever ready to \"march towards the sound of gunfire \" have arguably been poorly led by those whose grasp of strategy was sub-optimal.\nThe early stages of coalition (tuition fees reversal,NHS re-organisation) is one example, the pledge to revoke is another. Neither of these moves was a necessary corollary of Liberal values which ,popular or not, we just had to take. Both stemmed from a misguided and slightly cynical misunderstanding of where our political advantage lay and both were received by the \"troops\" with misgiving- largely ignored in favour of \"comfort polling\".\nThere are go course other examples- the handling of the EU Referendum and PR Referendum could equally well be cited.\nIt is not surprising ,therefore, if many of our troops before resuming the Sisyphean task that confronts us, wonder what future protection exists against the folly of commanders - especially as it is the rank and file activist who creates much of the enduring political capital the party still possesses.\nA sobering insight into how bad things can be was provided by the relaxed response from the then party leadership that accompanied the destruction of our urban council base in 2011- a base that in the case of places like Liverpool had taken decades to build.\nWe cannot be the force for social change and reform we want to be and we ought to be unless we take a hard and critical look at ourselves,how we are run, how the public sees us - rather than blaming circumstance and opposition chicanery.\nThere is no longer a 'business as usual' option for the party - unless one sees one's business as akin to that of poor old Sisyphus.\n* John Pugh was Liberal Democrat MP for Southport until 2017 and was elected as a Councillor for the Dukes ward of Sefton Borough Council on 2 November 2017.",

We hear from the United Nations that there are 65 million displaced persons in the world, and we know that in Europe alone, as already mentioned, there are 88,000 unaccompanied children. In the years to come, our legacy will not be a good one for our children, because with global warming, economic disasters and conflict, the flow of refugees could well become a torrent. So we have to face years ahead when we will need to tackle problems such as this far more effectively than we have this migration crisis.\nWhen we debated the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, I was very sad to see 200 Conservative Members of this House walking into the Not Content Lobby so as not to accept the 3,000 children mentioned in that amendment. I felt heartbroken that noble Lords could even think of going into the Not Content Lobby on that amendment. I hope that in the future we realise that this is not a one-off. It is something that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will have to face in a far more serious way than we have. I would really like to see an investigation - a commission, possibly - to look into why we acted as we did on this crisis. Why did we delay, month after month, before taking action to accept them?\nNoble Lords are probably very tired of me proposing things and asking questions. I have asked the Government to take positive action in Oral and Written Questions on 13, 16, 22, 27 and 28 June, 7, 12, 13, 14 and 20 July and, since the Summer Recess, on 13, 14 and 15 September and 10, 12, 13, 17, 19 and 24 October.\nNobody can say that we have not tried to move the Government on this issue. At one time we were accepting into the UK only one child every 18 days. Requests to local authorities went out on 14 October.\nThere has been delay here. The Minister and Ministers before her know how I have struggled with this and how I have been so saddened, time and again, because we did not move. Because of that, we come to this present situation: the only time the Government moved was when the bulldozers were in Calais. This really is shameful. We are a compassionate people, yet we delay.\nI have here lists of the children in the camps. Yes, some are 16 and 17 years old: they are not cuddly children, but they are still under 18. Not only that-as has been mentioned, some of them have been trudging from parts of Africa for two or three years. That must have aged them. I know that nowadays I feel pretty exhausted when I walk a few miles. These kids have suffered tremendously. I had a message this morning from Calais: there are about 2,000 remaining in the camps-no way is it 1,500 - and they are in containers. Each container has 12 beds but there are 20 youngsters in each container and they are also sleeping on tables and on the floor. The heating is on, so they are not cold, but there is not enough food to go round.\nThe message this morning said:\n- The weaker kids will be struggling because of the pecking order with other kids. They have no idea what is happening to them.\nHe estimated that there were also 300 people outside the container. This is a situation we should not tolerate as a civilised nation in a civilised Europe.\nThese children are being bussed out in coaches - I think tomorrow - thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs. Queens Park Rangers F.C. is ready to be part of this, though I do not think that will happen. But we must keep tabs on all of these children as they are scattered around France. There are many there who have a right to be here under the Dublin III regulations and many more under the noble Lord's amendment for vulnerable children. They have a place here.\nI had another message this morning:\n- Tomorrow, underage children from the temporary accommodation centre will be leaving by bus for juvenile centres all over France, where their applications to be transferred to the United Kingdom will be dealt with by the British Authorities. No further applications for transfer to the United Kingdom will be dealt with in Calais. All cases will be handled and all departures for the United Kingdom will take place from the juvenile centres. You will be given a wristband which has your bus number on it. The buses will be leaving throughout the day starting at 8 a.m.\nThe message goes on:\n- The British authorities will be accompanying you on the journey.\nWe have tried to face this crisis, but we have not done well at all. The promise is that we will have 20,000 refugees in the UK by the end of this Parliament. If we cannot handle 300 or 400, how can we think of handling 20,000? We cannot delay the organising of this any longer. We cannot have them all coming in the last fortnight; it is impossible. If we are to keep that promise, it must be an ongoing process now.\nI suggest that we should be in touch with Canada - not just because it has a Liberal Government, though it helps - to see what it has done. It has accepted 32,000 people in three months. They have more land than us, but they have bigger hearts than ours.\nIt gets more difficult as time goes on, but the people here are ready to embrace these youngsters and the others who will follow. It is not easy but it can be done. At the time of the Blitz, 3 million people were moved from the big cities to places such as north Wales in a month. If we did it then, we can do it now.\n* Lord Roberts of Llandudno is a Liberal Democrat Member of the House of Lords",

In the light of this, I took the opportunity to ask Cllr Barry Thomas, Leader of Powys County Council, a question on reported incidents of hate crime at Full Council last month. Given the need to keep our communities secure, tolerant and welcoming, I asked what specific measures are being promoted within the Powys Public Service Board, to combat intolerance and prejudice, in furtherance of the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. This followed a useful meeting that Cllr Thomas and I had with newly elected Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner, Dafydd Llewelyn, at the Royal Welsh Show.\nClimate of uncertainty and apprehension\nWhat prompted me to ask the question is the ongoing climate of uncertainty and apprehension, evident amongst sections of our population, in Powys, Wales and across the UK.

The minutes of the local Community Safety Partnership indicate a significant spike in hate crime in midsummer, with 12 referrals to Victim Support in June 2016, compared with 8 the previous year. These incidents took place in the immediate aftermath of the 23rd June - tying in with similar incident statistics across Wales and the UK. Clearly the febrile atmosphere unleashed by the Referendum campaign had played its part.\nUnleashing the prejudices of the few\nMost Leave voters, including many whom I would count as friends, had reasons for their choice - and would roundly condemn any hostility towards EU Nationals, or indeed any other minority groups caught up in the cross fire. However, it has become apparent that a small minority of individuals, who have always harboured prejudices, are emboldened, in the post Brexit climate, to give voice to them, regardless of the feelings of others. Whilst it seems that the surge in such incidents has ebbed, the overall atmosphere in our communities, our work places and even our schools, remains potentially vulnerable to fresh waves of such sentiment. This is a particular danger, should our economic circumstances deteriorate.\nSpontaneous displays of kindness\nAt times over the summer, by contrast, I have seen spontaneous displays of kindness and thoughtfulness at community level. This was manifested memorably when Talgarth Town, my local football team, hosted a friendly against Unity in Diversity, a Swansea based refugee team back in July. Similarly, a young Polish Mum cried as she told me about the flood of text messages that her daughter had received from school mates, offering friendship and support in the Brexit aftermath.\nWe all have a part to play\nSo it is clear that we are all able to make a contribution towards safeguarding the kind of decent, tolerant society that we would wish to live in. Especially in our schools, teachers, governors and parents can be alert to these matters in their own communities. I am not convinced that the Home Office's 'Prevent' strategy, which targets radicalisation, is well adapted to combatting home grown nationalism, jingoism and ignorance. We need bespoke strategies to challenge these behaviours - and this task should be on the agenda of our Public Service Boards.\nValuing our EU Nationals\nThe First Minister, the Rt Hon Carwyn Jones AM, has repeatedly stated that Wales values the presence and contribution of many thousands of EU Nationals and others to our communities and our public services, notably in the healthcare sector. My Welsh Liberal Democrat colleague Kirsty Williams AM, as Cabinet Secretary for Education in the Welsh Government, has recently emphasised too the importance of EU students to the sustainability of our universities - and our farming and automotive sectors remain heavily reliant on EU exports, regardless of the theology of Brexit. The recent events around Nissan are a powerful reminder of this.\nRemembrance - in its widest sense\nAs communities across the UK prepare to recall the sacrifices made for the freedom and tolerance of our society, there is maybe more than ever to reflect upon this year. The mass slaughter of the last century reminds us of what can happen when nation states pursue their interests unfettered and come off the rails. The 11th November is, of course, also Polish Independence Day, when Poles recall winning their freedom from domination by more powerful neighbours. Poland's contribution to our own struggle against fascism is a proud part of our shared history. In recent days, the German Embassy in London has reported a significant rise in those of German Jewish heritage in the UK applying for German and therefore EU citizenship to which they are entitled under the German Grundgesetz. Whatever their motivation, this move should cause all those of us who care about the reputation of our country abroad a sharp intake of breath.\nNot only common decency, but also common sense\nFor these - and so many other reasons - it is not only common decency, but also common sense, for us to remain mindful of the feelings and anxieties of our fellow residents, and to call out unacceptable behaviours, as we navigate our way through the post Referendum world.\n* William Powell is Deputy Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats on Powys County Council and speaks for his party on the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs.

On local issues, on Corbyn, on the Conservative Brexit Government and even things like grammar schools. The Liberal Democrats are winning those elections and making real progress.\nA 34% swing in Derbyshire, 18% in Newcastle, 15% in Cardiff, 31% in Sheffield, 28% in Teignmouth. It feels like there is isn't a week that goes by that the moment when I'm not tweeting Lib Dem gain on a Thursday night.\nI said on the night of my election as Liberal Democrat leader: \"Our survival, revival, our rebirth, our rebuild will happen in communities in councils in common rooms, away from the stuffy corridors of Westminster.\n\"Step by step, we will change people's lives for the better and as we do that we will regain their trust.\"\nThis is happening and you can see the results for yourself.

Nearly two weeks ago our team in Sheffield delivered a local and purely liberal message and it worked. They campaigned from dusk till dawn and won. But where was Labour?\nJust yards away from where the Lib Dem team were knocking on doors, some of the local Momentum activists were in the pub. They were campaigning. They were telephone canvassing for Jeremy Corbyn in the Labour leadership election. Meanwhile in the real world outside that rather nice Sheffield pub, real people were voting in a real election. A real election where the unspeakably brilliant Gail Smith was about to take the Liberal Democrats from 4th to first, gaining a seat from Labour with a swing of 38.1%.\nNow, in the wake of the Brexit vote those divisions are more exposed than ever before. With our country facing huge challenges - from inequality and injustice, to an NHS in crisis and an economy in jeopardy - we are left with a reckless, divisive and uncaring Conservative Government and Labour fighting among themselves with no plan for the economy or the country.\nOnly the Liberal Democrats have a plan on Brexit, are talking about proper funding for the NHS and are working to deal with the housing crisis.\nThat's why the Liberal Democrats are needed more than ever.

Labour also closed many Youth Clubs.\nA careful, case by case exploration with local voluntary groups of how best to provide \"places to go and things to do\" for young people could transform the situation, and save money. But this is not an instant solution. Simply closing down all the youth clubs, attended weekly by hundreds of young people, would be an act of vandalism.\nWe must accept that councils need to save money.

Here Tim Farron gives his take on the current situation and how the party should respond to it..\n2016 has been a year that has confounded conventional political expectations. Any idea of a liberal consensus has been turned on its head. Brexit and Trump are its biggest headlines. Elsewhere in the world there is the rise of Marine le Pen, the Alternative für Deutschland and Rodrigo Duterte. They each advocate nationalistic, right-wing populism, claiming falsely it is possible to provide easy solutions to complex problems.\nThese populist movements and politicians have gained traction by tapping into people's genuine anger at feeling let down and dispossessed by the mainstream political classes. They have also created a simple and emotive story that explains how people feel and makes it feel okay to vote for things that they would never have considered voting for, even a few years ago.\nFor us, here in Britain, Brexit presents the biggest challenge to us since the Second World War. Its handling will define our place in the world for generations. It will also determine our economic, social and political direction for many, many years.\nAll of this makes Sarah Olney's victory in Richmond Park all the more satisfying - and my most rewarding experience so far as leader. Building on Liz Leffman's fantastic result in Witney, and our continued astonishing success in local government, we have demonstrated that it is possible to challenge this new Brexit establishment.\nI still believe that leaving the European Union is perilous for our country and I am absolutely certain that Theresa May is mismanaging the process. That is why I am determined the Liberal Democrats will continue to hold her government to account - a government which has no popular mandate beyond a referendum that charted no destination for the United Kingdom in its relationship with Europe and the rest of the world.\nBut there is another challenge for our party.\nIn 2017, populist ideologues from the right and the left will continue to stoke racism, hatred and division. They will continue to look for simple, authoritarian solutions, trading civil liberties for so-called security and seeing diversity and multiculturalism as a threat, not a strength. I believe our liberal values embody the best values of the United Kingdom. We must give those values a passionate voice and a story that people can identify with.\nWe must demonstrate that Conservative elites are pursuing Brexit at the expense of rising inequalities in health and education. We must point out the huge damage being done to our culture of entrepreneurship. And we must highlight how their short-termism is jeopardising our commitment to fighting climate change and ensuring a sustainable future for future generations.\nDo so successfully and we have the potential to build a core of support behind our party. We can speak to those who are internationalist, concerned about the environment, suspicious of an over-bearing state, concerned that politicians in Westminster are out of touch with Britain's diverse communities, and those who believe in both free enterprise and fairness.\nOur victory in Richmond Park is an important first step in speaking up for a different kind of Britain. It is a first step at reclaiming the character of our country as one that is open, tolerant and united.",

[BBC]\nHere is what Nick Clegg had to say on launching his latest Brexit Challenge paper:\nToday I am launching the third of a series of Brexit Challenge paper, on Food and Drink - everything from farming and fishing to high value-added foods made with imported ingredients. It is our biggest manufacturing sector by value, larger than car and aerospace manufacturing combined, and employs 850,000 people. And it is highly dependent on access to EU markets and to EU migrant labour.\nSeen through this lens, Hard Brexit is not a sunny upland; it's a cliff edge.\nFirst, exporters. Food and drink products are currently traded across borders with no forms or checks. Once we leave the EU, products will have to go through customs checks at the EU border which include applying for relevant import licences, costly export health certificates to show that the product meets EU public health standards, and veterinary inspections. Major markets for key exports like whisky (which brings in £4bn a year) will become more challenging as tariff-free EU-negotiated FTAs fall away.\nFor farmers, the next few years are extremely worrying. Profit margins are already squeezed to the barest of minimums. Come 2019, farmers will face average tariffs on their wheat, milk, and other agriculture produce of 22.3%, and the following year they will most likely lose some of the £3bn in subsidies they currently receive from the EU. In the face of stiff opposition from abroad, the logical conclusion is that smaller operators will go out of business, while only the larger more industrial farms are likely to survive.\nManufacturers further up the food chain face the prospect of big price hikes in raw ingredients, both from domestic production and from the increased cost of imports once tariffs are applied. 70% of imported food comes from the continent.\nConsumers will inevitably have to bear the knock-on cost of these pressures, while also seeing the price of imported foods rise, including popular products which we are accustomed to buying cheaply.\nFor example, Chilean wine faces a 14% tariff, while for New Zealand Lamb the additional cost for importers will be 40%, while chocolate and beef will face whopping tariffs of 38% and 59% respectively.\nThese are daunting tariffs for importers and for consumers, but the problems start well before Brexit actually takes place. The recent drop in the value of the pound and its impact on sales of Marmite and PG Tips is only a foretaste of what is to come in the next 12 months.\nThere are two problems. First, many importers and producers reliant on imported ingredients are currently hedged against currency fluctuations, but those hedges will start to expire soon, exposing them to the full effect of the weaker pound.\nSecondly, supermarket suppliers are tied into long-term contracts, usually for 12 or 18 months. Producers who signed contacts before the devaluation of sterling are stuck with fixed supermarket prices, while the cost of their raw ingredients has risen sharply. One shortbread producer in Scotland recently warned that he risked going out of business due to a 75% rise in the cost of butter since June. When those supermarket contracts expire, suppliers will be able to negotiate at a higher price. Good news for them, but bad news for shoppers.\nOf course we don't exactly know what effect all of these factors will have on supermarket prices. As Ian Wright, the chair of the Food and Drink Federation said the other day, retailers only have three choices: either absorb the costs into their margins (which is difficult given the ultra-competitive nature of the supermarket industry); pass it onto consumers (similarly unattractive when discount supermarkets are nipping at your heels); or stop stocking certain products altogether. No wonder the Federation also found in a recent survey that close to 70% of their members are pessimistic about the future.\nPrice rises therefore seem inevitable. One study conducted for the National Farmers Union in April this year estimated that Hard Brexit would lead to average food price increases of around 8% by 2025. And in May this year the Treasury predicted that a fall in the value of sterling of 12% caused by uncertainty after a vote to leave would mean that a family of 4 would see their bills go up by £123 after 2 years. Given the fall in the value of sterling is now 17%, the final bill will surely be higher.\nTariffs and transaction costs are not the only concern though. EU rules govern every corner of food and drink, from hygiene standards to nutritional labelling, disease control to animal welfare. Consumer confidence in the quality and safety of our food hinges on these standards. All of these rules will therefore need to be brought into UK legislation and some of them will be hotly contested, with consumer groups and industry arguing about the correct balance.\nThe heavily EU-dependent food and drink industry really is the bellwether for a successful Brexit.

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_voter-migration-2017-2019/content_195.html": "Voter Migration 2017-2019\n1. Introduction\nThe key driver of the December 2019 election result was the group of voters who chose to vote differently from 2017. Using polling data, Electoral Calculus has identified and analysed these voters to see which parties they switched to and from.\nSince Brexit was obviously an important factor in people's decisions, voters were also identified by how they voted in the EU referendum of 2016 (as Leavers, Remainers, or those who didn't vote then).\nThe migration graphic below shows the results of the analysis. Each figure represents one per cent of those who voted in the 2017 general election, which is equivalent to about 300,000 actual voters. The colour of each figure indicates which party they voted for in 2017. Their shape represents how they voted at the EU referendum ('hand wave' for Leavers, 'feet astride' for Remainers, and a static figure for those too young or apathetic to have voted then).\nThe migration flows, indicated by the arrows, show how voters have changed their minds since 2017, and indicate the transfer of votes at the 2019 election. Parties which lost votes in 2019, such as Labour, have their ranks thinned by lost voters (coloured in grey) who supported them in 2017 but switched away in 2019. Parties which gained votes in 2019 have their ranks augmented by figures bearing a plus sign (+) who are new supporters of that party in 2019.\nAlso important this year were voters who did not choose to vote, which are indicated by the big grey figure in the middle. Some voters did not vote in 2017 but did vote in 2019, and they are represented by figures coming out of the non-voting area. Other voters did vote in 2017 but not in 2019 and they are shown going into the non-voting area.\n2. Analysis\nIn 2017, the Conservatives won 43pc of the GB vote, with Labour on 41pc and the Liberal Democrats on 8pc. The Greens and UKIP got about 2pc each. This is shown in the sizes of the party blocks (including grey voters but ignoring 'plus' voters). The remaining 5pc of voters voted for the SNP, Plaid Cymru and minor parties.\nWe can also see the breakdown by EU referendum vote. Most but not all Conservative voters were Leave supporters, and the 43 Conservative voters were divided into 31 Leavers, 11 Remainers and one who didn't vote in the EU referendum. The 41 Labour supporters are divided into 26 Remainers, 12 Leavers and three who didn't vote (possibly because they were too young in 2016). The eight Liberal Democrats were split 5-2 in favour of Remain with one non-voter. The Greens had both Remainers and Leavers, but UKIP (shown now in Brexit colours) was solidly Leave.\nIn terms of voter migration, the main story is that voters left Labour. Nine out of 41 voters left. They left for different reasons and went to different places, but they left. That partial collapse of the Labour vote is the most important fact of the 2019 election and explains why Labour did so badly. By comparison, the Conservatives were relatively stable and gained seats because Labour weakened.\nThe largest group of Labour defectors were the four supporters who chose not to vote. They could be solid Labour voters who were disenchanted by the Labour leadership and were uncomfortable in one way or another with the party's Brexit stance. This group played an important role in Labour's defeat, but those people could easily return to Labour at the next general election once Brexit is completed and if Labour's new leadership is more attractive.\nThree other Labour leavers went to vote for either the Conservatives or the Brexit party.\nOn the other side, two Labour remainers defected to the Liberal Democrats, presumably attracted by their more hard-line Remain stance.\nThe Liberal Democrats also gained a Remain voter from the Conservatives, and a new voter who had not voted in 2017. Altogether that increased their vote share nationally, but those votes were scattered across seats and they were not able to translate their increased support into seat gains.\nThe Conservatives were notably static. They gained a couple of Leave voters from Labour and lost one Remain voter to the Lib Dems. But otherwise their supporters stood remarkably loyal. Most significant was the significant group of Conservative Remainers who (mostly) did not defect to other parties. The failure of the Lib Dems to attract more of those voters was a big setback for the Lib Dems and a strong positive for the Conservatives. If half of Conservative Remainers had gone to the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives might have won just 325 seats and been short of an outright majority again.\n3. Conclusions\nThe 2019 election result was driven by two key trends. The first was the semi-collapse of the Labour vote, with both Leave and Remain Labour voters deserting the party. The second was the strength of the Conservative party in retaining its Remain supporters despite its drive for Brexit. Taken together, these two trends weakened Labour relative to the Conservatives in seats across the country and enabled the Conservatives to gain nearly fifty seats.\nFor the next election, both major parties will be eyeing the Liberal Democrats to see if they can recapture their \"lost\" voters. Labour should also be thinking about how to get those Labour-leaning abstainers back into the habit of voting Labour. That is Labour's largest group of lost voters and they may be easier to win back than those that actively defected to other parties.\nThe final big question is how the Brexit process will play out. If Brexit goes smoothly, it may become less controversial and the Leave/Remain divide will fade away. But if passions stay strong, then Brexit may define British politics for some time to come.",

With the noble exception of Canada, Liberal parties and values were largely confined to northern Europe, but since then the picture has changed dramatically. As we in Britain lick our wounds from the double whammy of the Brexit vote and the triumph of Donald Trump in the United States let us take comfort from the fact that the Liberal family is growing worldwide. This was dramatically illustrated by the Liberal International (LI) Executive in Marrakesh, at which five new African parties - from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Madagascar, Senegal and Somalia - were welcomed into membership last weekend, which means that LI now has almost 50 member parties from Africa alone. The Marrakesh gathering was timed to coincide with COP22, the latest in a series of global conferences following up on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Headlines about government support for the Nissan factory in Sunderland and GDP rising immediately after the referendum do not detract from the big picture: the UK's post-EU future remains gloomy, and then some. We are, it seems, at the start of a new era of border queues, inflation, renewed austerity, with the prospect of rising unemployment, and the exit from Britain of banks and other financial services. They may be modern villains, but they are also one of the only dependable sources of tax revenue we've got left.\nPolitical debate about what happens next is currently carved up between supporters of hard and soft Brexit - with, just to add to all the absurdity, the Labour party saddled with a new position all of its own: as reconfirmed by John McDonnell's media appearances this week, \"hard\" in the sense that its leadership is relaxed about Britain having only \"access\" to the single market, but \"soft\" in its attitude to immigration. Even among the people who spent the late summer wondering whether the referendum might somehow be annulled, the enemy is now a \"destructive\" Brexit, not the thing itself.\nThe pro-EU noise that followed the vote, it seems, has dwindled to almost nothing. You would think that no one is now calling into question what 48% of us voted against.\nBut listen closely, and you can hear it: people wondering why the UK is doing this at all. This week, a YouGov poll suggested that if a hypothetical Stop Brexit party put up candidates at an election, it would get the support of 25.9% of voters (including 4% of those who voted leave), leaving Labour trailing on 18.7% (the Tories, the poll says, would be on 34%).\nIndeed, trawl recent surveys, and you quickly get a sense of the people who are spooked, with good reason: the 36% of people who say Brexit will be \"bad for jobs\"; the 28% who think there will be negative effects on pensions; the 38% who agree with the no-brainer proposition that leaving the EU will reduce Britain's influence in the world.\nA lot of these people would presumably agree with AC Grayling, who may yet find himself in the unfamiliar position of speaking for a substantial body of public opinion: leaving the EU, he recently tweeted, \"is obviously such an incredibly bad idea - just stop it\".\nFor many people - including me - that kind of talk always triggers a deep ambivalence. If what took the leave side to victory was the support of so-called \"left behind\" voters who had not been listened to for decades, it still seems to me that arguing they should be ignored may not just be democratically questionable, but a gift to the forces that, even with Ukip apparently imploding, would know a once-in-a-lifetime chance when they saw it, and strike. Witness the pro-Brexit tycoon Arron Banks, who now wants to bankroll nothing less than a \"people's movement\", and give voice to \"England rising\". In that sense, there remains a good argument for those of us who voted remain to stand back, and let this frazzled example of government-by-plebiscite run its course, while bearing in mind the immortal words of the US writer and satirist HL Mencken: \"Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.\"\nAnd yet, and yet. Whatever your view, it is unquestionably the case that at this rate, the snowballing Brexit disaster will create a groundswell of public anxiety and outrage, and a big opportunity for a party willing to channel them. At the national level at least, this seems unlikely to be Labour, for three reasons: the number of \"core\" Labour voters who supported leave, the anti-EU inclinations of its leadership, and the general cluelessness that suggests it tends to view glaring political opportunities as some kind of bourgeois trick. In which case, there is one obvious candidate: the Liberal Democrats.\nFor sure, they have a hell of a lot to surmount: the deep damage to their reputation done by the coalition years, a leader who has yet to break into the public consciousness, and an almost total lack of powerbases, even in their traditional redoubts. But with memories of their grim partnership with the Tories fading, an intersecting alliance of voters could yet be theirs: those variously worried about hard Brexit, drawn to the Lib Dems' insistence on a second referendum, and in many cases opposed to leaving the EU per se - people who, if the government sticks to its current hard line and/or the EU refuses to play ball, may well become one big anti-Brexit bloc.\nThere was a flavour of this at this at last week's Witney byelection, whose pretty miraculous result - a 19% swing from the Tories to a party we all thought was dead - has been rather overlooked, along with Tim Farron's trumpeting of the result: a clear rejection, he said, \"of the Conservative Brexit government's plan to take Britain out of the single market\".\nWhat happened there highlighted a tension, hardly unique to that corner of the country, that was arguably always going to explode. The Conservative party faced thousands of Tory-inclined voters who supported remain (in West Oxfordshire, the pro-EU side won by 54% to 46%). After weeks of telling them that whatever their anxieties, it was now likely to be hard Brexit all the way, surprise, surprise: a lot of them didn't like it.\nSomething similar is likely to happen in the looming Richmond Park byelection- which Zac Goldsmith wants to be about a third Heathrow runway, but thanks to the absence of an official Tory candidate and an already-energised Lib Dem campaign, may well turn out to be a contest much more focused on Europe, and Goldsmith's leap away from thousands of his constituents. They live in a borough that voted 70% for remain - in which context, he will be hobbled not just by his support for the leave side, but the downright racist mayoral campaign that gave a sharp flavour of the nastiness that would erupt both before and after the referendum.\nI'm old-fashioned: I would rather political divisions were based on such trifles as inequality, and the limits of the market. But these are hardly normal times. As also evidenced by a steady stream of council byelection results, a proper Lib Dem revival may only be a matter of time. Whatever the contortions of the Labour leadership, I wonder about the Labour leaders of our big cities, and the first minister of Wales, and at what point they may break from their hopeless party line, and begin to pointedly question something that will so deeply damage the places where they hold power.\nAll the time, it gets louder: the early stirring of a messy realignment, and the birth pangs of 48/52 politics, whose consequences - on both sides of the divide - could be just as seismic as Brexit itself.",

Running the channels it is responsible for is necessary, but the smart strategy involves working with the huge number of other channels too.\nIt's not only that there are, literally, hundreds of channels around the country run by volunteers for each official channel from federal party HQ in London. It's also that the audiences for all those other channels rapidly add up to being a significant player in total compared to the national channels.\nTake Facebook, whose huge usage in the UK makes it a vital channel for political campaigning. The current public figures for a sample of six different Lib Dem Facebook pages are fairly typical of what I regularly see:\nThe 'Total Page Likes' figures are only of limited value as they are more an indication of potential audience reach for the pages rather than actual reach. The engagement figures - how many people have actually engaged with content - are much more meaningful.\nTwo things are notable about that column. First, the untapped potential of both the Nick Clegg and Tim Farron pages (especially when you also look at the number of Likes that the Nick Clegg page has). There is of course a bit of semantic debate about how official or not these pages are, but they do both make the point about how much more there is to the party's online presence that just the official federal party channels.\nThen look down to my own Liberal Democrat Newswire page, run part-time (very part-time) by one person. The party's own page only typically engages around five times as many people as my own solo effort. Start adding in the pages run by other members, and especially on behalf of local parties and councillors, and - even excluding those which are aimed at internal debate - you rapidly see how much of the audience that is being reached with Liberal Democrat messages is reached via people other than those at HQ running the official central channels.\nThis is nothing new. It was the case back when I was running the party's online operations, and hence my strategy then of taking a diversified approach which supported unofficial channels. But the lack of novelty in this lesson makes it all the more important as it is a permanent feature of how online politics works for the Liberal Democrats. The right digital strategy is one that recognises this (and so no prizes for guessing what I set out in more details in Targeting Plus..).",

The refund, announced in today's Autumn Statement, comes after years of campaigning by the MP.\nThe new policy replaces the previous arrangements, where teams would receive a grant to offset some of their VAT costs. That was first won by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Mountain Rescue, vice chaired by Tim, back in 2011 - but was due to expire this year.\nTim said: \"This is fantastic news and will make a massive difference to our vital search and rescue teams. It has always struck me as deeply unfair that an emergency service which saves people's lives everyday, has to pay tax on the vital equipment that they use - especially when virtually all of their funding comes from charitable donations. That's why I have been campaigning for so long to stop these teams having to pay VAT. Our Mountain Rescue teams do amazing work for people in desperate need. I cannot praise them highly enough - their determination and bravery are truly inspiring.\n\"Today's announcement would not have been possible without the work of the late Stewart Hulse from Windermere. As a member of Mountain Rescue England and Wales, Stewart helped me gather the evidence to present to Minister to firstly secure the grant funding, and now this refund. I want to pay tribute to him as we celebrate this important victory.\"",

However, the law was changed by the Electoral Administration Act of 2006, which made an attempt to mislead voters an offence of \"undue influence\" - although Watt said that had not been tested by the courts so far.\nWatt and his colleagues who have prepared the case say it centres on \"instances where the leave campaigns continued to make assertions of fact that were knowingly misleading\", including the oft-cited claim of the EU costing the UK £350m a week.\nThat claim, made by Vote Leave, was contrary to evidence from the Office for National Statistics, Watt said. Other instances cited to the DPP include alleged misrepresentations on pro-Brexit leaflets that Nissan and Unilever supported leaving the EU.\nWatt also cited Vote Leave's posters that claimed \"Turkey is joining the EU\", as well as the assertion that \"the UK has no border controls whilst in the EU\" when billions are spent on the UK Border Agency.\nSome other cases had been excluded, Watt said, including George Osborne's so-called \"punishment budget\" in support of remain, because it was \"an expression of opinion\" rather than a matter of fact.\n\"Whilst that may be considered by some as deplorable, only claims which amount to assertion of fact are likely to meet the test for undue influence,\" Watt said. \"Our primary aim in seeking prosecution is to try to restore some integrity to our democratic processes.\n\"None of us is willing to allow the UK to be dragged down to some kind of populist 'who can lie and deceive the most?' race to the bottom, such as we witnessed earlier this year.\"\nIf a case was brought successfully, it would not have any bearing on the referendum result or prevent the UK leaving the EU, but could result in criminal punishment of anyone held responsible by the courts for making false statements.\nWatt said the laws that \"protect against corrupt campaigning practices\" needed to be imposed. \"Ultimately it will be for parliament to decide, based on the court's judgment on evidence that there was undue influence, if that has bearing on whether the EU referendum result should be considered as democratically safe,\" he said.\nAlthough Vote Leave is no longer functioning , the Guardian has contacted Change Britain, its successor organisation, which campaigns to leave the single market, as well as its former chief executive, Matthew Elliott, at his new website Brexit Central asking for comment. Leave.EU has also been contacted.\nThe Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, patron of Vote Leave Watch, said: \"It looks like the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign will be needing to spend some of that £350m on lawyers' fees rather than our NHS.\n\"Vote Leave went beyond the normal bounds of political campaigning, telling blatant untruths about our contribution to the EU budget, Turkey joining the European Union, and much more. It's about time they were held to account for misleading the British people.\"",

Even if you've not committed any crime at all.\nThat's why Liberal Democrat peers, led by former Met Deputy Assistant Commissioner Brian Paddick, voted against these measures when they were inserted in the House of Lords. We would have defeated them if Labour had joined us, but only 17 of their 186 peers turned up to vote. When MPs had our one, brief chance to consider the proposals, I continued to challenge them - and to propose a far better alternative.\nThere's no doubt that we need urgent action to tackle the knife crime epidemic that is claiming far too many young lives. We need more police on our streets, more youth workers to help steer children away from gangs and violence, and a proper public health approach spanning youth services, community groups, schools and the NHS.\nBut that all costs money - money this Tory Government isn't prepared to spend. So instead, Javid has come up with KCPOs. It's a cheaper policy that certainly sounds tough. But history tells us it won't work. And evidence shows us there's a better way.\nKCPOs are essentially ASBOs for knives. They could be imposed on children as young as 12, even if they've never been caught carrying a knife or convicted of any crime. Yet breaching their conditions - being in the wrong place, hanging around with the wrong people, or even just failing to notify the police of a change of address - would be a criminal offence, punishable by up to 2 years in prison.\nI can't imagine what it is about the experience of ASBOs makes Javid think they'll work for knife crime. In some communities, ASBOs were seen as a \"badge of honour\". Many young people openly flouted them. The threat of prison simply doesn't work as a deterrent for a lot of young people.\nEven worse, ASBOs consumed a lot of police time and resources, whether applying to the courts to get one or enforcing its conditions afterwards. And that was at a time when we had far more police.\nIf Javid doesn't remember what a failure ASBOs were, he should just ask his boss. Theresa May, as Home Secretary, described them as \"bureaucratic\" and \"gimmick-laden\". \"They were too time consuming and expensive,\" she said. \"And they too often criminalised young people unnecessarily, acting as a conveyor belt to serious crime and prison.\" She was right, and that's why as Home Secretary, she abolished them.\nThe good news is that some police and local authorities developed an alternative method of tackling anti-social behaviour, as it became apparent that ASBOs weren't working. And this tool worked: Acceptable Behaviour Contracts, or ABCs.\nThe idea is fairly simple: a young person signs an agreement with their local authority and the police, promising not to engage in anti-social behaviour. There's no need to go to court, so they are much quicker and cheaper to impose compared to ASBOs. The idea is to make young people - and their parents - think about the consequences of their actions and take responsibility.\nThe evidence is clear. ASBOs didn't work. ABCs do. They are more effective at getting young people to change their behaviour, and far less costly in terms of police time and resources. Even before ASBOs were abolished, the use of ABCs had far outstripped them.\nSo instead of Sajid Javid's knife ASBOs, I'm proposing knife ABCs: Anti-Blade Contracts.\nThey could be imposed the first time a young person is caught with a knife, but could also be used proactively for children involved in gangs or who might be considering carrying a knife. The young person would sign a contract saying \"I will not carry a knife.\" In return, they could be guaranteed services to help them feel safer: a police officer or social worker to call whenever they need them, for example.\nCrucially, these new ABCs would be backed up by education and engagement: proper conversations with young people about knives. And by making clear that there are consequences for breaking these contracts: perhaps larger fines or tougher community sentences if they are convicted for carrying a knife in future.\nThat would be far more effective, far less time-consuming for police, and far more compatible with a broader public health approach than Javid's poorly-designed, badly-evidenced KCPOs. They may have passed into law, but the Liberal Democrats will continue to oppose them - and to make the case for a better way to get tough on knife crime.",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_politics-between-the-extremes-some-highlights/content_253.html": "Politics between the extremes – some highlights\nNick Clegg's account of the coalition and its aftermath is an insightful and in many places startlingly frank account. This is not a complete review, though do buy and read the book for yourself, but I'll pick up a few of the issues raised.\nNick devotes a chapter to \"the plumage of power\" - looking at how a government anchored in the centre ground by Liberal Democrats ended up appearing from the outside merely to be run by unusually moderate Conservatives. One aspect of this was being seen with the trappings of power. The value was understood all along by Conservatives - because they live for this sort of thing. Speaking at the door of number 10, etc. There's a fascinating contrast between the coalition DPM who had a veto on government policy but no real visible trappings - and, say, the US Vice President who is well adorned with plumage, but whose powers are 'not worth a bucket of warm spit'.\nThe lesson may seem obvious with hindsight - demand the pomp commensurate with the role. I guess we thought it pompous and silly. And no doubt had Nick demanded the use of the Number 10 front door, or another office with a grand entrance, for the TV cameras, the opposition would have said that that was all he was in it for.\nAnother chapter examines continental experiences with coalition from the point of view of the smaller party. The Dutch, we are told have a phrase: Burgemeester in Oorlog - to be a mayor in wartime - under the Nazi occupation, Dutch mayors could either resign and be replaced by a stooge or stay and become compromised. Neither choice was a vote winner. (That is not to cast the other parties as Nazis - but the dilemma, of having to choose between symbolic purity and the the consequences of your actions, will upset many whichever way you go.) This chapter then analyses the what happened and why on the effect of the coalition on the party's electoral support. There are lessons to be learned with hindsight but there are also factors that were outside our control. Labour's choice to target Lib Dem voters with much greater effort than they did Conservatives was one factor. Another was the unexpected effect of the SNP driving moderate English voters towards the Conservatives for fear of a government at the mercy of special pleading for Scotland.\nA third chapter looks at the EU referendum, with some interesting insights into the differences in what Europe means to its founders, to the southern and eastern additions, and to the UK. We had a referendum because of a failure of Conservative Party management, arising in turn from a war between the two halves of the Conservative brain: the home, hearth, heritage, nuclear family and King James Bible on the one hand, and the innovative free market capitalists, skeptical of government ability to 'buck the market' on the other.\nThe actions of generations of Conservatives have exploded the myth that Britain retains any meaningful economic sovereignty of its own. Yet this is the same party that goes beserk if Britain is outvoted in the EU Council of Ministers on technical amendments to the third widget directive. They have rubbed our noses in the idea that we have no alternative to being open to the world economically, while at the same time recoiling from the implications of that very openness.\nThe referendum debate is characterised as one that pitted the politics of reason, imperfection and compromise against those of anger, utopianism and grievance. This is also a larger theme of the book, looking at the lessons and challenges for liberal, plural and internationalist politics in the age of Trump, Corbyn and having \"had enough of experts\". Nick talks about the need for a more emotionally powerful message and calls on us to assert our positive patriotism in contrast to the patriotism of fear and isolation of the populists.\nIt's good advice, though we are in danger of telling the angry that they're not being reasonable, and telling those who have reasoned from false premises (decades of lies about the EU) that they are just being angry. That wouldn't work.\n* Joe Otten is a councillor in Sheffield and Tuesday editor of Liberal Democrat Voice.",

But, under his leadership, he says Liberal Democrats can become the natural home for pro-business, centrist politics. He talks to Charlotte Henry\nIt is somewhat unusual for an Oxford educated white man with a Knighthood to be an underdog, but Sir Ed Davey undoubtedly is that in the battle to become the next Lib Dem leader. His opponent, Jo Swinson, is the clear favourite with bookies and pundits.\nNot that this has dented the MP for Kingston and Surbiton's enthusiasm for the contest. \"Having served in parliament for 20 years, I now feel I've got what it takes to lead our party at this historic moment,\" he says.\nIt should come as no surprise that Davey is up for the fight. He first won the then newly created seat in 1997 by just 56 votes from Conservative Richard Tracey, who had been an MP for nearly 14 years. Davey lost the seat in the Lib Dems' 2015 wipe-out, before regaining it in 2017. Indeed, he points to his campaign credentials as one of the reasons he should succeed Sir Vince Cable: \"Given my campaigning history, where I've won elections when nobody expected me to do so, I think I can bring that substance and vision alongside the need to win. So, I think I'm well placed for the party at the moment.\"\nHe has big ambitions for his resurgent party if he becomes leader too. \"Why should we put a cap on our ambitions? We've never seen British politics in such a mess,\" he says. \"We've never seen both political parties so divided at the same time. Sometimes you've seen one divided. Sometimes you've seen the other one. You've never seen them both at the same time.\"\nDavey also believes that the Conservative and Labour parties have never been \"so extreme\". \"You've got an extremely right-wing Brexiteer Conservative government. It's not just on Brexit where they're out of touch with the British people, it's on so many things. And you've got a Labour party led by the most extreme left-wing leader it has ever had with the Momentum left-wing strengthening its grip on the party. Entryism in the Tory party... these parties are in a serious, serious, mess and people need to recognise that.\"\nHe said that while it \"would be nonsense\" to say the Lib Dems will win the next election \"what we can say is we can now conceive of that\". \"If you can conceive of something, if the story is plausible and you believe you are getting the strength in depth in members, in money, in voters, then why not think about that?\"\nDavey is clear he would like to be Prime Minister. However, in the current Brexit deadlock, he is also advocating a Government of National Unity.\n\"I think there are just about enough MPs from a plethora of parties who are so alarmed at a no deal prospect, who are so alarmed at the way our politics has been polluted by these hard-right Brexiteers, that they will come together. It will not be easy, but I could see a backbench Labour MP, I wouldn't name them but you can guess who they might be, being given support from enough people from enough parties that we could send a message to the Palace that if they send for that member of Parliament they will be able to command a majority of the House of Commons.\"\nHe says that this \"Government of National Unity\" would not be a coalition. \"It would be a temporary phenomenon in order to stop no-deal. In order pass the paving legislation for a people's vote and then be a caretaker government to oversee the process until that vote happened.\"\nDavey categorically rules out a coalition with a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party or a Tory party led by Boris Johnson, if, as expected, the former London mayor soon wins his party's contest. \"With the current Brexit leadership of the Tory party and the current Brexit leadership of the Labour party and the fact they're taking their parties to extremes, there's no way we could do a deal with them,\" he explains.\nDavey says that instead he believes in evidence-based policy and a rational debate. \"I know that's not very popular in a world where you have been like Nigel Farage who just make things up and Boris Johnson who just believes in deception on an industrial scale.\n\"I know we're getting used to the Trumps and Johnsons and Farages who just have a problem with the truth. It's astonishing that these people can be anywhere near power when they are just mass deception - that's what their game is. But we don't all have to go down that route,\" he adds.\nDavey is confident he is not alone in this view, not least in Parliament. He tells The House that former Labour and Change UK MP Chuka Umunna will not be the last to join the Lib Dems. \"To come into our party they clearly need to sign up to our values,\" he says, \"but I know a lot of pro-European liberal Tories. I worked with them in Coalition. I think there's huge common ground between us. I'm not saying we agree on everything, but I don't agree on everything with members of the Liberal Democrats! So we need to be a political home for the politically homeless. And that is liberals in the Tory party - pro-European liberals - and liberals in the Labour party.\"\nHe adds that his party would also welcome social democrats uncomfortable in the direction of travel of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party. \"There's a social democrat tradition in our party and if you have those views, you're a liberal, progressive, pro-European, you will find a huge warm welcome.\"\n***\nDavey has worked on a wide range of issues during his two-decades in Parliament. Many of these focus on equality. \"I had the privilege to move the amendment to get rid of Section 28,\" he recalls.\n\"I believe in equality. Period. There's no compromise. When people discriminate against any minority it offends me. The kind of transphobia we see, some of the appalling discrimination against the wider LGBT+ community... just abhorrent, but we've got lots of other things. Women are still discriminated against from period poverty to being sacked for being pregnant. We have our black and ethnic minority brothers and sisters get a rubbish time and we need to stand up for that. Just because the right-wing press screams headlines, you still stand up.\"\nEconomics and the environment are also key policy areas for Davey. In the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition he served as a junior business minister before becoming the Environment Secretary after Chris Huhne was forced to resign.\nHe notes with amazement that \"the Tories may elect someone who said 'fuck business'. I thought they were the party of business. No longer under Boris.\" Instead, he says that the Lib Dems \"will we become the natural party of business\".\n\"I'm pro-competition. I'm pro-entrepreneur. I'm pro-free trade. It is in our liberal economic agenda, but we do not think markets are there to tell us what to do, we're there, through democratic means, to shape those markets.\"\nDavey says there are lots of examples of this in action, but \"the one I'm focussing on is climate change\". \"It is absolutely outrageous that people in our country are allowed to not take account of climate change risks in their decisions. We are facing a climate emergency.\"\nThe former Environment Secretary wants to make sure \"all these institutions and corporates have to disclose both their investments in fossil fuels\".\nHe believes that \"it is completely legitimate for a democratic government that signed the Paris Climate Treaty to say to everybody, including the City, including the banks, including our oil and gas majors, including everyone, this is a decision by government, it's an international treaty obligation and everyone will play their part and that's not happening at the moment.\"\nDespite being an advocate of evidence-based policy, Davey describes himself as an \"emotional politician\". Indeed, when the conversation turns to the current situation in Hong Kong and what former Lib Dem leader Lord Paddy Ashdown, who campaigned for the rights of the Hong Kong Chinese, might think he swiftly moves the conversation on. \"I have to be careful when I talk about Paddy because I get quite emotional. He was a great liberal leader. I'm an Ashdown liberal,\" is as far as Davey will go.\nHe has also had a trying time in his personal life. He speaks movingly about the difficulties his family have faced caring for one of his sons, who is severely disable as a result of an undiagnosed neurological disorder. It was these personal and family issues that stopped him running for the party leadership in 2017, when some urged him to do so. His house at the time made caring for his son difficult and he did not want to further disrupt family life, which had already been turned upside down as a result of losing then regaining his seat in the space of two years. With some of those issues resolved, he now feels the time is right to try and lead his party.\nAfter the Lib Dems' recent success in the local and European elections, followed up in the polls, Davey thinks \"there's a big change and it's been sustained… that does reflect the big issue of the day - Brexit.\"\n\"To say that Michael Heseltine and Alastair Campbell both voted for us in elections is an astonishing thing,\" he notes.\nDavey believes that whatever the outcome in the coming months \"Brexit will remain a big issue\". He says he \"will do everything that I can in my power to stop\" Britain leaving the EU, but notes \"we've got years of negotiations whether we go with a deal or we do no deal\".\nHe thinks he is the right man to lead the opposition to Brexit. \"I would be absolutely determined that we were ready for the big time.\" Even with the Lib Dems recent success, this would be a tough ask, but if passed evidence is anything to go by, don't bet on Ed Davey giving up the fight.",

So today we are pleased to launch Open Britain, a new campaign for the best possible relationship with Europe for Britain's future.\nOpen Britain will help tackle the many unanswered questions about our future relationship with the EU, whether over funding, trade, immigration, security, the environment or workers' rights. We will also, we hope, play a part in the now necessary debate about how we make our economy fairer - arguably the most pressing issue after June 23rd.\nAnd we will do so in two ways.\nOpen Britain will be a cross-party organisation with a strong base in Parliament. Three of our leading MPs have written here about our starting point for campaigning.\nBut also, crucially, we will be a grassroots campaign, continuing in the spirit of the referendum - and we hope you will continue campaigning with us.\nWe plan to organise in every nation and region of the country as well as online - ensuring that the politicians in Westminster, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast hear your voice. You were a vital part of the Stronger In campaign and we want you to remain a vital part of Open Britain.\nWe both worked on the Stronger In campaign, gave everything over the last year to keep Britain in Europe and were devastated by the defeat. But of course we respect the result, and our role now will be to make sure Britain remains close to Europe.\nOpen Britain's Executive Directors are Joe Carberry and James McGrory and three MPs fronting its launch article in the Sunday Times are Anna Soubry, Pat McFadden and Norman Lamb:\nThose who rejected economic warnings in the referendum campaign did so because they themselves felt rejected by the political mainstream and faced an economy that was failing to spread opportunity. Inequalities in growth and living standards have been laid bare but, in our view, people didn't reject the global economy - their vote was a call to share more equally in it.\nThere is no path to prosperity that does not include competing with other major economies, integrating into global supply chains, attracting international investment and ideas or developing new sectors. Post June 23, we know that an argument for a global economy must acknowledge the limits of free trade alone to deliver higher living standards for all. An open economy must be coupled with a national strategy to deliver more equitable economic gains through regional regeneration, investment in infrastructure and far wider educational opportunities.",

Looking at my old stomping ground of Levenshulme, Manchester - the cuts beggar belief. Labour's slash and burn approach to Municipal Governance has come to the fore. Levenshulme has fought off attempts to close their swimming baths three times - now the campaigners are out in force as Labour tries again.\nA letter written by the Labour Leaders of Liverpool, Sheffield and Newcastle to the Guardian Media Group interrupted my Christmas cheer. A letter pleading poverty, claiming that the cuts they '…had to enforce' would lead to 'civil unrest'. This 'threat' garnered great publicity, job done you would assume.\nOne obvious name missing from this list was Manchester. Well done, I thought - at last a degree of maturity from a council I had previously described as 'reveling in the cuts for political gain'. This, of course was what we call a 'lay' year in the business - i.e. no elections so no political gain to be had. I was wrong, Labour in Manchester came out of the blocks in the New Year with a punishing announcement. Firstly, they were going to increase Council Tax by 3.7%, they refused £1.5m from the Government to freeze Council Tax and they were going to shut every community facility they had aspired to close and had to refuse because of short term political gain.\nThe 'lay' year was an opportunity for Labour to close the baths I learnt to swim in, close the library where I read my first book and close down a facility where John Leech scored the winning goal in a community football tournament years ago.

Put Council Tax up!\nThese next few months will give us all an opportunity to knock on doors, to speak to people.

All sounds rather familiar… for what was Sarah Olney, Richmond Park and Brexit in 2016 has echoes of Sarah Teather, Brent and Iraq in 2003.\nIn that parallel are some important lessons for the Liberal Democrats, because taking the long view back over the first decade of this century it is hard to see what the eventual electoral benefit was to the party of its distinctive and popular position on Iraq.\nPlot the graph of Liberal Democrat party membership totals, and you don't see a sustained Iraq boost. At best you can argue that a decline was halted for a couple of years. Same too for the strength of the party's local government base. Plot the proportion of councillors who were Liberal Democrat and you see a slight twitch upwards but no sustained Iraq boost, and the twitch then untwitched. Iraq occurred during a decade of flatlining in the party's local government base, with the party in 2000 having 20.07% of all councillors and in 2009 19.72%, with the peak at 21.52% in 2005. Even the 2005 general election - the party's best result in terms of seats - was followed by a widespread sense of disappointment across all parts of the party that the gains (+11) were only just in double figures.\nWhat then can the Liberal Democrats learn from this so that this time a foreign policy issue (Brexit) does turn into a sustained and significant boost for the party?\nFirst, if you want a stronger party you have to give real priority to growing membership and integrating this into all your plans. On that, signs are much more promising this time round, with recruitment plans closely integrated with wider party work - and indeed over 1,200 people joining the party since Sarah Olney's victory (many, judging by comments online, from Labour).\nSecond, national issues should lead to national campaigning. Such campaigning increases the chances of the party securing its policy objectives - and also provides the opportunity to accumulate data and email addresses about a huge extra number of people who can then be won over as regular supporters for future elections.\nBut when it came to Iraq even as simple a campaigning idea as running an online petition was vetoed from on high (I know - I was the HQ staffer suggesting one). National campaigning then was taken to mean get the party leader on the TV, have banners at one march and really not very much else.\nDuring the last Parliament, things were not much better with very little campaigning involving members to achieve national objectives in the sense that a pressure group or NGO would recognise. The jury is still out on whether the party will get that right this time - though the new Director of Campaigns is a promising sign.\nThird, national campaigning leads to attracting the support of a very disparate group of people who are massively motivated by one issue but may well not share that much with the party on other issues. In particular, Iraq led to an infusion of support which came from people who were many things but were not liberals. As I wrote in the Liberal Democrat Newswire #86, that produced a very brittle coalition of support which was bound to come unstuck at some point.\nThe lesson? You need a clear sense of what the party stands for beyond 'we disagree with the government on the big foreign policy issue of the day'. And then you need to consistently promote that to win over those who have been attracted to the party to get them to buy-in to the wider party vision too. The risk is that the party cheers the election of a Sarah, banks the goodwill, speculates about the next possible winnable by-election and thinks it just needs to continue as before.\nSuccess requires a different approach. Which of course is where my favourite core votes topic comes up… as set out in the newly updated version of the How to rebuild the Liberal Democrats pamphlet.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_the-observer-view-on-the-high-court-ruling-on-brexit-and-parliament/content_307.html": "The Observer view on the high court ruling on Brexit and parliament\nThe judgment is not about sabotaging Britain's EU exit. It's about respecting democracy and getting the best deal possible\nIt has become painfully clear since June's vote to leave the European Union that Theresa May's government and its supporters have little or no idea where the country is heading. Lacking a plan or a shared philosophy, they are united by an arbitrary and destructive rush to the exit. Their hysterical reaction to last week's unanimous high court ruling that Britain cannot quit the EU without parliament's consent also reveals extraordinary ignorance about where we, as a country, have come from. It is dismaying that those who campaigned so passionately to reclaim British sovereignty appear not to have the first idea about their country's long-established constitutional arrangements.\nIt is a fundamental principle of British democracy that parliament is sovereign. Not the government. Not the executive or a self-selecting clique within it. Certainly not this prime minister, who lacks a personal mandate. Sovereign power resides with our elected, representative parliament. This state of affairs did not come about by chance. A power struggle between the crown and its subjects raged almost unceasingly in the centuries following Magna Carta. The proposition that the monarch cannot rule without parliament's consent lay at the heart of England's serial 17th-century civil wars. The question was settled by the parliamentarians' victory at the battle of Worcester in 1651. Parliament's ascendancy was legally established in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which spawned the landmark Bill of Rights.\nIt is also a long-established fact of British constitutional life that the country's senior judges do not make domestic law. Their independent role is to interpret laws agreed by parliament, say what they mean and how and if they may be legally implemented. When Britain joined what was then the EEC, the European Communities Act, passed by parliament in 1972, incorporated many European laws into domestic law. Thus it is both illogical and ignorant to castigate the high court for doing its job and stating the constitutionally obvious: that having passed the act, only parliament can override it by consenting to activate article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.\nYet castigating the judges and by extension, anybody who has the effrontery to agree with them, is exactly what the hard Tory Brexiters and their accomplices in the lie factories of Fleet Street have resorted to with a venom, vindictiveness and vituperation remarkable even by their standards. The will of the people has been thwarted by an \"activist\" judiciary. These bewigged, closet Remainers, members of the fabled \"well-heeled liberal metropolitan elite\", are \"enemies of the people\", they shriek. Some of these sleaze-peddlers even dipped into homophobia, highlighting the sexual orientation of one of the judges. Inexcusable.\nThis is mendacious bile. It wilfully misunderstands the relationship between parliament, government and the judiciary. Partisanship is understandable, but this level of stupidity is unforgivable. It misleads and distorts - either deliberately or out of ignorance. As Hilary Benn pointed out yesterday, the high court judgment has nothing to do with defying the \"will of the people\". As he explained, \"the judgment is not to do with the fact that we will be leaving the European Union. It was a ruling on who starts the process, who fires the starting gun and in upholding the principle of parliamentary sovereignty… the judges said that since it was legislation that took us in, it should be parliament that takes the decision to start that process and not the government.\"\nOr here is Conservative MP and ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve speaking on Newsnight on Friday: \"I was horrified at the newspaper coverage, which reminded me of Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. The judges did exactly what was asked of them - they highlighted that our constitution does not allow you to overturn statute law by decree.\"\nThe judiciary are at the heart of our commitment to the rule of law and those who question their legitimacy (because they disagree with their view) threaten to undermine a critical institution vital to our democracy. Yesterday, the Bar Council took the extraordinary step of asking the lord chancellor, Liz Truss, to condemn the \"serious and unjustified\" attacks on senior judges over the Brexit court ruling. Senior judges having to appeal to the lord chancellor to defend them from unjustified attacks, in Britain, in 2016?\nSince 23 June, the country has loosed itself from tolerant, civil discourse - on both sides. The world has often looked to Britain as an example of a pluralist, inclusive democracy and a cultured, ordered and civil society. But that is changing. As the world looked at the response of politicians and the popular press to last week's court judgment, many will have concluded that it had more in common with Sisi's Egypt or Erdoğan's Turkey than the Britain they thought they knew. A country that hounds, demonises and implicitly threatens its independent judiciary is one that toys menacingly with the very tenets of democracy.\nWe noted in these columns some weeks ago that Theresa May, who coined the phrase the \"nasty party\" to describe the Conservatives some years ago, was threatening to turn Britain into the nasty country. That is increasingly the message being sent across the world. It is also the message being sent to foreigners living here, including long-resident EU nationals now afraid to speak openly for fear of rebuke or worse.\nMany more reasonable Brexit supporters have rightly distanced themselves from campaign to demonise the judges responsible for last week's ruling. But the government's ill-advised decision to appeal to the supreme court means judges sitting on England's highest bench, who will consider the matter next month, may now also be subject to overt political pressure and similarly contemptuous, intimidatory invective. In Turkey or Burundi, such tactics by the state and its surrogates might not be considered surprising. But here?\nWhat sort of country is Britain becoming that this sort of menacing behaviour is not only tolerated but implicitly encouraged by senior government ministers who fear, correctly, they are losing the argument? As has been repeated ad nauseam, the issue is not about reversing or somehow sabotaging the referendum result. It is about ensuring proper democratic scrutiny of the government's negotiating positions, about ascertaining whether its approach advances the national interest rather than sectional, business and City interests. It is about getting the best deal for Britain.\nThe concerted assault on the judiciary comes in the context of wider institutional vandalism indulged by the hard Tory Brexiters and their international sympathisers and emulators. They would recklessly tear up nearly 45 years of carefully navigated British relationships with our European neighbours. The resulting damage to the economy and living standards is mounting fast.\nMuch worse is to come. In America, Donald Trump runs a presidential campaign based on fear, prejudice, ignorance and xenophobia, which he claims represents change, not abject regression, and threatens to reject the election outcome if it goes against him. The dire cost of Trumpism to America's national unity and cohesion is already plain.\nAcross Europe, iconoclastic extremist and nationalist parties compete to demonstrate who is most intolerant, most hateful and best at scaring people. In France, their vile message may be working as presidential elections approach and the Front National gains ground. But hard Tory Brexiters do not see the link, deny any crossover, cannot understand how their institutional dumpster fire stokes nihilism and chauvinism. They dwell in their Little England bubble, detached from the real world or, as the high court said of their article 50 arguments, \"divorced from reality\". Anybody who disturbs their narrative, such as Stephen Phillips, who resigned as a Conservative MP on Friday, is shunned as a blood foe. Nick Clegg, for daring to add his voice to the democratic debate over Brexit, is ridiculed. Will these people who hound reasonable public figures ever understand what a mature democracy involves? Formidable, robust, intelligent and reasoned debate.\nAs Dominic Grieve said: \"Debate helps outcomes, suppressing it destroys it.\" Would they rather our public discourse - and hence, public life - be characterised by childish slurs, homophobia, distortions and vicious rhetoric? That is where Britain is being driven by a new hard Brexit elite.\nIt behoves any sensible, reasonable public figure to recognise that a 52-48 referendum result is one where national cohesiveness matters. And while it delivered a mandate to exit the European Union, it did not give sweeping powers to brush aside challenges on the nature, timing and texture of that exit. There is a lack of reason on both sides of this debate and there is a danger that the public fissures that have opened up since June 23rd become wider still. We all have a responsibility to ensure that does not happen. As Iain Martin says elsewhere on these pages, \"Neither set of extremists is representative of, nor has a majority in, parliament or the country. What becomes ever more apparent over Brexit is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate (of which there are many) Leavers and moderate Remainers, those who regret the result on 23 June but accept it.\"\nThe truth is, hard Tory Brexiters are fearful of losing the argument. The truth is there is little confidence that May can keep her head and rein in the irresponsible fantasies of her more wild-eyed colleagues. The truth is, May has already shown a talent for wrong-headedness, an instinct for the bad call, as seen with Hinkley Point, grammar schools, child obesity and Nissan subsidies. She appears unable to grasp the EU's blunt insistence that access to the single market cannot be divorced from freedom of movement.\nThe disdain, scepticism and bewilderment of Britain's EU partners is wounding. At last month's Brussels summit, her first, May was kept waiting until the early morning before being allowed to deliver a short statement on Brexit. She was listened to in silence. Nobody deigned to respond. On Friday, her calls to Germany's Angela Merkel and the commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, when she tried to persuade them, implausibly, that her March deadline for article 50 still stood, were embarrassingly brief. Few in Europe now believe Britain's government has a roadmap.\nIn such circumstances, it is imperative that parliament, now given its chance - and reminded of its duty - to shape Britain's future course by the high court, steps up to the mark. For too long, too many MPs who support continued EU membership (a majority overall) have been cowering in silence, fearful that any expression of unease over the Brexit process will be misrepresented as a bid to overturn the referendum result. No one disputes the result of the referendum, or the social, cultural and political tensions that delivered it, but it is right that the manner of our exit are properly scrutinised. That has yet to be decided. And parliament, rightly, has a role to play.\nTo be worthy of its sovereign status, both Houses of Parliament should now inject themselves into the Brexit process. This means cross-examining ministers and demanding a green paper on the government's plans. It means proposing alternative strategies. It means amending and, if need be, discarding wrong-headed approaches. And it means the holding of binding votes not only on when article 50 should be triggered but also on the final terms of any eventual exit agreement.\nIn short, parliament must be ready to exercise veto power over any Brexit deal that does not ultimately serve the national interest - because this government simply cannot be trusted not to deliver serious economic self-harm on the altar of blind ideology. It is a tall order. The growing prospect of an early general election, should May continue to trip, fumble and flop, presents many MPs with an existential dilemma: whether to vote with their conscience and uphold the democratic rights of parliament and their constituents or be pushed and pulled along by a populist tide, propelled by lies. Most Labour MPs, for example, represent constituencies where a majority voted Leave. It is still likely that last week's ruling proves a pyrrhic victory, by provoking an early election that, with the current dire state of the Labour party, will give May an enhanced majority. Thus, we will have a parliament with fewer teeth and providing less scrutiny or push-back than is required.\nPerhaps prodded by the shadow Brexit minister, Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, could be stirred from his lethargic ambivalence over Europe. If the Liberal Democrats and Scottish Nationalists add their voice, as Nicola Sturgeon suggests they will, in opposition to any hasty Brexit \"plan\", and if the House of Lords finds the courage, as it has in the past, to challenge unwise and overweening executive power, it is possible a sensible path forward acceptable to the country as a whole - and to Europe - can yet be found.\nLast week, independent judges courageously stood up for constitutional governance in Britain and, defying the bullies, did their job. Now parliament must follow suit.",

Liberal Democrat councillors voted against the Tory budget.\nUntil now home care has been available for people with 'Moderate' needs, but in future only those with 'Higher Moderate' needs will get care - a small change in the words, but the expected savings of £4million a year assume a big cut in the number of staff providing the service.\nPersonal Care Budgets\nThe other major change is the move, supported by all parties, to Personal Care Budgets. Instead of just having to accept what services the County is geared up to provide, elderly or disabled people will be assessed as to what they really need to continue to live safely at home.\nThey will then be allocated a budget which they can choose to use to get the care they want, either from the County or from another approved source.\nCharges\nHowever in future there will be a charge for the service of £23.90 per week, or more for those with substantial savings. The new system could help to match services to real needs. Under Labour's \"free\" service too many people did not get care when it was urgently needed, while some still received services long after the need had passed.\nBut the Tory cuts could jeopardise any benefits from the new system.",

A big foreign policy challenge for 2020, is to ensure president Trump exercises his imperial powers more like a Constantine than a Nero.\nEnter stage left, Johnson. We need our British prime minister to combine strength of character with a willingness to play the true friend to Trump. To act as a friendly check on an imperial president, facing impeachment and the electorate in the same year.\nHas the prime minister got what it takes? The evidence is not encouraging. His reputation as an incompetent foreign secretary devoid of diplomatic prowess went way beyond his shocking mishandling of the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and the Iranians.\nMoreover, Johnson's primary motivation right now is to secure a US-UK trade deal that would vindicate his Brexit experiment, regardless of the damage it will do to our family of nations. In this respect, Johnson's personal abilities and political interests do not appear to align with the British national interest: he is unlikely to be tough enough with Trump.\nThe White House knows that Johnson is desperate for a deal. In his statement after the Iranians attacked US military bases in Iraq, Trump pointedly said the United Kingdom must abandon the Iran Nuclear Treaty - a treaty signed not just by Britain, our close European allies, China and Russia, but also by the last US president, Obama. Trump's statement was nothing short of a veiled threat: if the United Kingdom maintains its own foreign policy separate to the US, we can expect to be punished with a less good trade deal.\nJohnson's own threats to rip Britain out of the EU, regardless of whether there's a deal for a future trading relationship, make us even more vulnerable to the whims of a president who bases decisions on his emotion and his ego, rather than calm reason.\nIn the face of bully-boy Trump, the Conservatives' Brexit experiment must not override open and honest cooperation with our European allies. Working with them, Britain should be a bulwark against this president's risk-taking and warmongering. We have to form part of a global Senate check to this particular imperial president.\nWhere we can find common ground with Trump, we must strengthen that cooperation. However much we disagree on his inconsistent and volatile approach to foreign policy - and especially his approach to climate change - the UK-US and EU-US relationships are vital.\nBut equally, we must stand firm and call for different policies, when Trump's actions unnecessarily increase global tension. We can, for example, demonstrate that by working constructively to engage with some brutal regimes like Iran, progress can be made. Equally, we can show that when we collectively impose effective sanctions on rogue states, that can also incentivise their leaders to act more responsibly.\nThe Liberal Democrats stood against the Iraq war and my party will oppose the escalation of conflict in Iran. We know from Iraq that the only people who would profit from a war with Iran would be arms dealers. For others affected, war means lives cut short, human suffering on a terrible scale and the flight of thousands - if not millions - of people from their homes into lives of enormous vulnerability.\nThat is why the Liberal Democrats will challenge this Conservative government to uphold the rules-based international system. Diplomacy is essential if we are to find peaceful resolutions in times of tension. Organisations like the UN - for all their faults - still represent the best path to achieving peace and security across the world, by promoting dialogue and allowing nations to work collectively to achieve particular ends. Britain must be the champion of international law.\nEd Davey is acting leader for the Liberal Democrats",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_how-to-address-concerns-about-immigration/content_226.html": "How to Address Concerns about Immigration\nEvery time I say something liberal about immigration or immigrants, people swarm to tell me that I'm being silly and idealistic and we have to respect people's genuine, legitimate concerns.\nSince they rarely say \"these are my concerns\" - there's a lot of hand-waving and a lot of pre-emptive defensiveness about how not-racist they are - it's difficult to figure out sometimes what the concerns are.\nSometimes the acceptably non-racist immigration concern is the \"drain on infrastructure,\" but the tide is already starting to shift on that one as people realize the infrastructure is underfunded by local and national governments rather than overused.\nSometimes the concern is about symbolic threats: hearing many languages on the bus, seeing a shelf of Polish food in the supermarket, Muslims celebrating their own holidays, and the general sense that the UK is not in control of its borders. That last point was made by shadow education secretary Angela Rayner as quoted by the Telegraph near the end of Labour's conference: \"Immigration is a good thing for the UK but what is not good is when people don't know about what numbers we have. I think you do have to talk about those things. People raise that on the doorstep all the time and it is important that we deal with those concerns.\"\nAnd it is certainly true that \"people don't know what numbers we have.\" According to an Ipsos Mori poll, Brits think on average that immigrants make up 24.4% of the population; in reality it's 13%.\nBut there's no indication that she addresses these concerns on the doorsteps with \"About eight million people in the UK were born outside it.\" Does she say \"About 8% of the population are not British citizens\"? Does she say \"Less than 3% are recent migrants to the UK\"? (I got all these numbers from Oxford University's Migration Observatory in a few seconds' googling; it's not difficult to find out.)\nDoes she say \"We're used to hearing about 'mass, uncontrolled' immigration but it's neither of those things? People who hear about my experiences with UK immigration are shocked at how controlled it is. The process has gotten increasingly expensive, intrusive, prolonged and stressful in recent years, to appease voters' \"concerns.\"\nBut most voters don't know about the barriers; they're unlikely to know any immigrants well enough to hear their stories firsthand (areas of lowest immigration are regularly shown to be the most \"concerned\" about it and to vote accordingly) and the media and politicians still go on about \"mass, uncontrolled immigration, so people think there's still cause for concern.\nSo the immigration controls haven't done anybody any good, and have brought misery and suffering to the lives of millions of people - and if you want to be nationalistic about it, many of those suffering people British, living with the fear or the reality of being separated from non-British spouses or children because of these immigration controls - as Tim Farron has said, three-quarters of British people cannot afford to fall in love with someone foreign.\nDoes Angela Rayner address the immigration concerns like that? Does anyone?\nThis is not a problem that can be solved by pandering to it. As the post-referendum rise in racist, xenophobic hate crimes illustrates, there are British people for whom any non-white people or speakers of languages other than English (even if they speak English as well!) are too many. This is what we as Lib Dems need to address, from policy to doorsteps.\n* Holly is an immigrant, bisexual, disabled, and probably can tick most other diversity boxes that you have handy.",

A \"blockade\" that only prevented the movement of weapons would I believe be the correct answer however I acknowledge that this could be very difficult to implement.\n5. Do you agree that we should stop trade with Israel's settlements on Palestinian land, and stop settlement goods being sold in Britain?\nDon't know. In principle I feel this could be a way to discourage illegal settlement, however I feel in practice it could be almost impossible to enforce and I am not sure that directly targeting the settlers rather than the Israeli Government is the best way to go about achieving change.\n6. Do you agree that the EU Israel Association Agreement should be suspended until Israel meets its human rights obligations?\nDon't know. In principle I feel this may be a way to persuade Israel to meet its human rights obligations however I feel that this unfairly targets large swathes of the Israeli population who are not at fault for their governments policies.\n7. Do you agree that the government should stop supplying arms to Israel until it complies with international law?\nDon't know. In principle I feel this could persuade Israel to comply more with international law, however in practice I have concerns that we would be unfairlylimiting Israel's legitimate right to defend itself, which as we are all aware has been required in the past. Additionally just the UK no longer supplying arms to Israel would not have an effect if others continued to supply them.",

Half the time since that the Party has been in Government in Westminster … and the other half seemingly dealing with the consequences.\nConstitutional changes in 2016 ended the practice of the Leader appointing different individuals to Chair separate General, Local and European campaigns and transferred the responsibility to the elected Chair of the FCEC. Expectations at the time were that my first general election campaign would be in 2020. I relished the prospect - putting into practice all the learnings from 2015 would be a substantial task - but one which the Party was more than up to. Instead of which, I have served three Leaders and overseen two general elections, each of them called at short notice and in challenging circumstances.\nThis has been a huge part of my life over the past decade. And it's now time for me to hand the baton to someone new. As things stand, it is reasonable to assume that the current Parliament will sit for its full term (possibly slightly shorter given an understandable desire to avoid a future December election). We will have a new Leader and hopefully time to operationalise and implement the learnings we will identify in the forthcoming review.\nThis is no less a challenging time to be overseeing the communications and campaigning functions of the Party than it was in 2010. While the Federal Board is the electorate, the position itself is open to all Party members.\nIt is a role that will bring you into frequent discussions with both Leader, Chief Whip and President, overseeing all federal elections and working closely with ALDC and the Parties in Wales, Scotland and England, plus responsibility for oversight of federal communications, branding and research. It works as the liaison with both Federal Policy and Federal Conference committees and plays a full role in them accordingly.\nIn what turned out to be the run up to the 2019 General Election this role was required to do face to face negotiations with other parties ahead of the Brecon & Radnorshire by-election and continued afterwards to conclude the Unite To Remain agreement with the Greens and Plaid Cymru.\nThere is rarely a dull moment, and all are essential to the way the Party fulfils its reason for being - to contest elections, increase our representation at all levels, reflect the society we serve, and to fight poverty, ignorance and conformity.\nThere's a huge number of tasks I will have left off. But if you're thinking of taking it on, then I'd be really happy to talk about what it involves in practice.\nMy final task will be to contribute to the general election review. December 2019 was a truly disappointing result and I know the review will be robust, detailed and insightful. It's crucial we learn from what went wrong, as well as what we did well. Because, as we prove week after week in local government, we can most effectively change lives for the better when we're in power.\nI have had the undoubted privilege of working with some of the best politicians, staff and activists in the country, and have been supported, motivated and challenged (in equal measure) by some of the best committee members a Party can hope to have. I'll continue to be a member of the Federal Board and look forward to playing my part in the future of our movement.\n* James Gurling is Chair of the Federal Campaigns and Elections Committee and the General Election campaign. <iframe style=\"display: none;\" title=\"Twitter settings iframe\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets/widget_iframe.4f8aea4342a4ada72cba2bdffcff6b4d.html?origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.libdemvoice.org\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><iframe id=\"google_osd_static_frame_4314223766273\" style=\"width: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;\" name=\"google_osd_static_frame\"></iframe>",

They went away and remained in opposition. Vince Cable once said that he could imagine himself becoming prime minister. Which is where that idea stayed: in his imagination. Nick Clegg did take them into government during the coalition years, an experience that ended with the Lib Dems losing all but eight of the 57 MPs they started with five years earlier.\nSo they have had fair warning about the perils of dreaming of breakthroughs. They usually don't come true. On the rare occasions when they do, the consequences for the party can be terrible. But dream they always will and never more so than now.\nJo Swinson, their new leader, calls herself \"a candidate for prime minister\". While that line rings ridiculous in non-Lib Dem ears, it generates plenty of applause from activists intoxicated by the party's recent successes and the swelling of their membership to more than 120,000. The Bournemouth conference is the most buoyant Lib Dem gathering in many a year.\nThere was an additional fillip to morale last night when they revealed another switcher from the Conservative party. Sam Gyimah, a talented minister in both the Cameron and May governments, was one of the 21 Tory MPs purged by Boris Johnson for rebelling against a no-deal Brexit. The increase in the contingent of Lib Dem MPs is the least important consequence of his switch. It is the signal that it sends to the electorate that really matters. The defection of liberal Tories such as Mr Gyimah and Sarah Wollaston sends a message to moderate Conservative voters that they ought to be making the same journey to the Lib Dems. The recruitment of Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger says to moderate Labour voters appalled by what the party has become under Jeremy Corbyn that they too can have a new home with the Lib Dems.\nOur latest Opinium poll puts the Lib Dems on a rating of 16 points; other recent polls have them at a similar level. This is not sensationally good. It is some way shy of their vote share in their best post-1945 general elections. But it is considerably better than flatlining on single figures, which is where they were less than a year ago.\nHer party's fortunes will be highly contingent on how she performs in an election campaign\nCan they translate this promising context into success when the country goes to the polling stations? A lot will depend on Ms Swinson, who might be well known among dedicated Lib Dems, but is still introducing herself to the electorate. Not yet 40, she offers some obvious differentiation to the fiftysomething and seventysomething men who lead what we used to call the two main parties. One of her colleagues calls Ms Swinson \"the wild card\" of the looming election. A senior figure on Labour's frontbench agrees, describing her as \"the unknown quantity\" among the party leaders. The voters are already well acquainted with Boris Johnson. In Jeremy Corbyn, Labour also has a highly polarising leader about whom opinions are fixed. Nigel Farage and Nicola Sturgeon don't need any further introduction. Views of these personalities may flux a bit during an election campaign, but how they are perceived is not likely to be altered fundamentally. By contrast, Ms Swinson is still a blank page as far as most of the electorate is concerned.\nHer party's fortunes will be highly contingent on how she performs in an election campaign and no one can be sure about that until she is put to the test in that hot crucible of character. Tim Farron was thought to be a good campaigner when he became Lib Dem leader, but he sank their 2017 election effort when all the party's messages were drowned out by questions about his attitudes towards gay marriage. Nick Clegg took everyone by surprise with the strength of his showing during the 2010 campaign. Hard though it is to believe now, there was a brief period when people talked about \"Cleggmania\" and one daft newspaper headline even suggested that he had become nearly as popular as Winston Churchill at the war leader's zenith\n.\nMs Swinson secured the party leadership by a large margin in July, but there is a vast difference between pleasing Lib Dem activists and connecting with the wider country. The next election will not be just about Europe. Many voters will have other issues on their minds. We don't know yet whether she has the skill to fashion an attractive pitch for her party that is broader than its opposition to Brexit. We will get some measure of whether she has what it takes from her conference speech.\nWe may also get a firmer idea about the extent of Lib Dem ambitions. Always outspent by Labour and the Tories at elections, they have a difficult choice to make about how high to aim. The cautious in their ranks argue that the party must be realistic about how many seats it can take off other parties and should concentrate its limited resources on their most plausible prospects. The bolder contend that they ought to risk spreading their resources more widely by pursuing an ambition to secure as many as 100 MPs.\nThey will need to prepare their defences against a big squeeze by the Tories and Labour. Both will try to turn the election into a binary choice between the two of them. Labour's tortured transition towards being a pro-referendum party will not be very convincing so long as its leader still refuses to say whether or not Labour is now a Remain party, but Labour hopes to recoup some of the anti-Brexit voters who have migrated away from them to the Lib Dems. Ms Swinson is responding by trying to sharpen the difference with Labour. She will ask the conference to endorse a new policy, namely that a majority Lib Dem government would reverse Brexit by revoking article 50 without another referendum. This sounds fantastical, anti-democratic and a gamble. There will be fervent Remainers who feel exceedingly queasy about overturning the 2016 referendum without holding another one.\nBoth Labour and the Tories fear a strong Lib Dem performance, but it is the Conservatives who probably have most to lose in terms of MPs. Of the Lib Dems' top 50 target seats, only seven are represented by Labour. The great majority of those target seats are Tory held.\nOne Conservative counter will be to attempt to turn the election into an extremely presidential contest, a Johnson versus Corbyn face-off, in the belief that this will best exploit the Tory leader's superior leadership ratings. The Conservatives will tell the Corbyn-averse that a vote for the Lib Dems will risk putting him into Number 10. The Lib Dems have recent experience of how damaging this can be. David Cameron cannibalised a lot of their support at the 2015 election by shivering the spines of Tory/Lib Dem swing voters with the spectre that a vote for the Lib Dems could send Ed Miliband to Downing Street at the head of \"a coalition of chaos\". That slogan has not aged well, given the mayhem that the Tories have inflicted on Britain in the years since, but fear of a repeat haunts the Lib Dems to this day. This explains why Ms Swinson is so adamantine about ruling out a post-election coalition with Labour for so long as it is led by Mr Corbyn, a man she calls \"unfit to be prime minister\". It also explains why she was so brusquely dismissive over the summer when it was suggested that the Labour leader should be made a temporary prime minister to block a no-deal Brexit. The Lib Dems have many reasons for sending a clear message that they will not ease Mr Corbyn's way into Downing Street. One of the most important is that it would set up the Tories to campaign on the slogan: \"Vote Swinson, Get Corbyn.\"\nThe latest defection to their ranks will embolden optimistic Lib Dems to think that we are on the cusp of a big realignment of our politics, the breaking of the blue-red duopoly that has controlled Britain for decades. The allegiance-smashing forces unleashed by Brexit certainly seem to have created the most promising outlook in decades. Ms Swinson likes to think so, saying that \"the faultline in British politics is no longer a left-right divide... now [it] is between liberal and authoritarian values\".\nI am old enough to recall Paddy Ashdown saying similar things back in the 1990s only for the big old beasts of blue and red to recover and reassert their dominance. The truth is we just don't know yet. That question is far too large to be answered during a few days by the seaside. What we might get is some clues about whether the Lib Dems are really up to grasping their opportunities.\n.",

This additional funding, heavily geared towards cycling, will support jobs, enhance access to employment and encourage greater use of more environmentally friendly transport.\nSustrans - the UK transport charity - will receive £8m for projects to enhance cycle routes across England. The remaining £7m will be allocated through the Cycle Rail Working Group - the body which brings together representatives of the rail industry and the cycling sector - to improve integration between cycle and rail at stations. Measures will include safer and more convenient cycle racks, additional cycle parking and storage, and better access for cyclists. This will complement the £7m that Network Rail is already spending in this area.\nLocal Transport Minister Norman Baker said:\n\"This fund underlines the firm commitment of the Coalition Government to sustainable transport\".\n\"If we are serious about reducing carbon, then we need to get more people walking and cycling. But we must do it in a way that boosts the economy\".\n\"I want this fund to support projects that create growth and tackle climate change by cutting our carbon emissions\".\n\"I look forward to seeing the projects put forward by Sustrans and the Cycle Rail Working Group and working with them to deliver transport that is greener, healthier and improves quality of life in our communities.\"\nBoth organisations will now work up the specific projects they intend to fund.

Party members are invited to attend the consultation session at party conference in Brighton, to be held on Saturday 17 September at 1pm in the Balmoral Room of the Hilton.\n1945, August 6, 8.15am. Slicing through the clear blue sky, a previously unknown \"absolute evil\" is unleashed on Hiroshima instantly searing the entire city, Koreans, Chinese, Southeast Asians, American prisoners of war, children, the elderly and other innocent people are slaughtered.

Yet those who have stuck rigidly to a policy of multilateral disarmament have not been successful in bringing about the nuclear-free world they profess to seek, and they show little sign of doing so.\nIt is my contention that British possession of nuclear weapons is immoral and that the UK should be leading by example in scrapping Trident and not replacing it with nuclear alternatives.\nNothing I have heard or read during the meetings of the Nuclear Weapons Policy Working Group has convinced me otherwise.\nBritain has only 1% of the world's nuclear weapons, yet our government pretends it is one of the big boys in the nuclear playground and that our nuclear weapons give us some sort of special leverage.\nThe evidence to back that claim is not convincing.\nI recall the former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Carver asking the question \"Trident? What the bloody hell is it for?\"\nTim Farron and others have referred to it as \"a relic of the cold war\". So why on Earth are we even considering the possibility of spending, maybe, up to £200billion on it in future?\nThe savings from moving to a part-time fleet, the party's current policy, are said to be not that significant in the scheme of things.\nFormer Defence Secretary Michael Portillo said Trident is \"completely past its sell by date\", and he is right.\nWith new technologies becoming available, Trident is increasingly likely to become vulnerable to cyber-attacks and drones, making it even more of a white elephant.\nOf the five options suggested in the Nuclear Weapons Policy Consultation Paper, two relate to Trident and one relates to free-fall nuclear bombs (which to my mind conjures up images from the Doctor Strangelove movie). The aircraft and the bombs they would carry are vulnerable to being \"taken-out\" before reaching their target. The paper notes: \"in all likelihood there would not be significant savings because of the cost of developing a new platform\".\nOf the remaining two options, one is \"Virtual Capability\". There are questions as to whether there would be sufficient warning of need to move to production and operational training. Such a policy could also send wrong signals at a time of international tension in the future.\nWhich leaves us with just one option \"The Zero Option\" of cancelling the Successor submarine programme and retiring the existing Vanguard fleet.\nIt is the option that I recommend.

The former Liberal Democrat leader has teamed up with his old political rival, Ed Miliband, and a small but significant group of Tory Remainers, to lead the call for there to be full parliamentary scrutiny of the government's Brexit plan. Last week, he found himself resoundingly cheered from the Labour benches as he demanded to know how the government could claim the right to know what Brexit means.\nDuring the parliamentary debate on Brexit he went further, effectively accusing the Prime Minister of hypocrisy over her reluctance to allow parliamentary scrutiny, in an impressive speech which won plaudits from the twitterati.\nAs the former Deputy Prime Minister, Clegg understands the inner-workings of both the Tory party and Whitehall better than most politicians. He also has a firm grip on the intricacies of Brussels bureaucracy. Before becoming an MEP in 1999, he worked as European Commission trade negotiator.\nNow the Brexit spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, he has been pushing the government to allow MPs a vote before Article 50 is triggered. The government has conceded a debate, but not a formal vote. Clegg says Theresa May and Brexit Secretary David Davis' position is \"based on multiple fallacies\".\nFreed from the shackles of government, Clegg's frustration with his former coalition partners is clear. He criticises May's leadership style, accusing the Prime Minister of preferring to operate behind closed doors.\n\"She is treating parliament much the same as she treated the Home Office . . . it has a particular culture in the government system, it relies on secrecy and does not welcome scrutiny. A strong home secretary, as she was, therefore tends to adopt quite a 'command and control' way of running things, but that is not the right approach for something as important and complex as Brexit,\" he said.\nClegg attacks the notion that the government thinks it has a mandate to impose whatever version of Brexit it chooses on the British public, including the 48 per cent who voted to stay in the EU. \"The government thinks the terms of our exit are nothing more than a technical negotiating matter, when in reality they are of a profound constitutional significance,\" he says. \"Decisions such as whether you stay in the single market are not negotiating chips to be kept close to the government's chest.\"\nBut is this all sour grapes? Are Clegg and his europhile friends merely struggling to accept the referendum result and denying the democratic will of the British people? \"That's absurd,\" snorts Clegg. His aim, and that of his cohorts, is not to \"in any shape or form\" seek to rerun the referendum, but rather to enforce accountability over a hugely important constitutional decision. He lays the blame for what he calls \"this sputtering nonsense\" firmly at the door of \"people such as Iain Duncan Smith and the more frothy Tory press like the Daily Mail\".\nThese hardcore Brexiteers are lashing out, in his view, because the false promises made during the Leave campaign are coming back to haunt them. Nobody talks anymore about funding the NHS out of our contribution to the EU budget (the much-discussed £350m figure) or the perceived threat of Turkey's potential EU membership.\n\"There was a dark cynicism in their [the Leave campaigners'] pitch to the British people - they persuaded people to take a leap of faith out of the EU and withheld their views about what this would mean in practice.\"\nHe mocks the notion that the Brexit negotiations need to be kept under wraps in order not to prejudice any potential deal with the EU. \"The Brexiteers sound like the agents of a Premier League footballer that they are trying to flog to another club. It's not like that . . . It's hugely important that the early signals from Theresa May assert her view of what she thinks is in the national interest, but they also need to be politically intelligent in terms of how they are perceived across the continent.\"\nClegg, who is a multi-linguist, confesses to a \"geeky interest\" in perusing the European press. His verdict is that the continent is currently looking at post-Brexit Britain with a mix of shock and bewilderment. \"In France, Germany and Spain, the newspapers are not currently writing about David Davis' clever negotiating tactics, they are saying 'why on earth is there this outburst of apparent xenophobia in Britain's public and political debate?'\n\"I wonder if David Davis has been spending too much time with Liam Fox, who, notably among the Three Brexiteers, does seem to operate on his own planet where Britain rules the seas, and we can rattle our sabre and all those pesky foreigners will fall in line,\" he says. \"It is astonishing to see British Tories who are prepared to ignore economics in favour of their own political fixations, who do not seem to understand that for other European leaders the same rules apply.\"\nClegg has previously voiced the hope that a botched attempt at hard Brexit might trigger a desire for an alternative to Tory rule among the British people. For him personally, Brexit is the perfect issue upon which to position himself as a voice of reason. He has the experience, the gravitas and the passion to help win back some of the political credibility he lost during the dark days of the coalition and the tuition fees debacle. Whether he can ever fully lose the traitor tag remains to be seen, but his intervention on Brexit will be welcome among the 16.1 million people who didn't vote for any kind of Brexit, let alone a hard one.",

If you want an exhibition stand in a plum spot you'll pay anything up to £27,500. And, according to press reports, you'll need to cough up more than £3,000 to rub shoulders very briefly over lunch with national luminaries such as Liam Fox, Chris Grayling or even Theresa May herself.\nWelcome to the great love-in between British business and the Conservative Party, which will be on ample - and expensive - display this week at the party conference in Birmingham.\nI do not disapprove of businesses paying to participate in party conference events - indeed, I encouraged it when I was leader of my own party. Nor do I begrudge the Conservatives for raising their price tag to get as much into their party coffers as possible. As long as we're stuck with our opaque party funding rules - the reform of which has been repeatedly blocked by both the Conservative and Labour parties - it's just the way of the world.\nNo, my big query about the huge financial donations provided by British businesses to the Conservative Party is not based on sanctimony but simply this: why are businesses supporting a party which now poses such a serious threat to the long-term health of the British economy?\nMay's party is now poised to inflict more damage on the British economy in one Parliament than John McDonnell could manage in a decade.\nThe evidence accumulates by the day: just this week the Conservatives announced a sweeping increase in business rates for many high-street companies, especially in London, having buried the business rate review initiated by Danny Alexander in the last Government. The Financial Times has reported that the Government is poised to decide in favour of Heathrow expansion but will then, weirdly, refuse to advocate it in Parliament, preferring the lottery of a free vote instead. Since when was building a runway equivalent to matters of conscience such as abortion or war, the subjects normally reserved for free votes? And Government ministers have pretty well confirmed that they've given up seeking to protect the \"passporting\" rights of the City of London in the EU's Single Market when we quit the EU.\nA Government that whacks up London business rates, fudges airport expansion again (Gatwick, incidentally, remains by far the most deliverable option) and kicks the financial sector - which has provided it with most of its donations - in the shins is not, you would have thought, a natural \"party of business\". And yet the longstanding cultural affinity between the boardroom and the Conservative Party lives on. Politics, I've discovered over the years, is not an especially logical process. People often vote for parties which do not necessarily help their own interests. Many people vote for social reasons - the feeling of being \"one of us\" is a powerful lure at election time. If you live in a commercial milieu for which voting Conservative is second nature, it's difficult to break the habit of a lifetime.\nAnd yet I have had many conversations with lifelong, mainstream Conservative voters in recent months which suggest to me that things are beginning to change.\nInterestingly, the early signs started well before the EU referendum. When George Osborne failed to get his budgets through Parliament - not just once but twice - serious doubts first emerged. In most mature democracies, when a Government can't pass a budget, it falls and elections are held. The fact that Cameron and Osborne managed to mess up so badly on two occasions shook the confidence of serious-minded business people in the City and beyond.\nThe patently daft economics of the Conservative Party manifesto last year didn't help either. There isn't a serious economist in the land who believes that there should be a blanket prohibition against the Government borrowing to fund housing and infrastructure projects, even though there is a strong case to be more wary of borrowing to fund day-to-day spending. Osborne relished his hardline \"no borrowing for anything\" stance in the general election - even as Government borrowing went up - as a contrast to both the Labour and Lib-Dem plans. It may have worked as a campaign tactic but it was rotten economics - and serious business people who know the value of quality transport, energy and telecoms infrastructure saw right through it.\nSo the Brexit referendum - triggered not because of an overwhelming public clamour but because of the Conservative Party's all-consuming obsession about Europe - is only the latest, if most significant, instalment in an increasingly business-unfriendly approach from the Conservatives. It is a sign of how much things have changed that Philip Hammond, who in Coalition was often the first to chip in during Cabinet discussions with some glib anti-European remark, is now regarded as a lone voice of sanity against \"hard\" Brexiteers such as Liam Fox and David Davis.\nBusiness people look on aghast as Brexit hardliners in the Government gain the upper hand - as confirmed in Theresa May's announcement yesterday that she will end Britain's continued membership of the EU's Single Market altogether (we can't be part of a market the rules of which we will refuse to abide by).\nOf the many Brexit voters I spoke to during the referendum campaign not one of them said they were voting Leave because they wanted to cut the City of London off from the continent and impose a raft of new border checks on all British exporters trading with the EU. Yet that is exactly the fate that now awaits us.\nThe Conservatives are now the party of 19th-century parliamentary nostalgia - not the party of 21st-century business.",

A combination of the rising national Liberal vote, a lot of outside help including Manchester students and YLs, and Dennis's personal charisma and campaigning energy produced a Liberal vote of 30.5%, narrowly third but up by more than 10% from the General election in 1959. He contested the seat at the following three General Elections, polling well but never as well as at the by-election.\nIn 1964 the Labour candidate was the subsequent Liberal Democrat peer and Lords Chief Whip John Roper. The story that both of them told is (from Dennis) \"Of course I was able to preach in every chapel in the constituency\" with the riposte from John \"Yes but I drank in every pub!\" Unfortunately neither won that year.\nTogether with the likes of Alan Share, Terry Maher, Mary Mason and Muriel Burton, Dennis was one of the team who made the Manchester Young Liberal Organisation a power in the party and the spearhead of Liberal revival in Greater Manchester, all of them going on to fight constituencies in the 1960s. They went on to play a key part in another significant body in promoting a North West Liberal revival, the regional candidates association, together with the likes of Geoff Tordoff, and Merseyside's Cyril Carr and Gruffydd Evans.\nDennis's very specific input came with Northern Radical Publications. This was a publishing outfit run from his home in Flixton in response to the perceived failure of the national Liberal party to produce good campaigning literature. Their distinctive crimson-red and black leaflets and pamphlets with their punchy style featured in many a local Liberal campaign in the region. In 1970 Dennis wrote a Liberal Publications Department pamphlet \"A Realistic Approach to Transport\" with a young Andrew George.\nDennis was always a committed evangelical Christian and after the disappointing 1970 election he gave up on party politics and devoted his life to his Christian zeal, founding and running the Maranatha Community. This formed his main life's work as he rather wrote out his previous Liberal party activities. But he never gave up local campaigning, co-ordinating a mass campaign in Trafford on the rates support grant formula, pressing for the Flixton motorway spur road and against the stenches from the Davyhulme sewage works, among many other local causes including most recently action against the proposal to build a Biomass Incinerator in the Urmston and Flixton area.\nI met Dennis on a couple of occasions when he came to lobby the Lords on behalf of various Christian campaigns. It was a privilege to talk again to a person who half a century ago had been such a campaigning inspiration to a generation of new Liberal activists in and around Manchester. Our thoughts are now with his wife Sheila and their family.",

Writing for The Times, he in particular highlights the damage that leaving the single market will do to Britain:\n\"In 1993 I was minister responsible for the UK's trade policy when the single market - a British idea - came into effect. The Common Market had already done away with tariffs. The single market accelerated exchange, as well as growth, by harmonising rules and regulations, making it possible for a lorry to load in Birmingham and transport goods to Berlin, Bucharest or Barcelona - and likewise for goods to reach the UK.\n\"Trade within the single market removed the need to fill in forms and removed checks at borders, which result in delays and higher costs. It is estimated that membership of the single market saves British businesses from filling in three million forms a year…\n\"The recklessness of the aims of those seeking a hard or no-deal Brexit, combined with fiscal irresponsibility, a lack of honesty about the implications for workers and jobs in the UK, and a disregard for truth and accuracy displayed by the prime minister and some of those around him have led me to conclude, reluctantly, that I cannot support the Conservative Party at this election\".\nAs resident in the Kensington constituency, he will therefore be voting for Sam Gyimah.\nTim Sainsbury was the Member of Parliament for Hove 1973-1997, beating later Liberal Party President Des Wilson in that 1973 by-election.

He had been a New Mills Town councillor and a High Peak Borough Councillor where he gained the respect of all his colleagues from all parties as a sensible and hard-working man.\nAs well as serving in office, he walked miles delivering leaflets and knocking on doors for the Libdem cause, and served on the Executive Committee for many years.\nHe was extremely loyal to the party despite having a few reservations about some of our policies but remarked that no other party would suit him better.\nHe threw himself into the local community, giving his spare time to the local Volunteer Centre and the Heritage Centre.\nIn his later years he suffered a variety of health issues but even so managed to attend several local functions including the talk with Nick Clegg in Buxton in 2017.

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_reversing-conservative-cuts-remains-the-big-social-security-challenge/content_180.html": "Reversing Conservative cuts remains the big social security challenge\nThe conference policy paper on \"Mending the Safety Net\" contains lots of good stuff on a wide range of welfare policy, even if I say so as a member of its working group. But, at Conference and beyond, I think it's important not to get distracted from the big issue of the £13bn of cuts planned by the Conservatives. Reversing these - and indeed going further - is what will make the biggest difference to people's lives, to UK inequality and even to the economy (and hopefully win a few votes in the process). Within this, here are three goals that the party should be fighting for.\nIncreasing working-age benefits in line with inflation - and ultimately earnings\nGeorge Osborne announced that most non-pensioner benefits would be frozen at their 2015 levels for 4 more years. Even before the Brexit vote, this was expected to be a massive drag on living standards. But inflation over the next few years is now expected to be higher than previously predicted - driven by rising import prices due to the weaker pound - and unemployment is predicted to rise too. This means the freeze will be even harsher than Osborne intended. And if the economy at any point needs a boost through fiscal policy, cutting the incomes of poorer households would be just about the worst policy you can think of, as The Economist recently noted.\nSo the party should be pressuring the new Chancellor to scrap the freeze and increase working-age benefits in line with inflation. But the policy paper goes further and argues that benefits should ultimately rise in line with average earnings - alongside a return to some form of housing cost link for Housing Benefit (soon to be part of UC). This would help ensure that when the economy and tax receipts are growing, everyone shares in that and inequality doesn't widen. It may sound boring, but choices about benefit uprating in the long-term can compound to be more important than almost any other welfare or tax choice for poverty and inequality.\nAvoiding the return of the tax credit cuts through Universal Credit\nAnother big part of the £13bn cuts was a slashing of the amount people can earn before their benefits start to be reduced. These tax credit cuts - averaging over £1,000 a year for 3 million families - were cancelled in the short term. But we can't forget that they are still being rolled out as part of Universal Credit. UC itself is a good thing - 6 benefits rolled into 1, and created under the Coalition - but post-election it's now less generous than the system it's replacing. Lib Dems must continue to fight these cuts for parents and disabled people, which will both hold back living standards for years to come and reduce the incentive to work. The way UC is being slowly rolled out across the country in a postcode lottery (while sensible in itself) may even lend itself to sustained, aggressive campaigning. Why are new parents on low incomes in Lancaster & Morecambe, for example, now eligible for less basic support than identical claimants in most other parts of the country?\nOur welfare paper also builds on this by calling for a new allowance in UC for second earners. At present, second earners can lose 65p in benefits for every £1 they earn. On top of childcare, taxes and other costs, this can mean it's not worth working. A second earner work allowance would reduce this barrier to mothers (and fathers) working. The paper also calls for the work allowance to be increased whenever income tax or National Insurance allowances are increased in future, to ensure those tax cuts aren't snatched back from poorer households through means-testing.\nStop child poverty rising\nAll these policies would be a great help for parents. But there's more to be done to ensure no child's development is held back by poverty. Another Conservative cut is to scrap the basic amount that goes to low income parents, regardless of the number of children: the Lib Dems would reverse this. What's more, we would go further and increase this amount by an extra £5 per week.\nThen there's the limiting of support for families with more than 2 children: the policy group decided that it's wrong to hold back support for a child based only on the number of siblings they have. Child poverty is currently set to rise under Theresa May, and the Lib Dem message must be that this is unacceptable and that there is an alternative.\nConclusion\nThese policies are costly but - although our paper includes some offsetting cuts such as ending the marriage tax allowance - Lib Dem policy has always been clear that we never signed up to Osborne's tighter fiscal rule, which the new government has reportedly abandoned in any case.\nFull or partial government U-turns on many of these policies are quite possible, and the Lib Dems would not be campaigning alone (the JRF's new anti-poverty strategy has a lot of overlap with the above, for example). Each campaigning victory would make a big difference to millions of low and middle income families. And each defeat would work against the Tory attempt to appear \"One Nation\" and \"driven not by the interests of the privileged few\", with poorer families' incomes falling or stagnating due to their cuts.\nSo, that's my plea for the above Lib Dem policies to be a priority, and to ensure that neither Lib Dem nor national welfare policy discussion get too distracted by shiny baubles or relatively minor issues. These are the overwhelming welfare challenges for this parliament, where big but sensible change is now distinctly achievable in Westminster, politically useful on the doorstep, and desperately needed in homes across the country.\n* Adam Corlett is an economic analyst and Lib Dem member\nReversing Conservative cuts remains the big social security challenge",

In the first six months of 2018, Remain was ahead by 52 to 48, for the rest of the year by 53 to 47.\nThis lead grew to 54 to 46 in the first six months of 2019, with the gap narrowing slightly afterwards to 53 to 47.\nThe findings came as the People's Vote campaign for a second referendum announced more details of its \"Together for the Final Say\" march on Saturday, October 19.\nBoris Johnson has vowed that the UK will splinter away \"do or die\" by October 31.\nHowever, Tottenham Labour MP David Lammy said: \"Confronted with the reality of Boris Johnson's destructive Brexit, more voters than ever before now say that the only way to solve this mess is to put the question back to the people.\"\nWith growing signs that no new Brexit agreement will be struck between the EU and the Government, the People's Vote campaign also highlighted its latest poll, by YouGov, which showed that if there is a second referendum with the choice between Remain or quitting with \"No Deal\", the staying-in option wins by 55 per cent to 45 per cent.\nThe poll-of-polls compiled results from four trend questions on Professor Sir John Curtice's whatUKthinks website including: \"If there was another referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, how would you vote?\", \"If there was a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, how would you vote?\", \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union, or leave the European Union?\" and \"In hindsight, do you think Britain was right or wrong to vote to leave the European Union?\"\nThe results suggest Remain would win a second referendum, but Leave could clinch it given the narrow gap, especially if it ran a better campaign as last time and got supporters out to vote in greater numbers.\nJeremy Corbyn's unpopularity among many voters, as well as parties' policies on domestic issues like the NHS.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_federal-conference-agenda-2020-the-final-stage/content_179.html": "Federal Conference - Agenda 2020: The final stage\nSunday morning at Brighton will see one of the most important debates at conference. It probably won't be terribly controversial (though one never knows …), but it is party members' chance to say what they think - not about specific policies the party should adopt, but about what the party stands for: its basic philosophy.\nThis is the final stage in the Federal Policy Committee's 'Agenda 2020' process, which has featured many times before in the pages of Lib Dem Voice. Over the past year we have published two consultation papers, organised two consultative sessions at federal conferences, commissioned a set of essays and organised an essay competition within the party (all available here at www.libdems.org.uk/agenda2020).\nThe outcome of all this is the policy paper The Opportunity to Succeed, the Power to Change. Its first purpose is to explain the basic underlying beliefs of the party and what, in broad terms, is the point of us. So the first main chapter sets out the case for the Liberal Democrats - the essence of what we are trying to do and why it matters. We've phrased this round two objectives: giving people the opportunity to succeed, and enabling them to take the power to grasp those opportunities. Too many people in today's Britain lack the opportunity to live their lives as they want, and too many people feel powerless in the face of change.\nThis basic approach is underpinned by the last chapter, which describes the Liberal Democrats' underlying philosophy - our core beliefs and values - in more detail. Readers of the previous Agenda 2020 consultation papers will be familiar with this, as we've reprinted it from them, modified to reflect the responses we received during the consultation process.\nThe rest of the paper then describes the agenda for policy development which the FPC will follow in the next few years, in the run-up to the 2020 general election: finding Britain's place in the world, in the wake of the EU referendum; modernising the economy; enlarging liberty; building a fair and cohesive society; and promoting communities. Each chapter identifies a number of topics where our existing policy is out of date or no longer fit for purpose and where the FPC will be submitting policy papers to conference to debate.\nThey don't cover every possible policy area - there is a limit to how many policy papers we can produce and conference can debate! - but of course party policy is not solely our preserve. We want to see party spokespeople, local parties and ordinary party members develop new ideas, discuss them within the party and submit them to conference for debate.\nI hope people will take the chance to read the paper; particularly for those new to the party, it offers a concise description of what the party they've joined is all about. And I hope those of you in Brighton will take the chance to speak in the debate on the paper (it starts at 9.45am on Sunday). It'll be a bit different from other debates during the week, because it won't be about particular policy proposals. It'll be about what is in some ways more important: what ties our policy proposals together into a coherent whole.\n* Duncan Brack is the Editor of the Journal of Liberal History and Vice Chair of the Federal Policy Committee.",

Mr Verhofstadt was given the role of negotiator by the leaders of the main party blocs in parliament.\nAn EU official close to Mr Verhofstadt said the former Belgian leader \"will be in the room, as he was in December when he was renegotiating the terms of British [EU] membership with [ex-UK PM] David Cameron\".\n\"He'll report back to the political group leaders in parliament and feed the parliament's position into the negotiations. He'll be in the room with the [European] Council and [European] Commission,\" he told the BBC.\nThe Council - representing the other 27 EU governments - and the Commission, which enforces EU treaties, share power with the parliament. But the Council and Commission are expected to have the most muscle in the Brexit talks.\nAlyn Smith MEP of the Scottish National Party (SNP) welcomed Mr Verhofstadt's new role. The Leave vote was 52% overall, but in Scotland 62% voted Remain - and Mr Verhofstadt believes Scotland has a right to stay in the EU.\nIn July Mr Verhofstadt scorned the Council's reaction to Brexit, saying it was not good enough to \"just implement existing European policies\".\n\"I find this shocking and irresponsible,\" he said.\n\"What are you waiting for? When will the Council recognise that this type of EU - you cannot defend it any more. Europe needs to be reformed... European citizens are not against Europe, they're against this Europe.\"\nAnti-UKIP\nFor years there has been friction between Mr Verhofstadt and Eurosceptic British politicians, especially the UK Independence Party (UKIP).\nAfter the Brexit vote on 23 June he condemned the \"absolute negative campaign\" and \"lies\" in the UK. He said the UKIP poster showing a crowd of refugees was \"like in Nazi propaganda\".\nBack in 2004 the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair - staunchly pro-EU - blocked Mr Verhofstadt's bid to become European Commission president.\nIn the end, Jose Manuel Barroso was chosen, despite Franco-German backing for Mr Verhofstadt.\nVincenzo Scarpetta of the Open Europe think-tank says he expects Mr Verhofstadt to be \"particularly intransigent when it comes to splitting the EU's so-called 'four freedoms' - that is, the free movement of goods, services, capital and people\".\nThe Belgian politician is likely to take a \"tough stance\" as a \"staunch federalist\", he said.\nBut he added: \"Given the more limited role of the European Parliament, its impact on the upcoming Brexit talks should not be overstated.\"\nAccording to the SNP's Alyn Smith, Mr Verhofstadt's long experience of partisan Belgian politics means \"he will be able to corral 27 national interests and be pragmatic about finding solutions\".\n\"He has also proven he is alive to the Scottish question and I have every confidence all the doors we need are open,\" he said.\nGuy Verhofstadt - campaigner for 'more Europe'\n- Leader of liberal group ALDE in European Parliament (67 seats - fourth-largest group)\n- Served as Belgian prime minister from 1999 to 2008\n- He cut Belgian taxes on individuals and businesses\n- Wants a more ambitious EU, to develop energy infrastructure, banking union, investment and labour mobility",

But rather than voting for our amendment, Conservative MPs are willing to let ministers negotiate away our membership of Erasmus if they think they could do a better job.\n\"It is time the Tories wake up and smell the coffee - are they in favour of staying in Erasmus or not? Liberal Democrats will fight to stop the Tories taking us out of vital EU programmes, weakening our universities and limiting the horizons of young people.\"\nMr Skidmore dismissed Wednesday's amendment as \"game-playing by opposition parties\", insisting that the UK remains \"open\" to continued participation in the scheme, subject to negotiations with the remaining EU states.\nAnd the Department for Education said that the government was \"committed to continuing the academic relationship between the UK and the EU, including through the next Erasmus+ programme if it is in our interests to do so\".\nBut the international director of the Association of Colleges, Emma Meredith, said: \"Erasmus+ is a brilliant programme for opening up the world for young people and helping show people from across Europe that the UK is open to them.\n\"UK colleges will still be able to apply for Erasmus+ funding in 2020 during the 'transition period'. There is a definite risk that UK participation could stop in 2021, or that Erasmus+ could be replaced by another mobility programme.\"\nMs Meredith said the AoC remained \"optimistic\" that securing continued access to Erasmus+ would be high on the UK's priority list for negotiations on the future partnership with the EU, which will begin after the official date of Brexit on 31 January and are due to conclude at the end of this year.\nJo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: \"Wilfully abandoning Erasmus+ would be a worryingly closed-minded move. The many benefits from having the opportunity to study abroad - from boosting employment prospects, to learning other languages and from other cultures - are well documented.\"\nAnd the director of the Erasmus+ programme in the UK, Jane Racz, said: \"The Erasmus+ programme has delivered and continues to deliver significant benefits to the UK and we need to ensure the positives of the programme are not lost as we move into the next stage\".\nSupporters of Erasmus+ expressed their anger on Twitter, where former student Josh Aarons said: \"As someone from a working class background who studied and worked in Germany and Spain as part of my degree placement, who greatly benefited both educationally and culturally from Erasmus+, it is a crying shame that we cut off from a mutually beneficial exchange.\"\nSheffield Hallam University lecturer Steph Hannam-Swain said: \"This is such a loss! We have some amazing Erasmus+ students each year who bring richness to our classes.\"\nAnd charity worker Ashley Thompson said: \"This is awful. These students have an amazing impact on our organisation and have so much to offer. Failing to continue with Erasmus+ programme will hurt British business now. It denies future generations an amazing opportunity.\"",

(Side-note: I'm standing. Votes, however innovative or traditional, most welcome.)\nThe online system developed by party HQ takes members through checking and updating the party's information about them (if they wish) as part of the voting process.\nThat is smart - because it means all the efforts going into getting members to look at the voting information also is driving people towards checking and updating their data.\nIt's necessary - because member data is hugely valuable, frequently changing and not perfect.\nIt's also a good nod to the future - because if the technology works well, it should be reusable for other party contests in the future. Roll round, for example, one-member one-vote elections for English regional parties and not only do you get another round of data cleaning, but for those regional parties the elections are cheaper and easier to administer. Everyone gains, including members who end up better communicated with thanks to better data.\nHaving one shared system also helps address one of the major drawbacks with online voting. In public elections such systems get used so relatively rarely that the setup and configuration effort each time introduces significant risks of getting something wrong. Getting a system up and running to a high quality for a continuous service is much less risky than setting up, closing down and mothballing for long periods a system. There is an initial learning curve in both cases, but continual learning and reminding of what needs doing works better than use, forget and try again.\nNice move, HQ team.",

However, as I pointed out for the 2010 general election:\nAround 576,00 Daily Mail readers voted Liberal Democrat in 2010, a number only topped by the 796,000 or so Sun readers who voted Liberal Democrat. That Daily Mail figure is more than the equivalent figures for The Guardian and The Independent put together.\nBut that was 2010 and that was print readership. What about 2015 and overall readership, including online?\nHere is what Liberal Democrat votes in 2015 were reading:*\n- The Guardian: 745,000\n- The Independent / i: 629,000\n- Daily Mail: 605,000\n- The Times: 501,000\n- The Telegraph: 489,000\n- The Sun: 391,000\n- The Mirror: 354,000\n- The Express: 199,000\n- The Star: 81,000\nYou may also notice just what a large number these figures add up to - a notch under 4 million compared with just under 2.5 million actual Liberal Democrat votes in 2015. Two factors inflate the figures above. Voters may read zero, one or more newspapers. In addition the definition of 'readership' includes some people who are not able to vote. However the net impact of both of these factors is to still leave the relative figures meaningful. They also mean that there is a good chunk of voters - and all the more so households - where readership of newspapers is more than just those top two titles.\nOverall, the figures are quite a change from the 2010 numbers quoted above (and previous general elections). There is much of a 'Lib Dem cliche' of Guardian and Independent voters. The big online successes of both are part of the story. As is The Sun having such a low relative online readership due to its (disappearing) paywall.\nYet it still leaves the combined Mail, Sun and Express total at just under 90% of the Guardian and Independent total. So as a rough rule of thumb, you can say that for every Lib Dem voter who is a reader of these latter two, there is nearly one other is a reader of the former trio.**\nOr, if you are a Liberal Democrat campaigner and want to understand the world view of a large proportion of Liberal Democrat voters (let alone the wider electorate), making a badge of honour of not reading the Mail, Sun or Express is about as wise as being a sailor who disdains wanting to know about tides, winds or coastlines.\nYou can do that, but it doesn't make you an admirable sailor. It makes you a bad sailor.\n* Data sources: voting intention by newspaper readership is taken from YouGov's poll of 100,000 people conducted May 6-18 2015 (a large enough sample to allow this sort of breakdown). Newspaper readership is taken from Newsworks, using figures for combined online and print readership in the UK in June 2016.\n** The potential Liberal Democrat core vote which David Howarth and I argue the party should target is much more heavily weighted towards Guardian and Independent readers. In this group the ratio is 3:1, but even so the Guardian and Independent readers are very much in the minority overall. See footnote 21 in our pamphlet for more detail. Plus, as we point out in that pamphlet such a core vote is a jumping off point to building a broader coalition to win under first past the post in many elections.

From 2010 (when I arrived) until 2017, the commons went into recess for the party conferences from mid-September until the beginning of October. There never would have been any question of this recess not happening under a majority government with the votes to pass a motion allowing it to take place. That is not the case now.\nThe Tories are now 43 seats short of a majority, so when they sought a three-day recess for their conference this week, there were more than enough MPs to defeat them. Having sought to unlawfully shut down parliament altogether with their attempt at prorogation, now ruled null and void by the Supreme Court, opposition MPs were in no mood to cede to this request.\nConsider that for a minute. The idea of prime ministers Blair, Brown, Cameron or even May not being able to dictate the sitting dates of parliament would have been unthinkable. But this week, the prime minister will give his main speech to the Conservative Party faithful whilst the commons is in session. Under Boris Johnson, the extraordinary has become ordinary.\nTake the week of 19 October 2015. On the Monday was the second reading of the Psychoactive Substances Bill; on the Tuesday there was an opposition day debate on tax credits; on the Wednesday were both Prime Minister's Questions and the committee stage of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill; on the Thursday was a motion on English Votes for English Laws, and on the Friday consideration of private member's bills. This was a fairly typical schedule during normal times.\nFast-forward to September 2019. At present, hardly any legislation is being put forward by the government at all for fear that it may be amended in a way which would stop the government pursuing its Brexit policy - an extreme agenda for which it cannot command a majority, and for which it has no mandate from the electorate.\nBut in another extraordinary development, that doesn't mean the executive is in full control. Whereas the government used to exclusively control the Order Paper - that is, the business of the house - a coalition of opposition parties and independents (including those who have left or been ejected from the Tory party) can take over the Order Paper and provide for whatever business we wish when we want.\nThis is what happened with the Benn Act. Opposition parties and ex-Tories took over the Order Paper, provided time for consideration of the bill and passed into law. That law now requires the prime minister to send a letter to the EU Council requesting an extension of the Article 50 process if we are heading into a \"no deal\" Brexit on 31 October. It is unheard of for the government not to be in control of the business of the house, or for any law to pass without its consent in this way. This. Is. Not. Normal.\nThere have been no opposition day debates since Johnson took office, in part because these debates can be used by opposition parties to pass motions forcing ministers to do things they would rather not do. Again, the opposition is usually in a minority, but with the support of others, it can now command a majority against the government.\nIn November 2018, the official opposition (then as now Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party) used an opposition debate to pass a motion forcing the government to publish secret legal advice around its Brexit plans. Opposition parties did something similar earlier this month when we passed a motion forcing the government to publish documents from its no-deal planning operation, Project Yellowhammer, outlining the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit would have on the country. It is worth noting that Johnson has yet to win a single vote in the commons; he was defeated three times on 4 September alone.\nPrime Minister's Questions and the specific commons statements the PM gives after EU summits, Nato and G7 gatherings usually see a full chamber and rigorous debate between the two main party leaders. But the exchanges between Johnson and Corbyn have been a terrible advert for our democracy. In contrast with their predecessors, neither is on top of the detail or up to the job, The level of debate is rarely worth watching or listening to, so much so that many MPs simply don't bother to attend these \"battles\" between two utterly sub-standard leaders. These jousts have become a circus.\nAmidst this storm, it is vital that the commons does all it can to ensure that not just the letter but the spirit of the Benn Act is complied with, safeguarding our country against a catastrophic no-deal Brexit. This is very much the priority for the Liberal Democrats. Yet once an extension to Article 50 has been secured and a no-deal Brexit has been averted in the short term, it's hard to see how parliament carrying on in this fashion is sustainable.\nSomething will have to give. But given how volatile our politics is right now you'd be a brave person to put money on any particular outcome. People keep asking all of us what will happen next - and the worrying fact is that no one really knows. That's how bad it has got. Change cannot come soon enough.\nChuka Umunna is the Liberal Democrat MP for Streatham",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_how-can-britain-stage-an-economic-recovery-after-the-brexit-crisis/content_514.html": "How can Britain stage an economic recovery after the Brexit crisis?\nFrom his booklet, 'Beyond Brexit: Liberal Politics for the Age of Identity', Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable explores how the UK can prosper socially and financially in the 2020s\nWithout an effectively functioning economy, such objectives as \"fairness\" cannot be realised, and political extremes flourish. What Britain needs to prosper socially and financially in the 2020s is a longer-term strategy for sustainable growth which addresses the country's deep failings in respect of skills, short-term financial horizons and housing. And, now, those of us who oppose Brexit and economic nationalism generally face the challenge to say how we would improve the functioning of an economy damaged by the financial crisis and then, again, by Brexit. Good economic management will be more critical than ever.\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s Britain suffered from \"stagflation\": rates of inflation well above historic trends and occasionally reaching double figures (leading to a balance of payments crisis under a fixed exchange rate system) combined with slow growth relative to developed-country comparators.\nWhat followed was a revolution in policy terms which came to be known as \"Thatcherism\" (with similar reactions elsewhere, notably the US): a fundamental switch from state ownership and controls to much greater faith in private ownership and market freedom (and with it, toleration of greater inequalities); independence for central banks to control inflation; fiscal rules to stop the build-up of unsustainable deficits and debt; and full-blooded engagement with an open \"globalised\" economy through trade, financial markets, international investment and (to a degree) migration. The Blair/Brown era of Labour government cemented this transformation.\nYet after the 2008 financial crisis no such fundamental rethinking of economic policy has occurred. On the British left (as also in the US and France) there is much denunciation of \"neoliberalism\" and austerity but little indication of what this means in practice except in a few exotic (and disastrous) experiments, as in Venezuela. There has been a revival of belief in nationalisation, though not in explaining how it would actually work.\nThere is a reaffirmation of the belief in more progressive taxation, but no developed economy has yet moved strongly in that direction. And led by the Democrats in the US, the emergence of the \"Green New Deal\" is proving a rallying point for mobilisation around a powerful and compelling theme - combatting climate change - albeit, so far, without realistic thinking on the financing of it.\nIf there has been any kind of paradigm shift it has been a revival of economic nationalisation, mainly in the form of trade protectionism (and anti-immigrant attitudes) in the US and disengagement from EU integration in Britain by the decision, as part of Brexit, to leave the EU Single Market.\nIt makes no sense to go back to the 1970s, as some on the left wish to do: restoring price, rent and exchange controls (or trying to); renationalising utilities and the manufacturing industries which used to constitute the \"commanding heights\" of the economy; abandoning fiscal rules in the name of \"ending austerity\"; bringing back penal tax rates on high incomes and corporate profits.Could a 'Brexit bounce' rescue our struggling economy?\nNor is there much attraction politically (or economically) in taking the Thatcherite revolution to another level, as some on the Brexit right wish to do: scrapping many of the remaining labour, consumer protection and environmental regulations; pursuing as a matter of doctrine, rather than fiscal necessity, a \"small state\" agenda in respect of tax and government spending.\nIn reality there are market failures and government failures. Good policy is about getting a sensible balance between making use of markets where possible and government where necessary - not a philosophy that will appeal to demagogues, but correct, nonetheless. Economic competence is not a message that stirs the soul but, without it, rising living standards and socially progressive measures are not possible. And we start from a position where there are major elements in the current model that we should be fighting to preserve as well as some major failures to correct.\nOne of the big advances of recent years which populists of the right and left are trying to undermine is independent central banks, overseeing financial stability. Unsurprisingly, the Bank of England is one of the main targets of the Brexit right and the radical left, complaining about the \"liberal elite\", as represented by the Federal Reserve in Trump's US and the European Central Bank in the eurozone.\nWhat is fundamentally at issue is the principle that day-to-day economic management, be it of monetary policy or financial regulation, should be left to politically independent \"experts\" acting on the basis of evidence. That principle should be defended as tenaciously as the principle that operations in NHS hospitals should be carried out by medical professionals rather than witchdoctors or cranks. I made my maiden speech in parliament in 1997 in support of Gordon Brown's decision to grant operational independence to the Bank of England, one of the most important parts of his legacy.\nWhere politics come in is in setting the rules for the Bank to follow, reflecting the experience of a major financial crisis and the fact that inflation is no longer the issue it was a generation ago (indeed, deflation has emerged as a real threat). The first changes could be to recognise the reality that the aim of policy, especially for interest rates, is to keep the economy growing as fast as possible.\nThe way of expressing this, technically, is to set a target of money GDP (inflation plus real growth) which is pretty much what has happened in practice. The second is to acknowledge that where inflation has been dangerously high is in the property market.\nThat is partly an issue of supply and demand, as I discuss below, but also of the availability of credit. Instead of politically driven, counter-productive and costly schemes like Help to Buy, the availability of credit should be determined by the Bank in what are now called \"macro-prudential\" policies. And third, one of the very painful lessons of the financial crisis is the danger posed by financial institutions that are not closely regulated (or supervised), and that accumulate high levels of leverage (debt), threatening the stability of the system.\nI have argued that the British financial service industry and its collection of banks (and shadow or quasi banks which create credit like banks) is simply too big for a medium-sized country. Brexit will now reduce it, but unfortunately in a way which randomly cuts its export earning potential rather than by ending activities which are high risk and of questionable value. Adair Turner, the former financial regulator, and Mervyn King, the former governor, have described how we cannot simply apply sticking-plaster solutions to a financial sector suffering from fundamental instability\nPerhaps the most serious issue, looking forward, relates to the vulnerability of the economy if we again face recession or depression (a period of falling production, wages and prices). The weapons to fight a crisis of this kind are heavily depleted. Interest rates are already close to zero. Government debt is already at levels which have historically occurred after times of war. The economy has been kept going by quantitative easing (the Bank of England buying government bonds to force down long-term interest rates, or purchasing assets in the hope that this will boost confidence to invest or spend). The side-effects (widening inequality of wealth) have become politically toxic.\nIn future, perhaps sooner than we think, the authorities may be forced into more extreme alternatives. Even if the international economic outlook is benign - which is increasingly unlikely - a disruptive Brexit could trigger a serious downturn requiring emergency action. One possibility discussed during the financial crisis, but not acted upon, would be for the government to finance its spending - either boosting spending through a tax cut, or handing out vouchers to spend, or investing in capital projects - by borrowing from the central bank. This is, in effect, \"printing money\", the original \"magic money tree\".\nWere we to find ourselves in another major financial crisis, or a deep depression caused by other factors, such unorthodox measures would prove necessary. But it would be essential to maintain the separation between monetary policy, managed by technocrats on our behalf, and budgetary (fiscal) policy run by politicians.\nIf it were not, it is not difficult to see how populist politicians, if in power during the next crisis, could manufacture short-term popularity by seizing control of the Bank of England to harvest the \"magic money tree\". Debasing the currency is bound, in due course, to have the same baleful consequences as it did for medieval monarchs and modern dictators. We should not be looking to the likes of Venezuela and Zimbabwe for a template for monetary policy.\nAll the more reason, then, to ensure that budgetary policy also operates within rules (though we can sensibly argue about what they are). The current battle between the European Commission and Italy over Italy's chronic inability to set a sustainable budgetary policy reinforces that principle.\nIn Britain, the phrase \"the end of austerity\" has the effect, if not the intention, of conjuring up a world where budget rules can be broken or no longer apply. We should be having a proper national debate about how much the public is willing to pay in higher taxes (and what taxes) to pay for better financed public services. Liberal Democrats are clear that some rises in general taxation are justified, in particular to pay for healthcare, and that changes to the way we tax wealth are essential to fund the services and investment the public wants to see.\nWhat makes no sense is vague appeals to have Scandinavian levels of public sector spending without any way to meet the costs in the long term - the stock in trade of the present Labour Party.\nWhat is required are rules of the kind originally set out by Gordon Brown - and in the EU in the Maastricht conditions - requiring governments to balance their (current) budget over the economic cycle (an elusive enough concept), policed by an independent body (currently the Office for Budget Responsibility). The major unresolved controversy is what to do about public investment. In theory public investment should be able to pay for itself and therefore not add to government debt.\nBut in practice a lot of public investment, however worthy (like school buildings), simply adds to debt, and the Treasury treats all investment as no different from current spending (a source of some tension within the coalition). What is needed is an arms-length and professionally staffed body, perhaps constituted like the Green Investment Bank set up by the coalition, which can vet and promote public sector investment projects which the private sector will not undertake but which produce a clear, long-run economic return.\nRailways and housing are obvious areas and the next generation of renewable energy. The ambition to mobilise political energy around a Green New Deal can be a central part of this investment provided it is separated from magical money.\nThere is a deep pool of potential infrastructure investment in pension funds. But the UK pension fund sector is very fragmented, and a proactive government should amalgamate them into bigger wealth funds to enable them to diversify in this way.\nAnother important role for public investment is to pump-prime private investment in some of the \"left behind\" areas of the UK. There is a category of projects which do not require financial subsidy but do require the \"comfort\" of government co-financing or enabling investment in the form of a key piece of infrastructure. The regional growth fund operated by my department during the coalition (since relegated in importance) provides a model.\nPrivate businesses bid for investment funds. These were vetted by a politically independent team of advisers led by Michael Heseltine and then subject to a detailed economic evaluation before being signed off by ministers. In this way, substantial new investment was generated without the overheads associated with the earlier regional development agencies. Future investment could be via some hybrid of the regional growth fund and regional development agency model, seeking to devolve decision-making away from Westminster and to put a local democratic process in place to oversee it.\nThe big underlying issue behind budgetary (tax and spending) policy is how big the state's share should be. The effect of a period of \"austerity\" under the current, Conservative, government has been to take the public spending share of the economy (including investment) from 41 per cent in 2015 to 39 per cent in 2018 (and tax revenue as a share of the economy largely unchanged from 36.2 per cent to 36.15 per cent).\nUnder the coalition the public spending share went from 43.75 per cent to 41 per cent (and tax from 35.2 per cent to 36.2 per cent). Despite the fierce ideological arguments around austerity, the shares haven't greatly changed. The \"small state\" revolution, if that was what it was, didn't get very far. And Britain is somewhere in the middle ground of developed economies, spending and taxing far less than some countries (France and Sweden) but more than others (the US).\nHere, economically liberal and social democratic values pull in opposite directions. My instincts are that important public goods are underfunded (health, education, policing) and taxes need to be raised to pay for them. The Lib Dems \"1p in the pound\" on income tax is a statement of intent to move in that direction; but we have yet to see how much appetite there is for funding a much bigger state (as opposed to taxing \"someone else\" (the super-rich or multinationals).\nOne important question, not raised since the debate around the poll tax a generation ago, and its replacement by a new form of residential property taxation, is whether the tax base should change in a fundamental way. The one, big, radical reform which is crucial is to shift tax from work (income tax and national insurance) to land.\nThe more successful western economies have long appreciated that a judicious mixture of competitive private enterprise and state intervention works best\nLand taxation has long been advocated as a form of tax which is economically sensible (it taxes something in fixed supply, encouraging efficient use), which cannot be avoided by shifting overseas (as can taxation of income and profit) and is relatively efficient (requiring collection from landowners rather than vast numbers of property owners). A prototype has been designed, replacing business rates by a landowner's levy, which could progress from there to residential land (also replacing council tax). There are administrative and political challenges, but it is the direction in which we should be travelling.\nAnother fundamental change, which is obscured by arguments about how to squeeze more tax out of companies, is to shift to shift tax away from equity (risk capital) and on to debt, which is currently treated as tax-deductible. The coalition recognised the need to make this change as a step to a more entrepreneurial business sector but it has not yet been followed through.\nArguments about how to divide up the spending cake, or how to realise the tax revenue to pay for it, beg the question of what government can do to help the economy become more productive and environmentally sustainable. The more successful western economies have long appreciated that a judicious mixture of competitive private enterprise and state intervention (within agreed international rules) works best. The serious issue here is not how to create a \"small state\" dominated by Conservative ideologues or a \"big state\" fantasised by Corbynistas. It is how to make government smarter and more entrepreneurial. There are three specific things which British governments should be doing more of.\nThe first is that while Britain has a good record in promoting, financing and safeguarding the quality of scientific research, this is not true of innovation - translating science into new products and processes through investment. UK R&D spending (especially the D) for non-military purposes lags behind that in comparator countries. Tax incentives (R&D tax credits) have helped but are wasteful of resources compared to targeted investment by government alongside the private sector.\nThe Catapult network launched under the coalition through Innovate UK now provides a good structure, but it needs considerably more sustained government support. Professor Mariana Mazzucato has described the model of an entrepreneurial state working alongside the private sector, which has led to breakthroughs in space exploration, the internet and pharmaceuticals and will be necessary for future success in dealing with climate change or cancer.\nSecond, all the evidence suggests that a more educated labour force raises the performance of the economy. Britain should aspire to be a successful knowledge-based economy - ideally, the best-educated country in the world. There have been piecemeal attempts to raise school standards, particularly in core subjects like literacy and maths, albeit at the expense of creativity. And there has been a massive expansion of higher education, even if it is often simply satisfying a perceived need for paper credentials. The priority now is to help young people prepare for a world of rapidly evolving technologies in which traditional skills and professions are becoming redundant and the premium is on adaptability: learning how to learn.\nThere are two glaring failings at present. The first is the lack of resources for the FE sector, both in providing basic skills for young people who do not go to university and providing progression for many more people to progress to higher apprenticeship and other advanced training. The apprenticeship levy - essentially another employee tax - has badly set back progress that was starting to be made. Raising the demand and supply of quality apprenticeships must now be a priority. One way in which this could be made a reality is to put Britain to work on a radical programme of new house building with an associated skills academy to train people in construction.\nSecond, adult education has been allowed to atrophy. What is needed is a much stronger commitment to lifelong learning. The concept of Individual Learning Accounts, which was briefly tried but discarded two decades ago because of fraud and lack of financial control, should be revived as a way of giving adults an incentive to keep learning and relearning. I established a commission to take forward this proposition for the Liberal Democrats. It is possible to see how such a system would work with a state-financed Individual Learning Account of - say £10,000, topped up by private and corporate contributions used to finance tuition fees whenever they are incurred and across the range of higher, further and adult education without discrimination.\nI know from my experience in government the enormous barriers to creating a level playing field between the various forms of post- school learning. Snobbery and ignorance play a big part. In the civil service and in politics there is a strong bias to traditional undergraduate learning (based on some imagined variant of Oxbridge colleges) as the \"gold standard\". I don't for one moment decry the merits of universities which have recently transformed the economic outlook of many provincial towns and, at best, can do wonders for creative and critical thinking. But in a world of scarce resources they have been wrongly allowed to crowd out equally valuable institutions of learning (and virtual learning).\nMy final role for the state is to build on the industrial strategy developed in my period as business secretary and before and continued by my current successor. The twin ideas are to develop public-private partnerships especially in areas of high risk and uncertainty into which the private sector alone will not venture; and, a related point, to provide longer-term horizons than capital markets will normally allow. There are successful experiences to draw on in automobiles, aerospace and life sciences. Examples include the development of the next generation of motor vehicles, including electric cars, the Aerospace Growth Partnership, sponsoring new biotech companies, and the promotion of the fintech sector.\nConcretely, this will involve the government establishing priorities, a process sometime pejoratively called \"picking winners\". The experience of the 1970s, including Concorde and the nuclear advanced gas-cooled reactors, provided many examples of failures which absorbed and wasted a lot of scarce capital. But recent experience, including mine, has suggested some useful lessons. One is the value of co-investment, so that the state leverages private investment rather than replaces it and goes with the flow of the market rather than against it. Recent experience with automobiles, aerospace and biotech, the Green Investment Bank and the Regional Growth Fund all followed this model.\nThen, there are sectors like the creative industries, professional services, construction and IT, where there isn't a demand for large amounts of state capital but for a good framework for training, intellectual property rights, better functioning credit and equity markets and funding of early-stage innovation. The work is often unglamorous, and this is not territory for ideologues and showmen. But there are undoubtedly areas where the state will need to go where the private sector currently fears to tread - for example, renewable energy, where recent decisions on solar and tidal make a nonsense of long-term sustainable energy strategy.\nThere is also too trusting a belief that competition will somehow naturally emerge as part of the workings of a market economy. In reality there are powerful forces working in the opposite direction, creating and entrenching monopoly power through the use of intellectual property rights - which may be necessary to spur innovation but also acts to protect monopoly positions - and through the sheer scale of new technology platforms. The next chapter deals specifically with this challenge.\nThis article is extracted with thanks from Sir Vince Cable's booklet, 'Beyond Brexit', a collection of essays on the future of liberalism",

The story had no reference to any benefits that flowed back to taxpayers in return for this drain on their income: education for children (£180,000 per child or more in the private sector between 3 and 18), health care (say £100,000 per person, incurred most heavily in the last two years of life), and post-retirement benefits (state pensions of £6-9000 a year over 10-20 years, bus passes, etc.), not to mention contributions to all the public goods that make civilised living comfortable: policing, roads and railways, external security, welfare, market support and regulation.

It probably won't be terribly controversial (though one never knows …), but it is party members' chance to say what they think - not about specific policies the party should adopt, but about what the party stands for: its basic philosophy. This is the final stage in the Federal Policy Committee's 'Agenda 2020' process, which has featured many times before in the pages of Lib Dem Voice. Over the past year we have published two consultation papers, organised two consultative sessions at federal conferences, commissioned a set of essays and organised an essay competition within the party (all available here at http://www.libdems.org.uk/agenda2020).\nUK Lib Dem news\nBritain must lead on defence and aid\nThe UK needs to strengthen both our Armed Forces and our soft power.\nEd Davey marks Holocaust Memorial Day 2025\nToday is Holocaust Memorial Day.\nBritain Leading Again\nThe UK must once again stand tall, leading on the world stage and working closely with those who share our interests – including, above all, our partners in Europe.",

It is a city built on the idea that the multitude of cultures that inhabit it are a benefit, not a curse, where communities from all over the globe live and work side by side, enriching each other's experiences. It is a city where Donald Trump's arrival is met not with fanfare, but with fury.\nIt proved it is a liberal city in May, when the Lib Dems topped the poll and sent three MEPs to the European Parliament to fight for our place in Europe. And I hope it will show it is a liberal city again when it elects Lib Dem Siobhan Benita as the next Mayor of London, so that we can build a safer and greener capital.\nEarlier this week, when Boris Johnson, London's former Mayor, finally got the keys to No 10, he promised a Cabinet that represents modern Britain. But as all Londoners know, promises made by Johnson tend to be less impressive in reality than they are in rhetoric. In his reshuffle this week, he gave jobs to people who have supported the death penalty, who have bragged about not being a feminist, and who are completely opposed to abortion even in cases of rape. He has also sacked the only LGBT+ member of the Cabinet.\nIt shouldn't surprise us that these are the people Johnson picked. Just look at him and what he has said. He has compared Muslim women to letterboxes and described elite women athletes as \"glistening like wet otters\". He is determined, despite all the evidence on how damaging it will be to our economy, to pursue a no-deal Brexit. And yesterday, when I asked him to fulfil his reassurances that the three million EU citizens - our friends, family and neighbours - would retain their rights after Brexit, and to back a Lib Dem Bill to that effect, he was all talk and no trousers.\nAnd while all this is going on, Jeremy Corbyn is nowhere to be seen. As well as failing to root out the anti-Semitism that is plaguing Labour, he is failing to be the Opposition to this far-Right Government. Yesterday was his last opportunity to table a motion of no confidence and stop Johnson's Government in its tracks, and he bottled it. Yet another crucial test of his leadership, yet another failure.\nIt would be easy to look at Johnson's new Cabinet or Corbyn's mediocrity and feel gloomy about the state of politics and the future of our country. But I am an optimist at heart - despite what the PM says about those of us who think a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic.\nI have hope because I know that the group of people who sit around the Cabinet table or on the Opposition front bench do not represent the modern Britain I know. The Britain I love is the one I've seen as I've travelled the country in these past few months for the Liberal Democrat leadership election.\nFrom Aberdeen to Cornwall, and everywhere in between, I've met so many people who believe that Britain should celebrate our differences, not just tolerate them; who believe that we should embrace the cultural diversity that has made Britain great, and who believe that we are at our strongest when we work with our European neighbours, not when we turn our back on them.\nThose fundamentally liberal values - openness, inclusion, internationalism - are what truly represent the best of Britain, and it's those values that I'm determined to fight for as leader of the Liberal Democrats.\nIt is frustrating when I am endlessly asked which of Johnson or Corbyn I'd rather was in Downing Street, as if my role in British politics is that of an X Factor judge, picking which act I prefer but having no ability to compete in the contest myself. To accept that as my role would be to accept that the British people really only have two abysmal choices, that their political and economic future is ultimately a choice between blue and red. Tory or Labour. Johnson or Corbyn. But I don't accept that choice.\nWhen I decided to run for the leadership of the Lib Dems, the party was in a very different situation. But the febrile nature of politics right now means people are no longer asking whether it is realistic to aim for the top. With the future of the country at stake, aiming for the top is what the Liberal Democrats must do, because the UK deserves better than Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn.\nOur country deserves a party that isn't afraid to say immigration is a good thing, or to say that Donald Trump is racist, or to admit that we have an economic system that is fundamentally broken for too many people and is breaking our planet too. Those aren't extreme, fringe views. Those are views shared by millions of people across the country who look in despair at the leaders of the Conservative and Labour parties.\nTo take on the forces of nationalism and populism, we need to rally a liberal movement that offers a positive, alternative vision for the kind of country we want to be. One where our economy works for people and our planet, where we work with our closest allies to resolve the climate emergency and keep us safe, and one where no matter who you are, whatever your background, you can access the opportunities you deserve.",

Here's what Sal said on the news of her re-election:\n-\nI am honoured to be returned unopposed for my second term as President of the Liberal Democrats.

I will be there again on Sunday and look forward to joining hundreds of Liberal Democrat supporters helping Sarah.\nWith no opposition, there was not much of an election campaign, but in her initial campaigning it was notable the priority which she gave to continuing the work of the Governance Review, and in particular to see changes made to the way the Liberal Democrats are organised in England.",

One where the campaigning model is based not only on narrow targeting but also on winning elections across large geographic areas too. One where members outside target seats can have a full role to play in the party's campaigning and successes.

I've heard of nurses now forced to take multiple buses, struggling to get to their 12-hour hospital shifts. And I've also heard from dedicated public sector workers, scraping by on low or even minimum wages, unable to afford to pay for even basic necessities, as prices spiral out of control, leaving wages far behind.\nThe solution to such distressing stories is clear: instead of strikes, there should be dialogue between government ministers and union bosses.\nBoris Johnson and Grant Shapps in particular are playing politics with people's lives, as they pretend to be innocent bystanders to the dispute. Government ministers now directly set and agree the budgets and strategic policies of the rail companies, so they cannot simply wash their hands of any responsibility: rail managers have only modest leeway in their negotiations. Yet, thanks to parliamentary questions asked by my colleague Sarah Olney,\nwe know ministers haven't met the RMT to try to stop these strikes, for well over a month.\nAnd as would-be passengers know only too well, not only have ministers failed to stop the strikes, they've also failed to plan ahead to minimise the disruption they are causing. There is no plan whatsoever to help frontline public sector employees get to work, whether that's in hospitals or police stations. And as if parents and children haven't gone through enough stress over the past two years, ministers have even failed to bring forward any plans to ensure every pupil can attend vital exams this week.\nMinisters must now clean up their own mess. Liberal Democrats are calling for an emergency Cobra meeting to kickstart a practical compromise and to keep Britain moving.\nGiven the bite of the cost of living crisis, Cobra must also ensure low-paid frontline workers - who we all depend on - are not out of pocket from this strike and can get to work.\nIf these strikes continue all summer much of the blame will lie at Shapps's door. \"Sleepy Shapps\" is presiding over the biggest set of transport crises for decades - whether it's the chaos at our airports, the rocketing price of petrol or now these rail strikes. It's beyond time for him to start doing his job. It is time he put the travelling public first, treated low-paid rail workers with respect and not as a political opportunity and looked beyond their provocative union bosses touring the TV studios.\nWith public-sector pay lagging behind both inflation and private-sector pay by a wide margin, it's also time the prime minister stopped playing his divisive politics. One way would be for him to deliver on his own recent promise of higher wages. Or, assuming that was yet more Johnson headline-grabbing bluster, he could at least show some leadership, demonstrate that the year is 2022 not 1972, and work to bring people together.",

Commenting on the news Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Norman Lamb said:\n\"The Health Select Committee are right to call out the Government on false claims about their investment in the NHS. Services are desperately in need of the money they were promised.\n\"But this also ignores the bigger question of how we ensure health and care are sustainable in the long term, as demand for services continues to rise.\n\"I have called for the establishment of an independent, cross-party commission to reform the funding settlement across health and care and the Liberal Democrats have set up an expert panel who will advise on how the additional funding the NHS really needs can be delivered. Including whether a dedicated Health and Care Tax should be introduced to help guarantee the future of the NHS and vital care services.\"",

The argument for realignment is different. Democratic politics requires its practitioners to build coalitions of people whose views are not identical, but who share political objectives and a commitment to see them translated into reality.\nBrexit is the immediate illustration of the issue. Liberal Democrats, liberal Conservatives and social democrats share a strong belief that the UK's interests are best served by remaining a member of the EU and building in Europe the world's most effective champion of liberal values. These values, enshrined in the EU treaties, are not, as Vladimir Putin says, \"obsolete\"; they are the essential ingredients of the success of western civilisation, and liberals should organise to defend them wherever and whenever they are threatened.\nLooking beyond the Brexit crisis, it is also obvious that our democracy is in dire need of reform. Parliament has lost the ability to speak for voters because it doesn't represent the balance of their views. Britain needs a more proportional voting system to ensure the views expressed in parliament reflect the country.\nAll this requires liberal Conservatives and social democrats to break cover from their respective parties and join the Liberal Democrats in a big liberal tent. It isn't just a question of \"joining the Liberal Democrats\"; by joining, their objective is to expand the Liberal Democrats to include fellow liberals from different backgrounds, all of whom are committed to delivering the reform of our politics that is so urgently needed.\nWelcome, Stephen.",

Ms Allen's arrival brings the Lib Dem tally in the Commons to 19.\nMs Swinson said she was \"in discussions\" with potential switchers and \"always hopeful of further defections\", but declined to say whether new recruits were in the pipeline.\nAnd Ms Allen, who has been sitting as an independent since quitting Change UK in June, said she was \"absolutely\" in touch with serving Tory MPs who shared her concerns over the direction the party was taking under Mr Johnson.\n\"I'm not saying everybody should casually resign the whip, but for me it was the right thing and I know that in other MPs' hearts they know it's the right thing to do,\" she said. \"There has got to be at least 20.\"\nAsked if she expected any to follow her, she replied: \"I couldn't say for sure that any will. I'd like to say yes, but one of the things that's disappointed me most since I became an MP is the lack of bravery that there is.\"\nMs Swinson said she had been working with her new MP for \"a long time\" on issues like the campaign for a Final Say referendum, and the pair have been \"in close contact\" over a possible defection since Ms Allen left Change.\nAnd Ms Allen revealed that she was considering an eventual move to the Lib Dems even while she was leader of Change UK during its disastrous European election campaign, when she clashed with Anna Soubry over her suggestion supporters should vote tactically for other anti-Brexit parties.\n\"I was talking about an alignment in the centre ground from the very beginning,\" she said. \"It was a question for me of whether having a holding position as an independent group would make it easier for other MPs to jump, but in the end not many did.\"\nMs Allen said she held off her move to the Lib Dems until the Unite to Remain movement - which she formed to promote pro-EU electoral pacts at the coming election - was securely established.\nShe vowed she would \"absolutely\" contest the seat she has held since 2015 in the election - telling The Independent: \"I wouldn't stand anywhere else,\" - and insisted she was hopeful of overturning a towering Tory majority of almost 16,000 from 2017.\n\"The constituency is probably close to 70 per cent Remain, and from the moment I left the Conservatives I have literally had thousands of emails from constituents and people coming up to me in the street saying they are grateful I had put the national interest first,\" she said.\nShe insisted that she would not stand down to spark a by-election, pointing out that she used her own literature in the 2017 poll rather than the pro-Brexit material put out by Tory central office.\nAnd she said there were \"dozens\" of traditional Tory heartland constituencies like hers which are now vulnerable to Lib Dems because their voters are turned off by the narrow Eurosceptic views of the Johnson administration.\nNaming Winchester and Guildford, as well as some of the seats of the 21 no-deal rebels who have been barred from standing for the Tories at the election, Ms Allen said: \"There are an awful lot of places where compassionate, moderate, centre-ground, progressive voters have previously backed the Conservatives.\n\"The Tory Party has completely turned its back on those voters and there is a real chance - with the Lib Dems offering that kind of politics - those seats could be lost to them.\n\"The most terrifying thing to me is that Boris Johnson seems to care not one jot about those voters or the MPs who have been loyal to him. His approach is to attack the Labour heartlands instead. But you win elections on the centre ground.\"\nHeidi Allen served as Change UK leader during the European elections (AFP/Getty)\nMs Allen was marked out as an independent voice on the Tories' centrist wing from her maiden speech in the Commons, when she was critical of the party's approach to welfare - something she admits \"probably limited my opportunities for promotion\".\nA former entrepreneur, who put her business on hold to enter politics, said she was attracted by the compassionate and pro-business agenda pursued by the coalition government under David Cameron.\n\"The Conservative Party since then has changed beyond recognition,\" she said.\n\"I don't see that I have changed at all, it is the party that has changed irreparably. The party that I joined doesn't exist any more. It is self-imploding, it is turning into the new Brexit Party.\"\nAnd she said it was a \"very, very risky\" question whether the Conservative Party would even survive its current traumas.\n\"The loud, bullying voices of the European Research Group have been allowed to capture the party and push it to the precipice of a no-deal Brexit, which would be unbelievably damaging for our economy, our society and our Union. Anybody who shares 'One Nation' values does not have a home there any more.\"\nBy contrast, she said the Lib Dems under Ms Swinson offer \"an incredibly positive beacon for what our future could be\", not only on Brexit, but also social justice, compassionate welfare and honesty over spending on the NHS and social care.\nMs Allen's defection was announced hours after the latest talks between opposition leaders seeking a means to prevent no-deal Brexit broke-up without progress on the key issue of the leadership of a possible caretaker government to extend Article 50 talks.\nMs Swinson said there were still \"constructive\" discussions happening, but said that if Labour stuck to its position that only Jeremy Corbyn could head a temporary caretaker administration, then \"it won't happen because we know what the numbers are of people unwilling to back him - not just Liberal Democrats but also rebel Conservatives and the increasingly large number of MPs who have left Labour or are still in the Labour Party but cannot contemplate Corbyn in No 10\".\nThe Lib Dem leader said she could name \"a dozen\" MPs who could fill the role of caretaker PM, but said this was only one of a number of routes open to those opposing no deal.\nProgress on issues like the Benn Act, to prevent Mr Johnson opting for no deal without parliamentary approval, had been made not in meetings of opposition leaders but in a wider group including rebel Tories and Labour backbenchers, she pointed out.\nStressing that the Lib Dem door remains open to future defectors, Ms Swinson said: \"It remains the case that there are lots of MPs who are unhappy with the current direction of both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and who share our values of internationals and a fairer and more inclusive society and want to stop Brexit and create a more positive future for our country.\n\"Obviously, I hope more of them will be joining us, but these things happen in their own time.\"\nAsked if she was actively talking with potential defectors, she replied: \"I'm always in discussions.\"",

The Tory grandee was suspended from the party in May when he said he would support the Lib Dems in the European elections.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday: \"The real issue is what is at stake and it is the prosperity of this country, the world influence of this country, our relationship with our neighbours in Europe. This is transcendingly the overarching issue at stake in this election and I cannot vote or support people who are going to make the country poorer or less influential - full stop, end of story.\"\nHeseltine called for a second referendum and took a swipe at Vote Leave's controversial claim that Turkey and four other countries could join the EU as soon as 2020, and their accession could lead to 5.2 million extra people moving to the UK by 2030. He also attacked its infamous assertion on the side of the campaign bus that Britain sends £350m a week to the EU and that money would be spent on the NHS instead.\nHe said it was \"complete nonsense\" to suggest Brexit could be done by Christmas. \"All you can do by Christmas is to pass legislation to enter into negotiations. It's like the boxer saying OK, you've been training, now you can get into the ring. And you'll be in the ring with, first of all, a massively, larger economic bloc, Europe, secondly Donald Trump fighting for his life politically. I dare say he's going to start doing special deals with us.\n\"It's preposterous. We are in for another year of uncertainty and a possibility of a no-deal exit at the end of it. That's the reality of what we're facing if Mr Johnson gets an overall majority.\"\nHeseltine accused the prime minister of pursuing an \"utterly disastrous\" policy \"for Britain's position in the world and for our economy and for the investment which is frozen up in this country at the moment\".\nSpeaking on the programme, he also said Jeremy Corbyn \"isn't fit to be prime minister. He's not going to be prime minister and you know it, I know it and every pollster reveals it.\"\nHe added: \"I think it's much more likely - the question is not whether he can be prime minister, it's whether he continues to lead the Labour party by Christmas because I think there will be a great move to get rid of him.\"",

Contrary to what the Leader of the House said yesterday in her opening speech, there is no mandate to leave Euratom. It is not part of the EU and it seems that, as a country, we are in danger of cutting off our nose to spite our face for no reason in terms of an electoral mandate.\nToday, I want to speak primarily about my great-grandfather, Samuel Miller. He was a master sergeant in the Middlesex Regiment in the late 19th century. I think that he served in South Africa but in the late 1870s he was posted to Dublin. There, he fulfilled his military duties and one year later, in 1880, my grandmother, Edith Blanche-later Leddra-was born. Because of that accident, I was able to take on Irish citizenship and indeed did so in 1996. I am a dual national. Therefore, after Brexit takes place, I will be able to have all the privileges of a European citizen, but that will not be the case for the 16 million people who voted to remain part of the European Union. Not just those with relatives who were born in other EU nations but those born in Ireland will also be able to decide whether to continue to have those privileges as European citizens in the UK beyond Brexit.\nPerhaps I may remind your Lordships of some of those privileges. They include non-discrimination alongside other European nationals, the ability to move and reside without hindrance in European Union countries, the ability to work within the European Union, to establish a business, to export and to trade without red tape, the ability to have diplomatic representation, the ability to use our qualifications throughout Europe, and of course the right to healthcare and a European health insurance card when travelling in the EU.\nI looked through the White Paper with a great deal of interest. As other noble Lords have said, it is not very long. Strangely, although there were a number of comments about reinforcing UK citizens' rights in the rest of Europe, it said absolutely nothing about the 16 million of us who will be denied those privileges and rights through the vote of the 17 million. On that, there is a complete void. It is because of that that I feel that those 16 million who along with me voted to remain-I am not going back in history; this is just how it was-have been abandoned by this Government. It is not mentioned in the White Paper. There is no plan for us to retain those rights.\nI have spoken with the European Parliament. It is my intention with other parliamentarians who have a similar concern not to negotiate with our own Government-I have no questions for the Minister today, because the Government cannot give what I am asking, nor do they have the power to do so-but to take a delegation of other parliamentarians to meet the rapporteur of the European Parliament and to ask it to protect those rights of our citizens either through membership or associate membership, and to try to achieve that where our own Government have clearly failed and have no interest.",

The full consultation paper can be found at www.libdems.org.uk/autumn-conference-16-policypapers and the consultation window runs until 28 October. Party members are invited to attend the consultation session at party conference in Brighton, to be held on Saturday 17 September at 1pm in the Balmoral Room of the Hilton.\nThe UK's options for the successor to Trident are (boiled down to essentials):\n- Same as now - nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines, only new.\n- Keep most or all of the kit but stop continuous nuclear armed submarine patrols, unless circumstances change.\n- Shift from missiles in submarines to bombs dropped from aircraft.\n- Don't keep nuclear weapons but do keep the expertise and the radioactive materials needed to make them, just in case.\n- No nuclear weapons. Unilateral disarmament. The zero option.\nI have been invited to write about these options in the light of ethical and humanitarian concerns.\nNuclear weapons are not really weapons of war. They are beyond war. They are means of annihilating life as we know it on this planet. There are about 15,000 nuclear warheads in the world today, which in a full nuclear conflict could comfortably exterminate us all.\nThey are so destructive that their use in pursuit of a traditional victory is impossible. They are not made to be used, but to make threats with.\nThe case for the nuclear arsenal rests on deterrence theory: to dissuade foes from certain courses of action, without ever actually being used, in order to make the holder of the deterrent safer.\nThe doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) assumes that if attacked by a superweapon, the defending state would be able to fire back with a superweapon, and both sides would end up annihilated, so the threat results in tense peace. There are problems with this doctrine such as whether the defending state would have time to retaliate, but no one wants to try it and find out. So we get non-nuclear conflicts and proxy wars.\nSo far as the UK's part in this elaborate game of bluff and counter bluff is concerned, all depends on the UK's leadership saying they are prepared to use nuclear weapons and being believed. Whether they really would is for potential foes to guess.\nFrom the humanitarian point of view it is imperative never to use a nuclear weapon.\nAs for ethics: on any theory a liberal or democrat could accept, we cannot attribute collective guilt for the aggression of dictators to the whole population they control, including dissenters, children and babies, not to mention other life forms. We cannot make an ethical argument for using an indiscriminate superweapon against populations, even in retaliation for an attack on us.\nSo the ethical case must focus on being prepared now or in future to spend what it costs to have a superweapon and to bluff without having a genuine intention of firing it. Again, the ethical obstacles to this are huge.\nThe MAD doctrine was questioned in the Wall Street Journal in January 2007 where Henry Kissinger and other cold war veterans asserted that nuclear weapons had become a source of intolerable risk, thanks to the risk of accidents, misjudgments or unauthorised use.\nThere have been accidents; there are ever present risks of sabotage, theft or human error; and the fact that no major detonation has occurred is at least partly due to luck. Weighing the risks, apart from that of attracting an attack, it is legitimate to ask whether the UK's possession of nuclear weapons makes us safer. Should our government bring these weapons on to our territory, with their attendant risks?\n* Jo Hayes is a party activist and a member of the Liberal Democrats' nuclear weapons working group.",

It includes a power to lock people up for 10 years if they are involved in a protest that might \"seriously annoy\" someone else. I urge all MPs of all political persuasions not to allow this new Policing Bill to get through.\nThe problem is that any protest will \"seriously annoy\" someone. That is what protest is all about. Last year many of my Liberal Democrat colleagues protested against the shutting down of parliament. Presumably this \"seriously annoyed\" Boris Johnson. I guess he was also \"seriously annoyed\" when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled against him.\nEvery Extinction Rebellion protest \"seriously annoys\" the powers that be and the fossil fuel companies.\nEvery Black Lives Matter protest \"seriously annoys\" the racists in our community.\nJudging by their subsequent actions, the vigil by people in London against women being harassed and abused \"seriously annoyed\" the Metropolitan Police.\nEvery time we turn on our television screens for the latest news, we see examples of someone \"seriously annoying\" someone. That is what protest is all about. It is because people are moved to draw attention to something that is unfair.\nWe see it all over the world, most recently in Hong Kong, in St Petersburg and in Myanmar. And we have also seen how \"seriously annoyed\" the authorities there have become.\nWe have a right to protest about things we feel strongly about. The only issue is how we do it. It must be done in a tempered and peaceful way. Yes, some people will still be \"seriously annoyed\", but we will have made our objection in a peaceful and respectful way.\nDoes this really warrant a 10-year prison sentence?\nI urge all MPs of all political persuasions not to allow this new Policing Bill to get through.

This is my fourth election as a candidate and this one is like no other.\nFirst, there is the obvious weather factor. Usually it is somewhat warmer, with general election polling days falling in May and the campaign kicking off at the beginning of April, not November. When you go out canvassing in the evenings it isn't normally dark when you finish a session, whereas it is now before you have even started door-knocking. And it's damn cold too!\nNext, whether you like it or not, it is \"the Brexit election\". The issue is constantly in the background and it is raised, unprompted, more than any other issue. Yesterday, when asked by Andrew Marr on the BBC whether he wanted to stop Brexit, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to answer in the affirmative for the simple reason that he is a Brexiteer. No wonder the Labour Party has written to Ofcom complaining about Sky News's description of this election as \"the Brexit Election\" which Labour claims \"represents unnecessary and slanted editorialising\" - because every time Corbyn opens his mouth on the issue, he loses Remain voters from Labour.\nThe suggestion that Sky News is editorialising here is clearly absurd. In poll after poll over the last few months the public have ranked Brexit as their top issue, then the NHS, crime and the economy or the environment. Sky News is simply reflecting this fact. What is unacceptable is Sky News's rival ITV, in its head-to-head debate, scheduled between Corbyn and Boris Johnson for Tuesday, airbrushing out the Remain side of the argument by excluding the leader of the other main party in UK politics - Jo Swinson - from the debate. Funnily enough, Labour has made no complaints about Jo being left out.\nIn order to stop Brexit, via a people's vote, you need the parliamentary arithmetic in the new parliament to stack up in favour of holding one. In order for this to happen, at the very least, the Tory party needs to lose seats. Anything could happen in the next four weeks and you are a brave person if you try to predict the outcome, but our role will be key because another truth has been emerging in the campaign...\nThe Lib Dems are in a far better position to take seats from the Tories than Labour. In fact, far from taking seats from Johnson, Labour is trying to defend its own from the Tories, particularly in the West Midlands, North East and Yorkshire. The Lib Dems are the ones challenging the Tories and going on the offensive, in London and the south of England in particular.\nIn the last week, the UK's chief polling guru, Sir John Curtice, has said the chances of a Labour majority are \"as close to zero as to be effectively zero\". He reiterated this on the BBC's Today programme on Monday morning. With regard to the Lib Dems, he says that in a substantial number of seats \"given [their] current standing in the polls, [they are] now likely to be the stronger challenger to the Conservatives even though [they] came third in 2017. That position arises in 75 seats or so.\" We are aiming for as many seats as possible and to form a majority, but at the very least, if we are successful in the seats Curtice refers to, it is highly likely this would deprive Johnson of a majority.\nFor the betting folks out there, Ladbrokes does not have Labour as favourites to win in any Tory-held seat - but it does with the Lib Dems. This is borne out by current in-seat polling. Over the weekend, The Observer carried out seat polls in constituencies that usually vote Tory. In Kensington, Finchley and Golders Green and Wimbledon in London it had Labour out of contention, with the Lib Dems in second place in all three seats and still poised to be able to beat the Tories. That is why in seats like these, more and more Labour voters are telling us they will vote Lib Dem as the best hope to keep the Tories out.\nWhy can the Lib Dems succeed when Labour can't in these kinds of seats? A lot of Remain voters simply don't trust Corbyn's Labour on Brexit, which they believe he'd be rather happy to see happen. Also, voters who previously voted Tory are much more willing to switch to and vote for the Lib Dems than they are to do so for Labour - this is in large part due to Corbyn who is disliked and viewed as extreme by a large number of Labour voters, never mind former Tory ones.\nGenerally, we are finding across the country that, in spite of the fact the Tories have been in power for almost a decade, Corbyn is as unpopular as Johnson. I don't remember Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband, William Hague and David Cameron ever attracting the levels of vitriol as Johnson and Corbyn. We have never seen anything like it.\nThis is unsurprising given the disgraceful shambles we have seen in the government and in the official opposition these last few years. Many who have voted Labour and Tory are still on a journey - in their heads, they know these parties to be a shambles, but in their hearts, changing a habit of a lifetime and voting differently is very difficult to accept.

Wednesday was the annual Earth Day. I'm pleased with some of the initiatives that we have in High Peak such as the water turbine in New Mills and tree planting to combat flooding, but we need to do so much more.\"\nCommenting on the £48bn local green funding, Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said:\n\"Last year the Liberal Democrats developed a proper green economic recovery plan, calling on the Government to invest £150 billion over three years. Now we are calling for £48 billion of that money to be given to councils and communities to invest in improvements for their local environment.\n\"Liberal Democrats care about the environment because local people and communities care about their environment. One of the very few positives over the past year has been people spending more time in their local communities, finding new walks and cycle paths, and enjoying green spaces they hadn't before.\n\"Wildlife. Clean air. Green spaces. People know, better than ever, that a healthy local environment keeps us all healthy - physically healthy. Mentally healthy.\n\"Liberal Democrats want a fairer, greener, more caring society and part of that must mean treasuring our local environment.\"\nCllr Lomax added:\n\"Liberal Democrats in High Peak are fighting for a greener society. With this funding, we could invest in new energy efficient heating systems for our housing stock and expand on it for all housing.\"\n\"The pandemic has made the value of our local community green spaces clear and we have to re-engage and care about our community environment.\n\"Our current Tory Government talks the talk on a greener Britain but time and time again has failed to walk the walk.

He said the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal next December was his main worry. \"We have to remain closely connected to the EU for trade. That is essential.\"\nSlatter said he was supporting the Liberal Democrats after having taken a long look at Labour. \"Jeremy Corbyn is a decent man, it's the people around him and the Momentum group that I find a problem,\" he said.\nRobert Moore, the marketing manager of insolvency group KSA, said he saw himself as on the centre right but not nearly rightwing enough to vote for a Johnson Tory administration. \"I am more aligned with Michael Heseltine and people like that,\" he said.\nMoore, who will also be voting Lib Dem, said he wanted the next government to do more to end homelessness, build more affordable homes and reduce the need for food banks. With offices in London and Gateshead, he said he could see the gulf between different parts of the country, \"which the next government should try to close\".\nThe director of an engineering company based in Scotland, who asked to remain anonymous, said she appreciated Corbyn's \"measured\" speech but remained to be convinced by Labour's plan to part-nationalise BT.\n\"It was more measured and calm than the prime minister's [speech],\" she said. \"I liked the way Jeremy Corbyn answered questions directly; like, for example, the very strong way he answered questions on and dealt with antisemitism. But I am not sure that nationalising so much, including the fibre optic network is the way to go.\"\nAndrew Larkin, the manager of a fibre optic cable provider, said: \"We know from experience that it will be be very ambitious to roll out fibre in the next 10 years.\"\nLarkin, who connects multiple-occupancy residential properties, student flats and government offices, said the success of his company could be tied to Labour's nationalisation of BT's Openreach business. \"It is a huge task and you have to ask if they know what they are taking on.\"\nSamantha Mickleburgh, the managing director of Duo Bootmakers, a company employing 35 people making women's boots in Froome, Somerset, was more emphatic in her view of the Labour leader. \"I don't think he has a clue what he is taking about. He wants to nationalise things without any idea how it can be done,\" she said.\nChris Buxton, the chief executive of the British Fluid Power Association (BFPA), which represents companies that make hydraulic and pneumatic equipment, told Swinson during a question and answer session after her speech that he was drawn to her policies, but the threat of a Corbyn government was driving him toward voting for the Conservative party.\n\"I'm scared to death of a Corbyn government,\" he said. \"I speak as a remainer when I say I would rather crash out of the EU without a deal than have Jeremy Corbyn in No 10.\"\n.\n.\n.",

Labour is not doing its job\nMore than two months have passed since the referendum and those of us who campaigned to remain have had some long, hard thinking to do.\nFor Theresa May and the Conservatives, the painstaking task of delivering Brexit has begun - or at least it should have. For Labour, it is still deciding whether it's even a pro-European party. Owen Smith has made clear he wants it to be, but Jeremy Corbyn's ambivalence was plain for all to see in the referendum campaign, and he has already made clear he wants to see the Brexit process get underway.\nThe Lib Dems are different. We have always been proudly pro-European. If Labour won't do its job as the opposition to the Conservative Brexit government, then we will.\nSo on Wednesday I am setting out the Liberal Democrat plan for Britain in Europe. First and foremost, we demand that the British people should have their say on the final deal in a referendum.\nTo be clear, this would not be a rerun of the last referendum, but an opportunity for the British people to have their say on what comes next. Voting for a departure is not the same as voting for a destination. May's \"Brexit means Brexit\" mantra actually doesn't mean very much at all. We have still had no answers the big questions about Britain's future. Will our businesses still have access to the single market, with all the benefits it brings for British jobs and our economy? What will happen to freedom of movement, not just for Europeans who want to live and work here but for Brits who want to live and work in Europe? What will happen to the British citizens who already live, work and study on the continent or EU citizens who have made their lives in the UK? What will it mean for the science and research funding that keeps British science at the cutting edge?\nThese are just some of the hundreds of unresolved questions. Our relationship with Europe affects our jobs and our economy, our security, our ability to tackle terrorism and climate change, and so much more. The British people have a right to know the answers and the right to have their say on whether the deal on offer is right for them, their family, their community and our country.\nIn the meantime, the government needs an opposition, and Labour has abandoned the field. Under Corbyn the party is hopelessly divided, has no plan for the economy and is clearly unfit for government. The opposition just isn't doing its job.\nSo if Labour won't, we will. We will be the real voice of opposition to the Conservative Brexit government. We will hold May to account over Brexit, expose the lies that Boris Johnson and co told during the referendum, and make sure that whatever deal they try to do is as good for the UK's economy, security and standing in the world as possible.\nAnd let me be clear: I don't believe there is any deal that May can do that will be better for Britain than being a member of the EU. So when people are given that choice, we will make the case loudly and clearly that we believe Britain should stay in the European Union.\nWe believed that Britain is better off inside the EU the day before the referendum, we believed it the day after and we believe it today. We may have lost the referendum but that doesn't change what we believe is right for the UK.\nPeople have been let down for decades by short-termist politicians who put the needs of one part of society above the rest. Now, in the wake of the Brexit vote, those divisions are more exposed than ever before. With our country facing huge challenges - from inequality and injustice to an NHS in crisis and an economy in jeopardy - we are left with a reckless, divisive and uncaring Conservative government, and Labour MPs fighting among themselves.\nThat's why the Liberal Democrats are needed more than ever. We are the real voice of opposition and the only party fighting to keep Britain open, tolerant and united.",

As a campaigner for wildlife protection I know the opportunity to influence protection at the highest level is rare.\nBefore I headed to South Africa I voted in favour of a European Parliament resolution calling for all elephants to be listed on Appendix 1 of CITES (the Convention in Trade of Endangered Species) This would mean in effect a total ban on the international trade in elephants.\nThe resolution was overwhelmingly supported by MEPs which shows the European Parliament's strong opposition to the trade in elephants and their ivory which in the past decade alone has seen the loss of 110,000 African elephants as a result of poaching and the massive global demand for ivory tusks as well as for trophy hunting.\nUnfortunately the official European Commission delegation voted against the listing of elephants on Appendix I as instructed to by the Council of European Environment ministers, effectively ignoring the wishes of the European Parliament and the hundreds of thousands of citizens who signed an online petition calling for a total ban.\nWith that said the EU has a defacto ban in place on ivory until 2017 and has said it publicly opposes the international ivory trade. But a total Appendix 1 (the highest protection offered by CITES) ban would have sent a strong message that countries have to stop selling elephant trophies and ivory immediately to allow elephant populations time to recover.\nIt is doubly saddening as the request was put forward by many of the African elephant range states from West and Central Africa as well as Kenya, so our snub to their request will send a message that yet again Europe 'knows best' in how to manage their resources.\nWhen I garnered the support of these countries at the African, Caribbean and Pacific joint parliamentary meeting to issue a declaration in for the protection of elephants in 2014 I thought we were making good progress, but a golden opportunity to end the illegal ivory trade for good has been wasted this week.\nBut I will not stop fighting to protect these most vulnerable animals. We must stop profiteering criminal groups needlessly poaching and trafficking elephant parts and hunters shooting them for the pleasure of a photograph. They are some our planet's most precious creatures and we should all be dismayed at the prospect of living on a planet where they no longer roam.\n* Catherine Bearder is the Liberal Democrat MEP for the South East",

One part of the Conservative brain espouses free trade, and the great exporting prowess of the United Kingdom.\nUntrammelled access into major markets, particularly in Europe on our doorstep.\nThe other side of the Conservative brain argues for a return to gunboat diplomacy and nineteenth century Parliamentary sovereignty.\nThese two things are un-negotiable. They are mutually incompatible. You cannot have untrammelled access to a single market which, remember, is a single market of rules, without abiding in one shape or form by those rules.\nThat is what will lead to gridlock under this hopeless government.

the SNP in Scotland, Plaid Cymru in Wales, the Green Party and UKIP.\nPolitics has changed and it has changed for the better.\nIt is more reflective of the broad range of opinions in British society.\nIn 1951 the two old parties shared 97 per cent of the vote.\nIn 2010 they couldn't muster two thirds.\nResearch has found that the result of the last election was decided by fewer than 500,000 votes.\nThat's out of nearly 40 million eligible voters.\nAnd last year more than two-thirds of MPs were elected with fewer than half the voters in their constituencies choosing them.\nThat means most of us are represented by an MP that most of us did not vote for.\nWhere is the democracy in that?\nWhere is the legitimacy in that?\nWhat was fit for the 1950s is not fit for the 21st century.\nFirst Past the Post leads to a whole host of problems.\nIt makes politicians more concerned with getting their own supporters out than to appealing to anyone else.\nIt means that MPs can go about their business without ever having to appeal to the majority of their constituents.\nSurely we can all agree that MPs should work hard for your vote.\nYet increasingly First Past the Post makes it easy for MPs to ignore you altogether.\nUnder First Past the Post, there are huge numbers of MPs with jobs for life in places where one party wins election after election and no one else stands a chance.\nIf you live in one of these places and you don't support that party, what are you supposed to do?\nYou either vote, knowing deep down your vote is wasted, or you just don't even bother.\nIt is because there are so many MPs with jobs for life that there are so many who can take their constituents for granted.\nAnd it is because there were so many MPs taking their constituents for granted that so many abused their expenses.\nThere was a clear link between how safe an MP's seat was and how likely they were to abuse the system.\nWhen a person is corrupt they should be punished.\nWhen a system makes corruption more likely it should be changed.\nSo no, First Past the Post is not working.\nIt is out of date and it is at the heart of so many of the reasons that people don't engage in or care about politics.\nIt means most MPs are elected without the support of most of the people they are supposed to represent.\nIt means millions of votes make no difference whatsoever.\nIt means millions of voices going unheard.\nFirst Past the Post is not working and it's time to do something better.\nWhy AV is better\nUnder the Alternative Vote, politicians will need to aim to get half of their constituents to choose them.\nThat means they will have to work harder to appeal to more people than before.\nIt means they will have to reach out to people who were ignored under First Past the Post.\nIt means they will no longer be able to rely on just their core supporters and ignore everyone else.\nThey will be more legitimate and will carry a stronger mandate from a broader range of people.\nThat can only be good for our democracy.\nUnder the Alternative Vote, there will be fewer MPs with jobs for life in safe seats.\nThat means people whose voices have been ignored will be listened to again.\nIt means that parties will have to compete for votes in every corner of the country and not just those few marginal seats.\nIt means more people get listened to and more respect for the different opinions and feelings we share as a nation.\nThat can only be good for our democracy.\nUnder the Alternative Vote, there need never be another wasted vote.\nThat means you can use your vote positively.\nIt means you can feel confident voting for the person or party you want to win and not have to think tactically about who can win.\nThat can only be good for our democracy.\nThe Alternative Vote puts you back in charge.\nYou get a bigger say in who your MP is. A bigger foothold in our democracy. A bigger stake in our country.\nAnd that will mean more people getting interested and involved in politics, knowing that their voices will be heard and that their actions can have a real impact.\nAnd that can only be good for our democracy.\nThe Alternative Vote is a simple change that will make a huge difference. It means MPs working harder, more voices being heard and power put back where it belongs - with you.\nTaking on critics\nOpponents of AV say it is too complicated.\nIn fact it's really simple.\nIt's as easy as 1-2-3.\nAll you do is put a number one next to the person or party you want to win.\nYou put a number two next to your second favourite and a three next to your third favourite.\nAnd if you only want to vote for one person then you can.\nThey use a form of AV in Australia and we use it to elect the Mayor of London.\nIt's not too complicated for Australians or Londoners.\nThis is not some strange, complex system. It's simple and it's fairer.\nOpponents of AV say it is somehow against British tradition.\nNonsense.\nThe beauty of the Alternative Vote is that it is evolution not revolution.\nIt's a small change which will make a big difference.\nIt not only keeps the link between MPs and their constituents, it strengthens it.\nOpponents of AV say that it will produce unstable governments.\nThis could not be further from the truth.\nThe Alternative Vote can and will produce strong, stable governments.\nResearch looking at every election since 1983 shows that if AV had been used the same party would have won and formed a Government, if with a different majority. But all MPs will have had to work harder for your vote.\nThe only election that would have resulted in a hung parliament was last year's, just as it did under First Past the Post.\nAustralia has had AV for 80 years and they've had fewer hung parliaments than we have with First Past the Post.\nSummary\nDo you remember how it felt when you heard about MPs spending your money on duck houses and having their moat cleaned?\nDo you live somewhere where the same party wins every time and you feel powerless?\nDo you ever look at politicians and parties and think these people don't care about me?\nThat's what this is about.\nWe deserve something different.\nWe deserve something better.\nWe deserve a new way of doing things.\nFirst Past the Post doesn't work any more.\nIt leaves too many voices unheard.\nIt leaves too many people powerless.\nIt is at the heart of why so many people don't vote.\nThe Alternative vote is better, fairer.\nIt puts you back in charge and makes MPs work harder for your vote.\nWhen we have the chance to clean up politics and make our democracy better we should take it.\nWe have the opportunity to do that in May by voting Yes to Fairer Votes.\nThank you.",

Six High Peak members have already made the short trip to the Hazel Grove office in Romiley but many more need to get over there by Thursday. Please go to Lisa Smart's shop at 34 Stockport Rd, Romiley SK6 3AA tel 07816 204762. Hopefully, helping to secure LD wins in the Grove will then add to our total UK-wide council victories and boost our Parliamentary byelection campaign at Tiverton & Honiton. I have already been helping in Hazel Grove and will shortly be starting\nStuart Roberts who is a former Conservative councillor and outgoing deputy president of the National Farmers' Union. And earlier this week, he joined the Liberal Democrats and said:-\nIt's just a few weeks until polling day, but don't worry, we have plenty of resources and training to help make sure you are ready.\nI've just arrived at the airport in Krakow following my trip to Eastern Poland, where I spent time meeting refugees fleeing Ukraine and the charities supporting them.\nLots of local parties across the region have mentioned that they'd like to engage more young active members, so we're giving something a bit different a try.\nAs liberals, we believe that true equality is achieved when individuals are not only free from prejudice and discrimination, but also free to fulfil their potential. So fighting for LGBTQ+ rights is not a choice Liberals make.\nThe Liberal Democrats' bold plan to restore UK leadership in science and innovation will drive investment, boost global collaboration, and ensure technology benefits everyone, not just the privileged few.\nReflecting on the year’s International Women’s Day theme of “accelerate action”, I am sadly reminded of how much more we still need to achieve.",

But Mr Corbyn's party holds onto its lead in the region as the Tory share of the vote fell from 34 to 26 per cent over the same period.\nThe North-East recorded the strongest support for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party at 19 per cent - up 15 points from Ukip's 4 per cent in 2017.\nIn the West Midlands, Tories extended their six-point lead over Labour in 2017 to 20 points on 43 per cent (down six) to Labour's 23 (down 20). Lib Dems were up 10 points to 14 per cent and Brexit Party were on 12.\nA similar pattern was recorded in the East Midlands, where Labour shed 19 points since 2017 to 22 per cent, 23 points behind Tories on 45 per cent (down six). Lib Dems were on 15 per cent and Brexit Party 12.\nIn the south, Liberal Democrats appeared to establish themselves as the main challengers to Tories outside London.\nIn the South-East - where Ms Swinson's party are targeting a number of Remain-voting Tory commuter belt seats - Lib Dems were up 12 points since the last election to 23 per cent, ahead of Labour on 16 (down 13) and the Brexit Party on 12, but still a long way behind Tories on 41 (down 13).\nLib Dems were on 21 per cent in the South-West (up 6), pulling ahead of Labour on 17 (down 12) and Brexit Party on 13, with Tories maintaining a comfortable lead on 41 per cent (down 10).\nAnd in the East of England, Lib Dems were up 10 points since 2017 to 18 per cent, one point ahead of Labour on 17 (down 16) and four ahead of the Brexit Party on 14, but still well behind Conservatives on 45 (down 10).\nOnly in London did Labour record a comfortable lead of 10 points over Tories, but even in the capital its rating was 16 points down from the 55 per cent recorded in 2017, on 39 per cent. The Conservatives were down four on 29 per cent and Lib Dems up 10 on 19 per cent.\nIn Wales, Labour had lost 20 points since 2017 but maintained a bare one-point lead on 29 per cent to Tories' 28, with the Brexit Party in third place on 15, Plaid Cymru on 12 and Lib Dems on 12.\nNicola Sturgeon's Scottish National Party consolidated its dominance north of the border, increasing their share of the vote from 37 per cent in 2017 to 42 per cent now. Tory support fell seven points to 22 per cent and Labour slumped 15 points to 12 per cent, while Lib Dems put on six points to 13 per cent.\nGreens improved on their 2017 performance in every part of the country, scoring 7 per cent in the North-East, Yorkshire & Humber, West Midlands and the South-West.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_how-super-lib-dem-mps-contributed-to-super-saturday/content_395.html": "How super Lib Dem MPs contributed to Super Saturday\nHere are the Lib Dem contributions from our MPs in \"Super Saturday\" debates.\nFirst up was Jo, basically telling the Prime Minister that he was too feart to put his deal to the people:\nThe Prime Minister's deal removes protections on workers' rights. It puts a border down the Irish sea and, according to the Government's own analysis, will damage our economy on a scale greater than the financial crash. Today, hundreds of thousands of people will be outside demanding a final say in a people's vote. Is not it the truth that the reason why the Prime Minister refuses their calls is that he knows that, if given the option, the people will reject his bad deal and choose to remain in the European Union?\nWhich he didn't answer, of course.\nThen Luciana tackled him on the fact that the Government hadn't even provided back of a cigarette packet figures for how the deal would impact on the economy:\nThe Prime Minister's Brexit Secretary was on television this morning. He confirmed that no economic analysis of the deal has been done. I ask the House to let that sink in: no economic analysis of the deal, on which we are all expected to vote today, has been done. How does the Prime Minister anticipate that Members on all sides the House can, in good faith, be expected to vote on a deal today that will impact on our country for decades to come?\nAnswer came there none.\nAnd the same when Sarah Wollaston had a go later:\nEvidence matters, Prime Minister. How can he possibly assure our constituents that this is a good deal if he has not carried out an economic impact assessment of what it will cost them? If he has carried that out, why on earth are we not able to see it as we debate this today?\nTom Brake challenged him to rule out leaving at the end of the transition period without a deal:\nWould the Prime Minister agree to pass an Act making it unlawful for us to leave at the end of the transition phase without a deal?\nAnd he refused to do so. Quelle surprise. But look at what he said, while thanking ministers and civil servants for procuring the deal:\nI respectfully say to the right hon. Gentleman that I do not think their position has been made easier by measures passed in the name of the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn). Not a good idea!\nA bit of a contradiction since he's been hailing this brilliant deal he brought back with the Benn Act in place.\nVince had a go later on:\nFollowing the earlier question from the right hon. Member for South West Hertfordshire (Mr Gauke), the Prime Minister will know that there is a great deal of anxiety in the business community that it faces a cliff edge at the end of next year. Will he reiterate what seemed to be his assurance that the transition will be extended until his free trade agreement has been concluded?\nThe Prime Minister's responded:\nI, frankly, am not as worried as he is, because I think we will do a great free trade deal by then.\nSo that's all right then.\nThen it came on to speeches in the debate itself. We got one and it went to Tom Brake who talked about how each household would be worse off to the tune of two grand and why that merited a people's vote :\nWe have reached the fork in the road. We must now choose. Do we choose the route that leads us to an outward-looking, confident nation, punching above its weight in a European Union battling for liberal values in a world that is increasingly illiberal, isolationist and belligerent? That course guarantees that EU citizens, many of whom have lived here since the 1960s and '70s, will not have to worry about proving they are entitled to healthcare and provides for their UK counterparts in the EU, who will not need to fret over what action to take should the time-limited six months of healthcare guaranteed by our Government expire. Or do we let ourselves be led by a colourful pied piper who chose his path and this deal not out of any conviction that his path was just, rational or economically beneficial for our nation, but because he believed it was the most secure way to achieve his own ambition.\nDo we meekly follow a man whose \"excellent\" deal, according to such Government analysis as they have been willing to make available, will leave each household at least £2,000 worse off and hit British jobs and living standards with the ferocity of the austerity triggered by the 2008 crash? This deal, as the Prime Minister confirmed in his rather rambling and dissembling contribution, may not survive the transition period and could still lead to a no-deal crash-out.\nDo we follow in the footsteps of a man who, just a month ago, claimed to a rapturous DUP gathering that the \"precious Union\" was \"in good shape\", but a month later dealt the Union a hammer blow that could shatter it within just a couple of years? Are we so afraid of our own shadow and so lacking in confidence in our capacity to work the EU system to our advantage, as we have successfully done for decades, that we have to fall back on a nostalgic vision of empire and a buccaneering Britain.\nThat is the choice in front of us today. I hope that we choose the former path. It would require one further step-a people's vote-to give the people the final say. That would be the democratic way-a way supported by the hundreds of thousands of people over there in Parliament Square as we speak. That is the only way to stop the Brexit rot in its tracks and put this issue to bed. I urge all Members to follow that path, vote for the amendment and reject this calamitous deal.\nBut others made interventions. Here's Luciana on economic analysis again:\nI thank the Secretary of State for very kindly giving way. He has used the word \"scrutiny\" on a number of occasions in his contribution so far, yet he was on BBC News this morning confirming that no economic analysis has been done on the deal presented to the House today. [Interruption.] Government Members may shake their heads, but how can this House be expected to vote on something so fundamental to the future of our country without that analysis?\nAnd Norman Lamb referred to how agonising the choice had been for him and highlighted how bad this was for the balance between the communities in Northern Ireland:\nI have really agonised this week over whether to support this deal, and it has been profoundly difficult. Does the shadow Secretary of State share my concern with regard to Northern Ireland that by disturbing the careful balance within the Good Friday agreement between the two communities, we run the risk of inflaming Unionist opinion in potentially a very dangerous way, just, in a sense, as the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) made clear in his intervention?\nSam Gyimah asked Peter Kyle highlighted how the differences of opinion even among Brexiteers meant that we needed a People's Vote.\nI have been listening to the hon. Gentleman with interest. Does he agree that though the referendum settled the question of leaving, it did not settle where we were going? That is why the House has, over the last three and a half years, debated different ways of leaving the EU. Some people believe in the May deal; some want a May deal minus backstop; some want a Northern Ireland backstop; some want a customs union; some want no deal; and some want a managed no deal. Does he agree that that is why any deal that the Government put before us should be put to the people for a final say?\nFinally, for the second time, Jo was greeted with jeers when she got up to speak to raise a Point of Order at the end. And twice the Speaker intervened on her behalf to say she must be heard.\nIt's very reminiscent of the way Charles Kennedy was treated during the Iraq War. And he was right, too.\nFurther to that point of order, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister's deal was a bad deal, and the public deserve to have the final say-not just the hundreds of thousands who are marching outside, but the millions of people across our country. [Interruption.]\nAnd the people who are outside this building right now will be heard, and they deserve the final say, along with millions across the country. The most urgent thing right now is that the Prime Minister complies with the law, and I ask your guidance. Would it be possible to suspend the sitting for a short time to allow the Prime Minister to go and send his letter, and come back and make a statement to the House to confirm that he has done so?\nWe know how that one ended up…",

It was immediately evident when EMAS held the public consultation on the 'one size fits all' proposal that it would be detrimental to rural areas like High Peak. It is a shame the board has caused so much concern and heartache for residents and staff over the last few months despite assurances that the original proposals would be revised.\"\nOriginally concerns were raised by New Mills County Cllr Beth Atkins 12 months ago over the poor response times, particularly in central High Peak, stressing that it was literally \"a matter of life and death for High Peak residents\". And speaking to a senior EMAS manager 4 months ago she was told that the board would be rethinking its options.\nBorough Cllrs Ray Atkins and David Lomax were the only High Peak councillors to attend an open consultation meeting held by EMAS on 11th March. \"This was a perfect opportunity to emphasise the need for a daily service hub and community posts across High Peak.

As we know from the cinema, they drove their ill-gotten gains in a rickety car over a state border across which the local police could not pursue them. Faced by this new motorised threat, the Congress in Washington DC created a police force which could cross frontiers. They called it the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI.\nThis is the same stage reached by the EU. The internal borders of the EU are open. Criminals, including gangs such as the Mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, the Camorra, Russian and Albanian and Chinese gangs, operate freely across our open borders, dealing in drugs and illegal immigrants, and plenty more. They invest their proceeds in property in Germany and Britain and elsewhere.\nIn Europe there are more than 500 separate police forces. None of them can cross an open border in pursuit. Over a hundred of these forces are in the UK, mostly separate county forces. In my region of the East Midlands, Derbyshire Constabulary cannot cross into Nottinghamshire or into Manchester.\nToday is a good time to be a cross-border criminal in Europe.\nSurely InterPol stops them? InterPol is a centre in Lyons that shares intelligence with other police forces around the world. It does this effectively, but has no powers to go into the streets to pursue and arrest criminals. The EU has its own intelligence-sharing centre, EuroPol, at The Hague. EuroPol exchanges information between Europe's police forces, with observers present from allies around the world. Its director for nine years was British, Rob Wainwright.\nIn the European Parliament I created an all-party group of MEPs who worked on this in the 2009-14 parliament before I was ejected by voters. Since then the Commission in Brussels have announced that they are preparing a formal proposal to create an FBI.\nTo create a European FBI will require a lot of groundwork. There are no federal EU criminal laws. It is not a crime to drive stolen money across borders in Europe. Nor are there federal European prisons or criminal courts, but in the meantime national facilities are available.\nTo create a federal FBI for Europe would more than pay for itself. Major crimes would be reduced. Fines would be collected. Economic confidence and jobs would benefit. The gains surely outweigh the costs.\nWhat should be the British attitude to a European FBI? Since we believe we have the best police in the world, we might lead it. Could there possibly be a British objection? In an increasingly inter-connected world, the solution is not \"sovereignty\" but more inter-connected cooperation.\nBritain should be leading from the front on this vital crime fighting project. Brexit will only take us a further step away.\nBill Newton Dunn is a Liberal Democrat MEP for the East Midlands",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_this-is-still-a-racist-country-lib-dem-leadership-candidate-jo-swinson-speaks-to-the-new-european/content_527.html": "'This is still a racist country' - Lib Dem leadership candidate Jo Swinson speaks to The New European\nTIM WALKER meets Lib Dem leadership candidate Jo Swinson to talk about the challenges facing liberalism, coalition mistakes and... Brexit\nI ask Jo Swinson why she should lead the Liberal Democrats and she takes a deep breath and manages to get it out in all of three sentences. \"I'm the best person to lead the movement because I can reach out to new voters, through traditional broadcast media, where I have a high profile, and through social media, where I have a high following.\nI also think I can reach out across the generations and across the country. I have cross-party relationships and a non-tribal style, which I think is exactly what we need at the moment.\"\nThe youngest member of the House of Commons when she was first elected in 2005 at the age of just 25, Swinson still retains all of her youthful enthusiasm and energy, and, as a child of the new media age, she puts great emphasis on getting the message out by all means possible, which is what she would appear to believe gives her an edge over Sir Ed Davey, her sole rival for the top job in their party.\nWhen I met her at her office in Westminster last week, she took great pride in listing all of her radio and television appearances since the beginning of the leadership campaign, including Politics Live, Question Time, LBC, Talk Radio, Radio 2, The Andrew Marr Show, Today (\"twice\"), Newsnight, Good Morning Britain, BBC Breakfast, Channel 4 News and Sky.\nIf there is only one thing in the world worse for any political party than being talked about, it's not being talked about, and the Lib Dems, on a high after the EU elections and some game-changing opinion polls, are pushing hard for the BBC in particular to give Swinson and Davey the opportunity to have a proper leaders' debate. Swinson tells me that so far the closest they are likely to come to achieving it are spots on Politics Live and/or the morning Victoria Derbyshire show.\nI have to say that any encounter between the pair is unlikely to make for especially scintillating television, as, in true Lib Dem style, the contest between the two is being conducted in a determinedly civilised, if not actually chummy, way. Swinson is quick to concede that Davey is \"talented\" and that - given their party still has only 11 MPs - she knows, as he does, that no matter who wins, they will have to work together.\nWhat criticism Swinson has faced so far in the contest has come not from her opponent, but, perhaps predictably, the Daily Mail. The tabloid felt the need to re-examine her role in investigating the allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female activists that were made against Lord Rennard, a former chief executive and campaign director of the Lib Dems. I give Swinson the opportunity to put the record straight.\nIn difficult circumstances, she feels that she did the most she could have done. An internal inquiry found in 2014 that the claims made by various women against Rennard were \"broadly credible\", but not proved beyond reasonable doubt. Rennard, for his part, apologised if he had \"inadvertently encroached\" upon \"personal space\".\nSwinson was made aware of the allegations in 2007, and she says, in retrospect, she wished she had more support from the powers-that-be in the party, in terms of addressing the issue at the time. \"We were right to have changed our processes since then because they were absolutely inadequate.\n\"The way it worked at our party headquarters was that the complaints ended up with the chief executive, so it was obviously unsatisfactory that he should deal with a complaint against himself. He had far too much power within our party. On reflection, one thing I would do very differently now is to strongly encourage someone to make a formal written complaint at the outset, which should have happened in relation to Rennard.\n\"The bottom line is the women that were involved are by and large no longer members of the party and that I find really frustrating. Rennard, for his part, shows, so far as I can see, no remorse, no contrition for what happened and he remains a Lib Dem peer. That shows how badly it was handled.\"\nScotland's Sunday Mail has, meanwhile, suggested Swinson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, has been guilty of hypocrisy because she accepted donations running into thousands of pounds from Mark Patterson, a director of a company with fracking licences, and that she voted, during the coalition years, against a moratorium on fracking.\n\"That is basically a cheap smear, not really based on the facts,\" she counters. \"I am anti-fracking. We are talking here about a donation from an individual who is a long-time supporter of the party, and not a company, and, by the way, 80% of the work that his company is involved with concerns renewable energy. I was a government minster when the fracking vote came up and it was an issue, quite simply, of collective responsibility.\"\nSwinson accepts that mistakes were made by the Lib Dems during the coalition years - she regrets not merely the broken pledge on tuition fees, but also having to vote for the iniquitous 'bedroom tax', which her party subsequently announced their intention to scrap in their 2017 general election manifesto.\nOverall, however, she feels their achievements, such as same sex marriage, the green investment bank, helping people on low incomes, the pupil premium pledge, tackling payday lenders and so on, means the party has every reason to feel pride in their years in office.\nIt is the here and now that obviously concerns Swinson the most and heading off a disastrous no-deal Brexit will necessarily have to be her number one priority if she becomes her party's leader. It disappoints her enormously that the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn simply didn't bother to turn up at a lot of the cross-party meetings that she attended with Sir Vince Cable to try to find a way out of the worsening chaos - \"I think of him as missing in action,\" she says - and now she feels the only answer to the deadlock is a People's Vote.\nLike Davey, she sees no obvious advantage in a merger with the Greens, but would be happy to welcome pro-Remain MPs from the Labour and Tory benches. I ask her if she feels impatient with them when, after three years, their positions on Brexit remain so fundamentally irreconcilable with their leaders. \"I understand how they don't want to give up on their parties. That is in many ways an admirable thing.\"\nI wonder if there was a single Tory leadership candidate that she could have envisaged doing business with and she says she was disappointed that Sam Gyimah, with his clear commitment to a People's Vote, had to withdraw because he could muster so little support in his party.\n\"That tells you a lot about the Conservatives - that someone offering the public a chance to have their say didn't even get past the first round,\" she says. She adds that for the Conservatives the issue they had with Gyimah was primarily his stance on a People's Vote, but she is not blasé about the challenges that black people face in public life generally and cites the abuse that Labour's Diana Abbott has had to go through in recent years.\n\"I recognise that ours is still a racist country. We have not dealt with those issues as much as we would have liked to, even if there has been progress in some areas. I would hope that one day soon we could have a black leader of a political party.\n\"Ours should be a country where every individual has an opportunity to thrive.

The County's Tory administration want to close seven care homes across Derbyshire and Goyt Valley House is the one singled out for closure here in the High Peak.\nThe Tories are making various dubious claims about the physical condition of these care homes, all underwritten by the totally false statement that the need for care homes is declining. The latter allegation flies in the face of the fact that the numbers of people in the population living into their eighties and nineties is at an all-time high.\nThe specific case of Goyt Valley House could also be seen as a deliberate snub to us in the High Peak Liberal Democrats. It may be more than coincidence that the catchment area for this particular Care Home happens to cover ALL the Borough and County seats held by Lib Dem Councillors in the High Peak - Cllr Beth Atkins' New Mills/Hayfield County Division ; Cllr Edith Longden's Blackbrook Borouch Ward (Chinley & Buxworth); Cllr Ray Atkins' New Mills West Borough Ward and Cllr David Lomax's Whaley Bridge Borough Ward.\nThe Protest March begins at Goyt Valley House in Jubilee Street, New Mills SK22 4PA at 11am. It finishes about half a mile away at New Mills Town Hall which is on the corner of Spring Bank and Hall Street.

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_brexit-chaos-could-change-the-political-map-of-britain/content_392.html": "Brexit chaos could change the political map of Britain\nThe Liberal Democrat victory in the Richmond Park byelection could be just the first of many electoral aftershocks that could reconfigure the electoral landscape\nGood news had been in short supply for Lib Dems over the previous 18 months, so when some hugely encouraging data arrived at their byelection headquarters in Richmond last Wednesday morning, the reaction was one of excitement coupled with scepticism. Party strategists had just received the results of internal polling showing they had pulled ahead of Zac Goldsmith, the former Tory MP turned independent, with 24 hours to go until voting began.\nGoldsmith, a hardline pro-Brexiter who had quit the Conservatives over the decision to expand Heathrow airport, had won a 23,000 majority at last year's general election and was still a popular figure locally. But if this data was correct his reputation would count for nothing and a party that came close to being obliterated at last year's general election was on course for a byelection sensation to rival any in British political history.\nThe small Lib Dem team led by campaign manager James Lillis studied the figures and wondered how to respond. One of the first rules of campaigning is never to appear too confident. Releasing them might give the impression that the party thought it had victory in the bag. But this was not proving to be an ordinary byelection in any sense and did not necessarily require stock responses. It had already broken all the rules. Over previous days Lillis's team had amassed solid evidence that many thousands of voters were shunning traditional party loyalties and deciding their votes not according to their views on issues like Heathrow or the NHS - but in line with what they thought about the biggest issue of the day - Brexit.\nThe Lib Dems had run their entire campaign in this wealthy part of west London suburbia, in which 72% of people had voted Remain on June 23, on an anti hard-Brexit message. \"For the first time I can remember we were not the pot-hole party. We were promoting our views on the EU, on internationalism, tolerance, what sort of country we want to be,\" said one party insider.\nTory Remainers had told them on doorsteps that they would vote Lib Dem because they disapproved of Theresa May's hard Brexit approach. Labour supporters were doing the same wanting to send an anti-hard Brexit message. The Greens and Women's Equality Party had not run candidates and instead had backed the Lib Dems, forging a fledgling progressive pro-EU alliance. A few Labour supporters had even campaigned for the Lib Dem candidate Sarah Olney.\nDespite all the positive feedback, the Lib Dems were far from sure. The mood was too unusual, too volatile. A decision was reached that they needed to instil confidence that the shift was real and they could actually win, so, departing from all precedent, they put out the data. \"We had never leaked polling of this kind before,\" said an insider. \"But because we had to overcome a 23,000 majority, probably the biggest barrier was simply that people didn't believe we could do it. We needed to show that progressive voters were responding to our message that Britain should remain open, tolerant and united. It worked. In the last day Zac Goldsmith's team just seemed to crumble. On polling day we were out from 5am delivering 'good morning' leaflets and were still out at 10pm knocking up our supporters. We got our vote out.\"\nIn the early hours of Friday morning the grin on Olney's face was so broad that at times she struggled to get the words out in her victory speech. She had overturned Goldsmith's huge majority and beaten him by 1,872 votes. Brexit had changed everything. Labour, which had argued internally over to whether to field a candidate at all but eventually did, saw its man Christian Wolmar lose his deposit and receive fewer votes (1,515) than it had local members (1,600).\nLater voters began to explain why they had switched from Goldsmith to the unknown politically inexperienced accountant Sarah Olney. \"It was a shame, really. Zac was always really diligent,\" said Susannah, a young mother who did not not give surname, on the school run in Mortlake. \"But the Brexit stuff was the most important issue. Lots of people here still can't really believe Brexit is happening. It was much harder to vote for Zac knowing he'd supported the people who got us here. It's made a lot of people like me change our votes.\"\nDown the road in North Kingston, Andrée Frieze, who was the Greens' candidate at the 2015 general election, said his party's decision not to stand, and instead to back Olney, was a sign of how narrow party interests and loyalties were giving way to new alliances and a fight for what mattered most. \"Brexit was absolutely the main issue on the doorstep here in Richmond,\" Frieze said. \"Zac had been really popular, and if the Greens had run, this election would have felt the same as any other. But because we didn't and explained why, people felt they could vote Lib Dem again. This wasn't about the person, it wasn't about the party, it was about the bigger picture. People told me that voting Lib Dem this time round - when people like me weren't running - made them feel part of a team.\"\nThis weekend all the main parties are grappling with the implications of the Richmond Park result. While it is an unusual seat, home to an uncommonly high number of well-heeled, well-educated Remain voters, and the election was triggered by the special circumstances of Goldsmith's resignation, it has single-handedly revived the Lib Dems' morale and sense of purpose as the anti-hard Brexit party. The question now is whether Brexit can have a similar transformative effect elsewhere. Tim Farron, the party leader, wasted no time in declaring that his party was \"back in the big time\". The Lib Dems are now eyeing up other seats in the south, and installing candidates where they have strong local roots and are second to the Tories, in case of an early general election or more byelections. They claim Richmond will not be a one-off and cite their success in David Cameron's former seat of Witney, in Oxfordshire, where they leapfrogged Labour and Ukip into second place in October, as evidence that they are now the party of the 48%.\nFor Theresa May and the Tories, despite their assertion that Richmond changes nothing, it is a warning shot that Brexit is shifting the landscape, in profound, if very different, ways across the country. May's already wafer-thin Commons majority has been cut to just 14, and if more byelection losses were to follow, her ability to govern effectively would be called ever more into doubt. Today, a group of former Tory ministers and senior MPs warn that if the prime minister panders too much to anti-EU hardliners, the party will lose middle ground voters en masse as they did in Richmond, and risk defeat at the next general election.\nThe tactical counter to that is that a soft Brexit will deliver ammunition to Ukip, under its new leader Paul Nuttall, particularly in the Midlands and the north where they pose a threat to both the Tories and Labour. For Labour the dilemmas are just as acute. They were never expected to do well in Richmond, but their miserable tally of votes there has sounded loud alarm bells nonetheless. The fear among Labour MPs is that the party led by Jeremy Corbyn, a lukewarm supporter of the EU but a keen advocate of free movement and defender of immigration, risks being trampled between a newly resurgent Lib Dem party in pro-Remain seats in urban areas and the south, and Ukip in Leave strongholds. As one senior Labour MP put it: \"Our leader seems to be anti-markets and lukewarm about the EU on the one hand, yet gives an unqualified pro-immigration message on the other. It is the worst of both worlds electorally.\" Yesterday, in a speech in Prague, Corbyn said it was vital that parties on the left did not respond to the surge of rightwing populism by scapegoating refugees and migrant workers, again refusing to be allied to those in his party who argue it is a problem that needs addressing.\nAttention is now turning to another byelection this Thursday in the Tory-held Lincolnshire seat of Sleaford and North Hykeham, caused by the resignation of Stephen Phillips, a Brexit supporter who stood down because he thought parliament should be consulted more on the terms of departure. In this seat 62% of people voted for Leave. The electoral dynamics are therefore in many way the reverse of those in Richmond.\nThe Tories have another huge majority (more than 24,000) with Labour second at the 2015 election and Ukip narrowly behind in third. The Tories should hold on. But the fear in Labour circles is that they could be overtaken by Ukip. After he was voted in as leader last Monday Nuttall declared that his ambition was \"to replace the Labour party and make Ukip the patriotic voice of working people.\" Thursday is his first test.\nLast week, at the outermost edge of the constituency, a group of Labour activists made a lonely picket outside Grantham Hospital's A&E unit, which is now closed overnight. They were joined for half an hour by Jon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, and the party's local candidate, binman Jim Clarke. Clarke says Labour should do well in this area but even the party faithful doubt his prospects. \"Who knows if we can beat Ukip the way things are going,\" said David Taylor, a Labour member. \"If people are voting Ukip, then we really need to look at what we're doing as a party.\"\nDown the road in Sleaford, Jack Croll is campaigning for Ukip. \"We'll beat Labour,\" he says. \"That's easy. I don't like giving money away, for a start. Do you? [He means to the EU.] The other issue, of course, is all this immigration. Where I come from it's absolutely spinning with immigrants. That needs to stop.\"\nVictoria Ayling, a well-spoken former barrister and county councillor standing for Ukip, said local residents across the heavily rural constituency had had enough of the two main parties, and that even Clarke's impeccable working-class credentials couldn't save Labour here.\nFor Theresa May, as for Labour, there are difficult if not impossible balances to be struck. Whichever line the Tories take on Brexit, part of their support base will be angered. Last week there were signs of May moving away from a hard Brexit - something that will please moderate Tories but alarm the right of her party. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, suggested as much when he said that the government might be prepared to pay into the EU budget in order to stay in the single market. Eurosceptics reacted with horror, saying there should be no backtracking and that voters would be appalled if money still went to Brussels to pay for a Brexit lite. Ukip piled in, saying the great betrayal was under way.\nThis week 11 judges will begin hearing the government's appeal in the supreme court over whether Parliament must approve the triggering of the Brexit process. If it is defeated the battle over Brexit will be fought out in parliament over the coming months. Already Brexit has altered the landscape as uncertainty prevails over the direction it will take.\nBack in Richmond a Lib Dem worker celebrated on Friday saying that his party, and perhaps Ukip, were the only ones with reasons to be hopeful amid the Brexit chaos. \"We are the only ones who offer any clarity. The Tories and Labour are divided over Brexit and we are united. It is a big chance for both parties.\"",

I promise not to throw any fire extinguishers.\nThat depends on who you think should pay for higher education. The government's plans to raise tuition fees, coupled with slashing university budgets, will transfer a great deal of the cost from the taxpayer to the individual graduate.\nYou may think that's fair. But even if you don't like the idea of subsidising kids to spend three years skipping class and downing vodka, there is more that may cause you disquiet. Lord Browne, the former BP chief executive who investigated the issue for the government, has proposed a market vision for higher education in which stronger universities can expand, weaker ones will contract and the money will follow the individual student.\nThis is fine if a student can make informed choices, but in practice it might end up simply rewarding those universities that are most prestigious. Prestige does not always equate with a good service to students; high ratings for research don't always mean that academics are keen to educate the next generation. Watch out for a future in which universities engage in noisy PR campaigns and aggressive expansion, because they fear the alternative is extinction.\nRemind me, how will the proposed system work?\nAt the moment, top-up fees are £3,290 a year for undergraduates at English universities. Universities will be allowed to charge £6,000 a year, or up to £9,000 in what the Government describes as \"exceptional cases\". Actually, it's hard to see £9,000 as the exception. There will be a strong financial incentive for universities to charge as much as they can after the government outlined plans to cut state funding for higher education in its spending review. No one will have to pay the fees upfront.\nBut could you pay upfront?\nYes and then you wouldn't have to worry about accruing interest. Arguably, this favours the rich, although business secretary Vince Cable suggested this might also apply to thrifty students who worked on a building site for a year to raise money in advance. Most students will carry on doing what they do now. That is, borrowing from the taxpayer and paying it back after they graduate.\nAnd for the rest?\nNo one will have to pay anything back until they are earning more than £21,000. At the moment the repayment threshold is £15,000. Graduates will pay 9% of their income above this threshold. To counter fears that graduates with a lucrative City job would be able to repay their loans rapidly and escape interest payments, the government is proposing a penalty for early repayment. There are no details of this yet. Graduates will pay interest on their loans, of a maximum of inflation plus 3%. Any outstanding repayments will be written off after 30 years, so graduates with low lifetime earnings will be protected.\nWhat about maintenance grants?\nStudents from families with incomes up to £25,000 will be entitled to a grant of up to £3,250. The government will save money by cutting maintenance grants for students from wealthier households - the current threshold of £50,000 will be reduced to £42,600. Loans will still be available. There will also be scholarships for bright students from poor homes. A fund worth £150m will be set up, and universities charging more than £6,000 a year in fees will be required to participate. The government is consulting on the details - but it is likely to focus on teenagers who get the new pupil premium when they are at school.\nIs there not a better alternative?\nThe National Union of Students proposes a graduate tax, with no variation in fees. The money raised would not go to the Treasury but would be paid into a trust controlled by the higher education sector, which would be independent of government. Bonds would be issued to raise money on financial markets, against future income from graduates. Critics, including Browne, say a graduate tax breaks the link between students and the university; there will be no incentive for universities to improve the student experience.\nHow are Labour doing on this?\nWell, its leader and shadow chancellor don't see eye to eye on this one. Ed Miliband favours a graduate tax, but Alan Johnson, who introduced top-up fees as Blair's higher education minister, has publicly disagreed.\nWe have had top-up fees for years; why are students suddenly so angry?\nThe fees being proposed now are much higher. They are also concerned about the cuts to teaching budgets, which will fall hardest on arts subjects because sciences are regarded as priority for economic growth.\nSo will we have the most expensive state universities in the world?\nYes. Taking figures from 2006/07, Iceland charges students US$6,449 a year (£4,000). Public universities in the US charge $5,943 (£3,752). However, a third in the US go to private universities, where the average fees are $21,979 (£13,900). (But at least the elite US universities have lavish bursaries to meet the full cost of fees.)\nEr, should we feel proud of that?\nWell, England does have some of the world's best universities. Oxford and Cambridge are ranked joint sixth in a league table published by the Times Higher Education supplement. Imperial College London is ranked ninth.\nWill poorer teenagers be put off going to university?\nThis will be a social experiment - no one knows. There's no evidence that the introduction of top-up fees in 2006 deterred students from poorer homes. In fact, in the last five years there has been a sustained increase in the number of young people from more deprived parts of the country attending university. But there is still a big gulf between rich and poor. Children from wealthier homes are far more likely to go to university than poorer kids. And this divide is sharpest when it comes to the most competitive universities - the ones expected to charge the highest fees.\nWill our universities go private?\nIf state funding for teaching dries up, there may be a temptation for some elite universities to go private so they can charge very high fees and ignore government targets on widening access. There was speculation last month that Cambridge is considering the possibility of going private, while the LSE's governing body recently studied a finance paper on the implications of declining government money.\nShouldn't we be more angry about the abolition of the education maintenance allowance?\nFor some teenagers the EMA, a weekly payment of up to £30 for 16- to 18-year-olds with a household income of less than £30,810, is essential to pay for travel to college. The government says it will be replaced by \"more targeted support\". The thinktank Policy Exchange argued in 2008 that the EMA should be scrapped, saying the payment only had a \"minimal\" impact on participation - and that when the school-leaving age is raised to 18 in a few years' time, it will be defunct anyway. An assessment by the Institute for Fiscal Studies disagreed. It said that the EMA did increase participation, particularly among young men. One of the Policy Exchange paper's authors, Sam Freedman, is now education secretary Michael Gove's policy adviser.\nWhat's to stop graduates bunking off abroad?\nYou won't escape repayments by moving overseas. Not unless you change your identity. If you have no appetite for life on the run, it's probably not worth the hassle. If you are planning to live abroad for more than three months, you have to inform the student loans company, as there may be a different threshold for loan repayment. The repayment threshold if you move to Poland is £9,000, for example.\nWon't Scottish universities suddenly become super popular? They are free, aren't they?\nThey are free for Scots, and other EU nationals. But English undergraduates have to pay £1,820 a year (£2,895 for medicine). There has been a rise in the number of English students heading north but there have been reports that the Scottish government - which is due to publish a green paper on higher education next month - will raise fees for English students to bring them into line.\nHow did we get into this position? Are too many people going to university?\nCurrently, 45% of young people go on to higher education. That's up from 39% 10 years ago - and just 6% 50 years ago. We've moved from a system where education for a tiny elite was funded by every taxpayer, to a system in which increasing numbers go to university every year in an expansion encouraged by Labour. Since 2006, the government has limited student numbers. That has led to a great deal of frustration; one in three of those who applied for places this year did not get in. That's not just a shame for the individual candidates; our future prosperity depends on having a highly skilled workforce. Other developed countries are desperate to raise university participation; Obama wants at least 60% of Americans to have a college degree by 2020.\nIs the idea to put students off ?\nNo, the reverse. Ministers argue that their proposals will allow an expansion of the system by transferring more of the cost from the taxpayer to the individual graduate. The scale of fees may be daunting, but the government believes students are aware of the increased earning potential conferred by a good degree.\nWhat about two-year courses? Are they a good thing? Will they be looked down on by employers?\nTwo-year degrees would keep costs down; a university might charge £7,000 a year for intensive teaching rather than £6,000 annually for a three-year course. Some students might welcome the combination of smaller debts and a chance to get into the workplace faster. There are already condensed four-year medical degrees open to graduate applicants - and these are regarded as an equally legitimate route.\nBut three-year degrees are likely to remain the gold standard. Any university crafting a two-year degree will have to work hard to overcome suspicion that it is just a cheap option.\nHow come university is free in France?\nHigher education is funded by the state, and tuition fees are very low. Some universities are free - and even pay a salary to students. To say the sector is resistant to reform is an understatement; politicians have feared the power of student protest since 1968.\nIs it true their universities are rubbish?\nYes, for the most part. France has a two-tier system - the highly competitive grande écoles, which train the future elite, and the facultés, which forbid selection but are overcrowded and run-down. President Sarkozy wants to allow universities more independence and access to private funding. Meanwhile, plenty of French students are coming here to study",

Governments have recognised this in delivering our public services and in fostering multiculturalism. However, when it comes to how we vote for our politicians, we have been stuck with first past the post, and left with the patronisingly simple option of submitting a single cross.\nExperts of voting behaviour in the past would have explained voting outcomes through 'class'. Nearly everybody voted either Labour or Conservative. For example, during every election of the 1950s, at least 90% voted for the two main parties. Now barely two-thirds do. 'Class', thank goodness, is not what it used to be; it was only suitable in an era when society carved itself up into simple sectors: rich or poor, left or right. First past the post ignores the fact that in this modern age people define themselves in a multitude of ways. Put simply, the system is no longer fit for purpose.\nThe choice available to the public has been widened with the emergence of new parties, as well as some notable independents. Under the alternative vote, people will be able to exercise the choice available to them without wasting their votes. At the last election, most people ended up with MPs they didn't vote for, who represented a minority of votes. Under AV, candidates will need to reach out to their entire electorate to ensure they are approved by the majority of their constituents.\nThis has to be a good thing at a time when trust in politicians is at an all-time low. I travelled to every corner of England during the last election campaign, and I was struck by the anger people felt towards the Westminster elite. People need a system which encourages greater legitimacy in the eyes of the people. This will also strengthen the influence of Parliament over the executive.\nElectoral reform also means we will see a reduction of 'safe seats'. We see too many constituencies where votes are taken for granted. It leads to arrogance on the part of the parties, and a consequent disengagement by the public. The whole point of politics is to serve the people, and the current system, now so obsolete, fails to encourage that public spirit.\nAustralia has employed AV as its method of choosing politicians successfully. We need it too if we want our political system to reflect the true wishes of our people.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_eu-citizenship/content_344.html": "EU citizenship?\nSince the vote to leave the European Union back in June, many of my friends have suddenly developed a keen interest in their Irish ancestry. Others have already bagged a German passport, a Cypriot passport, and permanent residency in Belgium. Everywhere, anyone with a parent or grandparent from elsewhere in Europe is clambering aboard a lifeboat out of Brexit Britain. Some of us however aren't able to contribute to the big, post-referendum spike in applications to become new Danes, Italians and Swedes.\nI was giving this a lot of thought last month. Sure, I want to keep my right to live, work, travel, study, retire, even start a business across the EU with the minimum of bureaucratic fuss and bother, but it's more than that. I am a European. I feel it in my bones. I don't want my EU citizenship ripped from my hands. I want to keep it.\nA thought popped into my head. A solution that would allow those who wanted to leave to do so, whilst allowing those who feel they are EU citizens as much as British citizens to remain.\nCurrently, individuals are only EU citizens if they are nationals of an EU member state. If the UK is no longer in the EU, we are no longer EU citizens. But why not allow people from departing member states to become EU citizens directly, out of choice? You'd have to opt in, make a public declaration of support for the EU (like people adopting new nationalities frequently have to do), and face a citizenship test too. We'd become joint British/EU dual nationals.\nThis solution would do something that the UK Government seems uninterested in doing, namely trying to find a way forward that works for as many people as possible - not just forcing through the agenda of some of the country at the expense of everyone else.\nI set up a new blog just so I could get the idea out there. It has been visited way over 100,000 times, it's had over 500 comments (almost exclusively positively), and 13,000 people have clicked on the link at the end of the post to sign up in support. I also blogged about it this week on an English-language Swedish website.\nWhat's in it for the rest of the EU? Well, a big member state is leaving. There is a risk that the EU's 12 stars will look to be setting not rising. That the whole idea is on the wane. With Putin in the Kremlin and Trump in the White House, Europe needs to stick together and the EU needs to work.\nWhat better way to put a bit of zip and zing into the idea of the EU than having ecstatic Brits waving their new EU passports for the TV cameras, like Apple Store customers on the day a new iPhone is released?\nThe EU has a flag, an anthem, citizenship. Many pro-Europeans like me are the first people who believe in all that who are also having it stripped from us. This is the moment for Europe to be brave and bold, to show it cares about the people who care about it.\nAnd it is not outlandish. As reported in the Sun, the Independent, and London's Evening Standard, a Liberal MEP - Charles Goerens - is pushing for it in the European Parliament. So, if you agree, read the idea in full in my original blog post, and sign up here.\n* Stuart Bonar was the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate in Plymouth Moor View.",

Which may make you think that it's a small set of elections and one in which many or even most parts of the country will not be voting.\nBut…\nAdd in also the Police and Crime Commissioner elections across England and Wales, the London Mayor and Assembly elections and seven different Mayor elections.\nThat gets you to elections across all of England and Wales, with only Scotland election-free (save for any council by-elections).\nIt may be a small round of elections from the point of view of numbers of councillors. But it's a huge round of elections from the point of view of how many people have the chance to vote, how many local parties have elections taking place in their patch, and how many chances there are to get members and supporters out campaigning for the party.\nIt also makes these elections an important opportunity to follow up on December's general election.\nMay is an important opportunity to strengthen the local government base in many seats where we increased our vote share in December.\nIt's a renewed opportunity to rebuild in seats where we were squeezed or didn't stand.\nCrucially for the long-term, they are also a hook to follow up on the many people who went campaigning for the first time - turning for many of them helping in elections into a regular habit rather than a one-off aberration.\nThere's much the party centrally has to get right to support these elections (such as the increased financial support). It also requires local parties to be up for it - including those who don't have elections other than being part of a Police and Crime Commissioner or Mayor election that covers a wide geographic area.\nWhich also means that regional parties in England and the state parties in England and Wales need to be up for it - not only telling others (such as me!) what they think someone else should be doing about the elections but also repeatedly asking it of themselves.\nI hope you are - and ALDC has a great source of resources, training and advice.",

Cathy is left homeless and her children are taken away.\nThe film had a profound impact on me as a teenager. I watched it and decided to join Shelter. Then I realised I could do even more by getting involved in politics.\nAlthough in the last 50 years there have been some changes, many of the same issues remain. We should be ashamed that in the 21st Century there are still people sleeping on the streets; many people are refused the support they need and are simply being let down.\nThere is quite simply a lack of political will to end this crisis, and the Government's approach of reducing council homes and failing to build enough homes is making it worse.\nI want to see real action to tackle the housing crisis, improve mental health services, and to properly fund homeless charities and local authorities so they can provide support.\nA decent, safe, secure and affordable home is essential to being a part of society and the community you live in. It allows you to make a living, and keeps you warm and secure, yet most of us take this for granted. I stress again that it is outrageous that homelessness still continues to rise every year in this country. It needs to be tackled.\nThis is why next week I'll be participating in the charity Centrepoint's 2016 London Sleepout, swapping my bed for a sleeping bag to help give homeless young people a future. By sleeping out on a cold and damp November night, I hope to raise awareness and money to support Centrepoint's work with those who face this ordeal on a daily basis.\nCentrepoint is the UK's leading charity for homeless young people, and along with its partners it supports 9,000 young people every year. They help 16-25 year olds into a safe place to live, give them a health assessment and plan support for their individual mental and physical health needs. We start them on a path to more independence and a job.\nA team of members are joining me for this - will you join us?\nThe event takes place on the night of 24th November at the Greenwich Peninsula and you can register here.\nAdd yourself to 'Team Tim' to join my group of enthusiastic Lib Dem anti-homelessness campaigners!\nAnd up until lunchtime tomorrow (Friday 18th November), you can get £10 discount on the registration fee by entering the code GREENWICH10.\nIf you can't attend but want to support the team and I, you can still use the 'Give Now' button on my fundraising page\nMany thanks for all your support!\nTim\n* Tim Farron is Leader of the Liberal Democrats, MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale and a former President of the Liberal Democrats.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_stop-brexit/content_465.html": "Stop Brexit\nThe Liberal Democrats unveiled their manifesto for the European elections last night in Shoreditch. It was what we've come to expect from that party: a slick, well-put together event that said both explicitly thanks to the speech given by its leader Vince Cable and implicitly thanks to its smooth execution that they are the largest, most well-organised pro-Remain party and that anyone who wants to stop Brexit should back them at this European elections. They also chucked in plenty of Green lovebombing, talking up their own environmental credentials without mentioning - or more importantly criticising - their competitors in that space.\nBut all anyone can talk about is the party's election slogan: bollocks to Brexit. The broadcasters and most of the papers are talking about whether or not the party has gone too far with their manifesto's new message.\nIs it a bit much? Anna Soubry certainly thinks so, telling the Times that there is no need to go into \"that sort of territory\".\nBehind the slogan, the manifesto is a serious document with a commitment to the free movement of people, a zero carbon target for the whole of the European Union, measures to tackle crime across the bloc, and much else besides. But anyone who thinks that had the Liberal Democrats not opted for a somewhat fruity tagline we'd instead be talking about the finer points of the European Arrest Warrant or the benefits of wind power is kidding themselves.\nOf course, the reason why Vince Cable can carry off with a little light cursing is that he is set to stand down as the man who led the Liberal Democrats to their best local election results in their history, whatever happens on 23 May. And if the polls are to be believed, the best is yet to come: his party is on the cusp of beating the Conservatives into third place in the European elections.\nBut the two things are linked. Look at the Green party: they also had the most successful local election results in their history yet they have received hardly any coverage as a result. They are being crowded out by the big two political parties, and by the Brexit Party and Change UK, who are shiny and new but whose case for that prominence is not yet proven.\nIt's not that the Liberal Democrats are a party on are on the up-and-up again despite being willing to say over-the-top things to get their issues talked about: it's they are a party who are on the up-and-up again because they are willing to say over-the-top things to get their issues talked about. The reality of course is that the word \"bollocks\" isn't on the party's direct mail and wasn't anywhere to be seen on the walls or podium - it's just a neat bit of political messaging that means that, thanks to some earnest discussions about whether or not the Liberal Democrats are lowering the tone means that the party's real anti-Brexit message is getting an airing it otherwise wouldn't from the mainstream press. It's the same with Caroline Lucas' championing of a meat tax - it gets her party in the headlines and allows them the space to talk about the rest of their programme in a way.\nSoubry might think that there is no need to indulge in that kind of behaviour, but her reluctance to do so, and the wider unwillingness of her new party to come to terms with the different challenge that comes with minor party status, could well doom her party from the get-go.",

So it was very awkward and there were queues of journalists outside my house for days on end.\n\"But I was persuaded to stick in there by family and various colleagues and I'm glad I did.\"\nThe furore broke when the Daily Telegraph secretly taped him telling an undercover reporter whom he thought was a Twickenham constituent, \"I have declared war on Mr Murdoch and I think we are going to win\". Mr Cable was at the time in charge of media regulation, including the £8 billion BSkyB bid.\nHe was humiliatingly rebuked by David Cameron and responsibility for media policy plus some 60 civil servants were all handed to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, a Tory who admired Mr Murdoch.\nToday, however, Mr Cable feels vindicated. His spirits fully recovered, he joked of being \"delighted to discover that everyone in Britain and the House of Commons now agrees with me\".\nEarlier, he had likened the anti-Murdoch fever to \"the end of a dictatorship, when everybody suddenly discovers they were against the\ndictator\".\nAsked if he thinks Mr Murdoch was a \"fit and proper\" person to own the 39 per cent of BSkyB he already has, the minister said: \"There's certainly a big case to answer. I don't know whether they pass that or not, it's for Ofcom to decide.\"\nBut for his actions last year in referring the takeover to Ofcom, he said, it would have been \"waved through\" by now.\n\"There was very strong advice in Whitehall and outside that I had no basis for referring this,\" he revealed. \"But I took independent advice which did suggest a serious plurality issue - and on the strength of that I referred it to Ofcom, who in turn said it should go to the Competition Commission. Had I not done that we would now be dealing with a fait accompli.\"\nThe effect, he said, would have been a \"very high concentration\" of media in one man's hands \"that was potentially very unhealthy\".\n\"There would have been a great deal of cross-promotion,\" he said. \"As a result the group would have been much stronger than the sum of its parts and real plurality and choice would have been seriously threatened.\"\nMr Cable says he is \"not into empire building\" and does not want his old powers over media regulation back.\nHowever, he is amused with a suggestion that perhaps a Lib-Dem minister in the Coalition should be responsible in future because they are the only party untainted by close association with the Murdoch empire.\n\"The Lib-Dems have gone out on a limb in the past to be independent, sometimes criticising proprietors like Mr Murdoch, and we've been caned in the media for it. We do collectively feel vindicated for it.\"\nHe thinks it \"fairly obvious\" that Rebekah Brooks was right to resign over the phone hacking scandal but that Mr Murdoch, whom he has never met, is ultimately to blame for what went wrong.\n\"Clearly as the primary owner the responsibility rests with him. I'm not trying to run the guy down. I think he is probably big enough to accept it's his responsibility.\"\nLabour leader Ed Miliband \"has had a good two weeks\" he said but said the real test was just beginning: \"I think what will now matter is which of the parties will have the courage to go ahead with the radical reforms that are going to be required to the oversight of the press, the competition rules and the concentration of ownership.\"",

But with the prospects of a deal looking slim, The Independent has been told the recall will now be staged \"either way\".\n\"We are in uncharted waters because only God knows what Boris is up to,\" said the MP. \"Whatever people had been discussing, they are not discussing it in the same context any more because of this move by No 10.\"\nPlotters are wary of giving Downing Street too much notice of their plans, or of striking before a majority is assured, said the MP: \"A lot of people are looking for ways to try to get the option of a second referendum onto the table, but we want to make sure we avoid the danger of it not being carried.\"\nEven if passed, any referendum motion would come up against a series of obstacles, including the fact that it would require a money resolution to authorise the substantial spending involved, which can only be tabled by a minister.",

Some are under 13.\n\"Nearly all the young people here are trying to reach family in the UK. That is the only reason anyone would put up with the horrible conditions here.\"\nDowning Street has tried to argue that \"nothing has changed\" because it remains the aim to reach an agreement to bring over child refugees where possible.\nBut this was undermined by clause 37 of the bill, which replaces the commitment with a need to simply \"make a statement\" - once - on the progress of the talks after Brexit.\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and former Labour MP Alf Dubs, who fled from the Nazis on the Kindertransport to Britain when he just six years old, had urged Tory MPs to join them.\n\"We know that there are many Conservative MPs, including some sat around the cabinet table, who know that this decision was wrong,\" they wrote, in a joint letter.\n\"Boris Johnson may have won a majority in parliament, but he did not win the moral argument to absolve himself of responsibility to some of the most vulnerable people in the world.\"\nA government spokesperson said: \"Protecting vulnerable children will remain our priority after Brexit and this new clause reaffirms our commitment while clarifying the role of parliament and government in negotiations.\"",

It commenced at 14:30 and went on well into the evening. There were only two items on the agenda.\nSnap General Election Manifesto\nThe Federal Policy Committee is responsible for the preparation of the General Election manifestoes for the party. Earlier in the year, following the turmoil surrounding the Brexit vote, the change in party leadership in the Tories and the extreme instability in Labour, it looked like there might be a snap General Election this Autumn. Under those circumstances, the committee wanted to have a manifesto draft available in the event that one was called. It would have taken far too long to prepare a document at that stage and we would have started on the back foot.\nAs regular readers of this report will know, a Working Group was set up to actually write the document. That group was chaired by Dick Newby. It worked very hard throughout the summer to prepare the first draft. There was also a consultation exercise in which 8,000 members of the party responded. Those responses were considered and many of them were incorporated.\nTim Farron opened this agenda item by welcoming the work that had been done on the draft and all of the comments that had been received. If they could not all be incorporated into this document then they could form the basis for future work. Much of it would be fed into future groups and possible new Spokesperson's Papers.\nMembers of the committee had submitted extensive comments on the draft. They were presented to the rest of the committee in the form of a grid and we went through them one by one. The agenda was structured around the main areas of the manifesto namely the introduction, narrative and top six commitments; and then the economy; childcare, benefits and pensions; education; health; the environment; communities; housing; home affairs, justice equalities and refugees; constitutional affairs and international affairs.\nObviously, I am not going to go into the details of all of the discussions that the committee had but it was a very useful meeting and much was said that will feed into future work.\nThe document was signed-off enthusiastically with thanks to Dick Newby and the manifesto group.\nEurope Motion\nThe committee spent some time considering the draft of a motion that was to be submitted to Federal Conference Committee (FCC) as an Emergency Motion.\nFCC did not want to take a motion on Europe when it met before the summer because it was fearful that any text that was accepted would be out of date by the time of the Autumn. In fact, the FPC had a draft prepared immediately following the referendum but did not end up submitting it in the end. The fear that any early text would be overtaken by events proved to be well placed because events have indeed moved on significantly.\nThe committee had a lengthy debate over the tone and wording of the motion. Debate focused around how we approach the way in which the referendum was conducted and what precisely we call for. There was agreement that there should be a Parliamentary vote before Article 50 was triggered. The committee was also clear that the referendum was about agreeing to start the departure towards Brexit but not the destination thereafter. Therefore, it resolved to call, in the motion, for the British people to have a final say on the terms of the final deal reached in the form of a referendum at that stage. The motion will also say a significant amount about the benefits that European Union membership has given is over the years.\nThe motion will be submitted to the Conference Committee and may appear on the agenda in Brighton.\nAs ever, I would be delighted to answer any questions about this report.

We placed no restrictions on their choices: they could choose anyone they wanted, whether a Liberal or not.\nThe article below will be included in the summer issue of the Journal of Liberal History, due out in mid July. See elsewhere on this website for the full range of the History Group's activities, including our meetings (the next one is coming up on 16 July), our short introduction to Liberal history and our wider range of publications.\nEd Davey - Paddy Ashdown\nLiberals are not meant to have heroes, but I can't help it. I don't genuflect before grand or celebrity figures, but re-reading speeches or learning of the noble deeds of Liberals can move me the way opera or acts of military valour can have others dabbing a misty eye.\nI love Gladstone for his insistence that: 'the sanctity of life in the hill villages of Afghanistan among the winter snows is as inviolable in the eye of Almighty God as can be your own'. Or Asquith for, in the midst of unimaginable wartime stress, ignoring press opprobrium to visit German prisoners of war to demand their good treatment. That instinctive determination to defend the vulnerable is what, I believe, makes us Liberals.\nHard choice though this is, my Liberal hero is more recent: Paddy Ashdown, for whom I still grieve.\nAs a new member of staff in 1989, what surprised me was how wonderfully Paddy treated youngsters like me. He had a reputation for being brisk - even brusque - but I discovered that was a front.\nI perched, as the party's chief economics adviser, in what felt like a tiny garret atop the old Whips' Office. Here I would receive handwritten notes thanking me for a piece of work, and I've kept them all. Whether eating, chatting or indeed drinking with junior staff at conference, Paddy was like the dedicated officer with his troops. He inspired loyalty and hard work in equal measure.\nPaddy's stories only added to his mystique and magnetism. A young colleague was startled to find a note on his desk from Paddy one morning: 'Call me on my car phone at 5.57am.' It wasn't so much the earliness as the preciseness of the hour that startled. Another note, upon Paddy assuming the party's leadership, read simply: 'Please remove David Steel's dead animal from my office.' It was a buffalo skin presented by Chief Buthelezi.\nSure, Paddy could be a task master, but even then I found him immense fun. Many a Monday morning my phone would bark into life: 'Edward, come to my office now, please.' From Paddy's mouth 'please' became a command. Once before him I'd find he'd read some article over the weekend extolling a new economic policy that he wanted to adopt. And I'd spend a good thirty minutes dissuading him of some crazy, ill-thought-through fancy.\nMy biggest disagreement with him came after I'd been elected in 1997, when he was determined to cling on to his pre-election plan with Tony Blair for close working relations with Labour - despite that strategy having been devised for a balanced Parliament, not for a Labour majority of 167. Brilliant as he was, he couldn't persuade Parliamentary colleagues or the wider party that Lib-Labbery worked in this context, for it would have hitched us to policies we disagreed with without influence to change them.\nIronically, during the five days of coalition negotiations in 2010, it was Paddy and me who tried to convince Nick Clegg and co not to rule out coalition with Labour, despite the numbers being difficult to make work.\nIt had been Paddy who first drew me to the party. All politicians have their causes, and for me it was the environment and education. Paddy made the green agenda a core strand of our identity when most MPs thought this a peripheral, even cranky, cause. I was hooked, and would like to think that my recently announced plan to decarbonise capitalism is one Paddy would have embraced with vim and verve.\nI'm an economist by training and so appreciated deeply that Paddy was, fundamentally, so economically literate. He took over a party that had been a little corporatist in its thinking but Paddy reconnected the party to its liberal roots, asking what a policy meant for the individual. He emphasised Mill's idea of the power of education to unlock human potential. Without Paddy I'm not sure we would have had such ground-breaking Lib Dem achievements in government as the pupil premium, a development of his policy of a penny on income tax to improve education.\nFinally, though a Liberal to his core, he sought to bring others into the Liberal tent. I took inspiration from Paddy when I called for a national government to deliver a people's vote. How he made the Liberal Democrats a big enough tent for MPs of other parties to join us should be our inspiration.\nIf elected leader, I will build on his legacy; Paddy, I miss you terribly.\nJo Swinson - Anita Roddick\nIt was through Anita Roddick that I first discovered what it was to be a campaigner.\nThe Body Shop in the 1980s was ahead of its time: sourcing their ingredients ethically; promoting recycling; taking on its own industry on issues like body image in advertising. As a girl, I would go to the Body Shop to buy my strawberry or banana-shaped soap and sign the petitions at the till. That was how I discovered a whole range of causes: fair trade, cosmetic testing on animals, or another worthy cause.\nIt fuelled my early environmentalism - something that has stayed with me ever since. I even tried to persuade my Dad - a Focus-delivering Lib Dem - to vote Green at the European elections in 1989. He didn't, as he rightly argued that the Lib Dems were better placed to deliver green policies. One of the best gifts he ever gave me was a signed copy of Anita Roddick's book, Business as Unusual, which I keep in my parliamentary office to this day. By that time I was 16 or 17, and the book reinforced in me a passion for how business can be a force for good.\nUnfortunately, I never got to meet Anita Roddick before she died in 2007. I have been lucky enough to meet people who knew her and worked with her, and the picture they painted to me was of a remarkable woman. She was a different kind of businessperson running a different kind of business. At a time when modern business was being defined by the Big Bang and the 'greed is good' culture of the Thatcher years, she defined an approach that declared that there was more to running a company than simply generating profits for shareholders. Her company was profitable, but it was also about social justice, about making the world a better place one recycled plastic bottle or hemp bag at a time.\nIn many ways, her approach had more in common with the socially conscious capitalists of the Victorian era - social reformers like Robert Owen and the pioneers of the Co-op movement, or the Quaker-run businesses, like Cadbury, who built homes for their workers. They may have taken a more paternalistic approach but they shared an understanding of capitalism as an agent for social justice.\nAnd it wasn't just her business philosophy that stood out like a sore thumb in the 1980s, it was who she was and how she conducted herself. She said what she thought; she dressed the way she wanted; she stood up for things she believed in. She was a determined, uncompromising, outspoken woman in an era of testosterone-fuelled alpha-male machismo - a great role model for an ambitious young woman like me.\nHer example has stayed with me throughout my life and has undoubtedly shaped many of my views on policy, both explicitly and implicitly. Not only have I remained an avid environmentalist, but her vision of responsible business has shaped my thinking on business and the economy too. As an MP and a minister I have championed many of the causes I first discovered through the Body Shop - from excess plastic packaging to taking on unrealistic body image depictions in advertising. And it's why I have put creating an economy that puts people and planet first at the heart of my leadership campaign. I want to reward dynamic, innovative companies that focus on the long-term challenges our society faces - such as the climate emergency, health inequality and the challenges of an ageing population - and that empower individuals and prize the productivity that comes when workers are treated as human beings and not numbers on a spreadsheet.\nBut as important as policies and political philosophy are, Anita Roddick also ingrained in me something more practical. She was, first and foremost, a doer. She was an activist who used her career and her business as a platform to make change happen. Her example taught me that it is not enough to simply believe things, or to criticise things, but to get out there and do things to make the world better.\nThat spirit will be familiar to Liberal Democrats. We are a party of doers. We pound pavements in the rain. We campaign relentlessly for causes we believe in. We put in the hard work all year round because we are determined to make a difference. If I am fortunate enough to become Leader of the Liberal Democrats, above all else it is in that spirit that I want to lead.",

I adjust my tie and clean my specs.\nSeven minutes to go.\nGah! There's a bottle of wine in the background!! So I get out of my seat and hastily remove it.\nSix minutes to go. I glance top right at the iPad screen.\nOMG - only 4% battery left! It could switch off anytime during my question! Jamie Stone would go completely blank live on Parliament TV.\nI look down for the charger - and then remember that the day before I had stood on it and broken it. It's terribly cramped under the stairs. Seriously rattled I'm again out of my seat and off to the kitchen to borrow my wife's.\nRush rush.\nClick - into the iPad.\nDamnation - not charging. So I turn it round and push it in again. Glory be, it's charging. My heart is racing, and I furtively mop my brow and glance at the screen again. There is Mr Speaker.\n\"And now we go to Jamie Stone - JAMIE STONE!\nI kid you not. In the very nick of time.\nThere is a small business in my constituency that cannot operate and is receiving absolutely no financial support from the government. They couple who were running it won't even get Universal Credit until next week. But for the food bank, and kind family and friends, they wouldn't have been able to feed their two small children.\nThis is how the official record of the House of Commons, recorded the final part of my question to Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\"They now have no income whatsoever and have fallen through what I might call the floorboards of the safety net. Will the Leader of the House be kind enough to agree with me that it would be helpful if a Minister came to the House to outline to Members like me how we can speedily try to help these people, pick them up off the floor and get them going again?\"\nWas Mr Rees-Mogg helpful? Not hugely. He airily referred me to Treasury Questions next week and then simply concluded that \"there are some who fall through the cracks\".\nIt's a complete lottery as to whether I'd be called for a Treasury Question next week. Absolutely not something I can bet on. So I have written to him further outlining this particular case, and also enclosing a letter about the couple in question that I wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer a week ago.\nTwo morals to the tale.\nMy work must continue.\nAnd I must remember to make sure the iPad is always fully charged.\nWatch the full video of me asking Mogg on Virtual Parliament here",

Leaving aside the heated arguments for how this would best work, how about involving those we are talking about in having a needle and thread too ?\nWhatever the ways we have of mending the safety net, those who need it must be able to understand the letters that they are sent from the officials concerned.\nI am not blaming the officials, they don't necessarily know how what is written is perceived, but what can be done is listen to the recipients. I was a volunteer advisor with CAB for 40 years, and know how many people just do not understand what they are being told.\nSometimes this is because of a learning disability or general literacy problem. But many people in this situation pass onto friends and relatives who also cannot understand fully.\nAs a fully trained and experienced advisor I sometimes had to ring the department to get clarification.\nWe heard in the debate about how people are sanctioned for not complying with the rules. They have not necessarily understood properly the rules they have to obey strictly and to the letter so they are not sanctioned.\nThere are letters not understood about being able to claim other benefits.\nThere are many letters not understood that gives a refusal of a benefit, but does not make clear that an appeal can be made, and what the time limit is. To say nothing of understanding why it has been refused.\nWhat I propose is that the party campaigns for a liberal solution: a customer testing panel.\nThis could be made up of actual claimants who would meet up with relevant officials, read proposed letters, and feedback what they thought it meant. Such a panel could rotate around the country to ensure one group did not get into understanding the departmental lingo, and regional differences were ironed out.\nIn return it would save time and money for the relevant department. Think what it would mean to those claimants to be welcomed into the office, even given tea and biscuits; what it would mean for them to be listened to; what it would mean for them to make a difference; what it would mean for the thousands who would receive letters they could understand. Surely it would raise confidence and skills.\nThis suggestion is truly empowering and Liberal , let's go for it!\n* Suzanne Fletcher was a councillor for nearly 30 years.

The first Labour MPs arrived in parliament in 1906 after a pact with the Liberals. During the world wars, the main parties observed non-aggression byelection deals. In 1983 and 1987, Liberals and the Social Democratic party struck a general election seats pact. And there have been notable individual constituency deals too. These range from the Oxford byelection in 1938 over the appeasement of Hitler to the Batley and Spen byelection in 2016 after the murder of Jo Cox. In Northern Ireland, tactical withdrawals to give a nationalist or a unionist a clearer run at the other remain commonplace to this day. A slew of new arrangements of this kind are likely to have a big impact in Northern Ireland's 18 seats next month.\nThis week's announcement of a Unite to Remain pact on 12 December between the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and Plaid Cymru is therefore not unprecedented. It could be significant in three ways: its immediate impact in a number of tightly contested constituencies in England and Wales next month, its consequences for Brexit and, perhaps more lastingly, for the wider signal it sends that traditional partisan politics are under challenge from shifting alliances of less tribal voters. This in turn is partly a result of the transforming impact of Brexit on British party politics and partly of a perception that both Labour and the Conservatives have moved decisively towards the extremes. This has helped to spawn new campaigns such as Common Ground and the all-party More United movement.\nThere is no getting away from the fact that this week's pact is only a deal between three minor parties. The SNP and Labour - the former a remain party, the latter a party with a large majority of remain voters - have both refused to join in. The pact involves only 60 seats out of 650, 43 of them in England and 17 in Wales. Its direct impact is likely to be small. While it increases the chances of the Lib Dems in, say, Richmond Park, the Greens in Bristol West and Plaid in Ynys Môn, all three of which are among the respective parties' targets, it still leaves the Greens and Plaid a long way from translating the pact into more seats at Westminster. If the pact delivers, the Liberal Democrats stand to be the disproportionate beneficiaries. Even so, in a tight election even a small number of Conservative losses in seats the party might have expected to win in the absence of a pact could be vital.\nThe other 572 seats in Britain - the overwhelming majority - will not be directly affected by this week's pact. True, a small number, including Beaconsfield, Broxtowe, Calder Valley and Luton South, have already witnessed unilateral Lib Dem or Green withdrawals in order to help pro-remain candidates, including pro-remain Labour ones. True also, there are likely to be informal decisions by Labour not to contest some Lib Dem target seats very strongly; perhaps even some formal decisions too, as advocated by Clive Lewis or Paul Mason. But the main effect of the pact in these seats is likely to be through osmosis and as a result of anti-Brexit tactical voting campaigns.\nThis week the Labour deputy leader Tom Watson joined the increasingly long list of moderately inclined Labour and Conservative MPs stepping down from politics. His departure, and those of many recent Tory ministers, seem to confirm that the big parties are not interested in working across even their own divides, never mind those between them. This week's pact is a reaction against the imperfect choices on Brexit from the two main parties. But in another contest the pact might easily be a cross-party response to the failure to adopt radical and agreed measures to combat the climate crisis.\nElectoral pacts are a consequence of the first-past-the-post voting system. If Britain's electoral system was fairer, and less prone to confer majoritarian powers on parties with only minority support among voters, they would not be necessary. As long as the voting system is unreformed, the pressure for pacts will be there, as it is today. But pressure to cooperate in the national interest stems from policy failure too. The system is wrong, but so is the political direction.",

Here's Matt Wilcock explaining what they've done and how you can learn from it:\nThe coronavirus outbreak has found us all indoors. That has not spelt an end to community support for our team here in Hull. We have put campaigning aside completely and instead we have put our foot to the floor with supporting our local community.\nWe are focussed on calling residents most at risk, particularly older residents who are single-home occupiers. We are asking if they need any help with groceries, picking up post or medication should they self-isolate and, if they do, making sure they know about the local support options available.\nThis has proven a great way to support our residents. Not only are we offering a great service, but all our councillors and volunteers are finding it an enjoyable and rewarding process.\nI asked one of our super-callers, Cllr Maria Coward, how she was finding the process:\n\"The residents are just appreciative. They couldn't believe their local councillor was giving them a call! They were really shocked.\"\nAlthough the regular staple of local Lib Dem campaigning, leafleting and knocking on doors, has gone out of the window you can still help your local community. The mighty phonebank is here to the rescue!\nIf you would like to set-up a phone-bank here are a few tips:\n- You can call at any sensible time. No need to stick to weekends or evenings, as people are in all day(!)\n- Have something of value to offer residents there and then over the phone. Perhaps you can have a few website links to hand or your local council's telephone helpline number.\n- Do tailor your list using the Connect target pools and save yourself some work by using the template scripts set up by Lib Dem HQ, as we are.\n- Stick to help that it is appropriate to offer - and if you need to contact any official bodies on their behalf, make sure you have their permission do so first.\nOur Hull Lib Dem team has called as many people as if we were still ramping up to the, now cancelled, local elections! It was a great start to the Monday morning to hear we had made more phone-calls than any other team in the country.\nThere you have it - the gambit has been thrown down. We look forward to being challenged for our number one spot this week - happy calling!\nFor more advice on what party members and supporters can do, see the party's website and don't forget the three steps you can take yourself to help the NHS.

For those who don't know it, it is at the top left corner of High Peak.\nQuite a bright spark for a girl from such a working-class family, daughter of a builder's labourer and part-time factory worker, who always voted Labour. I'd got a scholarship to a \"posh\" girls' school, but never quite learned how to be \"posh\". I went to the local Youth Club, that so-called \"den of iniquity\" that reputedly attracted yobbos and louts (mostly male, by definition). I never believed those labels. I never met any yobbos or louts there, just ordinary teenagers. Yeah, lots from the council estate. So what? I'd spent 10 years with mates from the council estate. Most of my relatives lived on council estates. Great places to be back then.\nA trainee youth leader came to the Club on placement from his degree in Youth Studies at Sheffield University, aged just 20. We all took to him like a shot. He was \"nearly\" our age, and we looked up to him.\nSo just before the General Election of 1966, the trainee youth leader thought we all needed a bit of insight into politics, and he invited the three candidates in High Peak to speak to us at the Youth Club. They were David Walder (Conservative), Peter Jackson (Labour) and Dennis Wrigley (Liberal). Of course, none of us were yet eligible to vote, and wouldn't be for another four years. But the trainee thought we were of an age to be introduced to politics. And anyway, he would be back at Uni in a few months, so this was his only chance to tick some boxes on his placement form. Cynical.\nThe candidates came on different nights, except I don't think David Walder came at all. No matter, some teenagers were firm Tories cos their parents were farmers, or doctors and lawyers. And none of the other kids would ever vote anything but Labour. There were certainly no Liberal kids there. So it was all a waste of time, wasn't it?\nPeter Jackson came first. Fairly young bloke, with a beard and sandals, a tad scruffy. Kids took to him at once cos he was just like them. Except he didn't really engage with us. He talked above us and at us, like we were 14-year-olds who knew nothing. We were, in fact, 14-year-olds who knew nothing. And whilst he was okay, he left us feeling like we were, well, 14-year-olds who knew nothing.\nA week later Dennis Wrigley came. Smartly dressed, middle-aged, no beard or sandals. Crikey, he was going to be boring for sure. How wrong we were. He treated us like we really mattered, our views were really important to him. He didn't TELL us stuff about the Liberal Party (unless we asked) he ASKED us stuff about our own opinions and told us where the Liberals were on those topics. And you could tell that it all went in. We MATTERED to him, to his Party, to his life even.\nAfter the visits I engineered a group discussion about the visits. That's the sort of thing I did at 14. About twenty 14-year-olds joined in, and of those twenty, twenty declared they liked Dennis Wrigley the best. Of course, you would, wouldn't you, if a middle-aged man listened to you? As it happens, Dennis was only 36, but middle-aged to us. And those twenty included the sons and daughters of farmers, doctors and lawyers who always voted Tory.\nFour years on and we had the vote for the first time.\nThe political parties held a hustings meeting in St George's Parish Hall. By now the Tory candidate was Spencer Le Marchant. Spencer, eh? Posh name, that. Peter Jackson for Labour, and Dennis Wrigley for the Liberals.\nTwelve of those 14-year-olds from 1966 attended the hustings.\nThe candidates all got some stick from the crowded room of about 120 people as they fielded questions from the audience. Spencer had to refer to his \"assistant\" for the answers to most questions; Peter gave stock \"Labour Manifesto\" answers (with a copy in his hands to refer to) and Dennis Wrigley spoke with no props, and from the heart, and with passion and belief in what he was saying. He LISTENED to the questioners and answered them with his own words.\nALL 12 OF US EX-YOUTH-CLUB MEMBERS DECIDED TO VOTE FOR DENNIS WRIGLEY, on the basis that he was the most honest of all three candidates. And we liked the policies of the Liberal Party too (not that we were 100% sure what they were, but we were pretty sure that such a good bloke would be in a party with decent policies).\nThe point is that Dennis was indeed charismatic, but not because of any particular flair that he had, but because he BELIEVED 200% IN WHAT HE WAS SAYING and it was obvious that he did. It was both refreshing and stimulating to us 18-year olds. And unsurprisingly, nearly 50 years on, I find that most of those teenagers from 1966 still vote Lib-Dem, and all because of the influence of Dennis Wrigley, who treated them as people at the age of 14.\nSadly, the election of 1970 did not see our opinions mirrored by other voters and our share of the poll dropped to 16%, its lowest in High Peak's history at that point - a disappointment when Dennis had managed 31% in 1961.\nBut I have no doubt that Dennis Wrigley enthused the teenagers at New Mills Youth Club back in 1966 and I will always be glad that he was the man that he was back then, and clearly was till last week, as a minister in the church that he founded.\nHe will be sadly missed, not only by his family and those who knew him in recent years, but by those of us who were impressed by him 50 years ago.\nHe changed lives and views. Tory kids voted Liberal, Socialist kids voted Liberal.\nAnd after I told my dad how good Dennis had been my dad voted Liberal too.\nAll because of one honest, decent, genuine man.\nRIP Dennis.",

Britain is feeling the discomfort of crushed grass as a result of the various fights picked by the government's powerful but belligerent friend Donald Trump.#\nIt was embarrassing, even humiliating, that the British prime minister was not given notice of the American strike against the Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. It isn't clear whether Trump didn't trust his British allies with confidential military intelligence, or didn't think we were important enough to merit a courtesy call. Either way, the snub was particularly galling, as 179 British troops have died supporting the Americans in Iraq.\nIf it were merely a case of loss of dignity, it wouldn't matter so much. Trump doesn't do courtesy, and perhaps we should appreciate his candour, making it clear that the special relationship is maybe special to Britain but isn't any longer special to the United States. But there are real British interests at stake.\nThe experience of UK ambassador Rob Macaire - arrested in Tehran and held for several hours - shows that even when the UK is behaving entirely properly, we are a target. Meanwhile, 400 British troops are involved in training the Iraqi army. They are at risk, as are many British civilians in and around the Gulf.\nIn Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranians effectively have a hostage, whose prison sentence can be lengthened or shortened as political circumstances demand. The Iranians are fully aware of Boris Johnson's inglorious role, undermining her trial defence. They will be alert for opportunities to apply leverage to an American ally with a military presence in the region.\nAs a nuclear weapons state, Britain also has a legal and political interest in non-proliferation, and in sustaining a nuclear agreement with Iran. Britain is closer to the European than the US position on Iran's compliance, or otherwise, with the previous agreement.\nAnybody looking for clarity in this murky area should read Bob Woodward's chilling but also hilarious fly-on-the-wall account of life in the Trump White House. There is an episode where the then Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, asks Trump to extend the agreement because of a lack of evidence of Iranian non-compliance. Trump insists that since he has decided to kill the agreement, there must - by definition - be non-compliance.\nThe UK now faces an awkward dilemma: defy the United States by trying to keep the agreement alive, or go along with inevitable pre-emptive strikes by the United States and/or Israel, which it will be alleged are essential to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.\nIt may be that the Iran crisis will abate, for a while. There is, after all, some common ground. Iran wants United States troops out of the region, and Trump wants to get his troops out of the region. But there are far from trivial issues around honour, revenge and saving face. And if these emotions prevail over cold calculation, then British interests will be part of the collateral damage.\nThe same is true of the less violent, but ultimately more significant, dispute over trade, technology and security between the two superpowers: Trump's America and Xi Jinping's China. The current pause and likely truce in the escalating US-China trade war is probably just a temporary respite. It is easy to mock Trump's economically illiterate obsession with bilateral trade deficits. But he is serious about their elimination.\nIt is also true that there are wider and better grievances shared by many countries. China has been a free-rider on the liberal multilateral trading system gaining access to western markets and technology, while offering little by way of reciprocal access. The passive aggressive prickliness and the assertive nationalism of Xi regime adds fuel to the fire.\nIt's quite possible that the trade war will simmer rather than boil over in the next few months. The Chinese are smart enough to have realised that they can pursue their wider ambitions while offering Trump enough to meet his narrow concerns over the bilateral deficit. They may also be right to calculate that the president would prefer to shield Wall Street and the wider US economy from nasty economic shocks in an election year.\nBut for the UK, any hope of rich pickings at the other end of the Silk Road now looks forlorn. The \"golden era\" of Cameron and Osborne's love-in with the Chinese has long gone. The sensible and neat compromise proposed by Theresa May over Huawei - excluding the Chinese company from the most sensitive parts of new 5G networks but welcoming the competition and innovation they bring to other parts - is in grave jeopardy.\nIn the next few weeks, we shall be forced to make a final decision over Huawei, and the British will be told in no uncertain terms that they cannot risk being caught on the wrong side of the new iron curtain which will divide transformative technologies.\nOf course, this is isn't the first time that the UK and USA have had divergent interests. Suez was one, Wilson's refusal to commit troops to Vietnam was another. Even Margaret Thatcher defied the United States over energy pipelines to the Soviet Union. But back then Britain still had some of the substance as well as the illusions of being a major player. Such a pretence is no longer credible. And we can no longer look to the European Union for political or diplomatic cover.\nThere will be a growing groundswell of support for those so-called neo-Cons who have long argued that our future is as a subordinate part of the Anglosphere. We should, they will say, accept and welcome our role on the back of one of the warring elephants, rather than being trampled underfoot. If that is the case, our future is as a transatlantic Canada without the French bits.\nThe Canadians will tell you that that isn't an easy existence, on matters of trade and many other things. But as we spurn Europe, it may be the best we can hope for.\nSir Vince Cable is a former leader of the Liberal Democrats and a former secretary of state for business",

I've seen one from a distance, and even though I was safe it was frightening. Having to flee to the nearest beach in order to save yourself from burning to death is terrible to contemplate.\nAlthough bushfires have always been part of the Australian experience, the number and intensity of the fires has increased. In the 1950s and 60s we had bush fires, but no 'bush fire season', as there is now.\nIn the latest fires thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed, individuals have died, native species are in danger of extinction. Forests that have never before caught fire have burned. Thousands of Australians are packed ready for evacuation, if necessary. This bushfire season started early, and we are now into January and February - the two hottest months when fires are most likely to occur. If rain doesn't come, the nightmare will continue.\nAustralia is the climate change canary in the mine. Temperatures will continue to rise, droughts and bush fires will continue to get worse. Australians are wondering how long it will be before their country is unliveable.\nThese unprecedented bushfires are due to a long drought, and the highest temperatures ever recorded. Both are a result of climate change due to human activity. They are a warning that we must halt our use of fossil fuels if we want to avoid climate catastrophe.\nIt is not just Australians whose lives are being destroyed by climate change. People all over the world are losing their homes through flooding, starving to death due to drought, grappling with cyclones and hurricanes, or contemplating a future when their country is submerged by the sea.\nWhere are the Liberal Democrats in all this? The press releases and emails members receive describe worthy aims and sensible policies.\nNonetheless, reading these communications over the last couple of months, the saying 'Nero fiddled while Rome burned' came to mind. Although they often relate to things happening in the news, there has been nothing about the Australian fires and the climate crisis they are pointing to. Does this mean that addressing the issue is not high on the Liberal Democrat agenda?\nThe Liberal Democrat environmental policies are good, as far as it goes. But we need to be doing more. It is clear that if we continue on as normal the next generation will be engaged in a struggle for basic survival in the face of ever increasing extreme weather events.\nLiberal Democrats can't continue relegating the issue to just one policy among many, ignoring the signs that climate change is happening even faster than expected.\nThis is an emergency; it requires immediate and radical action.\n* Catherine Wilson is a Liberal Democrat member in Wales",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_former-director-of-public-prosecutions-to-review-lib-dem-disciplinary-processes/content_262.html": "Unfinished business from Governance Review\nThere are three significant pieces of unfinished business from the Governance Review which was voted through at the federal autumn conference in Brighton.\nOne is simply that changing rules does not in itself change that much. People need to follow them. They need to be implemented with enthusiasm, competence and a clear purpose. Cultural change does not automatically follow.\nSo whilst there is much good in the Governance Review, including the improvements to the way the party makes strategy, as I wrote in the last Liberal Democrat Newswire, it is crucial we get the right people elected to the Federal Board and other committees to properly implement the changes. (That's also why this time round rather than running for the Federal Policy Committee again, I'll be running for the Federal Board. Here's a flavour of what I'd be pushing for on the body.)\nEnglish Party reform\nThe second is the problem that is currently the English Party. Tactically it made absolute sense for Party President Sal Brinton and others to pursue a package of reform which could be voted through by federal conference alone. But that meant no changes to the relative powers of the state parties, as that would have also required votes of agreement in their own bodies too.\nHence that meant very little to address the multiple issues around the English Party such as its hugely indirect version of democracy, the deeply ingrained culture of barely communicating with members and the way it can in effect unilaterally force decisions on Scotland and Wales.\nIt's significant, therefore, than in her Facebook posting setting out priorities for re-election as Party President, Sal Brinton put reform of the English Party down as one of her three priorities. Meanwhile, the English Party itself recently put off its latest reform package pending further thought, with a plan to come back with new reform plans of its own next year.\nKen Macdonald to review disciplinary process\nThen thirdly there is the problem with the party's disciplinary processes. These are numerous in form, but really boil down to two, one widely acknowledged and one which is usually overlooked.\nThe widely acknowledged one is that when put to the test in a controversial case, the processes have often resulted in rulings being made and then overturned on grounds of flawed procedure. That ends up with long-drawn out sagas without closure. They serve all sides badly, and the party itself too.\nTherefore the news that the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, is to head up a review is very good.\nTwo traditions Lib Dems need to abandon\nIt will be important that the review includes the area which is usually overlooked. It is that the party's disciplinary processes have their roots in two basic approaches, both of which have become frayed and neither of which are appropriate now, even if they ever were.\nOne is that the decision for Liberal Democrat groups about who can have the party's whip are decisions for that group alone. That is deeply problematic because who holds the Liberal Democrat whip is about who has the right to use the party's name in public - and that is a matter for the whole party, not just the particular group of councillors, Parliamentarians or others to whom that specific whip applies.\nTraditionally the Liberal Democrats have left the decision about who gets to call themselves a Liberal Democrat after election to the rest of the group to which they've been elected or, in the case of the House of Lords, appointed. Someone can stand as a Liberal Democrat with the party's backing, but it's up to the colleagues in their group as to whether they can continue to act as a Liberal Democrat once there.\nGiven the experience of the Labour Party in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it is understandable how many of those involved in forming the merged party were happy to stick with tradition - a tradition that the Liberal Party too had followed.\nBut politics has moved on from the battles of the early 1980s, and we face new problems now.\nAs an embarrassingly large number of cases have demonstrated in the last few years, leaving decisions over who gets the whip to a smaller group has served the party, its elected/appointed representatives and people with a complaint against them all badly.\nOne problem is one of power. The smaller the group, the easier it is for someone to exercise disproportionate and undue influence over their colleagues. The smaller the group, the bigger the risk that decisions about who should or should not have the whip are not decisions made well or in line with our values.\nAnother is that the Liberal Democrats are one organisation in the eyes of the public. Although the public does not hold the behaviour of every individual against the party as whole, it does do so to some degree an awful lot. The decision that one group makes has an impact on the rest of us too.\nThe other problematic tradition is the idea that outside of giving/withholding the whip, the only level of sanction in the party is to expel someone from membership. That also really doesn't work because it is far from unknown for party members to do something wrong that fall short of explusion level of offence but also should not be left completely unpunished:\nPartly at my instigation the English Party a few years ago introduced a wider range of more modest sanctions, such as banning people from holding office in the party, which could be applied in some cases. For example, if a local party treasurer regularly failed to file regulatory reports on time, expelling them from the party might be too harsh but banning them from being a local party officer appropriate. (Indeed, my involvement in instigating this change came from frustration at seeing several people who had behaved wrongly not facing sanction because the only sanction available was too severe.)\nA sensible … review of the party's expected standards of its members and disciplinary rules should include expanding that range of 'not serious enough for expulsion but serious enough for other sanction' offences.\nIt would need to be clearly defined, so it isn't used as an excuse to, for example, exclude out of favour troublemakers from a party committee, but it would also be the right thing to do.\nOnly if the Macdonald review also tackles these two long-standing traditions will it have a fighting chance of producing the sort of new processes which are fair to all sides and which protect the party's own reputation - a key part of its electoral appeal.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_champion-the-north-of-england/content_464.html": "The Devolution agenda looks almost dead in the water to the eagle-eyed journalist looking for the first hint of a Government U-turn on the once flagship Conservative Party policy. 6 months on from the metro-mayor elections the big tests of devolution look to be too hard for its students.\nThe Northern Powerhouse, once the standard bearer for a new, devolved relationship which will finally bring the capital investment and foreign investment the region so desperately needs, is just a name. Like a flash in the pan celebrity it is now resigned to the history books or to the occasional nostalgic op-ed. Infrastructure investment withdrawal was the last in a list of governmental disappointments.\nIn the dark, cold corners of the Northern Cities however, things may not seem all lost. Sure, political leadership may be dead in these bastions of ex-industry and trade, but then there was not much of it in the first place. 6 months of political leadership in the hands of a Mayor with devolved budgets and more responsibilities than ever before has left me feeling… nothing.\nNo mayor policy leads, no new initiatives and certainly nothing to score a single political point in either the town hall or Westminster. Not even my own Manchester, home of science and industry, symbol of human endeavour, birthplace of the alternative can champion devolution under its leader Andy Burnham. That maybe unfair - he did announce the \"oyster card for Manchester\", which though promised during the election has failed to live up to billing.\nManchester is the poster-boy of devolution. Its combined authority doesn't just accept the economic geography of the region, it champions it. The increasing service industry and investment has weathered the financial storm and come out the other side. Cranes and girders litter the skyline. In South Manchester house prices have recovered and booming.\nThe problem is - that was happening anyway. The poster-boy of the Northern Powerhouse continues regardless of hapless leadership from the Labour Party and inane interest from the Conservative Government. It is being led capably by business leaders and consortiums dedicated to drawing investment to the City.\nThe devolution agenda is vital in the next political decade. Only combined authorities will have the ability to address the growing housing crisis, shorten the gap between the living standards of the rich and poor, delivering community policing and address the gaping holes in our local NHS and mental health services.\nThe biggest issues facing you and your family in the regions will have its budget set in London but its decisions made locally. As devolution evolves with it will come the ability to work almost autonomously from London as powers to levy increase.\nLeadership and scrutiny are the key to success. Liberal Democrats must lead the way in addressing the major issues facing the Northern Powerhouse. Firstly, we must champion the term, regional government needs the leadership and representation it deserves as budgets navigate Brexit and further cuts. Secondly the Liberal Democrats must pursue a policy agenda that meets the needs and aspirations of the people in our most deprived areas. Finally, we must ensure that our local government base is capable of scrutinising the lacklustre leadership.\nIn Manchester, only the Liberal Democrats offer an alternative to a hapless Labour Party. But to lead you must first oppose and to oppose you must win. We face 95 Labour Councillors to 1 Liberal Democrat in Manchester. We are busy putting that right.\n* Richard Kilpatrick is the Chair of Campaigns for Manchester Withington Liberal Democrats and the Liberal Democrat Council Candidate for Didsbury West, Manchester City Council in May 2018.\n6 Comments\nOne of the key things we must emphasise that if devolution is to be offered, we must ensure that the devolution offered is acceptable to the people it being offered to; Prescott probably erred in his pursuance of devolution by not explaining to the North East what devolution would entail, and the current drama in South Yorkshire - where Whitehall is trying to enforce a mayoral election for the Sheffield city region despite all of the Derbyshire councils being sued out and Barnsley and Doncaster walking out - is something that even Armando Iannucci would reject for being too wacky.\nA wise and timely assessment by Richard Kilpatrick. As ' the party of devolution ' we often seem lethargic in engaging with it practically, and promoting how it can work for the benefit of regions and sub-regions.\nOne wonders if our historic commitment to 'localism' has atrophied into a damaging form of parochialism. An unwillingness to see beyond ward or local party boundaries.\n'Tees Valley Lib Dems Forum' was created to support our engagement with our Combined Authority and the new office of a directly elected Mayor.\nIf the Lib Dems are to achieve real political relevance in local government we must embrace the essential changes taking place.\nSpot on Richard. Here in Tees Valley the Conservative mayor is also not offering any leadership, but businesses are showing the way forward. The democratic deficit is huge as a result. Thankfully, the one Liberal Democrat on the scrutiny committee keeps us informed, but we need a bigger voice after the 2019 elections here.\nI have been involved in arguments about devolution and regional industrial and economic development, particularly in the North West, for over 50 years? I agree that, logically, devolution should precede development because the point of devolution is to make development happen.\nHowever, that doesn't seem to me the best political approach. We should start with the things we want to achieve and then, when that has sunk home, we should argue the case for devolution. Succinctly, it should be sold as a means not an end.\nThe biggest case is that for economic, industrial, commercial, entrepreneurial development. It is entirely clear that the UK's obsession with London and the South East puts the majority of the UK population in a poorer, less secure and more fragile position that all other large democracies and even some authoritarian states. the UK contains the richest and the eight poorest regions in the EU; the economic difference between richest and poorest regions of the UK is greater than that in the US and China (source: The Economist); etc. The overwhelming majority of other countries have federal, devolved or long-term decentralised structures with direct political power at regional level. The UK has never built a coherent political element into devolution and has suffered as a result (source: John Smith Institute Report). The Northern Powerhouse and metro mayors seem fated for the same degree of central government neglect leading to abolition that has characterised previous initiatives.\nBoth the development argument and the people argument provide a strong case for effective investment in infrastructure. It will be better, longer-term and counter-cyclical if led regionally\nThe role of the Manchester Mayor in overseeing health and social care spending is important - if it were to be sustained. I have no doubt that both funding and organisation issues would be dealt with much better if there were real devolution of control, including money-raising and spending. Currently, the NHS is a bureaucratic nightmare with little strategic, political control and random accountability.\nThe case for devolution can go on and on in these terms. The crucial point is that it is part of the answer to a series of crucial political questions. It's a means not an end.\nI am a convinced devolutionist but still find it weird that, in England, whose internal borders have been highly fluid and pragmatically malleable for years, we continue to accept that people will 'want' or can be persuaded of the merits of democratic devolution where people have not been democratically involved in defining the borders of the areas to which power is to be devolved.\nThat leaves devolutionists either with overlapping patchworks of bodies with differing potential constituencies (contrast metro-mayors / crime commmissioners / NHS trusts, for eg), trying to merge existing areas into incoherent ones (see also some of the metro-mayors), or trying to revive defunct historic areas (like Yorkshire).\nI know you'll all hate it, but at some point, someone is going to have to ask people in England where they think they live.\nI agree with Matt. Devolution will only work when the people are continually involved, whether that is by petitions, referenda or a citizens assembly. Politicians too easily lose contact with reality and are too focused on the next set of elections. People power is what it is all about. What are they afraid of?",

First and foremost, I believe the British people should be given the right to vote on the government's negotiated Brexit deal.\nVoting for a departure is not the same as voting for a destination. This is not an attempt to re-run the first referendum; we must respect the result. But the British people should be allowed to choose what comes next, to ensure it is right for them, their families, their jobs and our country. Our relationship with Europe affects our economy, our security, climate change, our influence in the world and so much more.\nUntil people get that choice, we will hold the Conservative Brexit Government to account and fight to make sure that Britain gets the best deal possible. So I am also setting out our approach on everything from the triggering of article 50 to the rights of EU citizens in the UK. While all the other parties are ducking these vital issues, we are tackling them head on. These questions are simply too important to ignore.\nOn that grim morning when we learned that Britain had voted to leave the European Union, I told the BBC that I remained as passionate about our European future then as I was before the vote. And that remains true today. If anything, as I see the Conservatives doing their best to turn the country I love into something of an isolated, international laughing stock, and I see an increase in hate crimes on our streets, my determination to see Britain remain outward-looking, open and generous at the heart of Europe has actually increased.\nWith the Conservative Brexit Government failing to set out its plan and explain to people what the consequences of Brexit will be, it is more vital than ever that passionate pro-Europeans hold their feet to the fire. Labour under Jeremy Corbyn has abandoned the field, offering no meaningful opposition whatsoever. And so it falls to the Liberal Democrats to provide the opposition to the Conservative Brexit government. We are the only party fighting to keep Britain open, tolerant and united.\nSo our policy on Europe is simple: we want to stay in the European Union. We wanted that the day before the referendum, we wanted it the day after and we want it today. We may have lost the referendum but that doesn't change what we believe is right for the United Kingdom. So when the Conservatives do eventually present the country with a deal for life outside the European Union, we believe people have a right to have their say.\nAnd let me be clear: I don't believe there is any deal that Theresa May can do that will be better for Britain than being a member of the European Union. So when people are given that choice, I intend to make the case loudly and clearly that we believe Britain should stay in the European Union.\nPeople have been let down for decades by short-termist politicians who put the needs of one part of society above the rest. Now, in the wake of the Brexit vote, those divisions are more exposed than ever. With our country facing huge challenges - from inequality and injustice to an NHS in crisis and an economy in jeopardy - we are left with a reckless, divisive and uncaring Conservative Government - and a Labour Party fighting with itself rather than doing its job as the official opposition.\nThis is why the Liberal Democrats are now the real opposition to the Conservative Brexit government - and the only party fighting to keep Britain open, tolerant and united.\n* Tim Farron is Leader of the Liberal Democrats, MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale and a former President of the Liberal Democrats.\nComments Tim Farron MP writes…A Liberal Democrat plan for Britain in Europe",

We must prove we can deliver it\nFor Liberal Democrats, one of the silver linings in last week's necessarily tough spending review was the introduction of a £2.5bn \"pupil premium\" to help close the unacceptable gap between the life chances of advantaged and disadvantaged children. This was one of the four main pledges on which the Lib Dems fought the general election, and as a former schools spokesman for the party I was particularly pleased and proud to see the delivery of this promise. This shows that the coalition is determined to pursue an agenda of creating real opportunity for all, even as it has to grapple with the problem of the budget deficit.\nSome people have tried to make mischief by claiming that the pupil premium is not additional money. This is nonsense. Without the pupil premium, I suspect that the budget for schools would have been based on a per pupil cash freeze for the period up to 2015. That would have meant a real cut in schools funding over the next few years. Instead, schools funding will rise by 0.1% (above inflation) each year until 2015 - that is a major achievement when the budgets of some departments are being cut by as much as a third. This is also a real-terms guarantee which the last Labour government was not able to make.\nI know that Nick Clegg and Sarah Teather, as well as education secretary Michael Gove, have worked hard to ensure that schools were one of the real winners of the spending review. I am also grateful to my excellent Lib Dem successor as Treasury chief secretary - Danny Alexander - for helping to deliver the goods.\nIt would, however, be a terrible mistake to think that the main purpose of the pupil premium is to protect schools from cuts. Its real purpose is to help lift the educational performance of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, so closing the shameful gap in life chances in our country.\nThe pupil premium is designed to have two beneficial effects. First, because the extra money follows the child, it will ensure that deprivation funding is far better targeted than it is now. Second, the premium will deliver extra money to the schools with the highest level of challenge - giving them an opportunity to combat disadvantage. Too few schools facing real challenges currently have the money to make a difference, for example with more one-to-one tuition, a longer school day, holiday classes, or paying more to attract the best teachers.\nSchools need to understand that they are being allocated the pupil premium to ensure that every child has a real chance to succeed. It is intolerable that so many young people, for example, still leave primary education with very poor reading, writing and maths skills.\nSo schools must not use the pupil premium to avoid making efficiency savings - they need to ensure that the pupil premium is used to do more for those who need the help most.\nThis government should not dictate to each school precisely how it should use the pupil premium - the coalition is moving away from Labour's obsession with micro-management. Schools will be held to account for their outcomes, and not for following some government mandated method.\nBut we should develop a clear framework of accountability, including through Ofsted, to ensure that the pupil premium is being used both effectively and for its purpose. There should be clear advice and support available to schools so that best practice in using the premium can be spread. Schools which fail to use the premium to close the performance gap, or who use the money ineffectively, must be held to account.\nProving that the pupil premium can deliver is crucial if we are to develop this policy in the future. By 2014/15 the government will be spending £2.5bn on the premium, but I would personally like to see funding in the next parliament grow towards £5bn per year, to cover more pupils and to ensure that schools have the resources to match the very tough challenges. We therefore need to revisit this issue later in this parliament, by which time the public finances should be in much better shape. But if we are to persuade the chancellor of the exchequer to continue to grow this programme further, schools now need to rise to the challenge which has been set.",

Do you trust him?\nThe Erasmus mobility scheme changes young people's lives. The Lib Dems will fight relentlessly to keep it.\nI never thought I'd see a student exchange programme trend on Twitter. People have told stories of studying and working abroad through Erasmus, sharing tales of friendships built, skills learned, and lives changed. Why? Because MPs voted against my amendment to keep the UK in Erasmus after the Brexit transition period. And people are angry.\nThe benefits of Erasmus are so obvious to the thousands of people who take part in the programme. Each year, more than 17,000 students at UK universities study or work abroad as part of their degree. They go because Erasmus has made studying abroad attractive and affordable. The EU gives them a monthly living grant, with young people from low-income backgrounds receiving higher bursaries and travel grants.\nIt really is an opportunity for everyone. College students, apprentices, adult learners, schools, youth programmes and teachers can all take part. Erasmus not only funds study abroad opportunities, but teacher training, partnerships between universities and colleges, as well as schemes to share best practice in education and youth policy.\nStudents who take part are more likely to find a job after graduating. One in three students who work during their placement get a job with their placement company after they graduate.\nBut what people remember most about studying abroad normally isn't that they increased their employment prospects. They recall learning a new language, falling in love with the culture and building new friendships.\nBy voting against the Liberal Democrats' amendment last week, Conservative MPs showed they are at least prepared to throw away all these benefits. It is devastating.\nBut the fight is not over. For a start, we're trying again in the House of Lords. My colleague Mike Storey is expected to propose another amendment to keep the UK in Erasmus. It's already been backed by crossbench and Green peers.\nBut there's another reason to keep fighting. I don't think the government has made up its mind about whether to stay in Erasmus or not.\nAt prime minister's questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson downplayed fears. \"There is no threat to the Erasmus scheme,\" he told MPs. \"UK students will continue to be able to enjoy the benefits of exchanges with our European friends and partners.\"\nCertainly, the Brexit deal leaves open the door to the UK staying in Erasmus. Why then, just 24 hours earlier, did the secretary of state for education, Gavin Williamson, send out mixed signals? He told the Commons that Erasmus membership \"will be a question for further negotiations\" and that the UK would \"develop our own alternative arrangements should they be needed\".\nYou would have thought that, three and a half years after the referendum, the government might have a clear position. But we're reliant instead on the comments of a prime minister who has form in getting into trouble over off-the-cuff remarks. If Erasmus is really not under threat, why were Conservative MPs ordered to vote down our amendment last week?\nThe prime minister must now back up his words with actions. Universities warn that a UK-led replacement would find it impossible to match the reputation, brand awareness and sheer scale of Erasmus. We need a clear, unambiguous promise from the government to negotiate to remain a full member.\nThe sad truth is that we may never get any certainty about the government's plans until it's too late. Before the general election, the EU withdrawal agreement bill included a section forcing the government to publish its negotiating objectives. Now, that safeguard is gone. The government can negotiate what it likes, and Tory MPs will blindly vote for what's in front of them.\nStaying in Erasmus should be a no-brainer, yet we have a fight on our hands to save it. Liberal Democrats will campaign relentlessly to stop the Conservatives taking us out of Erasmus and many other vital EU programmes. We will not lot Boris Johnson weaken our education system and limit the horizons of our young people.\nLayla Moran is education spokesperson for the Lib Dems",

Maybe they think the \"Britain standing alone\" motif adds much-needed heroic purpose to a Brexit future in which Britain stands without trading partners or allies to tackle climate change.\nBut they rarely invoke one feature of wartime: the national government steering Britain from disaster. Now that Britain faces its gravest emergency since the war, we might soon need another national government, purely to deliver a Brexit referendum.\nThe crisis demands a backbench rebellion with the likes of Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn working with the reinvigorated Liberal Democrats to bring down this rotten government. Jeremy Corbyn calls constantly for a general election but no Tory MP will pass a vote of no confidence in the government if a general election will follow. But might the likes of Dominic Grieve and Oliver Letwin join with progressive MPs to vote down a government committed to no deal if no election came next? Even Philip Hammond would.\nFirst, this backbench coalition must come together to prevent an incoming Tory leader proroguing parliament and forcing a no-deal Brexit on an increasingly doubtful public. If Boris Johnson tried that, it would be an effective putsch or coup d'etat against parliament. MPs who vote to stop such a hard Brexit no-deal coup would, in effect, self-select as supporters of a national government.\nThis is no attempt to gain power through coalition. Such a government of national unity would be short-lived and have one policy: to deliver a referendum. Even if more policy agreement could be found, there would be no point: as Theresa May has demonstrated, government currently lacks bandwidth to deliver Brexit, let alone more\nAfter a referendum, there would soon have to be a general election. Other MPs could return to their parties, and as Liberal Democrat leader I would take my party back into opposition and fight to win that election. But in parliament today we should recognise that Brexit has broken the party system. And just as one party proved incapable of delivering Brexit, so we will need more than one party to stop Brexit.\nMeanwhile, we need pro-European Labour figures who voted LibDem in their thousands to join us to give this move momentum (in the genuine sense of the word). I disagreed profoundly with Alastair Campbell and co over Iraq, but on the great issue of today we are on the same side against hard-right, dangerous nationalism.\nAny genuine progressive should work together to stop Brexit - this is a national emergency, requiring national cooperation.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_standing-for-election-isn-t-just-about-winning-1/content_116.html": "The obvious reason to stand for election is that you want and hope to win.\nA related common reason is that you want to win and hope that standing this time means you can win on a future occasion. But it also makes sense to stand even if winning isn't on the foreseeable agenda and you are what is often called a 'paper candidate'*.\nI've written before about the advantages of standing in unwinnable council by-elections. (The brief version: even an unwinnable contest is a chance to practice, to learn, to experiment and to raise the odds of winning somewhere else, sometime in the future.)\nIt's slightly different when it comes to standing in non-target wards in the usual run of council elections. Different, but still the same basic point: standing still brings many benefits.\nFirst, it's good for democracy. Having different parties put up candidates is the necessary condition for voters to make choices between them. The mere act of having your name on the ballot paper is a contribution to making democracy function - and democracy could do with all the contributions we can give.\nSecond, it's good for voters. It's deeply frustrating for many voters when they turn up to vote and see their preferred party isn't on the ballot paper. They may just feel frustrated (and boy, do they feel frustrated as I know having had the job of fielding such complaints from voters in the past). Or they may also blame the party for, in their eyes, treating them with disdain for not giving them a candidate to vote for. Frustration or frustration and disdain; either way, that's not how we should be leaving voters feeling.\nThird it's good for the party. One of the biggest challenges the Liberal Democrats face is to build up a large group of loyal supporters who persistently support us. Our core support is tiny compared to that of our main rivals - and we suffer for it. It makes us more vulnerable to bad times. It means we have further to go and harder to work to get to the winning post than rival parties with larger core voter.\nYet the one sure way to ensure people don't become persistent supporters is to insist that they should not be allowed to vote for us thanks to not putting up a candidate. No Liberal Democrat on the ballot paper means us saying to voters: 'we refuse to let you be loyal supporters of us'.\nStanding also helps the party identify better where its support currently is, and isn't. Having a full slate of candidates across the board helps spot areas that can be promising to target and try to win in the future.\nAll of which is why even if being a candidate does not mean more than getting a name on a ballot paper, it's still a valuable contribution to make.\nHundreds of party members do that every May - thank you. With next May's elections nearing, it's a terrific contribution you can make if you join them and ensure another vacancy has a Liberal Democrat name next to it come May.\nAnd in the meantime, lets contest as many council by-elections as possible - something made much easier with a bit of preparation.\nP.S. If winning is indeed your reason for standing, there's a book I'd recommend…\n* More accurately, a paperless candidate really as a 'paper' candidate doesn't then go and put out lots of leaflets.",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_migrants-welcome-and-fear/content_184.html": "Migrants: Welcome and fear\nRecently I was out with some Bishop's Stortford Liberal Democrats, gathering signatures on a petition for citizens of other EU nations currently in the UK to be allowed to remain in the UK. In a few hours we gathered just over 250 signatures on a not-that-busy street. Some were delighted to sign. Some were relieved that we were not taking the opposite position. Some said their businesses would struggle without people from other parts of the EU.\nMore worrying was the small minority who disagreed, loudly wanting foreigners to \"go home\". A prize for confusion goes to the person who said that, and then added that she wanted to retire to France.\nThen came an apparently-xenophobic attack on two Poles in Harlow and Theresa May's assertion that curbing immigration will take priority over access to the single market in Brexit talks. She must know this is unrealistic: freedom of movement is one of the pillars of the single market and Switzerland's access to EU programmes was curtailed after they sought to restrict migration.\nThe sense of farce is heightened by a survey from British Future saying that only a third of people think the government will meet its immigration targets over the next five years and a claim from Boris Johnson that people didn't vote Leave because of immigration.\nEconomic reality is that migration addresses skill shortages and builds connection that stabilises peace. In taking two million Syrian refugees, Angela Merkel was shrewdly addressing the problem, which we share, of an ageing population. Immigrants pay taxes and boost economic activity, creating jobs as well as taking them.\nStoking people's fears makes it harder to name and address our real problems.\nI had a chilling illustration canvassing in the General Election campaign when someone told me they were worried about the effects of austerity on their friends and family. Without pausing for breath, they blamed immigrants, so were going to vote for the Conservatives because they are tough on immigration, overlooking the fact that this meant they were voting for the party ideologically-committed to the austerity that was hurting them. The Tories and brilliantly exported the blame for the effects of their policies onto immigrants. This was in a constituency where 95% of the population are white British, so it's hard to see that there were enough immigrants to have the effect attributed to them.\nBlaming immigrants has become a way to duck responsibility for under-investment in the NHS, failure to build housing and for the effects of austerity. It's grossly irresponsible, both for future relations with our European neighbours, and for the fabric of British society. It's not worked in the past, and there is no reason to believe it will work now.\nThe people happy to sign a petition to help protect EU nationals working in the UK point in an open and positive direction. It might not be a coincidence that these people reacted well when I said I would be the Liberal Democrat candidate if there is a snap election, and standing on a pro-EU ticket.\n* \"Mark Argent is PPC for Hertford and Stortford, and was formerly Chair of Cambridge LibDems",

I would expect the government to set up a specialist team to negotiate this aspect of Brexit, and parliament should be kept fully informed at all times. These issues require ongoing cross-party support.\n\"Opting into the latest Europol measure is the first test of the government's resolve on this issue. The clock is ticking but so far the government has sat on its hands. This is not an issue that can be fudged to appease Tory backbenchers.\"\nMinisters must decide by the end of this year whether to accept a new, expanded remit for Europol, agreed by the 28 member states after the Paris and Brussels terror attacks. If they do, the UK police and intelligence services will continue to have full access to Europol databases and services. However, many Tory MPs will see the move as a \"fudge\" and a sign that the prime minister is backing away from a \"hard Brexit\". Crucially, if the UK stays in Europol it will have to pay budget contributions to the EU and accept a role for the European Court of Justice in resolving disputes - two conditions unacceptable for hardcore Brexiters.\nWere the government to reject the deal, the UK would drop out of Europol from May next year. The many UK staff at its headquarters in The Hague, including its British director, Rob Wainwright, would have to go.\nMay has raised the issue with international leaders in recent weeks, expressing her preference for remaining in Europol but also her fears that her party will see such a move as an early Brexit capitulation. In a speech in April, before the Brexit vote, she cited crime-fighting and sharing intelligence at EU level as a major reason for staying in the EU.\n\"Our response to Paris and Brussels cannot be to say that we should have less co-operation with countries that are not only our allies but our nearest neighbours,\" she said.\nIn a recent report, the Commons European scrutiny committee demanded a debate in parliament before any decision is made and expressed disappointment that ministers had said so little on the subject.\nThe Home Office said that no decision had yet been taken: \"The prime minister has stated that law enforcement cooperation will continue when the UK is outside the EU, and we will do what is necessary to keep our people safe.

Once we know, the people must have a vote on it\nThe Lib Dems are clear: the government cannot negotiate in secret - it must tell the public the terms of the deal it strikes and hold a second referendum\nAs leader of the Liberal Democrats, I have been clear that what started with democracy in June cannot end with a stitch-up. The government is determined to prevent any scrutiny of its plans, cook up a deal between Brussels and Westminster bureaucrats and foist it upon the country - a plan that no one will have voted for.\nPeople are clearly worried about the government's plans. No one has an idea of even its vaguest intention. For example, will it try to keep Britain in the single market, which is crucial to our economy?\nIt does not matter which side of this debate you were on. Whether you voted leave or remain, you deserve the right to have a say on what happens next, and the Lib Dems will fight to give that to you.\nThat's why, unless the government backs our plan to give the public a say, we will vote against triggering article 50. We want a guarantee that there will be a referendum on the deal at the end of the negotiations, when people can vote for that deal or to remain in Europe.\nTo those who say that our plans are undemocratic, I say: what could be more democratic than giving people a vote?\nDavid Cameron's government did not lay out plans for what Brexit would look like. The various leave campaigns did not set out one plan for what Brexit would look like. The leave campaign during the referendum set out plans for spending another £350m a week on the NHS, in the event of Brexit - which Theresa May has now admitted won't happen.\nMay did not set out plans in her leadership campaign for what Brexit would look like. She has not been elected as prime minister on the basis of any plans at all, let alone about Brexit. The government to this day has not even given the lightest pencil-sketch of an idea of what Brexit would look like. And on top of all that, it is appealing against a high court ruling in order to stop MPs having any scrutiny on the direction Brexit takes - whatever that may be.\nSince nobody has set out what Brexit would look like, and nobody - neither MPs nor the public - has had a say on what should come next, how is it undemocratic to demand that people should be given a say? Those who want to railroad through a plan without guaranteeing the people a say are the ones pursuing an undemocratic path.\nThe referendum starkly divided our country - 52% of people voted to leave, 48% to remain. We all must have a say on our next step.\nThis Conservative-Brexit government seems to have set off along a path that could lead to \"hard Brexit\", which would cost Britain dearly. That is why Lib Dems will also seek to amend the government's plans to ensure membership of the single market becomes part of its negotiation plans.\nThe single market is a British invention that creates the framework in which tariff-free trade is conducted, and is crucial for jobs, investment and planning.\nI believe the government cannot come back with a Brexit deal that is better than our membership. That is why my party campaigned for a remain vote. But when that deal is done, whatever it looks like, it should be put to a referendum.\nToo much of Cameron's handling of this issue was trying to unite a divided Conservative party. It is now critical that the government puts aside narrow party interest.\nFor these reasons, the only circumstances in which the Lib Dems could vote for article 50 is if any such vote includes an explicit guarantee to put the direction of Brexit back into the hands of the people through a referendum on the deal. We trusted people to vote for departure. Now we must also trust people to vote for a destination",

The idea of a left-wing Labour leader insisting his party must support a right-wing Conservative government on the major issue of the day is so at odds with the usual widespread Labour line of 'Tories are evil and don't have anything to do with them' (see coalition years, passim) that it is hard to predict how the fractures would play out.

It has also done wonders for social mobility, something that any UK-created alternative scheme would find it very difficult to replicate due to budgetary constraints.\n\"Brexit puts all that at threat, and we must do everything we can to protect Erasmus once we leave the European Union.\n\"That is why I have tabled this motion to acknowledge the good that Erasmus does, keeping the pressure on the Government to do the right thing and commit to seeking full association of Erasmus post-Brexit.\"\nEDM Details: [92] Future Membership of Erasmus +\n\"That this House celebrates that over 17,000 students at UK universities studied or worked abroad through the Erasmus+ programme in 2017-18, as well as thousands of school pupils, college students, apprentices, adult learners and teachers who took part in projects to study, work or train abroad, build international partnerships and share best practice; recognises that Erasmus+ has made studying abroad attractive and affordable by providing financial assistance to students who take part; highlights that the benefits of studying or working abroad include increased employability and the opportunities to learn a new language, fall in love with another country's culture, build new friendships and act as ambassadors for the UK overseas; notes that the EU intends to expand Erasmus+ from 2021, with MEPs voting in March 2019 both to triple its budget for 2021-27 compared to 2014-20, and to place greater emphasis on widening access to study abroad opportunities for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; recalls the conclusions of the House of Lords European Union Committee's 28th Report of Session 2017-19 that a replacement UK-led student mobility scheme would find it impossible to replicate aspects of Erasmus which are key to facilitating international exchanges, namely, the programme's strong brand, trusted reputation, common rulebook and framework for partnership agreements, and its established network of potential partners; and accordingly calls on the Government to follow the Committee's recommendation to seek full association to the 2021-27 Erasmus programme.\"",

That is why I and my party have always been critical of tuition fees,\" he says.\n\"The perception of [a tuition fee] is that it imposes a wall of debt as you walk through the entry gates of university. This has a chilling effect on applications. It sends a signal which seems to be discouraging.\"\nMr Clegg concedes there would be difficulties, saying: \"The question is whether you can make it work. You might not be able to.\"\nUniversity funding is one of the most divisive issues facing the Coalition. University leaders, backed by many Conservative MPs, want the cap on annual tuition fees to be lifted, allowing colleges to charge as much as £10,000 a year.\nBut the Lib Dems' election campaign promised to fight any increase in fees, which are unpopular with student groups. When Mr Cable floated the idea last month, it was thought that it was not being considered seriously at the highest level of government.\nMr Clegg's intervention suggests that the policy is, in fact, the Government's preferred option.\nDavid Willetts, the Universities Minister, this week insisted that the Browne review should be allowed to report on the issue. Earlier this week, Mr Clegg said middle-class children had taken a \"disproportionate\" share of university places in recent years, and pledged to change the situation.\nHe promised that five years of the Coalition would deliver clear improvements in social mobility.\nHe pledged to break down the \"social segregation\" in which middle-class children dominated higher education and the professions.\nIn the interview, Mr Clegg says that work is more important to him than Lib Dem attempts to change the voting system, which was a central demand in entering a coalition with the Conservatives.\nEnding the first-past-the post system is not \"the be all and end all\", and the Lib Dems will not walk out of the Coalition if their reforms are rejected, Mr Clegg says.\nThe Deputy Prime Minister talks down next year's referendum on electoral reform. If voters reject the proposed move to the alternative vote system it \"won't be the end of the world\", he says. \"I'm not going to throw my teddies out of the pram.\"\nA Downing Street spokesman said: \"We are not going to pre-empt Lord Browne's review into university funding, the results of which we are expecting in due course.\"\nAny move to impose a levy on graduates' pay would be controversial. Universities would not receive the funding directly. Instead they would have to rely on the Government to give it to them.\nCritics of the plan claim it would remove competition between universities, with less popular institutions still guaranteed funding regardless of how many students apply.\nResearch suggested that under the scheme, professionals would end up paying tens of thousands more over their working lives for a university education than they did by paying annual tuition fees.\nTo avoid a public backlash, Mr Clegg signals that ministers are likely to present the post-university levy as a \"graduate contribution\" and argue that it is simply a deferred tuition fee.\n\"As soon as you mention a tax, people go a bit loopy,\" Mr Clegg says. \"It's saying that students make a contribution, but we're not going to do it in a way that stops students applying, and we're going to make it dependent on how much benefit you get from going to university.\"\nWithdrawing benefits from drug addicts and alcoholics who do not take up treatment would be \"fundamentally inhumane\", a senior Liberal Democrat has claimed.\nThe Government is considering financial sanctions for welfare claimants who fail to address their addictions, it emerged yesterday. Tom Brake, the chairman of the Lib Dem backbench committee on home affairs, said he and some colleagues would be opposed to the measure.",

In fact, of the 79,000 people who have already been subjected to a benefits cap, only 23,000 (30%) have managed to find the level of work that would allow them to retain their benefits.\nFrom today the cap will be lowered even more, to £23,000. This will affect a further 88,000 people, with the average household losing £2000 each year. Single parents will be worse hit, as many anecdotes demonstrate.\nThe party has tabled a motion in the Lords, to be debated on Tuesday, which proposes that there should be increased support for getting people back to work. This is, of course, only a part of the solution to deal with a very messy situation.\nCathy Bakewell (pictured) is our Liberal Democrat Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, and she says:\n-\nLowering the benefit cap means it is no longer doing the job for which it was originally introduced. Cutting thousands of people's benefits is just cruel, but failing to help them find work is just reckless.\n-\nThe Government needs to plough any savings they make from the cap into supporting those affected by it. If they are unwilling to do so, then they are accepting their new lower cap is purely a PR exercise aimed at attacking those on benefits. Those are not the actions of a civilised society.\n* Mary Reid is the Monday Editor on Lib Dem Voice.\nComments on Lib Dems table motion on benefit cap",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_lord-william-wallace-writes-brexit-endgame/content_461.html": "Lord William Wallace writes… Brexit endgame?\nThis feels like the endgame for Brexit - and quite possibly for Boris Johnson. Briefings in Sunday papers on how the prime minister will refuse to resign when Parliament next votes him down - remember, he hasn't won a single vote yet - to force the Queen to dissolve Parliament and let him fight an election on the 'betrayal' of Brexit suggest that he doesn't expect the latest negotiations to succeed, and doesn't know how to evade the terms of the Benn 'Surrender' Act.\nThe tactical judgement of Johnson's advisers is that they can win an election on these terms, in spite of leaving themselves open to attack from the Brexit Party for being pushed into another extension.\nOthers have their own tactical considerations in mind. The SNP want an early election, before the embarrassing trial of Alex Salmond is due to start in the New Year; that's one reason why they've said they're willing to accept Jeremy Corbyn as a brief caretaker prime minister. Many Labour MPs rightly fear an early election, under an unpopular leader and against an effective populist; quietly, many would welcome an alternative caretaker premier who would hold things together while the Conservative Party fell apart.\nIt's to our advantage for the bankruptcy of the Conservative approach to Brexit to sink in to the British public - which means an election some time after October 31st, or preparation for a referendum overseen by an interim government.\nWhich should come first, election or referendum? Labour strategists see the attractions of a second referendum before an election, allowing them then to campaign on their domestic agenda. The problem is that it necessarily takes much longer to prepare for a referendum - agreeing the questions and the competing campaign organizations, allowing for a better-informed campaign over several months. Since this will only happen if and when the current government collapses, it will require more than a caretaker government: a 'government of national unity' which could hold together through at least 4-6 months, presenting a budget, taking unavoidable decisions, coping with unexpected crises abroad and at home. That would mean not just agreeing on the temporary head of government but negotiating a coalition agreement, and allocating Cabinet and ministerial posts among several parties and a clutch of independents. That's a different order of complexity than a 4-6 week caretaker government during an election campaign, and requires a much higher level of mutual understanding and trust. Remember, we have hard experience of coalition government.\nEvents may well sweep tactical preferences away. We may find ourselves in an acute constitutional crisis in three weeks' time. The gradual departure of one-nation Tories from a party that has been taken over by its radical right may speed up. We can take advantage of developments, but we cannot control them. Jo Swinson has been right to resist accepting that Jeremy Corbyn has the right to take office if Johnson is forced out; he could not assemble a Commons majority behind him either. Replacing a weak Prime Minister for whom Dominic Cummings pulls the strings with a weaker man for whom Seamas Milne pulls the strings would provide no solution for the current chaos.\nSo we will most probably end up with an election first, at some point over the winter. The Liberal Democrats are getting stronger month by month, winning by-elections, gaining members, at last bringing in additional funds. Working in London, I happily note that we are taken much more seriously than we used to be. A city lawyer even said to me last week that our record in the coalition qualified us for government, and that she would now be campaigning for Chuka Umunna. And I met a businessman whose name I knew from the media, at a charity concert, who told me that he had just joined our party - 'my children persuaded me'.\nAn election will not leave us in an easy situation. Which would you prefer: an outcome in which one party (most probably not ours) wins a bare majority of seats on a third or less of the votes, or one which creates a Parliament with 3 or 4 significant parties apart from ourselves, none of which have more than 200 seats? But the time to worry about that will be after October 31st; we have to get past the immediate crisis first.\n* Lord Wallace of Saltaire is a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords.",

In the same way that I take responsibility for appointments in my team, he takes responsibility for appointments to his team.'\nThe comments came as Prime Minister David Cameron was under renewed pressure today over his contacts with senior executives at News Corporation.\nAides have now confirmed that Mr Cameron had discussed the company's bid to take over BSkyB with the media players.\nThe attack from his coalition partner will add to the pressure on Cameron and deepen the cracks in government\nDavid Cameron is said to have discussed BSkyB with senior executives of Rupert Murdoch, left, and to have been warned about hiring Andy Coulson, right\nMr Clegg said that there were 'murky practices and dodgy relationships' at the heart of Britain's establishment.\nHe said the hacking scandal, and allegations that police officers were paid by the press for information, had 'shaken' faith in the police and brought public opinion of politicians to an even lower level\nThe Lib Dem leader sought to establish a distinctive position for his party, saying: 'I don't think anyone should be surprised that the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives come at this issue from completely different directions.\n'We were the only party in opposition to call for an inquiry into the phone-hacking allegations, even before the election.\nMr Clegg said that the judge-led inquiry into the hacking allegations provided a once-in-a-generation opportunity to clean up the media, politics and the police, by legislation if necessary. Politicians must be ready to accept Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations and act on them, he said.\nLiberal Democrats have not been implicated in the recent furore over politicians' relations with the press, but Mr Clegg has struggled to capitalise on this in the polls.\nMr Clegg added: 'Going back further than that, we were the only party to campaign for new pluralism rules in the media. The Liberal Democrats have had a particularly unique role in raising issues which were ignored by the other parties for years and years, most notably by the last Labour government.\n'I was the first person in Government to say it had to be a judge-led inquiry. I was the first person in Government to say that Rupert Murdoch needed to reconsider his bid.\n'I was the first person in Government to say we needed to cover not just the police and press but politicians as well.\n'On each and every one of these counts, I pushed that case and thankfully we have now got the right kind of inquiry, which I think will go a long, long way to cleaning up what was a very, very unhealthy state of affairs.\n'I passionately believe in open, transparent balanced government where people are not in each other's pockets, and that is what I think we now have an opportunity to achieve over the next few months and years, and that is an opportunity I hope we will seize.'\nQuizzed: James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, earlier this week\nMr Clegg added: 'I think that we now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to really clean up the murky practices and dodgy relationships which have taken root at the very heart of the British establishment between the press, politicians and the police.\n'That is what we now need to get on and do. That's what the independent judge-led inquiry will allow us to do. We must act on any recommendations from that inquiry quickly, if necessary through legislation as well.'\nPressure on the Prime Minister has escalated as Downing Street said that Mr Cameron could not rule out that BSkyB was mentioned during his meetings with senior News Corp figures\nThese included chairman Rupert Murdoch and his close friends, the former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks.\nBut Downing Street insisted that none of his conversations were 'inappropriate'.\nCulture Secretary Jeremy Hunt - who had responsibility for making the final decision on the bid, which has now been dropped - told MPs last night: 'The discussions the Prime Minister had on the BSkyB deal were irrelevant.\n'They were irrelevant because the person who had the responsibility... the person who was making this decision was myself.'\nRead more here",

The third group of low-skilled workers would only be able to stay if there were staff shortages.\nBusiness leaders sounded the alarm over restrictions to foreign workers who make up a critical part of the workforce in the NHS and social care, as well as in hospitality and on farms.\nMs May's immigration white paper in 2018, proposed a \"time-limited route for temporary short-term workers\" to mitigate the \"challenges faced by employers who would find it difficult immediately to adapt\" to new immigration rules.\nBut a No 10 source told the paper: \"As we leave the EU in just over 10 days' time, we have an unprecedented opportunity to change the way our immigration system works.\n\"There is a clear drive for talented and skilled workers from around the world to come to the UK, but we also need to see a reduction in the number of unskilled workers and those without a job entering the UK and that's why this will be coming to an end when the transition period ends in December.\"\nMr Johnson will make a final decision once he has received recommendations from the government's Migration Advisory Committee, which are expected within weeks.\nDiane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said: \"This is an ill-informed and reactionary policy that will damage us all, damaging to everything from the NHS to other public services and some of our key private sector industries.\n\"Ministers talk about ending uncontrolled migration when they have been in office for 10 years. In reality this is just a new twist in the long Tory campaign against migrants, scapegoating them for the terrible effects of Tory policies.\"\nLiberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Christine Jardine said the changes were \"utterly unworkable\" and impossible to implement in time.\n\"Decisions like this make it loud and clear that this Conservative government has no intention off ending the hostile environment,\" she said.\n\"It's a national embarrassment. For business and our economy, such draconian changes to immigration rules is utterly unworkable. To think the Home Office could implement the changes in the time given is a joke.\"\nMeanwhile, ministers have reportedly kick-started no-deal planning once more amid fears trade talks with Brussels could collapse.\nWhitehall's EU Exit Operations committee, which is chaired by Michael Gove, met on Thursday to discuss preparations for a no deal at the end of the year, according to the Mail on Sunday.\nThe prime minister is facing a new Brexit cliff edge in December when the transition period ends - and the UK could crash out of the EU without a trade agreement.\nBrussels has warned repeatedly that the timetable is too tight but Mr Johnson has enshrined the date in his Brexit legislation, which is expected to clear the House of Lords this week.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_liberal-international-s-african-reach/content_419.html": "Liberal International’s African Reach\nWhen Liberal International was founded in Oxford nearly 70 years ago it was very much a European affair. With the noble exception of Canada, Liberal parties and values were largely confined to northern Europe, but since then the picture has changed dramatically. As we in Britain lick our wounds from the double whammy of the Brexit vote and the triumph of Donald Trump in the United States let us take comfort from the fact that the Liberal family is growing worldwide. This was dramatically illustrated by the Liberal International (LI) Executive in Marrakesh, at which five new African parties - from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Madagascar, Senegal and Somalia - were welcomed into membership last weekend, which means that LI now has almost 50 member parties from Africa alone.\nThe Marrakesh gathering was timed to coincide with COP22, the latest in a series of global conferences following up on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. So it was hardly surprising that environmental issues figured prominently in LI's discussions this time. Indeed, one of the keynote speakers was Morocco's Minister for the Environment, Hakima el Haite, who belongs to the Moroccan party that was one of our hosts, le Mouvement Populaire. Human rights were also very much on the agenda; to a large degree they are LI's USP, as none of the other political internationals address them sufficiently seriously. Helen Zille, Premier of the Western Cape in South Africa (which LI member party, the Democratic Alliance, controls) gave a particularly inspiring address relating to gender equality.\nFor much of 2016 a working group has been writing a Liberal Manifesto which aims to be a campaigning tool for Liberal parties worldwide. This was also discussed at Marrakesh and a final version should be ready in time for the organisation's 70th anniversary next year. 2017 will see crucial elections in both France and Germany, in particular, and as the forces of illiberalism rally to fight those it is vital that the Liberal International's member parties, including the Liberal Democrats, are in fine fettle to take them on.\nJonathan Fryer is a former Chair of London Liberal Democrats and is a member of the LibDems' Federal Executive",

As we enter the final furlong of national campaigning, people's feelings - based on my own observations and feedback I've received from across the country - couldn't be clearer.\nThe discontent with the two main parties in UK politics - the Conservative and Labour parties - is palpable. There was general discontent with parliament in the wake of the 2009 expenses scandal at the time of the 2010 election (the first I stood in as a candidate). Take that level of discontent and multiply it tenfold and you still do not come close to how angry and dismayed people are. This is a feature of the majority of doorstep conversations our candidates have had all over the country. The Brexit chaos features as a reason, of course - but it is the general incompetence, ineptitude and a failure to do the basic constitutional duties of government and official opposition that people talk about.\nBoris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have turbo-charged the disillusionment. The levels of vitriol directed at them is on another level. Cameron, Osborne, Miliband, Brown and Blair did not attract this amount of contempt. Johnson is seen as a narcissist, an inveterate liar focused on his own interests rather than the country's, particularly by the half that would rather stay in the EU than leave it. At door after door, long-standing Tory voters tell us they are voting Lib Dem for the first time at this election because they are sick of Johnson, can't bear watching the party they once voted for turn into the Brexit Party 2.0, and want a return to the centre-ground.\nCorbyn is seen as extreme, weak and ineffectual - having failed to deal with racism in his party - and a threat to our national and economic security. That is a view held by a substantial number of longstanding Labour voters, never mind non-aligned ones. Candidates and activists from all parties have told me as much; I hear it a lot myself from voters.\nIn that context, it has been depressing and disappointing to witness candidates - who I knew as MPs in the last parliament, and who told me they would never sponsor either of the main party leaders to be prime minister - seeking to defend the indefensible.\nBoth carry a lot of baggage and have caused great offence to minority communities, but the concerns of those communities have been thrown under the bus and overridden by tribal party loyalty and the desire to continue as MPs. Part of the reason I left the Labour Party was because I did not feel it would be morally right to sponsor and facilitate a man whom I did not consider fit to lead our country. My feelings with regard to Johnson are much the same. So many Tory and Labour candidates know this to be true as well, but nevertheless have pressed on. It is very sad to see.\nIt has been a new experience standing for the Liberal Democrats and I have been proud to do so. You cannot underestimate just how difficult it is for the third party. Not only are there the formal constitutional impediments put in our way through the first-past-the-post voting system that works in favour of the two main parties, but there are the informal constitutional impediments too.\nMost people form a view and get their news from broadcast outputs on elections. When broadcasters insist on presenting the race as a choice between the Tories and Labour - which they always do - other parties are, in effect, forced to run up a down escalator for the course of their campaign.\nOfcom obliges broadcasters to give other parties air time and coverage according to the last general election result, recent election results and polling. This is a chicken-and-egg situation, however, because broadcast coverage partially drives those election results and polling in the first place. In spite of this, we have managed to get some cut-through for our domestic agenda, but not as much as we would have wanted. At least our core message - of seeking to stop Brexit - has got the billing it deserves.\nFinally, although it has been described as \"the Brexit election\", it feels like the pause button has been pressed on that issue throughout most of the campaign.\nIt will come quickly into view on Friday. The biggest development on Brexit during the campaign is the clear signal that the Tories will not only take us out of the EU at the end of next month if they get a majority, but we will be trading with the EU on \"no deal\" terms because it is impossible to finalise a trade deal (which took Canada almost 10 years to negotiate) in 10 months and Johnson has pledged not to extend the transition period.\nWhatever happens, my prediction is that the economy will become the main issue, once again, over the next year. This underlines why it is so important that we deprive Johnson of the majority the polls indicate he is on course to achieve. The Liberal Democrats are in a prime position to take seats from the Tories to stop this happening. This will require voters overriding the outdated system and tactically voting to safeguard the futures of the next generation.\nChuka Umunna is the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster",

No regrets. No shame - He has been hounded by nine-year-olds on the school run, but the Lib Dem leader tells Matt Chorley he's convinced he is in the right\nBriefly hailed as more popular than Churchill, Nick Clegg may well now be the most hated man in Britain. Effigies burnt in the street, dog mess through his letterbox, bike rides abandoned over fears for his safety. \"I never imagined it would be any different,\" he insists.\nLiberal Democrat leader; Deputy Prime Minister; architect of a new politics; and Judas to millions of students. The one-time political outsider sits forward on a plush, cream Whitehall sofa in defiant mood; belligerent even. \"Not a week goes by without a commentator saying 'next week the coalition will fall apart', and not a week or day goes by without us confounding those views.\"\nThere must surely be times, though, when he has had second thoughts, regrets. \"No. None at all. I'm absolutely convinced that almost any other course of action would have been a disaster for the country.\"\nWhile the Secretary of State for Business, Vince Cable, is dizzy with concentric U-turns on whether or not he will back his own higher education policy, Mr Clegg is adamant he wants to vote for it - and urges colleagues to follow him, despite signing the now infamous pledge to \"vote against any increase in fees\".\nHe says he is still determined to tackle social disadvantage and educational underperformance, and says that a £150m national scholarship scheme will give a year's free tuition to 18,000 students on free school meals. Universities wanting to breach the £6,000 cap on fees, to charge up to £9,000, will have to give another free year to the poorest students.\nIn the coming weeks, months and years he will need to \"grit my teeth, display a bit of resilience, and explain calmly and logically over and over again why we are doing what we are doing\". The question is whether anyone will hear over the noise of disaffected supporters who believe their beloved party has been sold down the river for the sake of ministerial cars and jet-setting summits.\nEconomic recovery is key. Couple it with public service and political reform, and Mr Clegg clings to the idea that even the doubters - of which there are many - will return to the Lib Dem fold. \"If there's one thing I'm not going to apologise for as the leader of the Liberal Democrats in government after 60 or 70 years of being out of government, it's that you just cannot avoid but deal with the world the way it is.\"\nHe is fresh(ish) back from Kazakhstan, representing the UK at a summit of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. After a sleepless flight and 14 hours of meetings he returned home to look after his three children - his \"wonderful and adorable\" wife Miriam away on a business trip to the United States. One of his children \"decided to puke in the middle of the night\".\n\"The good thing is we are staying in our own house, we haven't moved into the Whitehall fortress,\" he says. But life has changed. Even the school run is not easy. A nine-year-old boy took the opportunity to present a petition opposing cuts to school sports.\nHe says a \"cottage industry\" has grown up predicting death for the Lib Dems on a weekly basis, but Mr Clegg, 43, has developed the supreme confidence of a Lord Mandelson, whose former grand office he now occupies.\nHe complains repeatedly that despite \"punching above our weight in the coalition\" the Lib Dems are not getting \"a hearing at all on the policy stuff\". Having come third in the election and made major concessions to the Tories, he says he must be upfront about the difficult decisions as early as possible. \"Don't try and run away from it. Don't try to hide it, don't try and paper over it.\"\nThe coalition agreement pinpointed many of the \"bumps, glitches and dilemmas\" that lay ahead, including giving Lib Dem MPs the option to abstain on a tuition fees vote \"if the response of the Government to Lord Browne's report [on university funding] is one that Liberal Democrats cannot accept\".\nMr Cable, who drew up the response, said in mid-week that he may abstain, then said he would vote for it, then that nothing was decided. There are more arms to be twisted when MPs return to Westminster tomorrow. \"Of course I would like everyone to vote for this; we are not there yet.\"\nThursday's vote will be the biggest test of his party in the coalition to date. \"It is self-evidently extraordinarily controversial for us given the totemic status of our higher education policy.\" Vote against and it will fuel Tory suspicions that the Lib Dems do not have the stomach for power. Abstain and appear weak-willed and indecisive. Vote in favour and confirm the allegation of being an unprincipled sell-out to millions angered at the broken pledge.\n\"The allegation is made with the heart: it's 'you betrayed me'. And the answer is made with the head. When you have that, the heart always wins.\"\nHe is anxious to point out that both Labour and Conservatives were \"wedded\" to a tuition fees rise before the election and students would have faced an increase whoever won.\nBut he admits the deep anger felt towards the Lib Dems, the \"passion, the hurt feelings, the demos and the slogans and the vitriol\", risk deterring those from poorer backgrounds from going to university. \"It's immensely frustrating to me to see a policy which lowers barriers of entry to university being portrayed as putting up barriers.\"\nThe National Union of Students, and its president Aaron Porter, stand accused of \"not being straight\" with the protesters who seem to think they are calling for free tuition when in fact they back a graduate tax - the policy also favoured by Ed Miliband. Mr Clegg asked officials to draw up plans for a graduate tax, but no version was \"more workable or fairer\" than the coalition's plan.\nHe does not expect ministerial resignations, although at least two members of the Government have warned they would quit if forced to back the increase. \"We are no good in coalition government if rancour and bitterness and division creeps into our ranks.\" With the Lib Dem president, Tim Farron, comparing tuition fees to the poll tax and Mr Cable temporarily suggesting mass abstention, many in the Lib Dem ranks are unsure what their leaders want, and what is best for the country, the coalition and their own electoral prospects. Backbenchers in particular are frustrated at the apparent inability of the party machine to sell their policy \"wins\".\nSo Mr Clegg launches into a detailed explanation of what is planned to make university funding fairer. Upfront fees for the 40 per cent of students who are part-time have been scrapped and the repayment threshold raised. \"If you were a care worker starting on £21,000 you pay about £7 a month. Under the current scheme you pay £81 a month and under the 2 per cent graduate tax proposed by Ed Miliband it's about £36.\"\n\"I believe in this policy. I really think we will look back in 10 or 15 years' time and think, actually that was quite a brave and bold and socially progressive thing to do.\n\"It's now time for the NUS and Ed Miliband and others to just come clean about what their proposals are, and then in an open contest compare it to what we are doing.\" He believes much of the anger now aimed at his Lib Dem bunker comes from Westminster greybeards confronted with something politically new, people who \"don't like the fact that their comfort blanket of old pendulum politics has been snatched away from them\".\nIndeed sharing power is having a \"transformative effect\" on both parties. \"I really do think it is quite a liberal government and has got a very strong liberal flavour.\" Right-wing Tory traditionalists take note.\nHis poll ratings may have nose-dived since the giddy heights of Cleggmania, though he argues: \"Actually by some estimates we lost more in terms of the opinion poll vote share after the 2005 general election than we did after this one.\" He is adamant that in the long run the gamble of coalition will lead to an increase in vote share - and with it a long-term presence in government.\n\"I predict that with a bit of luck, with a bit of steel, with a bit of resilience, with a kind of discipline, we won't just recover but we will, I hope, reap the credit.\"\nIn his own words\nOn the tuition fees vote 'I'd like everyone to vote for this. We're no good in coalition if rancour, bitterness, division creep into our ranks'\nOn talks with MPs 'If you disagree, you disagree with everyone agreeing that everyone has had a chance to have a look at it'\nOn ministerial resignations 'I don't want anyone to leave. Sincere disagreement is the lifeblood of a strong party'\nOn class 'You know, I'm middle... I'm from an affluent background'\nOn student protests 'I was a student once as well. It's great going on demos and really having a crack at the government of the day'\nOn England's failed World Cup bid 'I just feel really heartbroken for the whole team that worked so hard on it'\nOn the old-Tory views of Lord Young and Howard Flight 'To say I disagreed with them is to put it very mildly'\nOn relations with David Cameron 'I don't think what the country wants is for us to become best mates. It's about, can we sort stuff together?'\nOn Lib Dems at the last election 'It would be lovely to wave a magic wand and live in a world in which we won the general election'\nOn Lib Dems at the next election 'We will be able to stand not only on a record but what we want for the future'\nOn being Britain's most hated man 'Is that an empirical assertion?'",

In the five years since then the world has changed, Shirley. Whilst Brexit, Trump and Johnson have fought for dominance of the agenda, a small, hardy band of activists and politicians have struggled to keep the climate emergency in the headlines. It has taken organisation, dedication and cooperation of progressives from many different parties and none. On Thursday, at Birbeck College, I proposed that that's the approach we need if we're going to save our planet. When the UN Climate Change Conference takes place in Glasgow this year, it can't just be smoke filled rooms and plenary sessions and handshakes between the rich and powerful. To tackle the greatest threat to our country, our people, and our planet, more voices must be heard. Every single one of us must take a serious role in holding key decision makers to account. If we don't take action now, it's not political points or elections we lose. It's our planet. Our home. The Liberal Democrats have always been ahead of the curve on climate policy and campaigns. Environmental action is in our DNA, and today it's more important than ever. So today, I'm asking you to be part of what comes next. We're launching a climate emergency campaign in the next few weeks which will be as big as our Brexit campaign and force the government to take real, meaningful action. Will you fill in this short survey to help us build a people-powered campaign strategy that will help us save the planet? The past five years have shown us the power of people.

If Jeremy were to pivot to the principle of a government of national unity to deliver a referendum, the referendum would slot into place remarkably quickly.\n\"There's a problem with Short money because if we have a government of national unity, you lose the Short money, which plays an important role in bankrolling the work of political parties in parliament.\"\nA Labour source said Mr Corbyn had laid out the simplest and most democratic way to prevent no deal, adding: \"As Dominic Grieve correctly notes, he is in no place to give advice to the Labour Party.\"\nTory MPs had been poised to dash back from their annual conference in Manchester in the event of a confidence vote, but opposition parties appear to be focusing instead on demanding information on no-deal contingency planning.\nParliament has already passed a law compelling Mr Johnson to seek a delay to Brexit if he cannot secure a new agreement with the EU by 19 October.\nBut some opposition MPs fear the prime minister could find a way to defy the law to force through a no deal - and keep his do-or-die pledge to leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal.\nSpeaking to journalists in Westminster, Ms Swinson said: \"What is clear is that this week it is important we don't go for a precipitous vote of no confidence motion.\n\"It is understood that, if anything, that would just increase the risk of a no-deal Brexit and therefore play in Boris Johnson's hands.\n\"What is going to happen is the party whips are going to meet to plan out different scenarios and different options, including the possibility of an insurance option of a government of national unity, including who might be able to lead such a government.\"\nThe Lib Dems are reluctant to instal Mr Corbyn in No 10, arguing instead for a veteran MP such as Labour's Harriet Harman, former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke, or ex-Labour foreign secretary Margaret Beckett.\nSwinson said Mr Corbyn would not command the necessary support from Tory exiles, adding: \"I have been crystal clear but I will do so again - Jeremy Corbyn is not going into No 10 on the basis of Liberal Democrats' votes.\"\nBut the Labour leader stood firm on his demands to head up a temporary government.\nSpeaking after the talks, he said: \"The position is quite simply this: when a government collapses then the leader of the opposition is invited to form an administration.\"\nMr Corbyn said a vote of no confidence in the prime minister was still on \"in play\" but would not come until no deal had been taken off the table.\nHe said: \"Our agreed position is to prevent a no-deal exit and ensure the prime minister obeys the act... which requires him to make an application to the EU by October 19 if no agreement has been reached by parliament at that stage.\n\"There are no signs that the prime minister has even made an application of any sort, or indeed any proposals, to the EU thus far.\"\nLib Dem proposals to force the prime minister to go to Brussels to seek another Brexit delay as early as this weekend failed to secure the backing of the other parties.\nInstead, the leaders agreed to try to use parliamentary devices to obtain secret government no-deal Brexit plans, after successfully securing the explosive Operation Yellowhammer documents.\nMPs will seek files on Operation Kingfisher, about impacts on business, Operation Snow Bunting, relating to police responses, and Operation Black Swan, covering the worst-case scenario.\n<iframe id=\"google_osd_static_frame_8654492378139\" style=\"width: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;\" name=\"google_osd_static_frame\"></iframe><iframe id=\"teadsConsensu\" style=\"margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; border: 0px !important; border-image: none !important; width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; overflow: hidden !important; display: none !important; float: none !important;\" src=\"https://cmp.teads.mgr.consensu.org/index.html\" name=\"teadsConsensu\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><iframe id=\"teadsConsensu\" style=\"margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; border: 0px !important; border-image: none !important; width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; overflow: hidden !important; display: none !important; float: none !important;\" src=\"https://cmp.teads.mgr.consensu.org/index.html\" name=\"teadsConsensu\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe> <iframe id=\"teadsusersync\" style=\"margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; border: 0px !important; border-image: none !important; width: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; overflow: hidden !important; display: none; float: none !important;\" src=\"https://sync.teads.tv/iframe?pid=84598&userId=9772932d-2f29-4c19-ac3d-fb35a5900273&gdprIab=%7B\" name=\"teadsusersync\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_brexit-you-broke-it-you-fix-it/content_422.html": "Brexit: You broke it, you fix it.\nIt's now five months since the EU referendum on June 23rd: plenty of time, you might have thought, for a government which appointed ministers committed to Brexit to key posts to have developed a strategy. Yet confusion reigns in Whitehall and Westminster. The clock is ticking towards Theresa's pledged date of invoking Article 50 by the end of March. Yet the government seems more focused on fighting a court case to limit the involvement of Parliament than in setting out its preferred future relationship with our neighbours on the European continent.\nThis is a degree of incompetence about which we should be angry, on top of our anger at the false promises and illusions of the Leave campaign. Some, at least, of the leaders of the Leave campaign should have had a strategy for negotiating a new relationship with the EU. But the coalition of ideologues and opportunists who led the Leave campaign only agreed on what they did not want. Economists for Britain wanted unilateral free trade; Professor Tim Congdon is still promoting this in the press. Liam Fox thought the Anglo-Saxon Commonwealth would welcome us with generous free trade agreements, and has discovered that this is not how trade negotiations work.\nBoris Johnson has so far offended most other EU foreign ministers by flippant remarks and unwillingness to recognise that they have their own interests to defend. The anti-foreigner undertones of the Conservative Party conference hardened attitudes in Berlin, the Hague, Stockholm and Helsinki - our closest natural allies within the EU - and reduced willingness to offer special concessions to ease the Conservatives' dilemmas. The Europhobe ultras continue to argue that we should tear up the treaties and leave, without further negotiations. And heaven knows what the Prime Minister thinks; stories circulate around Whitehall about her determination to keep control of the process, but she has few people around her who understand the issues.\nTory Europhobes, the Daily Mail and the Telegraph have covered this drift and confusion by ever-more shrill attacks on their critics - from judges to Liberal Democrats. Bits of information are slowly emerging. The government has said that it wants to stay plugged into police and intelligence cooperation (thank goodness); papers are reportedly being written about how to maintain cooperation in defence and foreign policy (but the Europhobes will bitterly oppose that); some sort of deal has been offered to Nissan, and another may be cooked up for the City. But there's no coherent package within sight.\nMeanwhile, the total contradiction between shrinking the state and 'taking back control' becomes clearer. The Taxpayers Alliance wrote in last Friday's Times that ministers should resist taking on more civil servants to manage the negotiations; somehow we should manage this massive task while cutting staff and taxes further. Parliament heard on Monday that the UK has 3 coastguard boats to patrol our lengthy maritime border, while the Dutch have 16 boats for 200 miles of coast. Promises of more money for the NHS and funds for an industrial strategy are yielding to cuts in corporation tax to compete for business outside the EU.\nThis is a mess. In previous revisions of the EU Treaties, our governments published white papers, set out their objectives, and carried the public with them. This time, the Prime Minister is clinging to secrecy, in order to avoid deepening the antagonisms within her own party. Any international negotiation has to win over domestic opinion as well as persuade foreign partners; so far, over five months, the government has gone backwards in convincing either side. Liberal Democrats have the right to say to those who led the Leave campaign to its narrow victory: 'You broke it, you fix it.' 'And if you can't work out how to fix it, what then?'\n* Lord Wallace of Saltaire is a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords.",

Especially when you're up against an ideologue education secretary with a team of 'unhinged' advisers\n-\nPart one: 'No wonder there was a Nick Clegg looking sad website'\n-\nMaking change is not easy: it is an art, not a science. As junior partners in a coalition and having been out of power for decades, the Liberal Democrats had to learn quickly how to get things done in a system that can resist change at every turn. The coalition government was, of course, a unique experiment in British politics with some unusual features, not least the need to secure agreement across the leadership of two parties. Unsurprisingly much of the significant change that came about during the coalition involved trade-offs and compromises.\nSometimes that involved a straight policy swap. On other occasions, it involved forensic haggling about the substance of contentious new policies. When we wanted a tax on plastic bags, for instance, and the Conservatives resisted, we compromised by allowing a number of exemptions from the tax for smaller chains, shops at airports and, somewhat bizarrely, \"ultra-biodegradable\" plastic bags that degrade within days (a type of bag that Owen Paterson insisted be exempted, despite the fact that it doesn't exist).\nWhile this toing and froing sounds a little unseemly, most of the time it was conducted in good humour. The main disadvantage was when disagreement on a particular policy led to gridlock and a failure to take a decision. But the need to strike compromises also had important advantages: having to justify one's ideas in the face of scrutiny from a sceptical coalition partner forced both parties to be more thoughtful and creative; and the challenge of finding agreement between two parties ensured that extreme or excessively partisan policies rarely survived. Moderation invariably triumphed.\nPerhaps the best example that came about through a straightforward policy swap was the introduction of universal free school meals for infants. It is a policy whose inception was intimately bound up with one of the most infuriating, yet creative characters in the government, Michael Gove, who moved from ambivalence to hostility to acceptance of a policy for which he was both an unwitting co-author and a serious obstacle. Gove was a prominent early public advocate for coalition. When we went for a meal near my home in Putney very early on in the parliament, I found him to be charm personified. He was generous, witty, collegiate and very smart. Over dinner, I tried to persuade him that the A-level system provided too narrow an education, which was neither good for pupils nor beneficial for the economy. He didn't agree - but he disagreed with amusing verve and flair, over a couple of bottles of wine.\n- A little over three years later, our relationship had soured to the point that he banned Lib Dem special advisers from physically entering the Department for Education, hid on one occasion in the toilet to avoid speaking to [schools minister] David Laws, and let loose his somewhat unhinged advisers to brief against me, and even against [my wife] Miriam, in the press. On one of the last occasions I spoke to him in government, I asked him to come and see me in my office. He was keen to be accompanied by his assistant, but I insisted we meet alone, as I wanted to deliver a blunt message. Once we were alone, I asked him how he would react if someone on my behalf wilfully lied about his wife in the newspapers? (Miriam had, ludicrously, been accused in the Mail on Sunday by one of Gove's advisers of seeking a Whitehall contract for a children's book charity - the contract had in fact been decided by No 10.) He mumbled that he thought he \"knew what had happened\". I was livid.\nShortly afterwards, I told David Cameron that I wasn't prepared to waste my time working with Gove, and that Laws would do so on my behalf (hence Gove's concealment in the toilet). Given how much No 10 clearly loathed Gove's principal adviser at the time and were as exasperated as I was by his occasional public outbursts, this didn't seem to come as much of a surprise to Cameron.\nBut even before the personal relations soured, policy disagreements had started to accumulate. At the beginning of the government I was encouraged by what I thought might be an exciting confluence of Lib Dem and Conservative priorities in education: Gove's support for an extension of Tony Blair's emphasis on greater school autonomy; and our emphasis on promoting social mobility through the implementation of radical funding reform such as the pupil premium.\nAt first there seemed to be genuine enthusiasm from Gove, too, to forge a new cross-party approach. Yet, almost exactly two years into the government, as I was leading the government delegation to the UN sustainable development summit in Rio in June 2012, Gove announced out of the blue that he wanted to return to a traditional two-tier O-level system. Laws called me very early in the morning in my hotel room in Rio to discuss our response. We decided it should be immediate, so I did a couple of TV interviews making it clear that such a regressive turning back of the clock would not take place on my watch. From bonhomie in a Putney restaurant to policy disputes across the Atlantic - the contrast couldn't have been greater.\n-\nThere ensued numerous other policy disagreements, from an attempt by the Conservatives to increase childcare ratios in nurseries - the number of children each trained member of staff can look after at a time - to Gove's unceasing effort to divert money away from needy mainstream schools to free schools. Given this fractious context, it would require a lot of effort to ensure that the DfE that Gove controlled would successfully implement the provision of free school meals for all infants. Unlike the raising of the personal tax allowance, for example, it had not been discussed at the start of government, or enshrined in the coalition agreement. In opposition, however, Laws had strongly advocated the policy. It seemed common sense that children would perform better in class in the afternoon if they weren't hungry. Research also showed that as many as four in 10 children officially categorised as living in poverty were still not eligible to receive free school meals - and that a universal provision would be disproportionately beneficial to those on lower incomes.\n-\nIronically, its origin as government policy can be traced to a holiday that Gove took in Marrakech, where he stumbled across Henry Dimbleby, the co-founder of the Leon restaurant chain and a healthy-food campaigner. As a result of the encounter, Gove commissioned Dimbleby and his business partner, John Vincent, to produce a report on how to raise the standard of school food. This became the School Food Plan, which was welcomed heartily by the education secretary. Buried in it was a recommendation to introduce free school meals for primary-school children.\nLater that summer, as the conference season approached, Oliver Letwin and Laws began the annual process of agreeing which government policies each party would announce that autumn. As ever, any spending commitments would have to be agreed as part of the autumn budget statement, and George Osborne had a rabbit he was determined to pull from his hat: a tax cut for married couples, where one of the spouses stayed at home. In reality, the amount a couple would save was relatively puny, but Osborne saw it as a symbolic gesture to warm the hearts of traditional Tory voters as well as the editorial teams at the Telegraph and the Mail. Knowing this was an unpalatable policy for us - it was a sop to married couples where one stayed at home and the other worked, while doing nothing for working couples, unmarried couples, single people or widows - he proposed a deal: the policy's price tag was £600m; if we would agree to it, he would find a similar amount for a policy of our choosing.\nLaws suggested that we should take a look at the free school-meal proposals and work out what we might be able to do with £600m. Given the spats with Gove, and certain as we were that he would object to a policy that imposed more obligations on free schools and academies, the proposal was worked up without his knowledge. We took the proposal back to Cameron, Osborne and Letwin and they agreed to the trade-off - and also agreed to keep the move to themselves, including keeping it from Gove. Laws eventually informed Gove at a later stage. To his credit, Gove said he was happy for officials to continue to work on the policy in private and he also agreed to keep it confidential, even from his own team of political advisers, so that it wouldn't leak.\nThose advisers, predictably enough, took this rather badly. Not only had their authority been undermined and their permission circumvented, but their own department and party leadership had worked against them, while the policy itself challenged the very basis of their free school project, requiring, as it did, supposedly autonomous schools to comply with the legislation. Soon the papers were peppered with specious stories planted by Gove's office about the diversion of resources from other areas of the education budget, implementation difficulties and budget overruns - all of which were nonsense. The implementation was remarkably smooth, not least because Laws oversaw it in minute detail. By the time the policy came into effect at the start of the next school year in September 2014, he could practically recite the lunch menus for each of the 17,000-odd state primary schools in England. And today over a million more small children eat a healthy meal at lunchtime every day at school.\n- While it is fashionable for politicians to bemoan the inherent caution of Whitehall civil servants - Gove provided regular entertainment at cabinet meetings, with his florid, if unreasonable condemnations of the civil service - their insulation from the political madhouse of Westminster serves as a crucial counterweight in our democratic system. The vast majority of civil servants I encountered in my five years in office were hard-working, thoughtful and driven by a quiet, if fiercely held belief in public service. The flaws of Whitehall (like any great bureaucracy, it has plenty of them) are systemic, not personal: the tendency for bright, young and wholly inexperienced officials to hold great sway over key areas of public policy for short periods of time, before being moved up to the next rung of the ladder, creates discontinuity and immaturity in policy-making. The over-centralisation of power in the Treasury leads to daft policy gyrations: from the failure to regulate the banks, to micromanaging them; from lax fiscal policy, to overzealous contraction; from the underfunding of capital projects, to a bevy of white elephants.\nAbove all, perhaps, it is the Balkanisation of authority across Whitehall that is responsible for dysfunctional decision-making. Some departments, notably the Treasury and the FCO, are regarded as the Oxbridge colleges of Whitehall. Others, notably the Department for Culture, Media and Sport or the Department for Communities and Local Government, are snobbily derided as red-brick departments. Each department develops a strong identity of its own - lofty at the top, chippy at the bottom - in the Whitehall pecking order. Understandably enough, discussions between Whitehall departments are as much a trial of strength for the civil servants who are involved as they are about sensible collective decision-making. In the paperwork I read late at night at home, officials would regularly describe arguments about a policy decision as if they were a chess game between different departments.\nAt the same time, both Cameron and I would frequently bemoan how difficult it was to get a particular department to produce recommendations or enact a decision, even when demanded by both sides of the coalition. This reluctance was exacerbated if the secretary of state in charge was particularly difficult, if there were tensions between them and the prime minister or me, or if the secretary of state had been in post for such a long time that they were convinced they knew best. The effect of this could be debilitating in the face of the 24-hour media circus. While the stately pace of decision-making in government is, in many ways, a useful antidote to the fickle daily demands made of politicians in the press, it can also come across as being out of touch with the reasonable public expectation that action should be taken rapidly.\nIn late 2012 and early 2013, for example, the Times printed a number of compelling accounts of Afghan interpreters who had assisted British forces in Helmand province and who were worried that they would be subject to retribution from the Taliban, once British forces had left the country. It was obvious that the government should move swiftly to provide reassurance that these interpreters would be treated fairly, if need be by relocating them and their families to the UK. Given that we were talking about just a few hundred people, the numbers were minuscule in the context of overall migration flows. I duly demanded an early discussion in the National Security Council and asked the Home Office and the national security adviser to prepare proposals as swiftly as possible. Instead, it took weeks and weeks of haggling to drag a grudging Home Office to come up with a plan that, in the end, was so convoluted it barely helped anyone.\n-\nAnother instance of sloth-like decision-making in government related to careers advice and guidance. Shortly after the coalition came to power, a decision was made to scrap the network of Connexions offices that had been established by the previous government, because, by and large, they were not providing high-quality careers advice and guidance to youngsters across the country. While this was harsh on those centres that were doing a better job than most, it was not an unreasonable measure as long as something more effective was swiftly installed as a replacement. Little did I realise at the time that Gove had a personal bee in his bonnet against any publicly organised careers advice and guidance of any description. So once the Connexions service was scrapped, nothing happened. Hundreds of thousands of youngsters were left in limbo without any properly organised support - other than that provided by individual schools - to make excruciatingly difficult decisions about their future educational, vocational and professional futures. Apparently, according to Gove's orthodoxy at the time, any requirement imposed upon schools to provide meaningful careers advice and guidance was regarded as a breach of the sacrosanct autonomy of schools. The push to spread \"Academy\" autonomy to schools had become a weird dogma, which risked depriving youngsters of exactly the kind of help they needed to make the difficult journey from the world of education into the world of work.\nStrikingly, it was not just my opinion that this was wrong; it was also the opinion of No 10 and, most especially, David Willetts, the Conservative minister in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills at the time who shared some responsibility for educational outcomes for school leavers. Yet the non-cooperation of just one department in Whitehall prevented the government from doing what was patently needed. It wasn't until the very fag-end of the coalition that Gove's successor, Nicky Morgan, finally introduced a new approach to careers advice and guidance, which went some way towards filling the vacuum that had opened up in the previous four years.\nNeedless to say, the principal fault in both cases did not lie with officials - the failure of No 10 to assert its will over two obstreperous secretaries of state was a far greater problem - but they both illustrate the mismatch between the need for swift action and the reality of constipated decision-making within Whitehall. I regularly found myself squeezed uncomfortably between the wish to react rapidly to reasonable public demands for action and the reality of cumbersome decision-making in government, stuck between the politics of a digital age and the analogue arrangements of Whitehall.\n• This is an edited extract from Politics: Between the Extremes by Nick Clegg.

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_greens-back-lib-dem-candidate-against-zac-goldsmith-in-byelection/content_320.html": "Greens back Lib Dem candidate against Zac Goldsmith in byelection\nParty hopes decision will encourage Labour to support Sarah Olney in cross-party effort to defeat former Tory MP for Richmond Park\nThe Green party has backed the Liberal Democrat candidate in the Richmond Park byelection against former Conservative Zac Goldsmith, who quit his seat in protest at the government's decision to expand Heathrow airport.\nThe party said they hoped the decision would put pressure on the local Labour party to not stand a candidate of their own and instead swing behind the Lib Dems as the best chance of beating Goldsmith, who is standing as an independent and has been endorsed by Ukip.\nAndree Frieze, who was the Greens' selected candidate for the seat, told her local party she was keen not to contest it, a decision agreed on Thursday night with Kingston Greens. \"I believe, wholeheartedly, that I am the right person to do the right thing - for the people, for the planet,\" she said.\n\"Realistically, however, I am not going to win and my standing could allow Zac, yet again, to be the wrong person representing our community. Furthermore, by not standing and helping a non-Tory win, we have the chance to seriously dent the Conservative majority.\"\nThe Conservatives are not putting up their own candidate for the byelection on 1 December but Goldsmith has been endorsed by the local Tory party and supported by his neighbouring Conservative MP Tania Mathias.\nThe Liberal Democrats have already confirmed Sarah Olney, a local accountant who is also anti-Heathrow expansion, as their candidate to run against Goldsmith. The party, which held the seat until 2010, has put huge resources into winning it back and are pinning their hopes for victory on being able switch the conversation from Heathrow to Brexit in the pro-remain constituency.\nGoldsmith, a keen environmentalist, voted to leave the EU. He was also widely criticised for his mayoral campaign, which opponents said used dog-whistle tactics against Labour's Sadiq Khan.\nJonathan Bartley, the Greens' co-leader, met local members of the Richmond Greens on Wednesday night, where the decision was taken to endorse Olney to boost parliamentary opposition to a hard Brexit. Kingston Greens also endorsed that decision at a meeting on Thursday.\nThis is no normal byelection,\" Bartley said. \"A regressive alliance of the Tories and Ukip are working together to reinstall a pro-Brexit MP who ran a racist campaign to be mayor of London.\n\"The decision not to stand has been made because we believe that a win for a non-Conservative candidate would be a blow to the Tory's hard Brexit and dent their damaging plans for post-referendum Britain. Ultimately we think Britain is better off without Zac Goldsmith returning to parliament.\n\"I'd now urge Labour to join us in forming a progressive alliance against the forces of Conservatism and narrow-mindedness.\"\nChair of Richmond's Greens, Richard Bennett, said local Liberal Democrats recognised that in the 2018 council elections the parties should work together in some wards \"to ensure people get the best chance both of Green party representation and of a council not controlled by the Conservatives.\"\nLabour is determined it will contest the seat, however. Alice Perry, who is a Labour national executive committee member, said shortlisting interviews to choose the party's candidate for Richmond Park had taken place this week and that the candidate will be formally selected by local party members from a shortlist on Saturday.\n\"We are definitely standing a candidate,\" she said. \"The Tory Lib-Dem coalition government made massive cuts to valued public services, including huge cuts to council budgets. The Lib Dems' actions in government proved they are not a progressive party.\"\nLabour's Sachin Patel, who fought the seat at the last general election, has already declared his intention to stand again.\nTim Farron, the Lib Dem leader, said his party had an environmental record that Green voters could support, including pushing for lower emissions targets, paving the way for the Paris agreement, renewables investment, the plastic-bag charge and opposition to airport expansion.\n\"You only have to compare that with the destructive Conservative Brexit government which is trying to force through Heathrow expansion, release polluters from tough EU environmental laws and slash subsidies for renewables, which has already led to 12,500 job losses in the solar industry alone,\" he said.\n\"It is vital that progressive voters get behind the only credible progressive candidate, Sarah Olney.\"",

It is estimated that one in four people experience a mental health issue in any given year, and that one in six employees is depressed, anxious or suffering from stress-related problems at any time. However, many of us know little about mental health. We often don't spot the signs that a colleague, employee, or we ourselves are struggling, and this delays help and recovery.\nLast week Business in the Community (BiTC) released the most comprehensive report of its kind, called Mental Health at Work. Worryingly, the report uncovered the fact that over three-quarters of employees have experienced poor mental health, and almost half of workers would not talk to their manager about a mental health issue. And while employers are talking more about it, words are not translating into action.\nThere is a disconnect between the ideals of company bosses and the reality of employees when it comes to mental health. Most board members believe their organisation is supportive on the issue, but 56% of people who have disclosed a mental health issue at work said their employer took no mitigating actions, found BiTC. How can we close this gap between perception and reality? A vital and practical step employers can take, and a key recommendation of the BiTC report, is investment in first-aid training in mental health for staff.\nMental health first-aid is the mental health equivalent of a physical first-aid course. It teaches people the skills and confidence to recognise the signs and symptoms of common mental health issues, listen empathetically and effectively guide a person towards the right support.\nRecently, I became a mental health first-aider myself, and now have the tools to start a meaningful conversation on the issue, something most of us would struggle to do. Could you think of the right words to say to someone who may be feeling suicidal? Having experienced loss in my family the training allowed me to reflect on what I might have done differently.\nWe spend a considerable amount of our lives at work and with more of us working longer hours, under more pressure, having mental health first-aid support in the workplace is critical not just for employees, but for businesses too. As it stands, mental health issues (stress, depression or anxiety) account for almost 70m days off sick per year, the most of any health condition.\nToday, on World Mental Health Day, with support from Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) England and Mind, I am calling on the government to act and bring parity to mental and physical health in the workplace. I'm submitting an early day motion on the issue as the first step towards amending the current legislation, which requires employers to train staff in physical first aid, to in future include mental health first aid.\nHow can we possibly justify leaving the law as it is? So far as the NHS is concerned the government has committed to the principle of \"parity of esteem\" between physical and mental illness. Surely they must apply the same logic to the workplace.\nPut simply, this is a call for every workplace to have trained mental health first-aiders just like they have physical first-aiders. A number of employers are taking action. WHSmith has committed to match the number of staff that are physical first-aiders with mental health first-aiders over the next 12 months.\nThere's a growing momentum for change, and hundreds more businesses across a range of sectors are implementing mental health training for staff from Unilever and Crossrail to Channel 4. Employers have a duty of care to their workforce, and with the scale of mental issues in this country much more needs to be done. The government must act now to ensure every employee has access to mental health support at work.",

That is what will happen to those who do not deliver Brexit\".\nAnd the prime minister was repeatedly asked by MPs to tone down his \"inflammatory\" language which they said was fuelling abuse and death threats against parliamentarians when he returned to the Commons last week.\nHe also caused outrage among politicians when he told friends of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox that the best way to honour her memory was to \"deliver Brexit\".\nMs Cox's husband Brendan later tweeted that he felt \"a bit sick\" at his wife's name \"being used in this way\"\nHe said: \"The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common.\"\nAnna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group for Change, added that the language used in the Commons had reduced her to tears and forced other MPs to leave the Palace of Westminster, \"such has been the distress\".",

Now I’ve joined them\nAs an ardent Remainer, it is the only party that will uphold my beliefs\nI've done it, I've joined the Liberal Democrats. Since leaving the Labour party, I've been thinking about it, edging closer and closer, like when you see footage of people slowly shuffling on their bums towards plane doors to do charity parachute jumps.\nI did it for highly unoriginal Brexit reasons (I'm one of those Remoaners who still think there's a lot to Remoan about). The Tories are morphing into a cartoon hydra of their own worst impulses. The Labour party seems intent on chewing on sticks of dynamite like they're delicious lollipops.\nDonald Trump is squatting in power like an angry toad stuck to an uber-Republican lily pad. Ultimately, I joined the Lib Dems because I didn't know what else I could do. The way I see it, this is turning into Generation Compromised and you gotta do what you gotta do.\nIt's all far from perfect (Tim Farron needs to speak clearly about gay issues). But it goes further back than that. My working-class background always felt like a bad fit with \"Lib Demmery\". I still have a childish Lib Dem cliche lodged in my head about earnest folk in socks teamed with sandals.\nHowever, the Lib Dems are committed to fighting against the bizarre acceleration towards Chaos Brexit (Apocalypse Brexit? Clueless Brexit?). This isn't about the people who voted for Brexit - it's about the people in charge of Brexit.\nI'm grateful that the Lib Dems are speaking up and I want to show my support - swell their ranks, at least give the other parties a fright and a reality check. Other people agree - they're joining the Liberal Democrats in droves.\nOthers disagree and I keep coming across them, in real life and on social media. Like me, they're Remoaners who still feel they have a lot to Remoan about.\nThere are also quite a few disenchanted former Jeremy Corbyn/John McDonnell/ Momentum supporters, whose conversation is often punctuated by the terrible melancholy crash of scales falling from their eyes. Some of them say that they could never support the Lib Dems - they feel that they can't be trusted because of the coalition/tuition fee debacle. I listen respectfully, but think privately: oh come on, move on, get over it just a tad.\nThe point is, I understand how people feel because I spent a long time feeling exactly the same way. I was furious about the coalition, though I think now that we can all appreciate that the Lib Dems were telling the truth when they say they did what they could to curb the worst Tory excesses.\nI remain angry about tuition fees (the ultimate betrayal of British youth), though whatever else the Lib Dems did or didn't do, they didn't originally introduce the fees.\nUnlike the Tories, the Lib Dems were spanked mightily at the last general election. Wasn't that enough? They're hardly the first party to renege on a pledge in British political history; when will they be allowed to put down their electoral leper bell and be judged \"clean\" again?\nSo I understand if people still wake up screaming, remembering the sickening scenes of the David Cameron/Nick Clegg \"bromance\" in the Downing Street rose garden.\nHowever, I feel it's now time to stop sniping about a ball that started rolling back in 2010 and instead focus solely on the here and now. And right now, continuing to carp about the past sins of the Lib Dems feels akin to whingeing about the colour of the curtains while the house burns down.\nI meant what I said earlier about it feeling like Generation Compromised: this may become an era that ends up defined by having to make difficult, conflicted grown-up choices - holding your nose and just getting on with it. Anything else could turn out to be self-indulgent in the extreme.",

Brexit was neither my choice. If they choose Boris Johnson, he will have to deal with us on the agreement we have done with Theresa May.\"\nArturs Krisjanis, Latvia's prime minister, laughed when asked whether he could work with Boris Johnson. He replied: \"Every country has their internal processes, how they choose their leaders. Great Britain has going through one of these processes. I'm very much looking forward to continuing good cooperation with Great Britain.\"\nThe Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was scathing when asked about the leadership candidates' Brexit positions, telling reporters: \"During the election campaign for the new leadership of the Tory party it seems their positions have shifted so much so it is difficult for me to assess exactly.\" He added: \"I'm not going to comment on the leadership candidates.\"\n\"But of course we will be leaving the EU and we look forward to developing a close partnership with the EU when we've left.\"\nBut the prime minister twice sidestepped questions about whether she would miss attending the Brussels gatherings.\n\"I will continue to do what we have always done as a UK, which is to play a constructive role within the European Union while we are part of the discussions around the table,\" she said.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_why-the-social-security-policy-paper-should-be-rejected/content_172.html": "Why the social security policy paper should be rejected\nOn Monday at Liberal Democrat conference, party members will have the chance to debate policy motion F31 which endorses a new Liberal Democrat welfare policy paper, Mending the safety net.\nHowever, as one of the members of the working group which wrote the paper, I strongly urge all members at conference to vote against the motion.\nMy reasons for saying this are simple: although the policy paper is called 'Mending the Safety Net', what it proposes is nothing of the sort. In fact, it actively endorses the current welfare system which is failing so badly that over a million people in the UK don't just live in poverty but are actively destitute.\nThis is undoubtedly one of the greatest social challenges facing our country - even if you set aside the human suffering it creates, poverty costs the UK £78 billion a year, blighting our national prosperity.\nWhen set against that backdrop, the welfare policy motion is a failure.\nIn my opinion it lets down some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in society by failing to offer real solutions to the problems they face, it spectacularly misses the opportunity to define a real and distinctive alternative approach to welfare for the Liberal Democrats, and, crucially, it cannot be made fit for purpose even if all the amendments to it on the agenda are passed.\nThat's not to say there's nothing good in the paper. There are several changes proposed that are very welcome indeed. But when you look at the paper as a whole, all of these amount to little more than fiddling around the edges instead of tackling the big issues facing the welfare system.\nHere are some of the ways in which the paper tinkers round the edges rather than actually fixing our broken safety net:\n- It proposes keeping benefit sanctions which can see benefit claimants left destitute and unable to afford to eat for 'crimes' like being 2 minutes late to an appointment - while it proposes new 'safeguards', these are little better than the safeguards which have already failed in the current system\n- It perpetuates the notion that claimants should have to \"prove\" they're looking for work by jumping through bureaucratic hoops if they wish to receive any support from the welfare system - and the best it offers to deal with the fact that many deserving people are unable to jump through these hoops is to promise £10 a week extra to those who do really well at proving they're looking for work\n- It proposes keeping unfair disability benefit assessments that have seen many severely disabled people (including paralympians) lose vital support and equipment such as mobility cars and does very little to help carers\n- The biggest change it proposes is to introduce opt-out income protection insurance policies for people in work - a helpful addition to the safety net but one which only relatively well-off earners will be able to afford to pay for and benefit from\n- It fails to offer more than tokenism in tackling child poverty - giving the poorest families £5 a week extra and telling the second adult in a household to get a job will barely make a dent in the number of children living in poverty\nBut worst of all, at a fundamental level, the paper buys into the shared Labour and Conservative viewpoint that there are \"deserving\" and \"undeserving\" poor and that a social safety net should only be provided for the former.\nFor me, and many liberals, the role of the welfare system should be to provide a safety net for everyone. In the same way that we guarantee everyone access to healthcare via the NHS and education via state schools, we should be guaranteeing, at the very least, that no one in one of the wealthiest countries in the world is left homeless or unable to afford to eat.\nThe challenge of how to provide this is what the paper should have been trying to answer. In the process it could have given us a distinctive and utterly different policy that would have made the Liberal Democrats stand out and given us something to fight for with pride.\nWith the party on just 8% in the polls we can't afford to have bad or timid policy. We need radical, innovative policies which will grab attention and which offer a compelling vision for a better future for everyone in society.\nUnfortunately, while amendments were submitted to the motion which could have made some real changes, the only ones selected for debate by Federal Conference Committee (FCC) simply don't go far enough to be able to fix the problems at the heart of the paper.\nTo make matters worse, under FCC rules, once a topic has been debated at conference it can't be debated again for at least another two years - meaning we'd have to wait until 2018 to revisit the issue.\nSo, sadly, voting the motion down is now the only realistic option. No new policy on welfare would be better than conference approving bad policy - especially since our existing policy already commits us to opposing the Tory welfare cuts - and, by voting the motion down, members would create the opportunity for something better to be brought to next conference.\nEditor's Note: Jenny Willott, who chaired the Working Group, wrote a piece introducing it here.\n* George Potter is the Secretary of Guildford Liberal Democrats, writing in a personal capacity.",

The article supposedly cited German government officials.\nElsewhere in the German press, the tabloid Bild published a report claiming that the vaccine is unlikely to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use on over-65s.\nAstraZeneca immediately refuted the falsehoods about the vaccine's effectiveness in older people, describing the articles in the German press as \"completely incorrect.\"\nIn a statement, AstraZeneca said: \"Reports that the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine efficacy is as low as 8% in adults over 65 years are completely incorrect.

One described the jobs as \"you need a people personality and an elephant skin\".\nIn the General Election, the Liberal Democrats are either first or second in 134 seats and in dozens of other seats are within ten points. Every single vote in these seats will count.",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_how-do-you-feel-don-t-ask/content_383.html": "How do you feel? Don’t ask.\nWhat the fuck just happened? First, the near-miss on Scottish independence, then the 2015 general election, Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader, Brexit, Corbyn's re-election and now Donald Trump's victory. Well, I've been working through a theory for a while now. I suspect some of you have been doing the same too. But if you just baulked at my use of the word 'fuck' in my opening sentence consider yourself part of my theory. What do I mean? Let me explain.\nI'm a data person; I'm proud of it. If you've got numbers I can 'model' them to do whatever you like. Campaigns contact me all the time, from all parties and political leanings within parties. Normally I am given numbers or demographics based tasks as that's what I'm known for. I use good data to provide good evidence. The numbers say this; the demographics say that; these are the high propensity voters you need; this is why. Clients are happy, I get paid, nobody gets hurt.\nExcept I often come away wondering what was missed. I've long viewed data to be extremely useful and necessary. All political campaigns should employ the best analysts available. However in the last year I've started to supplement my work with analysis of additional components: emotion and personality. I believe all of the above campaigns were successful because they employed emotional messaging aimed at particular personality types. In effect they were much less about what people are (demographics, data) and more about what they feel (anger, disillusion, etc). The latter are at least, if not more, important influencers in determining how people vote in my opinion. So it is puzzling to me that our politics continues to analyse data and less how voters represented in the data think or feel.\nWhich brings me back to what the fuck just happened. I suspect some of you won't like the use of profanity. It may evoke an emotional response. You may prefer if I cut down the emotional stuff and state the facts. After all, I am Election Data, so \"give us the cold data and analysis\" would be reasonable. However in my view the election of Donald Trump is just the latest example in a growing list of elections where progressives have ignored emotion and personality in favour of data and analysis. It's an entirely understandable thing to do, particularly when you've been reared on Philip Gould's grid (I admire Gould a lot btw) or Barack Obama's 2007/2008 field operation. There is also much more of a market in progressive audiences for considered research pieces; for think-tanks; meetings; broad debates; evidence; data. Should anyone express an unsafe opinion it's normal for all parts of the Labour party to round on it for example. Trust me, I know.\nBrexit was a perfect case in point. Remain had a difficult product to sell admittedly but they appeared to favour facts over emotion. After all, they said, this was totally obvious: staying in the European Union was just common sense, right? The logic seemed uncontroversial and absolutely undeniable. The only emotion they invoked was fear; the risk of leaving. The Leave campaign saw things differently. So we got 'Take back control', a message which by-passed complex factual arguments about sovereignty and plugged straight into the cerebral cortex of the voters Leave needed. I remember speaking with Goddard Gunster last year about this exact thing. The control message was so powerful it affected people hearing it; they sat up in their seats, jutted out their chin a little. The key reason this worked was because Remain's Risk Of Leaving didn't beat Leave's Taking Back Control amongst the voters Leave needed to win.\nThe same was true of the now infamous poster produced by UKIP showing a long line of migrants apparently heading for Britain. Again, a nakedly emotional message which went straight to those voters which were already primed to believe the threat was real; regardless of whether it was or not. Remain's answer was to rightly denounce the poster but that didn't take away from its power; in fact it have cemented it amongst all the voters Remain needed. Unconsciously those voters would have heard the Remain campaign denouncing their perceptions. If the Remain campaign was going to win it would have to rely on Evidence, Experts and Data defeating Emotion, Perception and Imperfect But Strongly Held Opinions. We know what happened.\nWhat the Remain campaign missed, and what data and polling often misses, is how people think and feel. I believe the same thing happened to Owen Smith in the summer and has just happened to Hillary Clinton in America. It's the so-called progressive side of the aisle which has forgotten how to speak to people's base emotions. It is they who still regale the audience with facts (apparently clear facts!) whilst Farage waves a passport. The left are repulsed by such imagery; UKIP know it. It is the progressives who hold dull press events about Corbyn's inability to win elections whilst Corbyn holds mass rallies where logic gives way to emotion. Which is right? That's less important to me than which has won. 2015, Corbyn, Brexit, Corbyn II, Trump. I make it 5-nil to emotion.\nAnother example may explain this point further:\nThe evidence seems to suggest that areas with lower levels of immigration were more likely to vote to leave the European Union. This partial finding has been used as definitive evidence to support the liberal progressive argument that much of what drives anti-immigrant sentiment is based on racism and bigotry. That may or may not be what the data is saying but by focussing entirely on that one finding the left in particular has ignored the personality types involved and the emotions that influence them. What if the 'perception' of immigration is more important than the reality? Those areas may have lower levels of immigration but they rarely have none. And even if they did it's the perceived threat of immigration which drives people's voting intentions. Ignore that and it won't matter how good your data is because they won't listen. Emotion beats Data hands down here. Particularly if you know, as I do, the personality types involved. You know who else knows this stuff? UKIP knows this stuff. Arron Banks and Nigel Farage know this. Donald Trump knows this. They don't turn their nose up at employing it like many on the left do. They don't counter it with facts and evidence in dusty think-tank launches. They reinforce it in people. They put it on giant posters on the side of trucks and drive it through council estates, That's their job, like it or not.\nSo, what to do next? I have been including emotional and personality markers in my work for some time. I am carrying out focus groups and find myself pouring over Haidt, Cialdini and Kahnemann much more than Cohn, Gelman or Issenberg. All of us also need to be less wedded to data alone. Everyone has an election model these days it seems. Political parties, academics and even pollsters have models to predict this and that. There are models about models for goodness sake! Nothing wrong with that in itself but none of those models seem to incorporate the most important factor in people's voting decisions: what they think and how they feel. It's the question which the data rarely gets to. It's a question I now incorporate in my work although I am working through this carefully; hence why I was still all too wedded to what the US data appeared to show in this election.\nI won't make the same mistake again. The key learning of the last year or so has been that the communication of effective emotional messages is currently beating data alone. This is particularly true in the age of social media which is effectively a delivery system for emotional weapons. Allied to which there is more volatility in our politics than there has ever been. Voter retention is weaker than ever, particularly on the left. Rich pickings for any party which knows the personality types of its voters and taps into base emotional instincts with effective messaging around issues they know the left are too feeble to confront. It doesn't have to be this way.",

I want to change the culture and change the debate,\" he said.\n\"I now have a disabled son, who's 12, and one of the things I have learned from that, and from conversations with people, is one of the things you worry about is who is going to care for them when you're not there.\"\nAsked whether he had a particular model in mind for funding an expansion of care provision, he said: \"Clearly, how you pay for different kinds of care needs to be thought through. For some kinds of care, it's completely reasonable to ask the individual to make contributions, so I'm not suggesting it all goes on the state. However, there are a whole range of examples where you couldn't possibly expect people to make provision.\"\nHe used his first prime minister's questions as acting Lib Dem leader to challenge Boris Johnson over cuts to the financial support that bereaved families receive.\nDavey said that in principle he would be prepared to join cross-party negotiations that Johnson has promised to set up to consider how best to fund social care for elderly people. But, despite reports suggesting the prime minister wants the committee up and running in his first 100 days, Davey said his party had not yet received an invitation.\nAs a former energy and climate change secretary, Davey said he would also be highlighting the need to take more urgent action to tackle the climate emergency in the next few months.\nOther potential candidates to be the Lib Dems' fourth leader in three years include the party's education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, and the new MP Daisy Cooper.<iframe id=\"google_osd_static_frame_5924201395226\" style=\"width: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;\" name=\"google_osd_static_frame\"></iframe><iframe id=\"obMntor\" style=\"display: none;\" src=\"https://widgets.outbrain.com/widgetMonitor/monitor.html?name=obm-cmp_fail&message=www.theguardian.com&stack=undefined&ver=1050112\" name=\"obMntor\"></iframe>",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_was-michael-gove-right/content_161.html": "Was Michael Gove right?\nOn 3rd June 2016, Michael Gove drew ridicule when he stated \"People in this country have had enough of experts\". However, Theresa May's announcement that her government are now seeking to actively support1 the reintroduction of selective schools goes against all evidence-based expert opinion.\nWe mocked Mr Gove but the reintroduction of selective schools may well prove he was right. There appears to widespread support across the right-wing press and the Telegraph website is currently indicating 77% of their readership support the policy.\nTo make such an argument, I accept that I do need to present credible evidence undermining the case for selective schools. As noted by Branwen Jeffreys, the BBC Education Editor:\nMany thought the debate about grammars had become almost irrelevant.\nand it is therefore not surprising that recent academic research regarding the impact of selective school's has been limited. Ironically, I suspect that this may have allowed such an antiquated policy to get its foot in the door.\nHowever, digging through the archives, there are multiple articles and data sets that undermine and contradict the proposal that selective education improves education outcomes for communities. For a quick summary, in 2013 Chris Cook of the FT presented compelling analytical data that deprived families \"do dramatically worse in selective areas\", that \"introducing selection is not good at raising school productivity\" and that as \"a way to raise standards or to close the gaps between rich and poor, it is hard to find evidence that [selective schools] are effective\". There have also been more specific studies focussed on selective areas such as Buckinghamshire, which concluded that \"the low prevalence of FSM eligible pupils in the grammar schools casts doubt on their ability to aid social mobility.\"\nIn light of such evidence, Professor Stephen Gorard recently concluded in a Guardian article that \"selection by ability is currently the very antithesis of an evidence-informed policy\". Even more pointedly, Sir Michael Wilshaw (the outgoing Chief Inspector of Schools) recently stated that the idea that poor children will benefit from a return of grammar schools is \"tosh\" and \"nonsense\".\nSo why do so many people appear to support the reintroduction of grammar/selective schools?\nUndoubtedly, most people are emotionally compromised when it comes to education. The only objectively credible argument for selective education I can find revolves around efficiency. There seems to be a certain truthiness in the idea that is easier to teach groups of similar abilities so that strong pupils can be stretched and challenged and others provided more time and support.\nHowever, the teachers I know are more than capable of teaching a mixed-ability class and just require the time to prepare various differentiation methods. The idea also overlooks the importance of peer interactions with massive benefits in most subjects for working alongside a variety of abilities. Where needed, setting of subjects is also obviously much more flexible (and changeable) than segregation at a school level.\nFundamentally a lack of good schools in certain areas and potential lack of time for teachers to prepare a fully differentiated lesson schedule can both be solved by one thing; recruitment, training and retention of more excellent teachers. Another disruptive and unmandated change to the schools system will just do even more damage (as evidenced by England's deterioration in results compared to Scotland and Wales, which have not faced Govian academisation).\nI am very glad to see Tim Farron has committed to opposing these plans in all ways possible and I hope to see Lib Dems in the House of Lords unanimously vote against any legislation that supports the entrenchment of social divides. I hope as a part we can unite to defeat such archaic ideas and we can also prove Mr Gove wrong and place evidence and experts at the centre of policy-making for our nation.\n* Jame Dalzell is a Cambridge based member and activist and will be taking up the role of Membership Development Officer for the city from January 2016.

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_william-wallace-writes-taking-on-the-anti-tax-movement/content_197.html": "William Wallace writes…Taking on the anti-tax movement\nIf you read any other paper than the Guardian, you will have noted some days ago a generously-covered story about the enormous 'lifetime tax bill' faced by British families. The 'average UK household' in 2014-15 was estimated to pay £826,000 in direct and indirect taxes over their working life, while the top 20% 'will pay £1,686,970' - a curiously exact figure for an estimate, and a claimed rise of 4.3% over the previous year.\nThe story had no reference to any benefits that flowed back to taxpayers in return for this drain on their income: education for children (£180,000 per child or more in the private sector between 3 and 18), health care (say £100,000 per person, incurred most heavily in the last two years of life), and post-retirement benefits (state pensions of £6-9000 a year over 10-20 years, bus passes, etc.), not to mention contributions to all the public goods that make civilised living comfortable: policing, roads and railways, external security, welfare, market support and regulation. The reader is intended to understand tax almost as theft, rather than a worthwhile contribution to services received.Stories like this come from the TaxPayers Alliance, possibly the most influential think tank in Britain at present: an organization at the centre of a network of right-wing bodies with close links to the Conservative Party - and across the Atlantic to right-wing think tanks in the USA.\nMatthew Elliott, the founder of the TaxPayers Alliance, took leave to run the No2AV referendum campaign, and has led the Leave campaign in the Euro-Referendum - using the populist promise of 'Let's spend the money on the NHS instead' in both campaigns, in contradiction to the TPA's opposition to public spending on health as much as on other services. The TPA's campaign's director, Robert Oxley, has just entered government as special adviser to Priti Patel: switching from campaigning against aid to advising the secretary of state on managing DfID. The Times, the Telegraph and the Mail carry TPA stories as often as they follow press releases from Migration Watch.\nThe TPA shares a building in Tufton Street, behind Westminster Abbey and close to Parliament, with other libertarian right-wing groups: the climate-change sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, Business for Britain, Big Brother Watch, Civitas, the European Foundation and Global Vision. The building is owned by defence companies run by Richard Smith, a businessman who is an active member of the Midlands Industrial Council with ties both to the Conservatives and UKIP. Their offices are apparently provided rent-free; we cannot discover which other rich British or American right-wingers fund it, since the TPA does not publish its list of donors. There are close links with Washington libertarian think-tanks. The TPA itself was modelled on Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, which campaigns to cut tax overall, including abolition of income and inheritance taxes. Norquist's most-quoted statement is \"I'm not in favor of abolishing the government. I just want to shrink it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\"\nYou might think that the Guardian would have drawn public attention to this coalition of right-wing lobbies, their links to the libertarian anarchists of the Republican Party and the corporations that fund them; but it's too busy plotting the factional disputes within the Labour Party. So we need to challenge the steady drip of anti-tax stories that appear in our media ourselves. The Observer analysis, on September 11th, of the different 'tribes' of British politics flagged up the cross-tribe consensus that supports lower taxes, apparently without linking that to deteriorating public services. Sadly, we know that decent public services have to be decently funded. No government has dared to declare itself in favour of higher taxes since the 1970s; the only party which has risked addressing the issue was the Liberal Democrat promise of 'a penny on income tax' for education in our 1997 manifesto.\nSo how do we raise the question of higher taxation, without upsetting the mass of voters who want good public services but think that others should pay for them, and who hardly turn an eye when successive Chancellors suggest that Chinese investors will pay for the Northern Powerhouse or that more state assets should be sold off to fund current spending? A vigorous attack on corporate and personal tax avoidance will not bring in enough extra revenue; beyond that, taxes need to rise rather than fall to give our children a sustainable state and society. The TPA and its libertarian allies want instead to shrink the state and slash or privatise public services: Matthew Elliott's pretended commitment to increase NHS funding was one of the most transparent lies of both referendum campaigns. Its success in undermining public support for state spending, however, has made our task in defending fair taxes and justifying public spending a harder sell on the doorstep.\n* Lord Wallace of Saltaire is a Liberal Democrat member of the House of Lords.",

Although the then chancellor faced widespread criticism over the report, the Treasury stands by its calculations, according to the Times.\nThe documents says: \"The Treasury estimates that UK GDP would be between 5.4% and 9.5% of GDP lower after 15 years if we left the EU with no successor arrangement, with a central estimate of 7.5%.\n\"The net impact on public sector receipts - assuming no contributions to the EU and current receipts from the EU are replicated in full - would be a loss of between £38bn and £66bn per year after 15 years, driven by the smaller size of the economy.\"\nBrexit backers who have seen the documents told the newspaper the figures were unrealistic and claimed there was a push to \"make leaving the single market look bad\".\nBut prominent remain campaigners pushing for a soft Brexit that would keep Britain in the single market said the documents showed the \"horrific damage\" of leaving the trading bloc.\nThe former Conservative minister Anna Soubry MP, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign, said: \"The horrific damage of a hard Brexit is clear. Less tax revenue means less to invest in schools and hospitals, lower trade and investment means businesses and jobs at risk.\n\"This danger is precisely why parliament must be involved in the principles to guide the Brexit negotiations. Britain will leave the EU, but we must do so in a way the protects our prosperity and reduces risk. The government should now make clear the 'WTO option' isn't on the table.\"\nThe prime minister, Theresa May, is facing growing pressure to allow MPs a vote on Brexit and the government is also fighting a legal challenge over the use of royal prerogative to invoke article 50, which triggers the process of leaving the EU.\nThe Brexit secretary, David Davis, told MPs the government would \"observe the constitutional and legal precedents\" on giving MPs a vote on any treaty setting out Britain's new relationship with the EU.\nThe Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said the leaked documents showed quitting the single market would wreck the economy.\n\"This is yet more proof that hard Brexit would be an act of sheer economic vandalism,\" he said. The Liberal Democrats will stand up for Britain's membership of the single market. We cannot stand by while this reckless, divisive and uncaring Conservative government wrecks the UK economy.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"We want the best outcome for Britain. That means pursuing a bespoke arrangement which gives British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market, and enables us to decide for ourselves how we control immigration.\"",

The new FCC also held a meeting in November where feedback from the Autumn Conference was discussed, and officers were elected. Geoff Payne was re-elected as Chair, myself as Vice-Chair (General Purposes Sub Committee), and Jon Ball and Cara Jenkinson as Co-Vice Chairs (Conference Communications Group).\nIt is always difficult to sort through the motions that are submitted to the FCC for any conference. This year we did have a lower number of submissions - only 19, but there were some interesting motions that were selected. It seems that the December General Election may have had an impact on the lower submissions, so we are looking forward to more submissions for the Autumn Conference.\nTimings are always tight at Spring Conference, and we have tried to maximise debating time. There are inevitably some items that must be held at Conference (leader's speech, and Committee and Parliamentary reports.) We have also made time for two consultations, one Federal Board General Election review, and one Federal Policy Committee manifesto review. We have also allowed two slots for emergency motions, as various political changes are happening at the moment which may require motions to be submitted.\nThe party will soon have to formulate its policy on Europe moving forward. We are, however, in a period of reflection. We do not have an elected Leader. There are consultations pending on the General Election and our manifesto. Things are still in flux politically and there are likely to be further changes before Conference. Unlike at previous conferences, we did not think that there was a need, at this stage, to rush to a finalised position in the Spring. We certainly know we are anti-leave. We know we are pro-European. There will many more discussions, formal and informal, to be held on Europe as events unfold. Local Parties will want to think about it as will Regional and State Parties. For those reasons, FCC resolved to set aside some time for a topical debate in the main conference auditorium on Europe to allow for a wider discussion and the voices of members to be heard on Europe generally. Along with the consultations, that will be an essential starting point for a fuller policy that will be debated in the Autumn. Our view was that Autumn Conference, which is the bigger event of the two, was the right forum to resolve that.\nThe full text of the motions will be published in the Agenda which is due out in mid-February. Those who have submitted motions have received their feedback, so I can reveal which motions have and have not been selected.\nSix motions were selected for debate; plus the two emergency slots gives us a potential of eight motions for debate in York.\nIf you would like to submit amendments or emergency motions for spring, the deadline for that is 1pm, 2nd March. It is common that a number of motions received by FCC are rejected due to being badly drafted, so I would recommend that anyone planning to submit a motion makes use of the drafting advice service - the deadline for that being 1pm on 17th February.\nYou can submit your amendments here, the submission form will be live once the Agenda has been published: HERE\nAnd finally, before you start reading the list of motions, don't forget to register!\nHope to see you in York!\nBusiness and Trade\n• Freeports (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\nCommunities and Local Government\n• More Homes, Better Communities (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\nCrime, Justice, Equalities and Civil Liberties\n• Tackling Youth Violence, Safeguarding Young People (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\n• Welcoming Child Refugees (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - selected\nEducation and Families\n• Children's Social Care (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - selected\nEnergy and Environment\n• Climate Emergency and Glasgow Climate Change Conference (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\n• UK Fossil Fuels - Keep it in the Ground (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected.\nEurope\n(see comments above)\n• The Liberal Democrats should accept that the British People wish to leave the European Union (submitted by a Regional Party) - not selected\n• Britain in the Heart of Europe (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\n• Opposing Brexit (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\nHealth and Social Care\n• Student Mental Health Charter (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - selected\nInternational Affairs and Defence\n• Hong Kong (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - selected\n• Indian-administered State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) a major Human Rights crisis in India (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\n• Issues Caused by the Russian Federation (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\nPolitical and Constitutional Reform\n• Electoral Reform (submitted by a Federal Committee) - selected\n• Enfranchising resident non-citizens and non-resident citizens - not selected\nWork, Social Security and Pensions\n• Unfreezing British Pensions Abroad (submitted by 10 (or more) Party Members) - not selected\nConstitutional Amendment\n• Increasing Regional Representation on Federal Committees (submitted by a Regional Party) - out of order, not taken for debate.\nBusiness Motion\n• Supporting Trans and Non-Binary Communities within the Liberal Democrats (submitted by a SAO) - in order, taken for debate\n* Nick Da Costa is Vice Chair of Federal Conference Committee",

This campaign is made up of a broad coalition of seventeen organisations (http://taxdodgingbill.org.uk/whos-with-us/) and aims to:\n• Make it harder for big companies to dodge UK taxes and ensure they're not getting unfair tax breaks\n• Ensure UK tax rules don't encourage big companies to avoid tax in developing countries\n• Make the UK tax regime more transparent and tougher on tax dodging\nThese measures could raise funds to help tackle poverty both in the UK and in developing countries.\nStephen commented \"Like many of you I find it very concerning that such huge sums of money are lost to countries all over the world, not just here in the UK, via large companies taking part in \"tax avoidance\" schemes. Whilst legally tax avoidance and tax evasion are different entities I believe that morally there is little if any difference between the two. You can therefore probably already tell that I am definitely within the 85% of the UK public that feel \"tax dodging\" is morally wrong even if it is legal!\"\n\"I feel those supporting the \"Tax Dodging Bill Campaign\" and calling on the next Government to introduce a \"tax dodging bill\" in the first 100 days after the election are doing the right thing, and I will be adding my support. The three main proposed outcomes of the proposed \"tax dodging bill\" are not only desirable for moral reasons but as you the additional money raised could help tackle poverty throughout the world, and that alone would be worth implementing such a bill for. If elected I would support the progress of such a bill in Parliament.\"",

In just three weeks, our activists put in a marathon effort to deliver millions of leaflets, bang in 'Stop Brexit' and 'Bollocks to Brexit' stakeboards and knock on thousands of doors (and this was on the back of an enormous effort to get all those wonderful councillors elected!).\nNow we are sixteen MEPs and I finally have some colleagues with me to fly the Lib Dem flag in Brussels and Strasbourg! There are some past MEPs coming back into our midst like Chris Davies, Phil Bennion and Bill Newton-Dunn, but there also some rising stars in the party like Irina Von Wiese, Antony Hook and Caroline Voaden and so many others who come with a whole range of skills and life experiences. It is truly a great and diverse team - over 50% are women and two MEPs are BAME.\nYesterday we met in London and the MEPs voted for me to lead our Lib Dem delegation in the European Parliament. I believe that my knowledge of how the EU works combined with the connections I have made over here in the last five years will ensure that our stop Brexit message is heard loud and clear by the EU negotiators.\nNow we will begin setting up our offices for the frantic months ahead and make sure we hit the ground running when the new European Parliament term begins on July 2nd. Each one of us will be regularly coming back to our constituencies, hosting meetings in town halls, speaking to businesses and community groups, campaigning with Lib Dem activists and reaching out to other remain groups. We have to use this summer to build momentum for a potential General Election in the autumn.\nSo finally, my message to you all is this: hold your head up high and be proud of what you have achieved in this month of May (where we also saw the end of Prime Minister May). Keep having the conversations with the undecided and call out the Brexiters who believe democracy ended on June 23rd 2016. Liberal Democrats are more important than ever to the future peace and prosperity of this country and we must take on this responsibility with passion and commitment.\nThank you! Thank you!

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_liberal-democrats-in-derbyshire/content_192.html": "Liberal Democrats in Derbyshire\nIt is an honour to be able to represent you as Chair of the Derbyshire County Group for 2020. Because the December General Election delayed the AGM, my term will run only the ten months from 1st March to 31st December. During this time we have four main focuses:\nPolice & Crime Commissioner Elections\nIn May we have the Police & Crime Commissioner elections. Representing the Liberal Democrats will be Amber Valley's Kate Smith. Many of you will know Kate, she has been a stalwart of the County Group for many years and serves a Parish Councillor in Crich. She is an excellent candidate and we will be working on her manifesto in the coming weeks.\nAs a party, the Liberal Democrats openly oppose the role of Police & Crime Commissioner. It is a waste of money and lacks the scrutiny that a committee would provide - so there is no secret that, in government, we would abolish the post. But we are not in government. This election will not provide an opportunity to abolish the role, neither should it be a forum for that. We are fielding a strong candidate who would do an excellent job if elected and I want everyone to throw their support behind Kate.\n2020 Local Government Elections\nWhile the majority of us had local elections last May; both Derby City and Amber Valley have local government elections in May 2020. For those of us who have a fallow period, Derby and Amber Valley would appreciate whatever support you can offer.\n2021 County Elections\nWhilst the County Council elections are still more than 12 months away, this is the time to prepare a manifesto so all local parties can hit the ground running next year. Back in 2017 local parties lacked the necessary support because of delays in the County manifesto being produced. We cannot allow that to happen again.\nReform\nI've deliberately held off thanking the incumbent Chair until this point. Since being elected as Chair of the County Group, Jonathan Sneade started the much-needed path to give new direction to the Derbyshire Group. He has done a terrific job so far; and we need to complete that work.\nThe ancient Greeks recognised the failings in their democracy as they simply granted a voice to those who could attend meetings on any given day. In a county as sprawling as Derbyshire, meetings are difficult to attend for anyone who lacks access to personal transport, those who need to arrange childcare cover, or have other caring duties, those who are less able-bodied for whom a lengthy journey can be arduous - effectively, everyone who the Liberal Democrats, and our forefathers the Liberal Party, have stood up to fight for goes unheard; and, as a result, the group loses relevance.\nTo address that, we need to use modern technology to open our meetings up; and, have the positive impact of reducing our carbon footprint on unnecessary journeys.\nWe also need to ensure that our actual defined steering group is properly representative of the county as a whole. In my mind, the logical direction is to unite the leaders of each district/borough/city council group (and, a designated person, for those districts where we have no elected councillors).\nThat ensures the group remains a practical size, while guaranteeing proportionate and proper representation across the county. It also provides a clear countywide mandate for our elected representatives at County Hall; and a much-needed, more direct link with our County Councillors.\nThanks to the hard work of Jonathan and the previous exec, we're part way through those reforms; but we're now entering the third year and we need to complete them, without delay, in order to give us the best fighting chance next year.\nWe've got a very strong membership across Derbyshire - some truly great people. We're still the only county in the East midlands to produce a Lib Dem MP since WW2 in Chesterfield's Paul Holmes. It's our job now to make sure that Paul is just the first NOT the only one; and together we can do that. Labour are in disarray across the County. We need to maximise on that and hit the Tories' poor performance hard. We need each local party to identify their own target seats and we will make those gains in Derby City and Amber Valley this year and at County Hall in 2021; because, with a strong base, we will get more MPs elected.\nThank you all for your support.\nKind regards\nDavid Hancock\nIncoming Chair: Derbyshire County Group\nTel: 07703 437180\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/CllrDavidHancock\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/NDerbyshireLD\nWebsite: www.nedbd-libdems.com",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_homelessness/content_46.html": "It's not every day you get to say you changed the law. I am elated that after four years of persistent campaigning, the Vagrancy Act is on the brink of being repealed. The Government has bowed to cross-party pressure and tabled an amendment to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill to repeal the Vagrancy Act 1824 in full. This archaic and cruel law has finally been consigned to history, and no one will be criminalised for sleeping rough again. This campaign has been long and hard-fought. It is a testament to the hard work and persistence of my team, our third sector partners, cross-party colleagues, and the students who first raised the issue with me. It was a group of Oxford University students who first brought me a petition in 2018 to end the criminalisation of rough sleeping. They were concerned at the manner in which homeless people were being treated by police, and the national approach to homelessness which seemed to favour pushing the problem away. I shared their outrage and agreed to take the petition on. You have to pick campaigns carefully, based on what inspires you but also what matters to constituents. For my constituents in Oxford West and Abingdon, rough sleeping and homelessness is an issue that has always been close to our hearts. Oxford attracts significant numbers of rough sleepers from the surrounding county and we saw with our own eyes that many were treated extremely harshly. I and my constituents saw vulnerable people being threatened with arrest and aggressively moved on, rather than being treated with compassion and offered support. We recognised that the Government has started to appreciate that the landscape around homelessness wasn't right. They had begun to change legislation and change their approach, but were not targeting the most punitive parts of legislation. What followed was a strategic campaign, fought using the full range of Parliamentary tools available to us and in conjunction with third sector partners. In order to amplify our voice and raise the profile of the campaign we contacted homelessness charities. The campaign began to gather momentum when Crisis decided to take it on as a major campaign. While the issues surrounding homelessness are vast, the Vagrancy Act provided a useful hook. |",

Let us instead call such a Brexit putsch for what it would be: an attack on democracy itself.\nBrexit has threatened everything from our economy to our sanity: now it is coming for British parliamentary democracy.\nIncreasingly, the private talk among Brexit ultras is that once Boris Johnson or some even more blood-curdling alternative is installed as leader, the Conservatives will prorogue parliament - that is, prevent MPs from meeting in the Commons - so parliament can't stop Britain crashing out of the EU.\nFor, as the Institute of Government has recently reminded us, the current default legal position on Britain's future in the European Union is that Britain would leave in October, without a deal.\nLet us pass over the irony of Brexiteers claiming their dying wish was to restore sovereignty to the \"mother of parliaments\" and then conspiring to muzzle it. Let us instead call such a Brexit putsch for what it would be: an attack on democracy itself.\nShould that happen, non-parliamentary democracy will mushroom. The one million people who marched so peacefully for a People's Vote will be joined by millions more on the streets to stop an ultra-hard Brexit ruining our country.\nAnd no doubt the supporters of Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Tommy Robinson will assemble a motley crew of Moggsters, Gammons and Black Shirts.\nThe peaceful protests we've seen recently calling for action on climate change could soon be a fond and distant memory, replaced by much uglier versions of protest. That's why MPs across the parties must speak out now.\nThat a prorogation - suspending parliament - is even being whispered about in no-deal Brexit circles is a democratic outrage, but I have had it confirmed to me by a senior Conservative that it is being seriously considered.\nAs a Liberal Democrat, I naturally support a vote on any deal to be given to the 47 million-strong British electorate, and not just to the 124,000 Conservative Party members. For the Conservatives not to even trust MPs with a vote would be extraordinary, even by today's sinking standards. The Conservative Party has already foisted its own nasty divisions on our country: if the Brexit ultras try to bypass parliament, they must be stopped in parliament.\nBut Brexiteers' desperate talk of prorogation does reveal their weaknesses: logic and reason. It reflects how little confidence Brexiteers have left in their tarnished case.\nThey are starting to realise what is, for them, an uncomfortable truth: that for all their obsession with leaders and leadership, a Churchill or a Cicero could not persuade parliament of the wisdom of no deal.\nThey have booted out yet another Conservative prime minister over Europe but even prime minister Rees-Mogg or (please don't laugh) Steve Baker would otherwise still have to persuade parliament to carry out their no-deal agenda. And then later, of course, having to crawl back to negotiate with the EU when they learn belatedly that leaving on \"WTO terms\" basically means being clobbered with massive tariffs by the EU and everyone else.\nNow it is just possible that Boris Johnson privately recognises the Brexit fallacy and is even preparing to pull a colossal, screeching U-turn if and when he blusters into No 10. It sometimes takes an ultra in office to make the fanatics face reality. After all, it is hard to discern what he fully believes in - apart from himself.\nHowever, the fear is the Tory party leadership will be a beauty parade in Brexit extremism. Instead of a thoughtful debate on the issues that really matter to people - our NHS, our schools, climate change, poverty - Conservative members, led by the ERGers, will be focused on tying the hands of Britain's next prime minister to the mast of a no-deal Brexit.\nUntil now, the fear of no deal has been suppressed by the strong evidence that a significant majority of MPs would vote against it, and that Theresa May had ultimately listened to the warnings from the Treasury, police and security services and from business, and would herself not countenance a no deal.\nHer departure changes that calculation. And MPs must wake up and act. We need cross-party motions and debates to show that parliament remains against no deal.\nBut above all, we need a new law preventing no deal without a parliamentary vote. Ideally, this would change Britain's default position to a revocation of Article 50, should any cliff edge be reached - but others may have different legislative ideas to prevent a national catastrophe.\nAnd we may well need Theresa May, in the time she has left, to save her reputation. She could facilitate the legislation to let MPs lockout no deal, before Boris or one of his ilk seize the crown.\nFor my part, if they lock me out of parliament, I will take to the streets - and I'm confident I will be joined by millions in peaceful protest. We must resist this attack on our democracy.\nEd Davey is the Liberal Democrat MP for Kingston and Surbiton",

Then Labour won three general elections. In the early 2000s, the Tory party was called a busted flush … now the Conservatives have a large parliamentary majority.\nThe conclusion: nothing is certain, and there must be a future path back to a non-Tory government. This will involve luck, but also a decent amount of design.\nTwo main obstacles block that path.\nLet's call the second obstacle the \"rural problem\". Labour's brand is toxic in much of the West Country, city commuter belts, rural Wales, North Yorkshire, Cumbria and most constituencies centred on market towns with a rural hinterland. This toxicity is tied to a sense that Labour \"can't be trusted on the economy\" or is too extreme to be in power.\nIn the right circumstances, the Liberal Democrats could win these seats (in North Cornwall, Lewes and Hazel Grove); after the 2019 election results, we are again second place in many. However Labour, pursuing an unattainable majority, fought them with sufficient energy for the Conservatives to slip through the middle. Until the Tories become vulnerable in these places again, they will keep winning.\nThe Scottish and rural problems are gifts granting the Conservatives a clear message and strategy for maintaining a majority for years to come. These two problems require, I believe, three solutions - all hard to achieve. Let's start with the hardest: defeating the SNP.\nI really like many of the SNP's MPs at Westminster. Indeed, Labour and Lib Dems in England tend to think broadly warm thoughts about the Scottish Nationalists, who are largely centre-left social democrats. But to achieve a non-Tory UK government we must defeat them comprehensively.\nI haven't got an oven-ready plan for beating the nationalists. I simply say, progressives in England and Wales must recognise the SNP is Boris Johnson's secret weapon. Perhaps the plan starts by seeking to convince progressives in Scotland that they are vital to stopping the Tories, and they can only do that within the UK.\nIf you are a Scottish non-Tory, join the fight - and ditch the SNP wholesale. Stop being tempted by the rickety lifeboat and help us achieve a mutiny that wrests lasting control of the ship from the evil Tory captain!\nThe second solution: detoxify Labour. At present, Labour's brand is so terrifying that it pushes voters into Conservative arms (which is one reason why the Lib Dems also struggled to win seats in 2015, 2017 and 2019).\nSolving this rests on the character and image of Labour's new leader. Party members must overcome their obsession with ideological purity at the expense of winning power. I, too, am repulsed by the notion of power without principles: but if you care about people in need, you can't fixate on principles without power. Labour must learn how to win again. For the sake of the country.\nThe third solution I hope I can affect: deploy the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems don't currently look like displacing either big party, still less like a government in waiting; but despite the election disappointment, we are in our healthiest position for a decade.\nIn 2015 and 2017, along with most of our seats, we lost vote share to the extent that we slipped from second to third place or worse in dozens of constituencies. Our 2019 silver lining is our return to second in around 100, mostly Conservative, seats. If we win many of those, then the Conservatives lose their majority. The path to a progressive majority is clearer.\nThe three solutions are connected. The Lib Dems' chances of winning these seats are hugely enhanced by the SNP's defeat and Labour detoxifying.\nBluntly, the enemies of a progressive, united Britain are the nationalists and the Tories. To fight them we need to develop humility and self-awareness and learn to work together.\nLet's start with my party. The Lib Dems must accept that Labour provides the main vehicle for defeating the Conservatives in most areas.

If you choose not\nto allow cookies some features may not be available, such as content from other\nwebsites. Please read our Cookie Policy for more information.\nA path to victory in 2024 does exist, but it won't be an easy one to follow\nBack in the 1980s, my A-level politics essays were all about whether we would ever see another Labour government. Then Labour won three general elections. In the early 2000s, the Tory party was called a busted flush … now the Conservatives have a large parliamentary majority.\nThe conclusion: nothing is certain, and there must be a future path back to a non-Tory government. This will involve luck, but also a decent amount of design.\nTwo main obstacles block that path.\nLet's call the second obstacle the \"rural problem\". Labour's brand is toxic in much of the West Country, city commuter belts, rural Wales, North Yorkshire, Cumbria and most constituencies centred on market towns with a rural hinterland. This toxicity is tied to a sense that Labour \"can't be trusted on the economy\" or is too extreme to be in power.\nIn the right circumstances, the Liberal Democrats could win these seats (in North Cornwall, Lewes and Hazel Grove); after the 2019 election results, we are again second place in many. However Labour, pursuing an unattainable majority, fought them with sufficient energy for the Conservatives to slip through the middle. Until the Tories become vulnerable in these places again, they will keep winning.\nThe Scottish and rural problems are gifts granting the Conservatives a clear message and strategy for maintaining a majority for years to come. These two problems require, I believe, three solutions - all hard to achieve. Let's start with the hardest: defeating the SNP.\nI really like many of the SNP's MPs at Westminster. Indeed, Labour and Lib Dems in England tend to think broadly warm thoughts about the Scottish Nationalists, who are largely centre-left social democrats. But to achieve a non-Tory UK government we must defeat them comprehensively.\nI haven't got an oven-ready plan for beating the nationalists. I simply say, progressives in England and Wales must recognise the SNP is Boris Johnson's secret weapon. Perhaps the plan starts by seeking to convince progressives in Scotland that they are vital to stopping the Tories, and they can only do that within the UK.\nIf you are a Scottish non-Tory, join the fight - and ditch the SNP wholesale. Stop being tempted by the rickety lifeboat and help us achieve a mutiny that wrests lasting control of the ship from the evil Tory captain!\nThe second solution: detoxify Labour. At present, Labour's brand is so terrifying that it pushes voters into Conservative arms (which is one reason why the Lib Dems also struggled to win seats in 2015, 2017 and 2019).\nSolving this rests on the character and image of Labour's new leader. Party members must overcome their obsession with ideological purity at the expense of winning power. I, too, am repulsed by the notion of power without principles: but if you care about people in need, you can't fixate on principles without power. Labour must learn how to win again. For the sake of the country.\nThe third solution I hope I can affect: deploy the Liberal Democrats. The Lib Dems don't currently look like displacing either big party, still less like a government in waiting; but despite the election disappointment, we are in our healthiest position for a decade.\nIn 2015 and 2017, along with most of our seats, we lost vote share to the extent that we slipped from second to third place or worse in dozens of constituencies. Our 2019 silver lining is our return to second in around 100, mostly Conservative, seats. If we win many of those, then the Conservatives lose their majority. The path to a progressive majority is clearer.\nThe three solutions are connected. The Lib Dems' chances of winning these seats are hugely enhanced by the SNP's defeat and Labour detoxifying.\nBluntly, the enemies of a progressive, united Britain are the nationalists and the Tories. To fight them we need to develop humility and self-awareness and learn to work together.\nLet's start with my party. The Lib Dems must accept that Labour provides the main vehicle for defeating the Conservatives in most areas. Labour must accept that their brand is a huge asset to the Conservatives, and that, across swathes of the country, the Liberal Democrats have the best chance of defeating Conservatives.\nLabour and the Lib Dems need to accept that co-operation is necessary and desirable. We must then collectively deploy a ruthless will to win, in order to do the good we can only do in power.\n• Tim Farron is the Liberal Democrat MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale.

It will be difficult… But it could happen. That would really shake the foundations.\"\nHe made clear his ambitions stretch beyond a third-place finish behind Labour and Nigel Farage's Brexit Party: \"What would shake the tree would be if we overtook Labour. That would be a big ask, but it is possible.\"\nFarage won't debate Brexit with me because he's running scared\nSir Vince was speaking as a YouGov poll showed the Lib Dems for the first time pulling narrowly ahead of Labour in the European election race, with support of 16 per cent compared to 15 per cent for Jeremy Corbyn's party, with Conservatives in single figures on 9 per cent trailing in fifth place behind the Greens.\nThe veteran Twickenham MP said he hoped momentum built up by success in local and European elections will make Lib Dems \"key players\" in the next general election, with a \"big if\" over the question of whether Tories or Labour can hold together in their current forms. \"They are giving every sign of reaching their sell-by date,\" he said. \"All kinds of possibilities are opening up.\"\nLib Dems had \"conversations\" with moderate Tories prior to the creation of the Independent Group in February, he said, adding: \"If the hard Brexiteers take over … I think we are going to get back to that kind of conversation before long.\"\nHe claimed to have heard rumours that some potential Tory leaders might be open to inviting Mr Farage into the party, something which he said could provoke a \"realignment of British politics\" by making mainstream Conservatives reconsider their allegiances.\nRefusing to name a preferred contender to succeed Ms May, he said: \"Even the ones who initially came across as more moderate and reasonable, like Jeremy Hunt, are falling over backwards to appeal to the backwoodsmen, and they have lost all credibility as far as I'm concerned.\"\nSir Vince was among a delegation from Remain-backing parties who met Ms May's effective deputy David Lidington to discuss the Brexit process last week.\nHe said he had picked up indications in various conversations with the government side that they were privately preparing for the possibility of a Final Say EU referendum.\n\"When we have been to see people they repeat the mantra that they don't like the idea, but it emerges that they have been doing a lot of groundwork anticipating it could happen,\" he said.\nOn the Labour side, it was clear from their public comments that senior figures like the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, were \"trying to get Corbyn into a more unambiguous position\" on a people's vote, he said.\nBut he added: \"I think it's too late for them.\"\nVince Cable spoke to The Independent in his House of Commons office (Andrew Woodcock/Independent)\nHe said it was \"a matter of great regret\" that the Lib Dems had been unable to form a combined Remain ticket with pro-EU parties Change UK and the Greens, but said he was hoping to get back into a \"collaborative working relationship\" with Change UK following the elections, naming interim leader Heidi Allen as \"a very easy person to deal with\".\nAnd he rejected the idea that Lib Dems should treat the Euro elections as a \"quasi referendum\" in which the combined totals for Brexit and Remain parties could settle the question of whether the country still wanted to leave the EU.\n\"We are treating it as an opportunity to choose MEPs who will hopefully be there for the next five years, and we want as strong a contingent as possible,\" he said. \"We will fight separately for a referendum when parliament gets down to business again.\"\nA 30 per cent-plus total for the Brexit Party \"would not prove anything\", he said. \"We know there is about a third of the electorate who are solid hardline Brexit. We think there is a bigger group on the other side who are solidly committed to Remain and then a smaller, diminishing, group in the middle who don't know.\"\nHe dismissed Mr Farage's calls for a \"WTO Brexit\" - leaving the EU with no deal and falling back on World Trade Organisation rules - as a \"complete fraud\" and said he was ready to debate the former Ukip leader on live TV to expose his position.\n\"There is no such thing, the system isn't working any more,\" he said. \"The WTO is wonderfully conceived, but it is a very weak, toothless organisation. To see that as an option is grossly dishonest, and that has to be exposed.\"\nSir Vince refused to reveal targets for MEPs or vote share in next Thursday's election, exercising his habitual reserve as he said: \"I started off with quite modest objectives to improve on last time, when we had one MEP. I now think we will do better than that.\"\nFollowing years in the doldrums as voters punished the party for its participation in coalition with David Cameron, the leader said he detected an upswing in morale on the back of local elections in which they gained more than 700 councillors and 10 authorities.\nAnd looking ahead to the general election, he said that seats which just months ago were beyond Lib Dem ambitions are \"now back in play\", citing Leeds North West, which they lost to Labour in 2017, and Chelmsford, where the party won control of the town hall for the first time in 20 years this month.\nDespite having announced his intention to step down as leader this month, he indicated he would stay at the helm in the event of an immediate general election prompted by a bloodbath for the Tories at the European polls.\n\"I'm not going to stay on and on like Margaret Thatcher because we've had a burst of positive news,\" he said. \"But in the unlikely event of a general election before the summer, I will be leading us into it.\"\nHe said he intended to remain \"engaged\" after stepping down, but was careful not to hint at any preference for either of the two expected contenders to replace him - deputy leader Jo Swinson and home affairs spokesperson Sir Edward Davey.",

Rumours of a possible snap general election prompted the party, rightly, to do urgent selections of prospective parliamentary candidates over the summer. Will the election happen? Could a possible false alarm be helpful?\nOne answer is to wait and see: a general election in October would point to a different strategy from one early in 2017, and we don't have resources to invest a lot in an election that doesn't happen.\nBut the appointment of a slate of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates (PPCs) and putting things in place for an election campaign is an opportunity to put forward strong party values and to engage with people who have joined recently in shock at the referendum result. If we get it right, what we do now helps to shape the national debate and strengthens our hand for whatever elections are on the horizon. Internally, this is also a chance to run meetings where PPCs (and others) speak, helping draw people together in a way that is more positive than just lamenting the referendum result.\nFocuses, press releases and media interviews to introduce PPCs are a golden opportunity to highlight the ideals and vision behind our support for EU membership. They are a chance to hold the Tories to account for the destructiveness of the referendum, and for a brutal austerity which we were told was essential but was dumped suspiciously quickly - when the damage it had done had stoked support for Leave.\nBrexit would do great harm, not least to many of those who voted for it. We can pick up LibDem approaches to the wealth inequality that has done such damage, push for devolution to address people's frustration at government being too remote, and electoral reform so that people feel their votes count (the present Tory majority comes down to the votes of just 900 individuals across the country). This is laying out our stall, but it is also signposting a vision at a time vision seems horribly lacking, replaced by attacks on human rights and immigration.\nGetting in gear now also means addressing local party web sites, Facebook and Twitter, so they are up and ready. It takes a while for these to build a following: a prod now is really useful, and can encourage people to get more involved in re-posting and re-tweeting. It should also be a spur to get more people using Connect, so they are not trying to learn that in the heat of an election.\nIf this all a false alarm, at the very least it connects with new members and will be a good foundation for the next local elections.\nSince last May we have been struggling to be heard. The appointment of PPCs is a temporary opportunity to change that.\nLabour's disarray means that, while we have been struggling to be heard, the country has been without a functioning opposition. It's been horrifying to see the media obsess about Jeremy Corbyn's railway seat when Labour should have been loudly challenging Tory proposals to repeal the Human Rights Act.\nThe appointment of PPCs gives us a chance to claim some visibility: it seems well worth taking.\n* \"Mark Argent is PPC for Hertford and Stortford, and was formerly Chair of Cambridge LibDems",

Well it would appear that on many fronts the government could be rightly accused of double-speak after this week's Conservative Party Conference.\nTheresa May was Home Secretary for six years. During that time she deported almost 50,000 students with dubious legality and yet still failed to meet her own unrealistic targets. She also oversaw a big reduction in the number of immigration officers at ports and airports. However rather than accepting targets will never be met and giving the Home Office the staff they need, it has now become the job of head teachers and property owners to control immigration. If you cannot do it yourself outsource to someone who can is the leitmotif of the May government.\nLandlords now face the risk of prosecution if they fail to check the right of their tenants to live in the U.K. Yet when a Tory Minister for immigration in the last government failed to check the papers of his cleaner he simply went to the back benches only to be reappointed to a Ministerial job. The \"A country which works for everyone\" slogan needs more small print than the average insurance policy.\nSecondly the PM likes to pick out and demonise groups of people no matter what good they do. She took a cheap shot at Human Rights lawyers this week. But she conveniently ignored the fact that were it not for their work the 96 families of the Hillsborough victims would never have seen the verdict of unlawful killing they had waited 27 years for. Ironically this was a cause she herself had supported.\nLiam Fox launched an attack on foreigners who come to Britain and consume our wealth. How about the British born Health Secretary who took Mandarin lessons on the state which enabled him to converse with the in-laws, a skill which has no relevance to his day job? Is he not paid enough to avoid burdening the taxpayer? Finally it was a collection of blame thy neighbour speeches. Rather than celebrate the diversity of our workforce, Theresa May chose to allow the Home Secretary to attack Companies who employ foreign workers instead of British ones. Meanwhile David Davis has very recently worked as a paid advocate for German companies.\nThe government needs to put its own house in order if it is to have any shred of credibility left.\n* Chris Key is dad of two girls, multilingual and internationalist.

But in order to stop this calamity in its tracks, at the very least we must reduce the numbers of Conservative MPs\nNext Wednesday, Nato heads of state and government will gather in Watford to mark the 70th anniversary of the organisation. Founded in 1949, this intergovernmental military alliance of 29 European countries and the US has sought to safeguard the freedom and security of its members and has been one of the lynchpins of the liberal international rule-based order.\nAlongside our fellow Nato ally, France, Britain is the most capable military power. Our intelligence gathering capacity remains indispensable. Our membership of the Five Eyes intelligence partnership makes us a global leader in the fight against terrorism. And in Nato, Britain holds the position of Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe.\nBut Nato must reform and adapt to the changing nature of threats we face. We need to increase Nato's conventional deterrent and help develop the application of Artificial Intelligence. Cybersecurity is now a tier 1 threat and Britain has a key role to play in the integration of internal security and external defence, to meet the new challenges of hybrid warfare. Above all, we must provide credible deterrents that convince others that Nato is committed to Europe's collective defence.\nUK 'risks becoming Trump's poodle' if Johnson wins election\nThat is why the Liberal Democrats will ensure the UK upholds our Nato responsibilities, including by spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence. Using the Remain Bonus and a growing economy, strengthened by staying in the European Union, we will be able to put more money into supporting our armed forces, and enhance the UK's ability to play our part in NATO to maintain our security.\nHowever, it is alarming that other Nato members' commitment to the alliance is less than fulsome. President Trump described Nato as \"obsolete\" during his 2016 presidential campaign. President Macron quite rightly cited Trump's failure to consult Nato allies, before his abrupt decision to pull forces out of northern Syria, as evidence of the US's waning commitment to the alliance. This, in turn, paved the way for Turkey - another Nato member - to start an offensive into Syria to create what it called a security zone along its border. No one is more happy to see this state of affairs than Russia's Vladimir Putin, an active opponent of Nato which suspended contact with his government over the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\nOf course, Putin, Trump and Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, not only share a poor regard for Nato, they share a politics: right wing, conservative, nationalist and authoritarian. This is a criticism that equally applies to our prime minister Boris Johnson.\nI do not need to repeat the various offensive things Johnson has said about different groups in our society. His capacity to lie - even to our Queen - is there for all to see. He unlawfully sought to shut down our legislature. He refuses to publish a parliamentary intelligence and security committee report into Russian interference into our democracy, in spite of the fact a former Conservative Attorney General chairs the committee, a former head of MI5, the former National Security Advisor and a former head of the Civil Service, all say it should be published. It is all very Trumpian.\nGiving Johnson a majority would be to give a blank cheque to this type of politics in the UK - something which should worry us all and be strongly resisted. As Liberal Democrats and patriots, we will defend our liberal, internationalist, progressive values - British values - in the face of this politics of hate and division.\nThe December EU Council summit starts on polling day and the election results will come through while it is still meeting. Whoever wins may well head straight to that summit. And the clock will be ticking down towards the current scheduled date of departure, 31 January 2020. Once you discount the Christmas break, exit day will be due just over a month after polling day.\nSo the public have a choice. Either Johnson fails to get a majority, and sufficient numbers of MPs are elected to provide for a people's vote in the Spring of 2020. Every Liberal Democrat MP and the full weight of our party will be thrown behind Remain in that scenario.\nOr, Johnson is given a majority, allowing him a blank cheque to do exactly as he pleases. He has said he will seek to bring his withdrawal agreement bill back to the Commons before Christmas, leaving little time for further scrutiny of it by a new parliament.\nRishi Sunak, chief secretary to the Treasury, let the cat out of the bag over the weekend when he disclosed that, regardless of whether the withdrawal agreement passes, if re-elected the Tories will continue to plan for \"no deal\".\nIn order to stop this calamity, and for the numbers to add up to stop Brexit in a new House of Commons, at the very least we must reduce the numbers of Conservative MPs - all of their candidates have signed a pledge in this election to deliver this hardest of hard Brexits.\nOver the last two weekends, The Observer newspaper carried out seat polls in a number of constituencies that usually vote Tory. They show the Lib Dems in second place with us poised to beat the Tories, particularly if Remainers vote tactically. This has been reinforced by Sir John Curtice who says the Lib Dems are best placed to beat the Tories in seats across the country.\nThe polling highlights the crucial role voters have in Tory/Lib Dem marginals in the coming weeks - stopping Brexit and Johnson's extreme version of it is the prize.\nChuka Umunna is the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for the Cities of London and Westminster",

Stilton is covered by a protected designation of origin, which is linked to the region a product comes from. Gloucestershire Old Spot pork is protected under a third system - traditional speciality guaranteed - which the Birmingham balti is currently applying for.\nThere are 73 such protected food names in the UK, including wines, beers, ciders and spirits, as well as wool. The list of protected foodstuffs includes Cornish pasties, Whitstable oysters, Scotch beef, Jersey royal potatoes and Anglesey sea salt.\nClegg also warned that British chocolatiers could soon face difficulties in exporting to Europe for a different reason. Cadbury's-style chocolate, which has a higher vegetable fat and milk content than most continental rivals, only won the right to be sold as chocolate across Europe in 2003 after a 30-year battle. Before that, a number of EU countries, including Spain and Italy, banned chocolate that contained vegetable fat instead of pure cocoa butter.\nClegg said: \"I would have thought that, relatively quickly, European chocolate manufacturers will say 'let's just tweak the chocolate definition' … then suddenly [British-style chocolate] cannot be called chocolate any more.\"\nThe former deputy prime minister, who is now the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Brexit, recently produced a report warning that foods including chocolate, cheese and wine would soar in price if the UK pursued a hard Brexit outside the single market.\nHe said that the promise from \"Brexit enthusiasts\" that a \"low-cost bonanza beckons\" as the UK strips away trade tariffs was unrealistic.\n\"This ludicrous utopia is simply not going to happen,\" Clegg said. \"It is a disservice to the debate for anyone to predict that.\"\nClegg said that food import tariffs were there to protect British as well as German and French farmers. He added that it would not be in the national interest to unilaterally remove them as this would remove the UK's bargaining power when it was trying to gain access with trade partners for exports such as legal services and accountancy.\nHe warned that the government needed to develop a trade strategy that would reassure businesses that would increasingly be demanding the same treatment promised to Nissan. The car manufacturer recently committed to further car production in the UK after receiving a promissory letter from the government.\nHe warned the government against \"making commitments without the power to deliver them\".\n\"If this carries on, we will just get a series of untransparent, potentially expensive, lopsided jumble sale deals between the government and one sector after another. You can't run such a complex economy as ours in such a piecemeal fashion,\" Clegg said.",

He told the Standard he was aware of Labour MPs who were disenchanted because Mr Corbyn's \"shambolic\" leadership was letting the Conservatives off the hook.\n\"I don't want to park my tanks on Labour's lawn,\" he said. \"I want to park my tanks on the Tory lawn, which is where Labour's tanks ought to be.\" Mr Farron even hinted that Labour defectors would be allowed to stand in the next election under Lib-Dem colours, aiming to tempt those facing deselection. \"We'd want those people to be very much part of our future,\" he said.\nHe virtually ruled out ever going into a coalition with Mr Corbyn, saying: \"Could I see myself doing it? I can't.\"\nMr Farron accused Labour's leadership of being \"more content with feeling good about themselves than doing good\", adding: \"I think there is nothing grubby about winning elections.\"\nA year after he took over from Nick Clegg as leader of a party reduced to just eight MPs, Mr Farron claimed the Lib-Dems had recovered their \"winning ways\" after their \"best local government results for eight years\" and a rise in membership.\nHe revealed the Brighton conference will open this Saturday under the theme of an \"open, tolerant, united Britain\".\nThe leader unveiled a policy announcement calculated to hearten activists - an extra £60 million for local authorities to tackle the \"outrage\" of homelessness in London and other big cities.\nBut the keynote conference pledge, he believes, will be to halt Brexit by holding a second EU referendum in two years. Voters and business leaders, he argues, will increasingly feel that leaving the EU is a \"calamitous situation that our children will pay for\".\nHe added: \"I imagine Theresa May would bow to that kind of pressure.\"\nMr Farron has known the Prime Minister longer than most. As a 21-year-old student, he stood against her during the 1992 election in the Labour stronghold of Durham North-West. \"I found her sharply dressed, polite and a competent debater,\" he said. \"She played the game of the Tory parachuted into the unwinnable seat. We both got annihilated, me slightly more than her.\"\nHe thinks May has a \"basic decency\" and keeps her word but suffers David Cameron's flaw of \"short-termism\".\nScathingly, he said her \"fence-sitting\" in the EU campaign made even the low-profile Mr Corbyn \"look like an absolute trouper\". He added: \"If you are a leader, you stake out a position and you fight for it. You don't just see which way the wind is going.\"\nSometimes Mr Farron's strident positions sound jejune, however. Defending his opposition to the so-called Snooper's Charter, he said \"a pair of eyes, time and shoe leather\" provides better intelligence than computers.\nConfirming his opposition to a third runway, he said that if Zac Goldsmith resigns his Richmond Park seat in protest at a go-ahead, the vote would turn into \"a referendum on Heathrow\".

This raises questions about the sustainability of Labour's perpetually ambiguous stance on Brexit, which underwent yet another round of cautious evolution this week. Labour now says it will fight an election committed to a second referendum, with Remain as one option and a \"credible Leave option\" as the other. That is a long way from its 2017 manifesto position, which committed Labour to honouring the result of the first referendum. But this shift may not be enough for tribal Remain voters, who now see the Lib Dems as a more credible champion of their cause, particularly as Labour refuses to commit in advance to campaigning for Remain in a second referendum. The risk for Labour is that seeking the middle of the road on Brexit gets them run over by an electorate no longer interested in compromise - 69% of voters rate Labour's current Brexit policy as \"unclear\" and 63% disapprove of Corbyn's handling of the issue.\nHow worried should Labour be? The electoral risks are mounting. Labour has lost half of its 2017 support, and some polls now put them behind the Lib Dems overall. Jeremy Corbyn's personal ratings have slumped since the 2017 election and are now the worst ever recorded for an opposition leader. Labour optimists will point to the party's dramatic turnaround in the previous general election campaign as evidence that there is no need to panic. Once an election is upon us, Remain voters will again recognise that Labour is the only viable alternative to a hard Brexit Conservative government, and will return to the fold. The Lib Dems' rise may even play out in Labour's favour, if the Lib Dems challenge the Conservatives in southern English seats where Labour is out of contention, while being tactically squeezed in Conservative-Labour marginals where Labour is best placed to defeat the Conservatives.\n• Robert Ford is professor of Political Science at the University of Manchester and co-editor of Sex, Lies and Politics",

My one comfort about Boris Johnson is that if he's promised us one thing, there's a high probability he will do the opposite\nFor Liberal Democrats, the political choice between the hard Brexit menus offered by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt might seem about as tempting as arsenic verses strychnine.\nSome might believe Hunt's offer is less poisonous, but for British business the choice is still between Johnson's decidedly strange strategy or Hunt's willingness to close small businesses down, all for the sheer deranged machismo of Brexit. And you know what? I'm starting to wonder if Hunt might indeed be the worse choice.\nCertainly Hunt is the most catastrophically disastrous foreign secretary since, well, the last one. Alas, despite their appalling apprenticeships, one of these two men will be hired as our prime minister.\nThe kindling is sparking under Hong Kong. China's draconian communist government clamps down on civil rights and contemptuously tells Britain to suck up the fact that it is ripping up the agreement that handed over the then colony in 1997. So what is our foreign secretary doing? Spamming Twitter with news of how he is enjoying fish and chips in Scotland and cream teas in Devon, while campaigning for the Tory leadership.\nBefore the handover, my political hero Paddy Ashdown led a campaign to guarantee citizenship to Hong Kong people holding British nationality overseas passports, should China break its promise to give Hong Kong a \"high degree of autonomy\" and uphold \"rights and freedoms\". Shamefully, Britain rejected the pleas of the then Liberal Democrat leader. Canada, incidentally, was more generous, and its thriving community of Hong Kong expats has contributed huge amounts to Canadian life.\nSo where now is the bold offer from Britain to show solidarity with current victims of oppression, and to put pressure on China? Where's the offer of sanctuary to students in Hong Kong who now face a worrying future? Where is the top-level engagement?\nIt's not just that Hunt has failed to act - he scarcely seems troubled by the crisis. One suspects he betrays a greater sense of consternation while attempting the quick crossword.\nAnd this is the problem with Hunt. All that seems to really animate him is the chance of becoming prime minister. He will avoid saying anything that might deny him his great prize. He knows Brexit will be a disaster and that the chancellor is right to warn it will cost each household £3,300 a year - or, to put it another way, more than our police and schools combined.\nYet still Hunt peddles Brexit fantasies to woo Tory members, even offering a vast bung to farmers that would break the rules of the very World Trade Organisation that Brexiteers hope to fall back on after a no-deal Brexit.\nHunt isn't stupid, so this makes his crassness all the less forgivable. When he compares the EU to a Soviet prison, you know that he knows some of the stuff that went on in the gulags. \"Foreign secretary,\" you feel compelled to ask, \"do your principles really mean so little to you? You were better than that, weren't you?\" If Conservative members suddenly had a Damascene conversion over Europe, he would surely start calling Brussels the promised land and denouncing Nigel Farage as an enemy of the people.\nMy one comfort about Johnson is that if he has spent a very long time promising one thing, there is a fairly high probability he will do the opposite.\nTherefore, don't rule out Boris from pulling off the most spectacular rubber-burning U-turn and belatedly backing calls for a Final Say on the Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May. Less comfortingly, he is just as likely to attempt a coup d'etat by proroguing parliament to force through no deal.\nIf there is rain in Hong Kong, it must be the tears of Paddy looking down at the troubles he foretold. This I know: the agents of the Chinese police state and the agents of Brexit are the enemies of Liberalism.

Our first thoughts are of course for his family and colleagues.\nAs a consequence, there will be a by-election in Gorton. This will actually the sixth by-election in the constituency in the space of 128 years, which is rather a lot. At first glance, this is a very safe Labour seat, with 67 per cent of the 2015 vote and no other party making it into double figures.\nBut if any party is going to challenge Labour here, it will almost certainly be the Lib Dems. The Remain vote in this seat was 61 per cent Remain according to NCP estimates. The Lib Dems came second in each election from 1997 to 2010, latterly coming within 18 points of Labour.\nThe problem for the Lib Dems is that they came fifth in 2015 and lost their deposit. That means that, unless any opinion polls are commissioned (and show the Lib Dems in a clear second), they may have trouble squeezing the Green vote without a pact. And as this is one of four seats (all Labour-held) where the Greens came second last time, the Lib Dems may have a hard time persuading them to stand aside.\nIn reality, the Lib Dems have a far stronger chance of challenging Labour, due to their well-oiled by-election machine and a higher vote \"ceiling\", not least because unlike the Greens, they could conceivably squeeze a few points of tactical voting from the Conservatives (or indeed anyone that wants to stop Labour).\nWithout a pact, the 31.5 per cent swing required by the Lib Dems might be a bridge too far. What's more, Labour may opt for a 4th May poll to coincide with the Greater Manchester mayoral election (and county council elections elsewhere), and we know that people often gravitate towards putting their crosses in the same box at coincident elections.\nIt wouldn't be without risk, however, as it would mean a relatively long campaign. That is probably a bigger threat to the incumbent than anyone else. Whoever wins might be in their place for place for a while. This constituency has a large electorate for a Labour seat, and in sharp contrast to Copeland and Stoke Central, it is unchanged in the initial proposals from the Boundary Commission.

And, now, economic debate is drowned out by the politics of Brexit and an unstable government.\nYet this is an unusually important and difficult budget.\nThe Chancellor has foresworn the use of a second budget, traditionally used to correct the mistakes in the first.\nAnd the potential for a massive, if unquantifiable, economic shock from an unsatisfactory deal - or, even, 'no deal' is palpable.\nBrexit hangs over the forecasts.\nThe environment of radical uncertainty is already spooking business investment and depressing growth, including the growth in government revenue.\nI want, then, to set out some analysis of where we are and some ideas for where the Liberal Democrats think Britain could and should go.\nOur focus is on freeing up capital spending to build the homes and infrastructure the country needs, on reviving the NHS with a targeted injection of cash, and on giving a leg up to young people with a learning account as they begin their working lives.\nTo do all this, we need a Government which prioritises economic competence over political dogma.\nNeither the 'no deal' Brexit extremism of the Conservative Party nor the 'socialism in one country' dreamed of by Labour will deliver a successful economy.\nFiscal Rules\nI have long held the view that governments must subject themselves to the discipline of fiscal rules which have first, sufficient independent, non-political, oversight to prevent arbitrary and populist tax and spending policies and, secondly, which dovetail with independently managed monetary policy.\nIn the last two decades, however, good intentions and consistency have been undermined by the massive shock and dislocation caused by the 2008 banking crisis and by the temptation of successive governments to redefine and politicise the fiscal targets while paying lip service to them.\nGordon Brown introduced two rules which were broadly accepted as sensible: to balance the current - ie non capital - budget over the economic cycle; and to permit borrowing for investment subject to meeting a rule that government net debt to GDP should be under 40%.\nTo complicate matters the Government also shadowed the Maastricht target of an overall deficit (current and capital) of 3% GDP subject to a (gross) debt ratio of 60%.\nAfter almost a decade of sustained growth the Labour Government claimed that it was still meeting the fiscal rules, though it was widely believed that this was achieved by defining the cycle in a statistically convenient but economically dubious manner.\nThe collapse of the banking system destroyed the fiscal framework.\nEnormous temporary deficits (with overall government borrowing of 10% in 2009) made the current deficit and overall debt rules meaningless.\nThere was a massive structural rather than cyclical deficit.\nI wrote about these issues in both my book The Storm and its sequel, After The Storm.\nThe Coalition set the fiscal objective of eliminating the structural current deficit ratio over the first four years of the 2010-2015 Parliament.\nThe Office of Budget Responsibility was set up to provide independent monitoring.\nBut the four year objective was allowed to slide to five, then seven, years and attempts to separate the structural and cyclical became increasingly difficult.\nGradually, Osborne's objective became one of simply eliminating government borrowing - current and capital - over a specified time period.\nThe present objective is to balance the overall budget by the end of the decade (followed by surpluses).\nIn practice, this means running a surplus on current spending by the end of the decade.\nThe justification for doing so is to build in resilience in the event of a future shock.\nWhat it does not acknowledge is how challenging reaching a surplus position may be, and the other risks it poses to economy - particularly if capital spending continues to be constrained.\nThe current position as set out in scenarios proposed by the IFS, is that the Government may come close to achieving the OBR estimate of 'structural' borrowing of under 1% of GDP in 2019/20 in a \"moderate\" benign environment, falling further in subsequent years (from 3% in 2017/18).\nBut it is also possible that in a \"very poor\" environment the 'structural' deficit could fall to only 2% in 2019/20 and then rise again to over 3% in 2021/22.\nIn the latter case, government net debt could rise to over 90% in 2021/22 as opposed to falling below 80% in the benign environment.\nThe IFS concludes that a firm commitment to running a budget surplus from the mid 2020s (for resilience reasons) \"is no longer sensible\". I agree.\nWhat should be done? The public is tiring of \"austerity\" though the Government is some way short of realising its targets, which may well have to be allowed to slide to accommodate the clamour for spending on health, schools, welfare reform, policy, defence and prisons; lifting the public sector pay cap; and accommodating Brexit contingencies.\nThe IMF (like the IFS) recommends a \"gradual\" approach to reducing the deficit.\nOur priority now must be to prioritise capital spending.\nOne damaging practical consequence of the Government's existing, unachievable targets is that productive investment is being squeezed, choking off the prospect of the long-term economic benefits it brings.\nDespite this month's rate rise, government borrowing can be financed very cheaply at present, with continuing very low interest rates available to us on long term debt.\nMy preferred model would be to return to the Golden Rule which will be more credible now there is an independent OBR.\nThere also needs to be an independent check on the economic impact of government financed capital projects. I discuss how this can be done in a recent paper for the LSE.\nIn parallel with a reform of fiscal targeting I would want to see a reform of the monetary policy framework.\nI was a strong supporter of the MPC set up and continue to defend its independence.\nBut post-crisis economics has made its role in setting interest rates of secondary importance and also deeply confusing not least to itself: a ship with defective radar, damaged steering and ancient maps.\nIt would make more sense to give the MPC the role of targeting (nominal) GDP, which is what it has appeared to do in any event and also to have some agreed rules around QE including variants which merge into fiscal policy since this is likely to be the main policy mechanism in future recessions.\nEconomic Fundamentals\nUnderlying the more pessimistic forecasts for economic growth and the budget are negative assessments of UK productivity performance.\nUK productivity in terms of output per man hour and total factor productivity lag well behind other Western economies such as Germany and France.\nMoreover, productivity has stagnated since the financial crisis: the flip side of a positive story of rising employment and falling unemployment.\nThe two sides of this phenomenon come together in the form of stagnating real wages.\nThe budget cannot solve the productivity problem but it can address it properly and point to the steps needed to counter it.\nThe first is the need for increased business investment which incorporates innovative technology and better work practices.\nHowever, a long-standing dearth of investment is now compounded by the radical uncertainty surrounding Brexit.\nLong term studies by the LSE have shown that the two main determinants of poor UK performance on productivity are lack of innovation (R&D as opposed to basic science where the UK is strong) and low levels of skills.\nThe former problem is being addressed by R&D tax credits and by the work of Innovate UK, in particular the Catapult network, which Liberal Democrats launched in government as part of the Industrial Strategy.\nThe latter is a far less tractable problem and despite the progress we made in the Coalition in raising the number and quality of apprenticeships, especially Higher Apprenticeships, the programme is now slipping backwards largely because of clumsy implementation of the apprenticeship levy and the neglect of careers advice and guidance.\nThere is an immediate need to ensure that the apprenticeship levy rebates reach the supply chains of larger companies.\nThe industrial strategy is the right framework. After I introduced it in 2011, as a way of cementing long term decision making, there was a revival of confidence in industries as varied as cars, aerospace, creative industries, and railway supply chains.\nWith the current uncertainty over Brexit and doubts about the durability of the government, that confidence has begun to evaporate.\nYet a budget built around the industrial strategy, prioritising education and skills, R&D and infrastructure would, at the very least, send the right signals.\nLib Dem priorities\nGiven the constraints surrounding the budget I would advocate the following:\n1. A freeing up of government capital spending, separate from decisions around the day-to-day budget. Two main areas suggest themselves. One is greater operational freedom for Network Rail and devolved transport authorities like Transport for London to finance their investment programmes, where they can raise capital cheaply.\nThat would mean faster decisions to press ahead with projects like Crossrail 2, and the potential to move on bringing about a rail revolution in the North with HS3.\nThe second is to use the Government's balance sheet to finance large scale housebuilding by a government agency operating on the Development Agency model, used in different ways in the Docklands and Liverpool and for the New Towns.\nThe Communities Secretary has partially backed a plan originally put forward by Respublica for a £100bn programme over ten years, to build homes for sale or rent.\nSuch a programme could be complemented by greater freedom for councils to borrow to build, and by assisting smaller private builders by boosting the small builders' credit scheme operated by the British Business Bank.\nOne way of improving the overall economic effectiveness of public investment would be to channel it through our independently managed institutions on the lines of the Green Investment Bank (now, regrettably, privatised).\nIf Brexit happens, Britain will need to replace the admirable European Investment Bank, based loosely on the model of the German kFW.\nA British Investment Bank would have responsibility for selecting and, then, overseeing public investment.\n2. There is an urgent need for additional funding for key public services but this must be financed on a tax neutral basis.\n3. My party's policy is to raise 1p in the pound on each rate of income tax, to provide an extra £6.5bn for the NHS and social care.This proposal has the dual merit that it addresses the immediate gap identified by NHS professionals and the NHS Chief Executive (though not the longer term issue of funding sustainability) and acknowledges explicitly that revenue has to be identified to pay for spending commitments.\nThere are other current spending priorities and, in particular, to relieve the harshness of welfare changes notably arising from the freezing of benefit levels, especially housing benefit, and the introduction of the universal credit.\nThe June Lib Dem manifesto explains how those could be funded:essentially by cancelling several tax cuts since 2015, notably to Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax.\n4. By common consent, young people have been left behind for too long. There now has to be some form of redistribution between generations to restore the implicit contract in every society between young and old.In ours, the spiralling price of property has radically shifted the balance making home ownership unaffordable for large numbers of younger people.\nTaken together with diminished job security, pension availability and the costs of post-school education, an issue of intergenerational equity has arisen.\nA better proposal than populist gestures like cuts in tuition fees and freezing rents is to create an endowment or learning account for young people on their 16th or 18th birthday which they can draw down at any time in life all to pay for further and higher education (a post graduate course, for example), reskilling and adult learning, as they choose.\nThe Director of the IFS has written favourably of this approach. The principle of intergenerational transfer would be sustained by the imposition of a modest tax on personal wealth.\nLet us consider, notionally, a generous and ambitious learning account of, say, £18,000.\nThis would cost just over £14bn per annum for each new age cohort. This is worth roughly 1/3 of 1% of net household financial and property assets.\nIt is not difficult to see how a modest tax on personal net wealth, above a certain threshold, could generate substantial sums. We shall investigate how best to do this.\nWider Tax Reform\nMy party, in coalition, promoted one of the more far reaching tax changes in modern times by radically lifting the threshold for basic rate income tax, lifting four million people out of income tax altogether. We also promoted an aggressive approach to tax avoidance, leading to the introduction of the General Anti Avoidance Rule.Now I want us to apply that same radicalism to land values, to business taxation and to tax avoidance.\nFirst, led by the entrepreneur, Andrew Dixon, we have a group investigating the feasibility of Land Value Taxation.\nAuthoritative analysis of the British tax system, notably the Mirlees Report, makes it clear that the taxation of land is the most economically efficient and rational form of taxation, the least open to evasion and avoidance and the most relevant to contemporary needs such as better utilisation of land for housing.\nThe Lib Dems are committed as a first step to replacing business rates with site value taxation.\nSecondly, a group of tax specialists, on our Corporation Tax Panel, has been reviewing business tax. Its interim conclusions are that the system is over complicated and full of unintended incentives. They suggest:\n-\nA stable and predictable corporation tax reform with a competitive rate of around 20%. Britain should not be aiming to be a corporate tax haven.\n-\nAll companies bidding for government contracts must be clearly seen to be subject to tax in the UK and preclude the use of offshore tax havens.\n-\nRapid progress on limiting tax deductibility of corporate interest\n-\nRecognising the special problems presented by digital companies which currently find it easy to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions. One argument for \"exit from Brexit\" is that the European Commission is currently an effective enforcer.\n-\nThe complex capital allowances regime must be reformed to incentivise and not penalise capital investment.\nThirdly, The 'Paradise Papers' scandal underlines the scale of systematic tax avoidance.\nIn fact, the introduction by the Coalition of the General Anti-Avoidance Rules and an open register of beneficial ownership put the UK among the tighter jurisdictions and the estimated 'tax gap' between actual and potential receipts is now one of the lowest - 6% of revenues. This still, though, amounts to a large sum.\nOne necessary step is firm action against dependent territories and crown colonies which encourage aggressive tax avoidance. This should include the blacklisting of firms which utilise abusive schemes operating from those territories and the reserve power of direct rule.\nThere are precedents for such action. The Turks and Caicos Islands were subject to direct rule because of corruption in 2009.\nConclusion\nGetting this Budget right is more important than the Chancellor realises.\nDisillusionment with our current economic performance, and the model which underpins it is acute. Any Brexit would make the problem worse, and a 'no deal' Brexit would cause severe destabilisation.\nThe danger is that this provokes a further growing appetite both for populist fiscal policy - sometimes described as the magic money tree - and for retreating to a much more state controlled and inward looking model.\nBoth could be catastrophic for our country.\nSo what is needed is a serious strategy for growth and prosperity, and in today's politics only the Liberal Democrats are offering it",

Visitors seek advice and buy an array of items that are on sale within the centres. Closure would see a large number of permanent staff made redundant.\nAccording to the authority's website, the Peak District National Park has just over 13 million visitors each year and is one of the most popular parks in the UK. An estimated 20 million people live within a one-hour journey of the Peak District. More than 50 million people live within a four-hour journey.\nEach of the four visitor centres is situated in key tourist hotspots. Edale is where the Pennine Way begins and Kinder Scout is nearby - it is also valuable for moorland research. Castleton is famed for its extensive cave and cavern system and castle and Mam Tor. Bakewell, a market town dating from medieval times, is home to one of the UK's most important agricultural markets, is famous for Bakewell puddings and is close to the stately homes of Chatsworth and Haddon Hall, and Bamford.\nOne person, who did not wish to be named, said: \"Our visitor centres provide a valuable service to\nmany of the thousands of people who visit the area each year and I cannot imagine what impression\nthis would give to those visiting if there was nowhere to be able to obtain information and help.\"\nDuring the recent meeting at Aldern House in Bakewell, authority member Peter Tapping asked about the cost of running the visitor centres. He said: \"It looks as if it costs £510,00 to run them, which is an enormous amount. So is that value for money?\"\nMr Mulligan answered and said: \"That figure is not totally correct and I will be talking more about this later. They cost more than that to run, around £800,000 but I will give the figures later.\"\nMr Tapping also observed that the authority has reserves amounting to about £9 million on a turnover\nof £15 million a year.\nAsked about the possibility that the visitor centres could be closed, a Peak District National Park Authority spokesman said: \"With a long-standing 'flat cash' government grant settlement that is also expected to continue for the next two years, coupled with the organisation-wide impact of unprecedented levels of inflation, the Peak District National Park Authority is currently reviewing its operational structure.\n\"As part of this process, the chief executive has this week shared internally with staff a number of options to explore re-shaping the authority to ensure the organisation remains resilient and sustainable in an increasingly challenging financial situation.\n\"The review of operational structure also aims to ensure the authority has the right resources in place, including potential changes within its workforce, to focus on activities that will safeguard the future of the Peak District National Park including climate change, nature recovery and supporting those who live, work in and enjoy the area.\n\"An ongoing process of engagement with staff will take place to help develop proposals prior to formal consultation, with final decisions on areas of the organisation affected by the options being considered brought to members of the authority in July.\n\"Operations, services and activities currently being delivered by the National Park Authority will not be affected during this time. Any further information on how authority operations may be impacted will be shared when confirmation can be provided.\n\"Whilst the authority's overall financial turnover figure may be higher, our baseline government grant is around £6m a year - with almost all of the remaining spending being grant-funded and restricted to specific projects or other works. It is the government grant aspect of our funding that has remained unchanged for a number of years despite rises in inflation and increased costs.\n\"Although the authority does retain a financial reserve, this is similarly restricted for the most part for specific uses and activities.\"\nZena Hawley, Agenda Editor, The Derby Telegraph, 9 Feb 2023",

Well it would appear that on many fronts the government could be rightly accused of double-speak after this week's Conservative Party Conference. Theresa May was Home Secretary for six years. During that time she deported almost 50,000 students with dubious legality and yet still failed to meet her own unrealistic targets. She also oversaw a big reduction in the number of immigration officers at ports and airports. However rather than accepting targets will never be met and giving the Home Office the staff they need, it has now become the job of head teachers and property owners to control immigration.

That is why we want a general duty of care for the environment, to ensure that companies are avoiding behaviour in their operation and supply chains that is damaging to the environment,\" she told the Guardian. \"[We] have ambitious plans to tackle the climate emergency so that we can look after the planet we have because there is no planet B.\"\nUnder the proposed legislation, companies would be required to exercise due diligence with regard to certain commodities - for instance, products such as palm oil, crops or timber that could come from deforested areas - and to certain behaviours, such as modern slavery or child labour.\nThe list of criteria would be set out separately, and could be expanded over time. These rules would be valid even if the companies were acting according to the law in the country where deforestation was occurring. If deforestation were set out in the secondary legislation as being something on which there was a requirement to report, then companies would have to report on it regardless of the legality in the country they were doing it.\nThe proposed legislation would also encourage companies to exercise due diligence with regard to environmental, social and human rights issues in general and would require them to publish reports on the steps they have taken to exercise that due diligence.\nSwinson will also attack the government's record on environmental issues, pointing to a lack of clear policy on how to achieve the net zero target that was enshrined in law under Theresa May, and what she said were failings in climate policy, such as support for fracking and airport expansion, scaling back support for renewables such as solar panels, and the privatisation of the Green Investment Bank. \"The Conservatives' record on the climate crisis is appalling. They have declared an emergency but have done nothing about it. That is like setting off the fire alarm and then standing by as you watch the house burn down,\" she said.\nOther political parties are also considering rules to prevent goods being sold in the UK whose production contributes to deforestation, as environmental and trade issues have taken on greater prominence in the light of Brexit and a potential general election.\nEarlier this month, the Guardian revealed the extent to which products such as soy from deforested areas of the Amazon were found in British supermarkets.\nMolly Scott Cato, MEP for the Green party, told the Guardian: \"Primary forests play a vital role as carbon sinks and in preserving biodiversity, so we need mechanisms in place to ensure firm action can be taken against countries that either encourage deforestation to push exports or fail to make efforts to protect their forests. We must take a lead by adopting legislation on mandatory due diligence, as the EU has done already with conflict minerals.\"\nShe gave Brazil as an example of where the principles should be applied, in the case of imports. \"It is evident that [President] Bolsonaro has given the green light to land clearance for the production of beef and soy exports and has weakened forest protection. Brazil is therefore undermining its Paris Agreement commitments and firm action should follow. The EU and UK must refuse to sign up to trade deals with Brazil until it ends its ecological vandalism and work to regulate specific global supply chains based on the requirements of the Paris Agreement and the [UN's] sustainable development goals.\"\nBarry Gardiner MP, Labour's shadow secretary of state for international trade and shadow minister for international climate change, told the Guardian his party would also move to tackle the problem. \"We need a global consensus on measures to deal with trade arising from deforested areas.\" he said.\nGardiner added: \"It is outrageous that the government is cosying up to Brazil's rightwing government, which is actively supporting the widespread destruction of the Amazon through deliberate forest fires. Labour's trade policy will be used to elevate environmental protections rather than opening up opportunities for big business to profit from significant environmental damage. the next Labour government will pursue trade agreements that meet our global climate obligations.\"\nThe government said it was \"committed to working with our world-leading businesses to reduce the UK's impact on deforestation overseas.\"",

We do not want a re-run of the 2016 referendum. But we demand that the people of Britain should have the final say. When the government can tell us what the terms of exit actually are, the people should be able to vote on whether they want them or not. That is the legitimately democratic stance. The public did not vote on 23 June to give a blank cheque. They did not vote for \"Leave on any terms\". Quite the opposite.\nThe public may have instructed the government to negotiate exit terms. The public can give further instructions on whether to accept those terms or not.\nAll over the country local meetings are taking place between people from progressive parties (and people of no party) about this issue.\nLast Friday I spoke at such a meeting in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, where the local MP campaigned for Leave despite most local people voting for Remain. Over the summer, I have spoken at a number of other meetings in other counties too.\nLast Friday at Amersham saw a packed meeting with Liberal Democrat, Labour and Green speakers.

Pictured above are just some of those who attended.\nIt will take many years before the government is in a position to say \"here are the draft terms for exit on offer\". It is vital that we do not wait until then to organise our campaign but make our case now, and continue to make it. Our case is a liberal, open, prosperous Britain, which is in the Single Market, protects the environment and gives UK citizens all the benefits they currently enjoy as EU citizens.\nOver the years ahead, more and more people will come to conclude that they were lied to in June 2016. They were lied to about £350 million per week. They were lied to about immigration. They were lied to about Turkey. And, fundamentally, they were lied to that exit could be beneficial and not harmful. As with Blair's WMD in Iraq, time will expose these lies.

This will make the severe staff shortages faced by the NHS even worse and patient care will suffer as a result.\"\nA Conservative spokesperson said: \"Since these documents were written, Boris Johnson has negotiated a deal with the EU that would have ended any anxiety felt by millions of people, including EU nationals.\n\"The Liberal Democrats voted against that deal, causing more delay and more uncertainty for those whose interests they claim to want to protect.\n\"A vote for Jo Swinson will only result in a Corbyn-Surgeon alliance, and two referendums in 2020. That's not good for the country, and it's not good for EU citizens living here, who just want to work hard and get on.\n\"A majority Conservative government will get Brexit done and introduce an NHS fast-track visa for qualified doctors and nurses - because we value their contribution to our fantastic NHS.\"",

And with a parliament likely to last four years, we have time to devote to thinking about where we want the party to be by 2024 - and how we get there. So before Christmas, Lisa Smart (Hazel Grove) and I met up for a pub lunch in the Peak District. We picked Hope, partly because it's halfway between our homes, and partly because… well… we could use some hope.\nWhile this election was disappointing across the board, the result masks significant regional variation. We did relatively well in London and the south east, despite heartbreaking near-misses in Wimbledon and Carshalton and Wallington. But elsewhere in the country our performance was weaker - even in areas, like Sheffield Hallam, that voted remain.\nI believe that one of the factors driving this was a failure to set out a clear 'offer' to the North - although the policies were all there. A £50 billion capital investment fund, extra money for buses, skills wallets as an attempt to support those hurt by deindustrialisation - all underpinned by real devolution of money and power. Together, these would have made a real impact on communities across the north - whether cities like Sheffield, towns like Harrogate, or villages like those in Westmorland and Lonsdale. But somehow, the message didn't get through.\nThis election offers a real opportunity - with dozens of strong second places and four years to prepare, we are well placed to move forward next time. But it also presents a risk. With these second places, along with most of our held seats, concentrated in London and the South East, we may be tempted to speak only to those places, at the expense of Northern England and our former heartlands in South West England.\nI believe that would be a mistake. Our country - all of it - deserves better than Conservative division and Labour arrogance. And our party has a huge amount to offer cities like Sheffield - where residents have been let down over and over again by an over-centralised economy and a complacent and out-of-touch council. Our core values, centred around empowering people and communities and devolving real power and money to cities and regions, represent the best answer to rebalancing our economy and addressing the real frustrations that drove Brexit. And our commitment to education is a vital part of giving people - all over the country - the opportunity to realise their potential and drive growth for their communities.\nA lot of these issues are common across the north. But our party's regional structures have made it harder to develop pan-Northern policy, and without a strong parliamentary party across the regions to drive collaboration, I believe we need another approach.\nThat's why we're proposing to launch a Northern Liberal Network at Spring Conference - which appropriately is being held in York. This isn't intended to be a policy talking shop - at least not at first. It is instead modelled on the work done by the Social Liberal Forum in coalition - providing a forum for the exchange of ideas and to advocate for a strategic direction. We can also use it to engage with business across the north, and to run our own regional campaigns - or anything else people suggest. The key is that we want to start talking to each other, about the big challenges that our region faces, and what our vision is to address them.\nIf that sounds like something you'd like to be part of, please keep an eye out for our event in the Conference Fringe - or if you can't make it to conference, email me at lauragordonLD[at]gmail[dot]com and I'll keep you informed.\nPhoto above of the Valley of Hope by AJC1 on Flickr CCL Some rights reserved\n* For many years, Laura Gordon did humanitarian work in Africa helping the victims of war, disease and famine.

That's a question being debated again in the Liberal Democrats in the aftermath of the 2019 election, so here is a re-run of an excellent account of a previous attempt, the one under Paddy Ashdown. It's Duncan Brack's chapter from The Alternative: towards a new progressive politics, kindly reproduced here with the permission of the author and editors.

After an election campaign which had seen the two main parties more or less tied in the opinion polls, Labour had entertained real hopes of emerging as the largest party, and the Liberal Democrats of holding the balance of power. The result, a Tory lead of 7.5 per cent over Labour, and a Tory majority in the Commons of 21 over all other parties, came as a crushing blow to Labour; the party's leader, Neil Kinnock, resigned a week later. The Liberal Democrats too were disappointed, though at least they had succeeded in recovering from their post-merger nadir of 1988-90. (The polls' consistent over-estimation of Labour's support reflected the pollsters' failure to pick up the speed with which Britain's electorate was changing; their sampling was wrong. Plus ça change.)\nPolitical discussion after the election focused on the seemingly never-ending Conservative hegemony. Commentators seriously considered whether Labour could ever win another election. Echoing Mark Abrams' and Richard Rose's Must Labour Lose? of 1960 (which had followed three Tory victories, from 1951 to 1959), the Fabian Society published a series of pamphlets under the heading Southern Discomfort, focusing on Labour's loss of support in southern England. And yet the combined Labour and Liberal Democrat vote in 1992 clearly exceeded the Conservative level of support, so there was also speculation about whether there might be some grounds for collaboration between the two opposition parties.\nIn fact, the potential for cooperation between the non-Tory parties, or a realignment of them, had been a common theme of leaders of the Liberal Party for the previous 30 years - including Jo Grimond's call for a realignment of the left in the 1960s, the formation of the Lib-Lab Pact in the 1970s, and the alliance between the Liberals and the new Social Democratic Party in the 1980s. With the sole exception of 1955, the combined Liberal and Labour vote had exceeded Conservative support in every election since 1945 (and has continued to do so in every election since 1992). It was only the division between the two progressive parties, it was argued, that had allowed the Tories to hold power for so long. The most radical version of this argument ascribed Conservative success throughout the 20th century to the disintegration of the pre-first world war Liberal Party, which had divided progressive politicians between the rising Labour Party and the surviving Liberals and had allowed the Tories to win power for most of the century on a minority vote.\nPaddy Ashdown, the first leader of the Liberal Democrats, had been interested in exploring the possibility of cooperation with Labour since his election in 1988. Just five days after becoming leader he met representatives of the newly formed Labour-friendly Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) to talk about think-tank cooperation, and the following April he and his lieutenant Richard Holme were talking about some sort of Lib-Lab 'Programme for Britain'. The 1992 election seemed to make the case even stronger. The day after polling day he held a strategy meeting which decided that the Liberal Democrats should not attack Labour too strenuously; he recorded in his diary that 'we must make use of this opportunity to realign the left'.\nExactly a month after the election, on 9 May, Ashdown delivered what became known as the 'Chard speech', given to an audience of only 40 or 50 in a small town in his constituency; he said later that he believed it was the most important speech of his leadership. Arguing that the Liberal Democrats needed to 'work with others to assemble the ideas around which a non-socialist alternative to the Conservatives can be constructed', he called for a national electoral reform commission and for Labour to be more open to constitutional reform and a market economy, more pluralist and less a creature of the trade unions.\nThe speech was deeply unpopular with Liberal Democrat MPs (one took to referring to it as a 'burnt offering'), partly because at the time Labour seemed finished and about to descend, in the wake of Kinnock's resignation, into another bout of infighting. The Liberal Democrat peers were more supportive, but only last-minute wrangling prevented a strategy debate at the autumn conference placing severe restrictions on Ashdown's freedom of manoeuvre. However, there was very little response from Labour. Although some of the party's leadership, including Robin Cook and Peter Mandelson, were open to approaches from the Liberal Democrats, the new leader elected in July, John Smith, was determined to maintain his independence and believed that Labour was still capable of winning on its own. Events over the next 12 months seemed to suggest that he might be right - in September 1992, 'Black Wednesday', which saw the pound forced out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, destroyed the Conservatives' reputation for economic competence, and the party then started to tear itself apart over British accession to the Maastricht Treaty of European Union in 1992-93.\nThe Conservatives became so unpopular that between mid-1994 and the start of the 1997 election campaign the Labour share of the vote in opinion polls never dropped below 50 per cent. But many Labour politicians, and commentators, could not bring themselves to believe that the Tories would not win again; they had been too scarred by the experience of 1992. In the phrase of Neal Lawson (adviser to Gordon Brown 1992-94), Labour felt like gatecrashers at a party - they might be having a great time, but eventually someone would turn up and kick them out. So the possibility of cooperation remained alive, and it gained new impetus with the sudden death of John Smith in May 1994, and his replacement as Labour leader by Tony Blair in July.\nBlair, influenced partly by Peter Mandelson, was far more open to some form of cooperation with the Liberal Democrats than Smith had been. Indeed, Ashdown had discussed the topic with him as early as July 1993 at a dinner organised by Anthony Lester (special adviser to Roy Jenkins in the 1970s, founder member of the SDP, and from October 1993 a Liberal Democrat peer). Blair, following Jenkins (whom he regarded as a mentor), recognised the strength of the argument that the historic split in the British left had handed power to the Conservatives; as he put it later, 'the 20th century had been a Tory century precisely because good and talented people who should have been together were instead in separate parties fighting each other'. Two months after his election as Labour leader, he and Ashdown began what was to become a five-year series of meetings and discussions about how to get rid of the Tories and how best to work together both before and after a potential election victory - what became known as 'the Project'.\nThe details of the process can be followed in Ashdown's diaries and other sources. What this essay focuses on is what in practical terms the two parties did, and what lessons can be learned from the Project for cooperation in today's very different political environment.\nAssuming that the Tory vote was likely to recover before an election in 1996 or 1997, some kind of cooperation certainly seemed to make sense; and even if Labour did win, it seemed quite possible it would be with only a small majority, and might thus need additional Liberal Democrat support in the Commons. By 1993-94 the Liberal Democrats were also benefiting from the collapse in Tory support, in local elections and by-elections - in many areas, particularly south-west England, they seemed better placed than Labour to dislodge the Conservatives. In July 1995 they fought off a strong Labour challenge to win the Littleborough & Saddleworth by-election from the Conservatives, suggesting that they would not simply be swept aside by the rising tide of support for Labour.\nBut what kind of cooperation? One possibility was an electoral pact, where Labour and the Liberal Democrats would field common candidates. Blair suggested this in talks with Ashdown in November 1995, at least for seats in the south-west. But as Ashdown retorted, this was: 'totally impossible'. He added, 'And we would waste a lot of time dividing our parties if we tried to do it. It would also look like a grubby plan designed to gain power and votes for ourselves, instead of one based round principles and what was best for the country.' The Liberal Party had been through a process of seat allocation with the SDP, and it was a divisive, time-consuming and exhausting exercise even between two parties with very few policy differences.\nWhat Ashdown preferred was to lay out a small number of key positions on which Labour and the Liberal Democrats agreed and make it clear that they would cooperate on them in the next government. This would enable the parties to retain their distinctiveness in other areas while at the same time promoting an atmosphere of cooperation which should encourage tactical voting amongst the electorate. Many of the discussions between Blair and Ashdown over the following 12 months explored these possibilities. This was assisted by the formal abandonment of 'equidistance' by the Liberal Democrat conference in 1995. Although many of the party's activists and MPs were highly sceptical of Ashdown's approach, and resisted any attempt to more publicly align their party with Labour, the reality was that Liberal Democrat policy positions were, with a few exceptions, much closer to Labour's than to the Tories', and the government was so unpopular by 1995 that it was ludicrous to pretend that the Liberal Democrats were indifferent, or 'equidistant', between them and the official opposition.\nDiscreet cooperation began to develop between the two parliamentary parties. Archy Kirkwood and Donald Dewar, the Liberal Democrat and Labour Chief Whips, began to talk more frequently, developing what Kirkwood called a 'doctrine of no surprises'. They tried to avoid major rows between their own parties and on occasion coordinated their MPs' attacks on the Tories, helping to reinforce the impression that the government was an increasingly beleaguered minority. This approach paid dividends when Kirkwood and Dewar discovered that the Conservative whips were 'pairing' the same Tory MPs against both Liberal Democrat and Labour members, effectively reducing opposition numbers. Blair and Ashdown also sometimes coordinated their attacks on the government at Prime Minister's Questions.\nTalks, generally over dinners, between small groups from both parties helped each side understand each other's positions, explore the possibilities for cooperation in Parliament (short of a coalition) should the Conservatives lose power, and paved the way for cooperation over policy in the form of a series of talks on constitutional reform led by Robin Cook for Labour and Robert Maclennan for the Liberal Democrats. Starting in March 1996, a year later the group reached agreement on a package of proposals including incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law, freedom of information legislation, devolution to Scotland and Wales (and elections by proportional representation to their parliaments), an elected authority for London, removal of the hereditary peers from the House of Lords, proportional representation for the European elections, and a referendum on voting reform for Westminster elections, comprising a choice between the existing first-past-the-post system and a proportional alternative, to be agreed by a commission on voting systems. Most of this had been Liberal Democrat policy for years (or was a watered-down version of it), but some was new for Labour. Blair saw it as part of his programme of modernising the Labour Party, and the position of the constitutional modernisers within Labour, such as Robin Cook, was thus strengthened.\nThe Cook-Maclennan process was public. What was discussed in secret, however, was something much more dramatic, what Ashdown called 'the big thing', an agreement to fight the election on a common platform on at least two or three major issues. Ashdown went so far as to draft successive versions of a 'Partnership for Britain's Future', covering constitutional reform along the Cook-Maclennan lines, cleaning up politics (after several examples of corruption and dishonest conduct amongst MPs), the reform of welfare systems and economic policy reform, including investing in education, awarding independence to the Bank of England, and adherence to the criteria for entry into the single European currency. From July 1996 Blair and Ashdown started to talk about Liberal Democrat participation in a Labour government; Peter Mandelson later claimed that this would have involved including two Liberal Democrat MPs, Alan Beith and Menzies Campbell, in Blair's first Cabinet.\nIn the end, the 'big thing' was too big a step. What worried Ashdown and his colleagues was Blair's refusal to commit firmly to the introduction of proportional representation for Westminster elections - the absolute bottom line for the Liberal Democrats, who could not be expected to tie themselves to a much bigger partner without being able to survive its eventual fall. Ashdown's diaries record in painstaking detail a long series of meetings in which Blair was first educated about what PR meant and the different systems through which it could be introduced, and then prevaricated, hinting at his own possible conversion to it (or maybe to something weaker, such as the Alternative Vote), but stressing the opposition he would face in the Parliamentary Labour Party. In the end, policy cooperation extended only as far as the Cook-Maclennan agreement.\nThe approach of the general election raised the question of how far the parties should cooperate - and be seen to be cooperating - during the campaign. Ashdown argued for overt collaboration, campaigning together to get rid of the Tories, even to the extent of appearing at joint rallies with Tony Blair. But polling in the party's target seats conducted by Chris Rennard, the Liberal Democrats' experienced Director of Campaigns and Elections, showed that while those who had voted Conservative in 1992 were open to the proposition that the Liberal Democrats could participate in government with Labour should the Conservatives lose, they strongly disliked the idea that the Liberal Democrats should actively campaign for a Labour-Lib Dem coalition, and any hint of this would drive them back to the Conservatives. Furthermore, the prospect of a coalition did not help with those who had voted Labour in 1992; they preferred the Liberal Democrats to the Tories anyway, and the evidence suggested that not many of them really understood tactical voting, believing that they had to vote Labour to bring down the Tories, even when their candidate was in a poor third place in their own seat. These findings were unwelcome news to Ashdown, but the polling evidence was so clear that he had to accept it; and it recalled what had happened in the last week of the 1992 campaign, when it was felt that speculation about the possibility of a hung parliament had driven voters back to the Tories. Holme also shared the figures with Mandelson.\nSo overt cooperation would be counterproductive. But what about covert cooperation? In January 1997 Neal Lawson and Neil Sherlock (a member of Ashdown's speech-writing team) - both supporters of cooperation - organised a dinner in the Goring Hotel in Victoria to bring together key individuals from the election campaigns on both sides, some of whom had not before been involved in the Project. Chris Rennard raised the idea of the Mirror (the main Labour-supporting tabloid) endorsing Liberal Democrat candidates where Labour had no chance. Mandelson agreed this could be done, and smoothed the way with the Mirror's staff. Originally supposed to cover just 10 seats, on the eve of poll the paper published a list of 22 seats where, if Labour voters backed the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives would be defeated. In the event the Liberal Democrats won 20 of them.\nMandelson also requested a list of Liberal Democrat target seats so that Labour knew where to restrict its campaigning efforts. Rennard supplied a list of 28 seats to Labour deputy leader John Prescott's office, disguised (in case of leaks) as an academic paper identifying constituencies where the Liberal Democrats could win and Labour could not. It is not clear to what extent either party really held back in their campaigning - and the extent to which campaign managers can direct their activists to go to seats other than the ones they live in is probably less than the managers like to think - but it helped that in many of the targets it was obvious that the Liberal Democrats were better placed to win than Labour. The number of seats where both opposition parties were in contention with each other was very small, though there was certainly no let-up on either side in those constituencies; in the end, Labour gained two seats from the Liberal Democrats.\nThe parties also collaborated, in a fairly low-key way, during the 1997 election. Blair and Ashdown stayed in touch both before and during the campaign, discussed using a common language to attack the Tories, generally avoided criticising each other's parties, and focused on much the same issues in campaigning - health, education and crime (they would probably have done this anyway; these were the leading issues). The fact that the two parties' policies were different - Labour had promised to stick to Tory spending plans, the Liberal Democrats to raise income tax to invest in education - also helped, marking out a distinctive case for the Liberal Democrats and making it clear that cooperation did not mean a Labour takeover. The most obvious example of cooperation came in the decision to withdraw each party's candidate in Tatton, to give a clear run to the former BBC journalist Martin Bell, standing as an independent 'anti-sleaze' candidate, against Neil Hamilton, a Tory MP (now a Ukip's leader in the Welsh Assembly) deeply embroiled in the cash-for-questions scandal; Bell, assisted by activists from both parties, won convincingly.\nThe 1997 general election saw the Conservatives go down to their worst result in a century and a half, losing a quarter of their vote and half their seats. Their losses were exaggerated by tactical voting; as the psephologists John Curtice and Michael Steed concluded, 'the scale and impact of tactical voting in the 1997 election was unprecedented'. They estimated that Labour gained between 15 and 21 seats, and the Liberal Democrats between 10 and 14, as a result of tactical switching to defeat Tory MPs. Supporting one of the findings of Chris Rennard's target seat polling (see above), Liberal Democrat voters proved more willing to switch to Labour than Labour voters to the Liberal Democrats - the surge in support for Labour was so great that often the best that Liberal Democrat candidates could hope for was to keep the Labour vote at its 1992 level (which was often enough to win, given the collapse in the Conservative vote). Tactical voting was more widespread in areas where the Liberal Democrats had done well in local government over the preceding five years, which had established the party as a credible contender in the eyes of the local electorate. Effective targeting of resources throughout the Parliament also clearly helped.\nIn a close election, tactical voting on this scale would have made a major difference to the outcome. But the 1997 result was not close: Labour won 419 seats, for an overall majority over all other parties of 179. Nevertheless, as late as election day, Blair and Ashdown were still talking about whether they could entertain any form of cooperation. Blair declared that he was 'absolutely determined to mend the schism that occurred in the progressive forces in British politics at the start of this century'. He hinted at a coalition, though Ashdown pointed out that it would be unacceptable for Liberal Democrat ministers simply to implement a Labour programme. By the next day, however, Blair had changed his tone, talking merely of a 'framework for cooperation'. Robin Cook later confirmed that Gordon Brown and John Prescott had both made clear to Blair overnight their virulent opposition to any role for Ashdown or his colleagues in government. In any case, the size of Labour's majority destroyed any argument for it.\nThe rest of the story of the Project can be followed elsewhere. In place of a coalition, a Joint Consultative Committee was created between the two parties to discuss issues where there was already agreement in principle, such as devolution or first-stage reform of the House of Lords; it was later extended to European issues. It is difficult to judge what, if anything, the Committee achieved, and it was largely abandoned by Charles Kennedy in the run-up to the 2001 election. The key stumbling block to further cooperation was Blair's continued refusal to commit to proportional representation. In December 1997 the government finally announced the establishment of an independent commission on voting reform, to be chaired by Roy Jenkins - but when his report was published in October 1998, advocating an additional member system of PR, Blair's response was entirely neutral, with no commitment to a referendum. Later that day Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, rubbished it publicly, and did so again in a Commons debate the following week. Effectively this was the end of the Project, and Ashdown decided that it would also mark the end his period as Liberal Democrat leader; he announced his resignation three months later.\nNo comprehensive and objective assessment of the Project has yet been carried out. However, it seems clear that it made a difference in at least two respects. The Cook-Maclennan agreement had a direct impact in the shape of the constitutional reforms Blair implemented after 1997. Probably Labour would have devolved power to Scotland without any prompting from the Liberal Democrats, but Labour's attachment to issues such as Welsh devolution, proportional representation for the European elections or freedom of information was much weaker, and these policies may not have been implemented in the absence of the agreement - or their introduction may have been delayed and perhaps eventually dropped. Second, the atmosphere of cooperation that Ashdown and Blair built between them in the run-up to the 1997 election, and specific instances such as the Mirror list of winnable seats, made a difference to the election result, encouraging supporters of each party to switch to each other to defeat the Conservatives and thereby exaggerating their losses.\nWhat lessons can we draw for the future from the experience of the Project? There are (at least) six.\nFirst, don't talk about coalition, even if that's what you have in mind. The target seat polling from 1997 showed that those who had voted Tory in 1992 would be frightened back to their original party if they thought Labour and the Liberal Democrats were ganging up in advance of the election. This is strongly reinforced by the experience of the 2015 election, when the prospect of a Labour government in coalition with, or supported by, the SNP proved deeply unpopular (though not quite as unpopular as the Liberal Democrats' apparent willingness to join a coalition with almost anyone).\nSecond, it is nevertheless worth exploring the potential for pre-election cooperation over specific areas of policy. The most obvious is constitutional reform, along the lines of the Cook-Maclennan agreement or, more ambitiously, the Scottish Constitutional Convention of 1989-95. The gross distortions of the 2015 election result, where it took 34,000 votes to elect a Conservative MP, 302,000 to elect a Liberal Democrat and 3.9 million to elect a Ukip MP, makes a strong case for electoral reform in particular. Voters do not tend to get excited about these kind of issues, however, so the state of public services, particularly the NHS, could be another possible topic - the evidence suggests that voters like the idea of politicians setting aside party differences to work together (though the fact that that's what coalitions do seems to have eluded them).\nThird, do everything you can to maximise tactical voting, which is a rational response to the distortions of the first-past-the-post electoral system. This will probably be more effective if it is promoted from outside the parties, as in the Mirror piece in 1997. In 2020 there should be extensive potential for arranging vote swapping via social media. Parties' campaigning resources - which, with the much greater use of telephone canvassing, are now more centralised than in 1997 - can also be deployed to avoid attacking each other, at least up to a point.\nFourth, either keep it all as quiet as you can - or be as open as you can. Some party activists are open to cooperation - and it is of course widespread in local government - but many are not. Journalists often like to look down on party members as 'tribal', but another way to put this is that they are loyal, to their beliefs and their colleagues. Most party activists will spend their entire political careers delivering leaflets, raising money and knocking on doors without ever being elected to anything, and without realising any personal financial benefit. Belief in the cause is what keeps them going, and naturally they will not be well disposed to giving up their efforts to see another party's candidate elected. So, either don't tell them, or as be as open as you can, explaining what's going on and what the benefits are. The Blair-Ashdown Project is an example of the former approach; in retrospect it is remarkable how little of what was going on leaked to the outside world. The overwhelming vote at the Liberal Democrat special conference in May 2010 to enter coalition with the Conservatives is an example of the latter, showing that reasoned argument can convince activists to work with other parties in the national interest.\nFifth, none of this will work unless the personal relationships between the key individuals involved are very good - they have to trust each other to work together and stick to their side of the deal. The Project would never have happened without the rapport that Ashdown and Blair built up over several years of dinners and discussions.\nFinally, be clear what you want the outcome to be: a coalition, a confidence and supply arrangement, an agreement to reform the voting system and then call another election, or something else. And despite all the difficulties, never forget the reason: to avoid the 21st century seeing another succession of Tory victories on ever-diminishing shares of the vote.\nDuncan Brack was the Liberal Democrats' first Policy Director (1988-94), chair of the party's Conference Committee 2003-10, and special adviser to Chris Huhne at the Department of Energy and Climate Change 2010-12.

First and foremost, I believe the British people should be given the right to vote on the government's negotiated Brexit deal. Voting for a departure is not the same as voting for a destination. This is not an attempt to re-run the first referendum; we must respect the result. But the British people should be allowed to choose what comes next, to ensure it is right for them, their families, their jobs and our country.

Some dismiss this is a post-referendum spasm which will quickly ebb away. I fear that may not be the case and the Brexit decision may cause long-term damage to community cohesion and open a Pandora's box of nasty populist politics. Let me explain why.\nBrexiteer leaders - Farage, Fox, Johnson - made promises which are already unravelling. They told voters that leaving the EU would lead to better NHS services, improved job prospects and smaller class sizes. Those promises were largely based on migration myths which, unfortunately, many people believed.\nVoters were promised that leaving the EU would lead to an improved NHS. Migrants were (wrongly) blamed as a drain on scarce NHS resources and that the UK cash contribution to the EU would be redirected to the NHS.\nThe reality is that the NHS is struggling because people are living longer, but often with multiple medical conditions and there has been a huge increase in conditions resulting from lifestyle choices. Neither of these is related to migration - these are home-grown problems - so leaving the EU will not resolve them and may make matters worse as it could discourage medical professionals from coming to work in the UK.\nAs regards more money for the NHS, that promise has already been broken. The Government has stated it will instead guarantee existing EU funding for the science and agricultural sectors which means no cash injection for the NHS.\nWith regard to class sizes, as a former school governor for many years, I can say that has always been an issue. The problem is not migration, but underinvestment over many decades in the education system.\nBrexiteers promised that less migration would mean more job opportunities for UK citizens. Yet, in reality it is Government underinvestment in education, training and apprenticeships - not migration - which has resulted in school leavers lacking the skills they need to secure employment.\nSecondly, Brexiteers argued for a points based immigration system. The Prime Minister has rejected that, but offered no alternative. Whatever model is eventually proposed it is unlikely to meet the expectations of ultra-Brexiteers as the \"who's allowed in\" list is likely to be long: from bankers to seasonal agricultural workers to qualified construction workers which the housing sector needs.\nIronically, if the Brexiteers' promise that the UK economy will boom comes true then demand for migrants to meet that economic expansion will increase.\nAlso, any Brexit deal with the EU will almost certainly protect the residency rights of Brits living on the mainland as well as those from the mainland living in the UK.\nBrexit migrant myths will be exposed, but will not disappear overnight. Failure to deliver Brexit promises will lead to a lot of angry voters which creates fertile ground for populist politicians even more extreme than Farage.\n* James Lindsay is a Lib Dem member in Harborough.",
  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_standing-for-election-isn-t-just-about-winning-2/content_107.html": "The obvious reason to stand for election is that you want and hope to win.\nA related common reason is that you want to win and hope that standing this time means you can win on a future occasion. But it also makes sense to stand even if winning isn't on the foreseeable agenda and you are what is often called a 'paper candidate'*.\nI've written before about the advantages of standing in unwinnable council by-elections. (The brief version: even an unwinnable contest is a chance to practice, to learn, to experiment and to raise the odds of winning somewhere else, sometime in the future.)\nIt's slightly different when it comes to standing in non-target wards in the usual run of council elections. Different, but still the same basic point: standing still brings many benefits.\nFirst, it's good for democracy. Having different parties put up candidates is the necessary condition for voters to make choices between them. The mere act of having your name on the ballot paper is a contribution to making democracy function - and democracy could do with all the contributions we can give.\nSecond, it's good for voters. It's deeply frustrating for many voters when they turn up to vote and see their preferred party isn't on the ballot paper. They may just feel frustrated (and boy, do they feel frustrated as I know having had the job of fielding such complaints from voters in the past). Or they may also blame the party for, in their eyes, treating them with disdain for not giving them a candidate to vote for. Frustration or frustration and disdain; either way, that's not how we should be leaving voters feeling.\nThird it's good for the party. One of the biggest challenges the Liberal Democrats face is to build up a large group of loyal supporters who persistently support us. Our core support is tiny compared to that of our main rivals - and we suffer for it. It makes us more vulnerable to bad times. It means we have further to go and harder to work to get to the winning post than rival parties with larger core voter.\nYet the one sure way to ensure people don't become persistent supporters is to insist that they should not be allowed to vote for us thanks to not putting up a candidate. No Liberal Democrat on the ballot paper means us saying to voters: 'we refuse to let you be loyal supporters of us'.\nStanding also helps the party identify better where its support currently is, and isn't. Having a full slate of candidates across the board helps spot areas that can be promising to target and try to win in the future.\nAll of which is why even if being a candidate does not mean more than getting a name on a ballot paper, it's still a valuable contribution to make.\nHundreds of party members do that every May - thank you. With next May's elections nearing, it's a terrific contribution you can make if you join them and ensure another vacancy has a Liberal Democrat name next to it come May.\nAnd in the meantime, lets contest as many council by-elections as possible - something made much easier with a bit of preparation.\nP.S. If winning is indeed your reason for standing, there's a book I'd recommend…\n* More accurately, a paperless candidate really as a 'paper' candidate doesn't then go and put out lots of leaflets.",

Norman Lamb, the former Care Minister and Lib Dem MP made a passionate plea for greater investment in the NHS and in particular on mental health.\nTory MP, Jacob Rees Mogg, unsurprisingly, countered that the UK cannot pay more tax. Even the usually more Conservative Julia Hartley Brewer nodded in agreement when Lamb outlined how little we spend on health as a proportion of GDP, which by the way is less than other European countries including Portugal.\nWhile Lamb focused on the human cost of a lack of investment in mental health including on his own family, Rees Mogg's attitude was totally oblivious to the impact of not spending more. It appeared as if Rees Mogg was finishing an A Level Economics test, not appearing on a national TV programme where human beings with real problems were watching as he regurgitated historical tax take percentages.\nFrom the family who loses the main bread winner to suicide and then cannot claim on life insurance, to the child who has waited three years for a diagnosis for autism, there is a massive human cost for failing to invest in mental health. Luckily for Rees Mogg he does not have to travel 300 miles each way to see his children every weekend in hospital as some parents have to.\nI have been honest before about my own experience of mental health issues. Following a breakdown in 2014, I spent £4,000 on private treatment as there were no options in urgent care on the NHS for me other than sectioning. I have recovered and gone on to pay back this investment many times over in taxes to Her Majesty's Treasury. Had I ended up out of work for an extended period I would have cost the Exchequer not just in the lost taxes but also through benefit payments. My case is just one of many but shows how investing in mental health can have big benefits for society.\nIt is estimated that mental health causes 70 million sick days a year in the UK, which is a staggering statistic. Other research has quoted the cost of replacing people on sick leave with mental health problems at £2.4billion a year. It is the leading cause of absence in the workplace.\nWe have to be realistic that it is unlikely we can eliminate mental health issues completely. However unlike Jacob Rees Mogg, we have to start seeing spending on mental health as an investment, in people and their families and the economy.\nOnly last week, it was revealed that 73 areas are cutting the amount of money being allocated to mental health. An abject failure to deliver on a promise made by the government to devote a higher proportion of spending by CCGs on mental health.\nIf the only way to meet that promise is to pay more tax then I for one am happy to pay towards it. For not everyone has the £4,000 that turned my life around.\n* Chris Key is dad of two girls, multilingual and internationalist.

Barclay responds in correspondence by defending the UK's approach and seeking updates on the schemes being developed by the EU27 governments.\nThe details of the parliament's call to the Johnson administration comes ahead of a meeting between the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the British prime minister in Downing Street on Wednesday.\nSources close to Von der Leyen said she would seek to privately sketch out the potential pitfalls in the 11 months Johnson has set as the timeframe within which to agree a comprehensive deal.\nBut EU sources said the trip would be the first of a number of initiatives designed to move the Brexit negotiations into a more collaborative phase that avoids the clashes of the last three years.\n\"We do not want to do this negotiation in public, that is for sure,\" one senior EU official said.\nWhen the EU's negotiating position is revealed in draft form in early February, before its formal adoption by the EU27 at a meeting of ministers on 25 February, it will only contain \"headline principles\" in order to avoid an early clash with the UK.\nJohnson has said the UK will not align with EU rules after Brexit, while the EU is expected to make significant \"level playing field\" demands on the UK in exchange for a zero tariff, zero quotas trade deal.\nBut the detail of those demands are not expected to be stipulated in the negotiating mandate to avoid clashes when the talks start in earnest in early March.\nIt is understood, however, the demands will closely follow those contained in the agreement made between Theresa May's government and the EU over the operation of the shared customs territory envisioned in the original Northern Ireland backstop.\nThe EU will seek dynamic alignment with the bloc's state aid rules and the continuation in the UK's domestic law of the bloc's directives on the exchange of information on taxation, anti-tax avoidance rules and country-by-country reporting by credit institutions and investment firms.\nThe UK will be asked to reaffirm its commitment to curb harmful tax measures as defined in the EU code of conduct.\nIn the field of environmental standards, sources said the EU will \"at the very least\" seek a commitment from the British government that it will not lower the EU's existing environmental standards in key areas such as industrial emissions, air quality targets, nature and biodiversity protection and environmental impact assessments.\nEU sources suggested that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, could push for a closer alignment to ensure the UK stays in line with Brussels as Von der Leyen pushes her new green deal.\nThe EU will also demand that the UK implements a system of carbon pricing that is as effective as the EU emission trading scheme for greenhouse emission allowances. The EU additionally wants non-regression clauses in the trade deal on labour and social protection standards.\nThe UK is expected to leave the EU on 31 January. The withdrawal agreement bill is returning to the Commons this week and will move to the House of Lords on Monday. It is expected to be on the statute books by the middle of the month and the European parliament will vote to ratify the deal on 29 January, according to a leaked draft agenda.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We have already provided certainty to over 2 million people who have been granted status through the EU settlement scheme. Our scheme is free, there is plenty of support for applicants and, once the withdrawal agreement bill passes, EU citizens have until the end of June 2021 to apply.\n\"We have done far more than any other EU member state has done for British citizens, and it's time they adopted a similarly generous approach.\"<iframe id=\"google_osd_static_frame_2926941470977\" style=\"width: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;\" name=\"google_osd_static_frame\"></iframe>",

That is why Liberal Democrats are proposing a transformational change to our economy, by providing working parents with free childcare from when their child is nine months old.\n\"This will close the gap between the end of paid parental leave and the start of free childcare provision. It will finally give parents more choice about when they return to work and unlock their untapped potential for our economy. This is part of our bold plan to build a brighter future and fundamentally reshape our economy.\"\nSwinson is keen to show that stopping Brexit is not her party's only preoccupation, as she tries to convince voters the 12 December general election is not a two-horse race between Labour and the Tories.\nJeremy Corbyn will launch Labour's policy offer for parents on Saturday. Speaking at an early years arts project in Leeds alongside the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, he will say the party would provide 30 hours a week free childcare for every child from the age of two.\nLabour is also promising to open a Sure Start centre in every community - 1,000 in total - to \"unlock the potential of every child\". The centres were created under the last Labour government and acted as a one-stop shop for parents; running playgroups and hosting health visitors and other services, but many have since been closed down.\nCorbyn will say: \"The Conservatives are failing a whole generation of children. Labour will deliver the real change Britain needs. Parents are struggling to afford the childcare support they need, while many children are going hungry and growing up homeless.\"\nAll three-year-olds are currently entitled to 15 hours of free childcare a week, with most working families entitled to up to 30 hours - and lower-income parents receive extra help from when their child is two years old.\nThe Lib Dems say their plan would cost £14.6bn a year, which would be funded by reversing cuts to corporation tax made since 2016 and increasing capital gains tax so wealth is taxed in line with income. They say the changes would be phased in over five years.\nLabour's costings will be published by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, alongside the party's manifesto - but he has already signalled his intention to increase borrowing significantly to fund a \"social transformation fund\".\nThe Conservatives rejected Labour's plans to extend childcare. Nick Gibb, the early years minister, said: \"Giving children the best start in life is vital. That's why we are investing record amounts in high-quality childcare and we have seen the quality of childcare improve, with 95% of childcare now rated good or outstanding.\"\nMany childcare providers argue that the level of funding provided by the government means they are unable to make ends meet. The Lib Dems say they will increase funding levels significantly, by 37% for two-year-olds to £7.22 per hour and by 20% for three and four-year-olds to £5.36 per hour.\nSwinson's party has welcomed a series of high-profile defectors in recent months, including the former Labour MPs Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger, and the former Conservatives Sam Gyimah and Sarah Wollaston.\nThe Lib Dems hope the issue of Brexit will put the party in contention in many remain-voting seats, including some in and around London, where the party was well behind Labour in 2017.\nUnder a \"remain alliance\" pact announced on Thursday the Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid Cymru have agreed to stand aside for each other in 60 seats in the hope that fielding a single anti-Brexit candidate will help to keep out the Conservatives.\nUnder the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids '\"wasting\" your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.\nOn Friday, Labour MPs from the campaign group Love Socialism Hate Brexit criticised the deal. They said some of the seats involved were held by ardently remain-supporting Labour MPs, including Ben Bradshaw and Neil Coyle.\nClive Lewis, the MP for Norwich South, said: \"I've long championed the idea of a progressive alliance and there is a strong case for parties working together, given our electoral system. But this remain alliance risks taking votes away from Labour in marginals and targets good, sitting pro-remain Labour MPs. This could give the Tories the advantage in certain areas. It is irresponsible. I urge the parties involved to talk to Labour and reassess.\"",

The Liberal Democrats only contested half the seats up for election last May. So I hope that in addition to more people than usual thinking about standing, more people than usual are also encouraging others to think about standing.\nOf course, saying yes to standing isn't the right answer for everyone. There's a whole bundle of factors that go into making the right decision, from the electoral through to the personal.\nIn particular, knowing what it takes to be a good candidate and then a good councillor is vital to winning elections - and to then making something out of the opportunity the voters have given you.\nSo here are seven questions to ask yourself if you are thinking of standing in the elections next May:\nWhat will you do differently from a councillor of another party?\nThere are decent people who will be conscientious and work hard in (just about) every party, and even in the most rural of wards, there is more than one person who is local to the ward. So what will you bring to it that makes you more than just a good councillor from any old party? What makes you a Liberal Democrat in how you go about the role?\nWhat do you want to achieve for the ward?\nWinning elections is a means to an end. What will you do with the power and publicity opportunities that even the humblest of backbenchers in the most ostracised of opposition groups get?\nHow long is it since you went to the least visited part of the ward?\nIn a rural ward, it may be a clutch of farms flung out on a track a long way away from the rest of civilisation. In an urban ward, it may be a block of flats hidden away behind a locked gate with an intercom. But wherever it is - your job as a councillor requires you to really know your patch, probably better than anyone else alive (save for any ward colleagues if you have them!). If even you are neglecting an area, then chances are there are people there who feel left out and also issues there that aren't being tackled.\nHow well do you really know which issues concern people in your ward?\nDo you know the name of the MP? Bingo - you're already more politically informed that the majority of voters. Yes, really. Most people spend very little time thinking about the council and even less time thinking about politics. That doesn't mean neither matter to them. But it means their priorities are driven by their lives, their families and their concerns, not by the strategic integrated framework for holistic service delivery.\nWhat's your two sentence answer to \"Why should I vote for you?\"\nAll the above should give you a good idea of the answer, but it's surprising how many people don't really know the answer. Muddling through without a message might get your through - but to survive a tough contest or to do a good job once elected, you do really need to know what you are doing and why.\nWhat are your political and personal weaknesses?\nAnswer this question honestly - and then ask yourself how much they matter to doing the job of a councillor (almost certainly more than you'd like to admit) and what you can do about them.\nLet me give one example: I've come across councillors from all parties who, fundamentally, don't really like talking to strangers. They come up with all sorts of excuses to not go canvassing and to stick with leaflets and doing stuff on the computer. The best admit these mistakes to themselves, and step by step remedy them. The worst? They never really talk to the public, sometimes wing it in a good year and get re-elected - but even when they do, they fail to shine as councillors because they carry on dodging talking to people.\nHow many votes do you need to win?\nIf you don't know how many votes you need, how can your campaign be run efficiently? It'd be like trying to run a business without knowing what the overall profit and loss is.\nDon't fret if you don't have good answers to all these questions yet: there is still plenty of time for you to sort that. Not many people will score a perfect set of answers to these questions - but good, talented people will recognise what needs doing and get to work. The tough part isn't having the right answers to all the questions - the tough part is being willing to admit to yourself that you might not have all the answers, and then to start doing something about that.\nOnce you do, it gets easier and easier from there. So good luck - and have fun!\nOne final thought: if you want to find out more generally about what winning an election involves, there is 101 Ways To Win An Election.",

We have also seen, in our wider society, outrage at the discrepancies between the pay of men and women in some of our greatest institutions... Sadly, these issues of discrimination and marginalisation of women still remain relevant, and must be challenged.\"\nThe lack of official rules concerning TV debates means the process is a complicated negotiation between parties and broadcasters.\nThe November debate would be the first direct confrontation between the Tory and Labour leaders since TV debates began in 2010. That election saw three three-way debates between David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg, and resulted in an outbreak of \"Cleggmania\" as the Lib Dem leader was credited with winning many of the exchanges. While the Lib Dems ended up with fewer seats, insiders say the debates allowed the party's polling to recover, compared with the start of the campaign, and helped it to a record number of votes.\nThe Lib Dems are angry that Swinson is not being allowed that chance. \"Jo is our candidate to be prime minister, and has the right to debate the other major party candidates,\" writes the group of female politicians. \"For the last six months, the party has been gaining momentum in the polls, and are now consistently polling at or around 20%, and we beat both Labour and the Conservatives in the last national elections in May.\n\"If Jo were not to be included in the leadership debates that are proposed, it would deny these people a voice. Her exclusion would fail to represent any balance or provide a platform for a unique position that has undeniably garnered significant public support.\"\nThe frontrunner usually avoids the debates as they can derail campaigns, but Johnson's team have been keen to put the prime minister up against Corbyn, with polls suggesting that the public see him as more prime ministerial. Labour, however, back Corbyn to win the support of viewers with his plans to reduce poverty.\nDowning Street sources have indicated that any debate involving smaller parties may be avoided by Johnson, who could send a cabinet minister in his place. However, when Theresa May made a similar decision in 2017, it was regarded as a of the mistake in an error-strewn campaign. Johnson ignored a head-to-head debate with Jeremy Hunt during the Tory leadership election, but took part in a chaotic debate that included five contenders.",

The review was set up by Labour on a cross-party basis, and that is how we want to proceed.\nI and my colleague the Rt Hon member for Havant want to thank Lord Browne and his Review Panel. The Government endorses the main thrust of the report. But we are open to suggestions from inside and outside the House over the next few weeks before making specific recommendations to Parliament, with a view to implementing the changes for students entering higher education in Autumn 2012. More detail will be contained in next week's Spending Review on the funding implications. But as a strategic direction the Government believes the report is on the right lines.\nBrowne acknowledges that \"the current funding and finance systems for higher education are unsustainable and need urgent reform\". The issue is how. And that question has to be framed in terms of how the higher education sector contributes to the deficit reduction programme.\nThere is also, I think, consensus around the idea that there should be no upfront tuition fees for students. That would seriously deter students from low and middle income families. This Government is strongly opposed to upfront tuition fees. Indeed it shares Lord Browne's conclusion that we should extend exemption from upfront tuition fees to part-time students, currently 40% of the student population, who have been unfairly discriminated against hitherto.\nThe question, then, is how much the graduate contributions for tuition should be.\nWe are considering a level of £7,000. Many universities and colleges may well decide to charge less than that, since there is clearly scope for greater efficiency and innovation in the way universities operate. Two year ordinary degrees are one approach. Exceptionally, Lord Browne suggests there should be circumstances under which universities can price their courses above this point. But, he suggests, this would be conditional on demonstrating that funds would be invested in securing a good social mix with fair access for students with less privileged backgrounds, and in raising the quality of teaching and learning. We will consider this carefully.\nWe believe it is essential that if the graduate contribution is to rise it should be linked to graduates' ability to pay. On average, graduates earn comfortably more than £100,000 over their lifetimes compared with non graduates. But not all graduates benefit in this way. Some choose socially useful but modestly paid or unpaid work which may include time spent bringing up a family. At present the graduate contribution acts like a poll tax, and is not fair .\nLord Browne has come up with persuasive proposals to deal with this issue. He suggests a £21,000 graduate income threshold before any payment is made, as against £15,000 at present, and to be linked to average earnings. And he suggests that a real rate of interest should be paid but only over that threshold. The effect is striking: 20% of graduates could pay less than they do now. The top third of graduate earners would pay more than twice as much as the lowest third. That is fair and progressive: the Government broadly endorses this approach and will examine the details of implementation. The principle of needs blind admission to universities must remain central.\nThe cost of university education to individuals and the state reflects living costs as well as tuition costs. The Browne Report makes some constructive suggestions, . We shall come forward with detailed proposals which will make it attractive for students from families of modest means to go to university and will be fair and affordable including exempting the poorest students from graduate contributions for some (or all) of their studies.\nLord Browne considered alternatives, including a graduate tax - as I believed new leader of the Labour Party favours. There are some key features in the current proposal for progressive graduate contributions which incorporate the best features of a graduate tax. It would be collected through the pay packet at a rate of 9p in the pound above the £21,000 threshold; combined with a real interest rate as Browne recommends, it would be progressive and related to ability to pay.\nBut Browne identifies serious problems with a 'pure' graduate tax. The proposal is unworkable; does not produce sufficient revenue to finance higher education until 30 years from now; weakens university independence; and is unfair to British graduates as opposed to graduates living overseas.\nIf there are any lingering doubts on opposition benches I would strongly commend a letter from the new shadow Chancellor to the new Labour leader 3 weeks ago, which reads thus: 'Oh, and for goodness' sake, don't pursue a graduate tax. We should be proud of our brave and correct decision to introduce tuition fees. Students don't pay them, graduates do, when they're earning [more than £15,000 a year], at very low rates, stopped from their pay just like a graduate tax, but with the money going where it belongs: to universities rather than the Treasury.'\nI do believe, moreover, that we need to look beyond the graduate population. 55% of young people do not go to University. We must not perpetuate the idea encouraged by the pursuit of a misguided 50% participation target, that the only valued option for an 18 year old is a three year academic course at a University. An Apprenticeship can be just as valuable as a degree, if not more.\nFinally, there is a challenge to all of us to promote a long term sustainable future for higher education. This has been a difficult issue for all parties in the House. Those opposite have ranged between being early advocates of a graduate contribution such as the member for Sheffield Brightside and the new shadow Chancellor, through to those implacably opposed to change - to the current labour leadership who remarkably have now embraced a graduate tax! The Conservatives initially campaigned against graduate contributions but reversed its position. The Liberal Democrats consistently opposed graduate contributions.\nBut in this current economic climate that policy is simply no longer feasible. That is why I intend on behalf of the coalition to put specific proposals to the House to implement radical and progressive reforms to HE based on the Browne report.\"",

The number of refugees has doubled in the last fifteen years. More than half of them are children. Over 6 million refugees are from Syria.\nThe UK has a long and proud record of providing asylum to seekers of sanctuary - from Jews escaping Nazi Germany to Sri Lankans, Somalians and Syrians fleeing civil war.\nBut now, the Conservatives seem determined to make our asylum system as cruel and unwelcoming as possible.\nThe clearest example is the inexplicable ban on asylum seekers working while their claims are processed. Thousands of people are left waiting for months for a decision, dependent on a government handout of £37.75 a week.\nAllowing asylum seekers to work is a no-brainer. It's good for them, good for businesses and good for taxpayers. That's why the Liberal Democrats have tabled legislation to give asylum seekers the right to work if they've been waiting for more than three months.\nThe Government must also stop locking up asylum seekers - including victims of torture - in detention centres with no idea when they'll be released. It's inhumane, unnecessary and expensive.\nThe Liberal Democrats believe detention should be an absolute last resort, and we are supporting cross-party efforts to impose a 28-day time limit on detention.\nBeyond these clear issues, though, is a pernicious culture at the Home Office that means asylum seekers are treated appallingly. It has a shockingly poor record on getting decisions right, with 44% of appeals upheld by a judge.\nOfficials treat even the most vulnerable people with callous suspicion. This is particularly bad for LGBT+ asylum seekers, who are often asked to prove their sexuality in humiliating ways. Some are asked explicit questions about sex lives, while others are forced to produce screenshots of their conversations on dating sites, or statements from former partners.\nThe Home Office is clearly not fit for purpose. And, when it comes to immigration and asylum, the Liberal Democrats believe it is beyond repair.\nWe will take asylum decisions away from the Home Office, and establish a new, non-political body staffed by highly-trained caseworkers who can make decisions quickly and fairly, getting them right first time.\nThat's how we make sure that seekers of sanctuary are treated with compassion and dignity.\n* Ed Davey is the MP for Kingston and Surbiton and Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesperson.",

  "http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk/http_highpeaklibdems_org_uk_news_article_what-now-for-the-humbled-liberal-democrats/content_229.html": "What now for the humbled Liberal Democrats?\nExclusive: Five Liberal Democrat MPs are considering standing for the leadership as intense divisions emerge over Jo Swinson's leadership and the party's future direction.\nWhen it became clear to Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson that she had lost her seat at last month's general election, she didn't cry. At least not in front of anyone. Instead, the first question she asked was whether her mum and sister were okay. She hugged her staff, and was outwardly upbeat through the night and into the following day's speech, in which she confirmed she would resign as the party's leader. Only days later did the news sink in. \"I'm still not over it to be honest,\" reflects one of those who was with Swinson in East Dunbartonshire that evening.\nThe party speaks about its now-former leader in reverent tones. \"No, I haven't seen her. Just texted,\" one MP says with a sad smile. Another rules out running for the top post because, they say, they could never match Swinson's commitment and energy to the rather unforgiving job of Liberal Democrat leader. \"She's the most resilient person I've ever met,\" says one Liberal Democrat who worked closely with Swinson. Party figures like to joke that \"you could punch her in the face\" and she would merely take a breather and keep going.\nThe bruising, public and largely unexpected loss of their leader's seat was the definitive blow on an election night that profoundly disappointed the Liberal Democrats. After finishing second in last May's European elections, the party enjoyed a whirlwind period with eight defections from the Conservatives and Labour, and a by-election victory in Brecon and Radnorshire, taking their total number of MPs to 21. Yet they ended 2018 with fewer MPs (11) than after the disappointing 2017 general election (12). Now, despite the warmth, kindness and sadness with which they discuss Swinson as a person, many of the Liberal Democrats' current MPs are privately scathing about the decisions taken under her leadership, as they look back on the campaign, reflect on what went wrong and debate where the party should go next.\nAs any Liberal Democrat will tell you, some of their electoral fate is invariably beyond the party's control. As the third party in a first-past-the-post electoral system, a squeeze on their vote share in a general election is largely inevitable, especially in a contest where the two main party leaders are highly unpopular. In an unpopularity contest, voters ultimately act to prevent their least-desired outcome: in this case, voting Conservative to stop Jeremy Corbyn, or voting Labour to stop Boris Johnson, with little thought given to the Lib Dems. Party figures acknowledge that the success of the Liberal Democrats is closely correlated with the popularity of the Labour leader: an unpopular Corbyn ultimately damaged the Lib Dems too.\nThere is frustration that Swinson lost crucial airtime through her exclusion from the televised leaders' debates between Johnson and Corbyn, and a sense of exhaustion at the uphill struggle that the third party faces in trying to attract media coverage. (The overshadowing of their universal childcare policy by Labour's less generous proposal is a particular sore spot.)\nBut beyond these external factors, there is much that Liberal Democrat MPs complain of from their own campaign, which several privately condemn as \"hubristic\", characterised as it was by multiple \"stupid\" decisions and a culture in which bad decisions went unchallenged.\nThis began with the decision last October to vote for a general election at all. Johnson craved an election having long prepared the ground for a \"people versus parliament\" contest, while the SNP were keen to hold an election before any potential ramifications from the trial of former leader Alex Salmond over sexual assault allegations, which begins in March. If the Lib Dems had \"stayed in the trenches\", as one MP puts it, Johnson could have been forced into a compromise position of holding a second referendum by January. Instead, in the words of a Lib Dem MP: \"we believed our own hype\", and the party made its first strategic error of the campaign. (Though it is difficult to know if \"staying in the trenches\" would have worked until January: with the combined votes of the Conservatives and SNP - 323 - a majority could have been won for a short bill setting aside the Fixed-term Parliaments Act and allowing for a general election on a specific date.)\nBut the greatest regret among Lib Dem MPs is over the party's pledge to revoke Article 50: how the decision was arrived at, and how it was later communicated. The Liberal Democrat leadership had long been aware of a push among the grassroots to back this proposal, which would have automatically cancelled Brexit, as party policy. (Under Liberal Democrat rules, any member can propose a motion for debate at conference and every member, including MPs and MEPs, has one vote. If a motion passes, it becomes party policy.) When it became clear that members would table a pro-Revoke motion at the party's autumn conference, which was likely to be selected for debate, the leadership decided to own the move and propose the policy themselves, rather than being forced to amend a policy from the membership.\nThe measure turned into a vote of confidence in Swinson's leadership, and it was overwhelmingly approvedOn the day the motion was introduced at the conference, one Liberal Democrat MP went for a long walk along the beach in Bournemouth to escape the \"madness\" being witnessed in the hall. There is disagreement among MPs about whether they were consulted over the policy in advance: some insist there was a meeting and a genuine effort to make a collective decision. Others argue that the defectors from rival parties - the \"new sexy people\", as one MP describes them - had Swinson's ear, while the party's pre-existing MPs were sidelined.\nSpecifically, couched in polite, very Lib Dem caveats about how talented this defector is, there is annoyance in the parliamentary party about how much sway Chuka Umunna had over the decision-making process. After his experience of leaving Labour to form The Independent Group/Change UK in February 2019, Umunna had a keen sense of the need to take bold positions in order to be noticed. This, his former colleagues suggest, was a critical factor in the adoption of the Revoke policy, and its subsequent communication, as well as in other decisions which they deem to have backfired. Whether they were in the room or not for the initial decision on the Revoke position, some of the party's MPs complain of a culture that discouraged criticism of policy. Umunna, the \"shiny new best friend\", as one MP describes him, was listened to at the expense of other Liberal Democrat voices.\nThis was also true in the case of the decision to make \"Jo Swinson: the UK's next Prime Minister\" a defining message in the campaign. Lib Dem MPs are unaware of how this crucial strategic decision was taken; certainly, they say, they had no input.\nAs one Lib Dem MP recalls hearing the line for the first time, they smack their head and roll their eyes. It looked \"hubristic\" and \"undemocratic\" when combined with the Revoke policy, they argue. (This has become a fault line in internal party debate: other Liberal Democrats are keen to point out that the \"next Prime Minister\" line has been used by successive Liberal Democrat leaders and in Ed Davey's leadership campaign with no negative response.)\nThere are other rather subjective criticisms of Swinson's leadership: that she placed too much emphasis on quantitative rather than qualitative data (an excess of polling, with little use of focus groups or doorstep campaigning to test messages); that she wasn't surrounded by people with experience of on-the-ground campaigning; and that the party failed to sufficiently change its strategy and messaging when the inevitable polling squeeze began. There is also a consensus that Swinson proved unpopular with voters in a way that was entirely unexpected: no polling or focus groups had suggested this would be an issue. Sexism played a role, most agree, but it is harder to work out how to prepare for, or resolve, a problem such as this in future elections.\nOn Saturday 18 January, a chair for the review into the Liberal Democrats' general election performance will be appointed, a timetable for a leadership contest will be set out, and a post-mortem will be underway. Some of the party's MPs are entirely withholding judgement on their election performance until they see the report. Others, from staff in Lib Dem HQ, to grassroots campaigners, to MPs who felt shut out of the process, will be hoping to see their own reflections vindicated.\nPerhaps more notable than the regrets over the election campaign, however, are the divisions over the Liberal Democrats' future. Even before a leadership contest timetable has been announced, the candidates and the battle lines are clear to anyone who speaks to the parliamentary party.\nOut of a field of 11, no fewer than five Lib Dem MPs are seriously considering standing for the leadership: former climate change and energy secretary Ed Davey, the current acting leader; Layla Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon since 2017; Christine Jardine, MP for Edinburgh West since 2017; Daisy Cooper, the newly-elected MP for St Albans; and, unexpectedly, Wera Hobhouse, the MP for Bath since 2017.\nIt will be a crowded field should all join the contest, and the divisions that will define it are already visible beneath the surface. Davey, 54, who was defeated by Swinson in the last leadership contest only six months ago, is widely expected to stand again, and his colleagues are keen to avoid a \"coronation\". However warmly he is spoken of by fellow MPs, Davey's view that the party's record in the 2010-15 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition must be owned and defended - if the party is to win back power - is one that will be fiercely contested.\nMany of Davey's colleagues privately argue that the \"yellow Tory\" factor was a hugely underestimated impediment at the general election. To overcome this obstacle, they say, the party needs a post-coalition leader: that could be any of the four women considering standing, who did not become Lib Dem MPs until 2017 or later. If Cooper, the newest MP, stands, the debate over the party's past could be particularly vociferous.\nThough the 40-year-old St Albans MP is little-known publicly, she is renowned within Lib Dem circles as a former candidate for the party's presidency and as the person hired to run Swinson's leadership campaign last year. A Lib Dem member throughout the coalition years, she protested against the bedroom tax and against the introduction of university tuition fees. In a contest between her and Davey, especially, the party would face a stark choice over how it relates to its recent history.\nMore broadly, however, the Liberal Democrats are thinking seriously about their post-Brexit direction. Many are aware that 70 per cent of the party membership has joined since the 2015 general election and fear that they merely view the Lib Dems as an anti-Brexit party, with little sense of the liberal values of openness and internationalism that informed opposition to EU withdrawal. \"I haven't heard a passionate case for liberalism or why it matters in people's lives,\" several of the potential candidates told me. Conversely, a candidate like Hobhouse, a first-generation migrant from Germany, could become a lightning rod for the party's most ardently pro-European members, as she flies the flag for the campaign to rejoin the EU.\nAbove all, most know that their future direction and, ultimately, their fate, will be shaped by the new Labour leader. One MP is holding out hope of mass defections if Rebecca Long-Bailey wins the leadership contest, while others envisage working closely with other candidates. Another MP highlights the possibility that the SNP will be damaged by Salmond's forthcoming trial. The road to a non-Tory majority, they say, is paved on the \"annihilation\" of the SNP in Scotland (the party currently holds 48 of 59 Scottish seats). And it isn't all gloom for the Liberal Democrats: the party came second in over 90 seats at the general election and increased its vote share (from 7.4 per cent to 11.6 per cent). In five years' time, the Lib Dems could well be in a strong position to make a comeback.\nAs they conduct their election review, watch the Labour leadership contest unfold and quietly prepare for their own (expected to begin after the local elections in May), some in the party wonder if Swinson will return. Her former colleagues are certain that she would never contest a constituency other than East Dunbartonshire. Having twice lost that seat, once in 2015 and again in 2019, it might seem oddly self-flagellatory for the former leader to get back in the saddle. But, as we know, Swinson can bounce back after a punch in the face.",

Teachers from outside the EU need a Tier 2 visa, which costs £1,220 if it is for more than 3 years.On top of this, the Conservatives have announced a big hike in the immigration health surcharge, paid by all migrants towards NHS costs, to £625 a year.\nFurthermore, should the UK crash out of the post-Brexit transition period at the end of 2020, those regulators would no longer tell the UK whether teachers had been sanctioned in their home country, the party warned.\nThe number of teachers from the European Economic Area (EEA) - the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - has already dropped from 4,795 before the Brexit vote in 2015-16 to 3,103 in 2018-19.

Each of these underpin the party's specific policy proposals.\nLiberty\nWe believe in the right of individuals to make their own decisions about how they live their lives, as long as they do not cause harm to others.\nOur aim is to empower and support individuals to pursue their dreams, to make the most of their talents and to live their lives as they wish.\nEquality\nWe stand by the idea that without equality, true liberty cannot be realised.\nThis requires an active state to: ensure that no one is held back by poverty, poor health, or discrimination, including on the basis of personal characteristics or beliefs; provide access to education or training, and other public services, including a welfare safety net; and guarantee that everyone enjoys equality before the law.\nDemocracy\nWe understand that through democracy, every citizen is empowered to make their voice heard, without being dominated by entrenched interests or the power of money; checks and balances, so that those in power cannot abuse their positions for personal gain or political advantage; and a plurality of views, where no individual or organisation is deterred from speaking truth to power.\nCommunity\nWe believe it is important to provide support for a diverse range of organisations that enable individuals to join together in the pursuit of common goals or activities; and the decentralisation of political and economic power to local government and the nations and regions of the UK.\nHuman Rights\nProviding, defending and promoting equal legal rights for everyone to pursue their lives according to their abilities, wishes and means, with no discrimination on the basis of religion or belief, gender, sexuality, age, ethnicity, disability, or minority status in their country of birth or permanent residency is highly important to us.\nInternationalism\nWe support a fairer and more equal, tolerant and connected world and collaboration with the UK's neighbours - including, ultimately, rejoining the EU - in guaranteeing peace and security, tackling the climate and nature emergencies, standing up to corporate power and spreading prosperity around the world.\nEnvironmentalism\nWe value the importance of acting at home and internationally to promote environmentally sustainable means of production and consumption and living in harmony with nature.\nOur policies\nLearn more about the influence these values have on Liberal Democrat policy",

She admits it was a little bit like grief after a death. But a year later, thanks to his disastrous referendum decision, Cameron was gone; then hubris struck his successor, Theresa May, who called an election expecting a landslide, which instead saw her lose the Tory majority and Swinson back as MP for East Dunbartonshire (a seat she first won as a 25-year-old in 2005). Two years later, she was elected Lib Dem leader. As Cameron and May reflect on their failures and mull their place in history, Swinson is now in a potentially critical position in the stormy politics of our time, as the fight over Britain's future continues to rage.\nAlastair Campbell: What does it say about our country that Boris Johnson is prime minister?\nJo Swinson: I think it is deeply worrying. Six or seven months ago, I didn't believe that the Conservatives would elect Boris Johnson. I think what happened was they got spooked by the Brexit Party.\nAC: I wonder what it's saying at a deeper level about what our politics is becoming. Is it about showbiz? Is it about journalism?\nJS: I think we're at a moment of shift where the old fault lines of British politics between the left-right spectrum aren't where the debate is anymore. It is now about this liberal to conservative, or authoritarian, spectrum. Whether you have an open or closed view of the world.\nAC: Would you argue that both main parties are there?\nJS: They're both split and that is why they are both struggling. That's one of the reasons for the increase in support for the Liberal Democrats at the ballot box. Tens of thousands joined the Lib Dems since the start of May because people want someone that speaks to those small \"l\" liberal values for opportunity, internationalism, equality, fairness, treating people as individuals.\nAC: Say Tories and Labour got identical outcomes in terms of seats, which of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn do you think you could work with as prime minister?\nJS: They are both, I think, not fit to be prime minister.\nAC: If that is the choice?\nJS: There are millions of people out there who agree that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are not fit to be prime minister and so we have a general election campaign and we make our case and our pitch to the country. I think the way that politics is right now, things are volatile. I think we are at a tipping point because we are changing from that old system, where it was all about left-right and those two big parties and people want some new and something different.\nAC: As you know I voted for the Liberal Democrats in the EU elections...\nJS: Thank you very much, Alastair!\nAC: But if you're going to stop Brexit, there are going to be lots of areas where presumably you will want Labour to beat the Tories?\nJS: I know that there are people in the Labour Party, who are working hard and trying to get Labour to a sensible position on Brexit. But basically we both know that the Labour leadership is not currently in favour of Remain. We don't know what the manifesto is going to say. It doesn't matter whether you put a red rosette on it or a blue rosette on it, Brexit is going to be bad for our country. People deserve, I believe, to have the choice to vote for a party that will say we should stop Brexit.\nAC: You and Labour are hitting each other into the low twenties and you're in danger between you of setting Johnson up for a winning position, where he then has a mandate for a hard Brexit.\nJS: I think that our politics and the public need a clear choice of a party that is unequivocally backing remaining in the European Union. The Liberal Democrats are that party.\nAC: Do you differentiate between Corbyn and Richard Burgon and Ian Lavery, and the Peter Kyles and the Phil Wilsons and the Anna Turleys?\nJS: I have a very positive working relationship with lots of Labour members of parliament, and indeed Chuka Umunna joined the Liberal Democrats. He has talked about how it was like gang warfare in the Labour Party and he is struck by how positive and welcoming it feels in the Lib Dems. I know there are many former Labour members and voters who have come to our party and I think there will be more. That includes people who are currently in parliament.\nAC: I see you at meetings of the People's Vote campaign. We're not going to get one without the Labour Party's support.\nJS: That is why we have to work cross-party. I think the Remain cause needs a very strong Liberal Democrats at the centre.\nAC: Do you think we'll see at the general election a bigger version of the Brecon by-election where parties stand down from each other?\nJS: My instinct is there will be some more of that. It's not new. At the last general election. We didn't stand in Brighton Pavilion against Caroline Lucas of the Greens and there have been various local arrangements. There will also be a lot more tactical voting. We have a broken voting system.\nAC: Johnson's not going to change it is he?\nJS: I think its days are numbered. You have a system which has been for so many years geared towards two main parties, but those parties do not work within the new landscape of political opinion.\nAC: From a purely selfish Liberal Democrat perspective, would it worry you if Jeremy Corbyn vanished and somebody more credible came in?\nJS: I'll certainly say there have been many times over the last couple of years when Jeremy Corbyn stood up at the despatch box and said something and then 20 minutes later Yvette Cooper is called from the backbenches and you just think, \"Yep, she's showing you how it's done.\" History is littered with what-ifs. What if those Labour MPs hadn't put Jeremy Corbyn on the ballot paper and somebody like Yvette had become leader of the opposition? We might have been - would have been - in very different territory. I think you'd have had a Labour Party that would have enthusiastically campaigned to Remain at the referendum in 2016, which I think might have meant you'd have had a different result given it was so close in the end and you'd certainly have had a different past three years in the aftermath.\nAC: Is that where a lot of your antipathy to Corbyn comes from, failing to campaign in the referendum?\nJS: Brexit is part of it. That Panorama documentary where you saw those staffers, young people... Instead of saying he would root out the anti-Semitism and going to war with anti-Semitism, he goes to war with the BBC and impugns the reputations of those former staffers. I do find that really troubling.\nAC: Does Corbyn not care? He does have a world view.\nJS: Does he care about anti-Semitism? That is the genuine question you are left asking.\nAC: You mentioned Caroline Lucas earlier. What do you think of her woman-only cabinet idea?\nJS: I'm a big fan of Caroline. We get on very well and we agree on a lot of things.\nAC: I can feel a \"but\" coming.\nJS: She made a contribution about how we work more cross-party, and I am a huge feminist, but I think men have something to offer the debate as well. There's the but. When I first entered parliament, women were about one in five MPs. Now it's up to about one in three. We've all had that experience of being the only woman in the room and knowing what that feels like to feel a bit different. There is a degree of shared sisterhood that is sometimes unspoken and silent but acknowledged.\nAC: What did you learn from losing, when you and your husband both lost on the same night?\nJS: Yeah, it wasn't a great day in our household, though when we had the vote to leave the EU it felt much worse. I was in the situation where most Lib Dem MPs lost their seats, most Scottish MPs lost their seats, so as a Scottish Lib Dem MP it helped not to take it too personally. Certainly, Duncan and I supported each other, but also our colleagues were in the same situation. There was a degree of shared experience about it. Obviously, it wasn't in the plan, losing, but I do think in some ways it ended up being positive, because you often learn more about yourself when things don't go well than when they do.\nAC: Now you're party leader, with the possibility of an election just around the corner, or a referendum, with a new baby as well...\nJS: You make things work. If I think about the state that our country is in, its actually because of Andrew and Gabriel that I'm really motivated as well. I took Andrew to the Extinction Rebellion protest. He's five-and-a-half. He can understand that. In Cornwall we went to the Eden Project, where they had some really good stuff about climate change in a way children can engage with and understand. I think that's important because the voice of young people in these debates is crucial. If we don't act now in the next decade, what future are we going to hand on to then? If we don't win this fight to stop Brexit, think of all the opportunities that they are not going to have that my generation and your generation had.\nAC: We're the same generation.\nJS: Yeah, obviously.\nAC: Me as a child of the Fifties, you as a child of the Eighties. What does it say about politics that Greta Thunberg has become such a symbol?\nJS: I think it's a positive thing and also a sign that things are broken. It is genuinely positive because young people should be listened to. I was the youngest MP when I was 25, 14 years ago. I kind of hated being called the baby of the house, but I always felt that we should have young people involved in politics. Often young people are quite patronised in politics, so I think it's fantastic Greta Thunberg is leading this fight, that the School Strikers For Climate are doing the same.\nAC: What do you think it says that so many people seem to want to do her in?\nJS: That is part of the way in which public debate is at the moment. I read this brilliant book last year called Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now.\nAC: You haven't done that.\nJS: I did pause for three months while I was on mat leave and it was lovely.\nAC: Didn't do anything at all?\nJS: There was one exception, a day in early December last year when there was lots of stuff that was going to happen on the Brexit vote and I thought I need to know what @BBCLauraK is saying. But, no. I didn't do any posting on Twitter or Insta for three months. It was very positive. The whole premise of the book is that the way the business model works is about getting our attention and then selling us stuff and manipulating us and that has negative impacts on our politics and the echo chambers have a negative impact on our debate.\nAC: But you need it for campaigning.\nJS: That's why I did it on mat leave, but as an active politician that is not very practical.\nAC: There is a lot of talk about anger. Should we not be a lot angrier over the state of our politics, the state of our government, the state of the world?\nJS: I think people should be a lot more active than they are. We are seeing more of that, because that anger can be channelled in a positive way. We saw it after Trump's election. Lots of people, women in particular, given what he had said about sexual assault. We did see elected a fantastic new generation of women. All is not lost. There is hope. People all have power. Some of us have more power than others. Some of us have more privilege and are better able through having more money, or a position, or a status, or influence. Everybody can do something; nobody is entirely powerless and if we work together, we can achieve a huge amount.\nSo much happened in the immediate aftermath of our interview that we spoke again at the end of a week in which Boris Johnson lost more Commons votes than Tony Blair did in his entire Premiership, and lost his brother Jo from the cabinet too.\nAC: The first part of our interview was the day you had the first meeting with Corbyn and the other leaders. You've had more. Has your assessment of him changed at all?\nJC: It is still frustrating, to be honest. There is not always the urgency I think there should be. But I think we got to the right place in resisting the calls for an election. I am not scared of an election but I believe the People's Vote is the way to resolve Brexit, on its own, not mixed up with everything else.\nAC: Who is more flakey on maybe falling into the trap of an election for their own reasons, Labour or the SNP?\nJS: It is complicated. There are lots of different motivations at play. We are working together on this at the moment, so I am not going to be overly critical. We had another call today and Anna Soubry, Caroline Lucas, Liz Saville-Roberts and I were absolutely clear: we should not be playing Johnson's game, letting him have an election on his terms just because he can't do the job. He was desperate for the job. He was going to get a great deal. He is not even trying. He has got to the hot seat and been shown up for what he is. It is not our job to help him.\nAC: Mrs Thatcher won a huge majority in 1983 on roughly the same share of the vote as Theresa May got in 2017 - because Labour and the SDP split the opposition vote. Do you not need to make sure there is a lot of tactical voting and arrangements maybe about who stands where?\nJS: We are very clear we want to stop Brexit and anyone who wants to stop Brexit should vote Lib Dem.\nAC: Even if it splits the vote in seats where only Labour or SNP might beat them and helps Johnson win?\nJS: On Brexit, it is not clear what a vote for Labour will mean. I have a lot of time for those people who have worked so hard to get them to a better position, but they are still talking about delivering Brexit and the only clear path against that is us.\nAC: But you accept the risk?\nJS: We did not stand against Caroline Lucas last time. There are discussions we are engaged in through Unite to Remain, but in the vast majority of places the best way to stop Brexit will be a Lib Dem vote.\nAC: Corbyn has moved on a referendum.\nJS: Kicking and screaming. He had the opportunity to lead the charge and failed to take it. We are going to be better funded, target more seats. It is very difficult to predict what will happen. This is a four-party election, if and when it comes. The Brexit Party is still a player.\nAC: We both agree a referendum is the best way to resolve this but do you see an election as inevitable now?\nJS: I think we are moving to an election, the question is whether it is in weeks or months. Once you have a government without a majority it can't hold that long. You could have an emergency government led by a grandee that could command support across the House. Currently the Labour leadership is not open to that but that might change.\nAC: Who was it who shouted \"sit down darling\" when you were speaking in the Commons?\nJS: I don't know. I didn't hear it, but was told afterwards. If I'd heard it, you'd have heard about it.\nRead Alastair Campbell's full interview with Jo Swinson in the November issue of GQ, out on 4 October.",

Our reputation for many years has been that of a Europhile party, and nearly all of our votes are aware of this fact. So too are the thousands of new members who joined after the referendum. To not vote against would not only be betraying party members, it would be betraying our voters too. After a bruising period in coalition in which we lost the trust of many of our members, I fear that retreating from our pro-European principles poses an existential threat to the party.",

Three and a half million EU citizens live in the UK but are not being given the guarantees of Rights which were promised by Boris Johnson in the 2016 referendum. Boris gives himself the right unilaterally to abolish the UK Board which will oversee the granting of rights. We must see how this problem works out during the next two weeks. On 29th MEPs, if they are satisfied, are scheduled to vote on Brexit or not.\nContinental MEPs say \"The new Withdrawal Agreement is a terrible \"deal\" for the UK. But if the UK wants it, that is okay.\"\nThe EU is basically trusting the UK to keep its word...on rights for a million UK Citizens living in EU and 3.5 million living in UK \"to live in the host country as they have chosen to do\". The WA given comprehensive guarantees for as long as they want. The UK must implement them. But there are still cases that have not been given papers and other are confused or have not yet applied despite having lived in the UK for forty years or more. We need a guarantee that the independent Monitoring Authority will be truly independent. The EU will monitor this closely.\nAfter the Transition the UK will be a Third Country and will have to negotiate a new way forward. Brussels sees a lack of long term guarantees by the UK government. If individual rights are guaranteed that will give a better basis for ongoing negotiations.\nThe EU says \"A physical document is necessary, London says an email with a pdf is enough. The Independent Monitoring Authority must be truly independent but Johnson has given himself powers to weaken it.\nIf and when Brexit happens, then there will be negotiations about trade with the EU. If the UK says it wants zero tariffs and zero barriers to trade, in return Brussels will say that there must be zero dumping and therefore very close alignment on social legislation. The EU wants a level playing field and no drain on skills.\nMaybe Brexit is a necessary trauma. Because of huge insularity at Westminster which is still uninformed about how the EU and international cooperation work. And the UK's constitution which is no longer fit for purpose. A German said to me : \"Brexit is the last act of the British Empire, when the British blow themselves up.\"\nThe UK system is broken. As another continental asked me before the general election : \"How is it possible in the UK that a prime minister who is unelected can advise a head of state who is also unelected to suspend a parliament which is only half-unelected?\"\nOther high-lights of the week:\nBreakfast with Commission vice-president Dombrovskis, for Economy and Employment. A Latvian, he was re-appointed and is very experienced in financial affairs. He said that the European economy is facing major transformations due to Climate Change, digitalisation, and its age-ing profile. Europe has had seven years of uninterrupted growth and unemployment is at record low levels, but there are still inequalities, the nature of jobs is changing, and the Green transformation.\nThe six-month Presidency of the Council of Ministers chaired by Croatia began. Its prime minister, speaking in the chamber, revealed he started his political career as a trainee in the European Parliament. In July Germany will take over from Croatia.\nClimate Change. It looks increasingly that the planet is near its Tipping Point. Next year the fires in Australia, Brazil, Siberia and California will be bigger because the planet's temperature is rising and we are still pumping more and more gases into the atmosphere.\n\"What we're talking about is a point of no return, when we might actually lose control of this system, and there is a significant risk that we're going to do this,\" said Will Steffen, a climate researcher with the Australian National University and co-author of the commentary. \"It's not going to be the same conditions with just a bit more heat or a bit more rainfall. It's a cascading process that gets out of control.\"\nTwo Leaders of Catalan independence arrived to take their seats as MEPs, having been elected last July but delayed by exile and court hearings in Madrid and the Europe's Supreme Court.\nAs UK MEPs leave at the end of January, 73 seats will be up for grabs: 27 of those seats will be re-distributed among 14 member states.\nThe new parliament will have an overall total of 705 MEPs (with one Catalan MEP not having yet taken his seat). The remaining 46 seats will be available for potential EU enlargements and for any possible future creation of transnational lists.\nMy forecast for the future?\nBoris will find himself torn between being at heart a European and his right-wing who will give him a horrible time. And it will serve him right. He is a softie, caring only about being loved for himself. The far-right never give up, Boris will eventually lose and be reviled as a failure.\nIt feels tragic that UK is closing itself off, cutting itself off outside decision-making and opportunities. Tragic for our young people.\nBest wishes,\nBill",

The report is likely to be nodded through by the Conservative majority. (The Cabinet is in fact comprised solely of Conservative Councillors).\nAnyone reading the Cabinet papers for Thursday will come to the clear conclusion that the consultation almost universally opposed the closure - and whilst we all recognise that updates and improvements are always needed - this can be done in a way that does not close homes. It is understood and acknowledged widely within the care sector that moving elderly and frail residents in care, places them at risk and directly leads to faster and higher mortality of those in care. A decision that leads to this outcome must be opposed.\nAccordingly, we are preparing plans for the decision to be Called-In to a Scrutiny Committee and will be forcing the Portfolio Holder and Senior Officers to answer questions in public.\nFurther, in the event that this fails to secure the necessary outcomes (and it is unlikely) we will seek to trigger the procedures for an emergency Council so that this dreadful decision is taken in plain sight with a named vote of all councillors.\nIf you feel able to support our opposition please do come on Thursday to Matlock for 1.15 to join the protest for the Cabinet meeting and I will keep you informed of the next stage of developments. We will be seeking to submit the petition that is comprised of signatures against this decision on Thursday as well.\nThe truth is that the Care Homes do not need to close to be renovated and brought up to modern standards. The way the renovations are being proposed is clumsy and poorly thought through. The Council have massively run down the Care Homes, and have ceased admissions leading to a huge exodus of highly trained and experienced staff making the provision of adequate services near impossible. This plan is about the Conservatives wanting to cut costs and reduce the size of the Council's public sector service provision for adult care. The next step will be the remaining 20 homes.\nThis is a closure plan driven by Conservative Party dogma supported and enabled by an unhealthy majority of 44 Conservative Councillors who dominate the Council. I can give my personal assurance that the Liberal Democrat Group wi consistently argue for County Council Care Home provision and will make the case for Derbyshire to continue to be a public sector market leader in this field. The Homes do not need to close.",

This is part of plans to increase support for parents and help encourage good behaviour to prevent problems developing later on.\nLikely topics covered in the classes will be how to promote positive behaviour with better communication and listening skills, how to manage conflicts, the importance of mothers and fathers working as a team, understanding the importance of boundaries and routines to children and firm, fair and consistent approaches to discipline as well as strengthening positive relationships in the family.\nCommenting, County Councillor Barrie Taylor said:\n\"The first few years of a child's life set the foundation for a healthy and successful future, but they can be the toughest period for parents.\n\"We should support parents during this time where they need help. These parenting classes can make a crucial difference because they give parents the skills to manage challenging situations, give their children clear and firm boundaries and help them understand the consequences of their actions.\n\"These classes will strengthen families and mean children are better behaved and can achieve more at school. At the same time, they will reduce the need for expensive support later on in life. It makes moral, social and economic sense.\"\nCommenting further, Sarah Teather said:\n\"I want to get rid of the stigma attached to asking for help. Parenting classes aren't just for struggling families with complex problems. All parents should know it's ok to ask for extra support and guidance when they need it - just as most do when they attend ante-natal classes before their child is born.\n\"Parents have one of the toughest and most important jobs, but unlike so many other areas of our lives, they don't get a training manual or a how-to guide.\"",

Sir Gerald Kaufman served this area extremely well and it will be both a challenge and an honour to fill his shoes.\n\"Manchester Gorton deserves a local champion to stand up for our community against Theresa May's hard Brexit plans, against the wishes of local people. Labour can't stand up for us whilst they're too busy arguing amongst themselves in Westminster and supporting the Tories on Brexit.\n\"Labour have also failed locally, just this week increasing council tax for Manchester's poorest residents by 22%. It is clear that Labour has been treating Manchester like a one-party state and has been taking it for granted for too long.\n\"It is also vital that Manchester Gorton has someone to stand up for local NHS services, and defends them from Tory cuts. This great area deserves better.\"\nUpdate 2:\nTony has mentioned this Manchester Evening News article in the comments and I thought it was worth putting in the main site just to show you how functional, together and united the local Labour Party in Gorton is.\nLast year a mammoth falling-out between different factions and personalities reached its zenith at a Levenshulme branch meeting. As with all things to do with Gorton CLP it can be difficult to get to the actual facts - but suffice to say the police were called in amid claims of vote-rigging, abuse and intimidation.\nA letter from regional office to the CLP at the time said allegations 'related to the conduct of Labour party members both during and outside of Labour party meetings', as well as to 'the conduct of members of the CLP executive committee in administering internal ballots'.\nIt had received complaints from members fearing for their safety, it added.\nIn contrast, the same paper observes in a different article that the Liberal Democrats are intent on giving Labour a run for their money in Gorton.",
