There was a good turnout on a beautiful sunny day. The event was opened by Elaine Aitken, Deputy Lieutenant for Edinburgh, and kicked off with some Scottish dancing. There was also a buffet, a bouncy castle and musical entertainment.\nJoanna said ‘thanks to my constituents at Oxgangs Neighbourhood Centre for inviting me to their Jubilee street party, and to the girls from the Mhairi Hogg School of Dancing for helping the community celebrate in traditional Scottish style’.",

Sadly due to Covid restrictions, I was unable to give the lecture in the Bute Docks at Cardiff but thanks to Cardiff University and a great local team in Edinburgh the event went ahead virtually. You can read the full text of my speech below.\nStands Scotland where it did?\nScotland's journey back to statehood\nJoanna Cherry QC MP delivers the Wales Governance Centre Annual lecture 27 November 2020\nClick the headings to read the different articles\nCardiff Lecture\nNoswaith dda.\nThank you for inviting me to give this lecture. My pleasure at being asked has been tempered slightly by not getting the added bonus of a visit to Cardiff and Wales. But I hope that’s something that can be addressed when this pandemic is over or at least under control. And it’s great to be speaking at the end of a week when finally there is light at the end of the tunnel thanks to the vaccines.\nMy last trip to Wales was to give the fraternal address at the Plaid Cymru Spring 2018 conference in Llangollen. I greatly enjoyed the warmth and hospitality of my welcome. My only regret was that I was shamed by Liz Saville Roberts announcing to the whole conference that on the road trip up from London I and her other Scottish passenger had marred her usually healthy living habits by introducing her to the delights of Greggs pasties at one of the service station stops.\nIt’s a great honour to be asked to give this speech. Since my election as an MP in 2015 I have benefited from the work of the centre and it’s been my pleasure to share platforms and select committee evidence sessions with Professors Richard Wynn Jones, Laura McAllister and Jo Hunt and to renew my acquaintance with Professor Daniel Wincott whom I first a long time ago when we were teenagers and he dated my best friend.\nAlthough Wales voted to leave and Scotland voted to remain a commonality of interest in defending our economies and our devolved settlements has brought us closer together since the Brexit referendum, but it has also accelerated the pressure for constitutional change in both our nations.\nAs the UK stands on the verge of leaving the Customs Union and the Single Market, we are still unclear about the future trading relationship with the EU. The Trump era has come to an end in America and Biden will be a very different President. What happens to the Northern Irish Protocol and the Good Friday Agreement could well determine whether or not Biden’s administration will entertain a trade deal with the UK.\nMany Democrats take the view that the UK Government is the last outpost of the Trump project.\nSeen from Scotland it certainly feels that way. The post Brexit landscape has accentuated our sense of political alienation from the concerns and projects of Westminster.\nAnd so, Scotland most certainly does not stand where she did. She is not so much at a crossroads as on a highway to independence. A couple of exits have been missed but the indicator is now on and I am confident that Scotland will take the next exit. The destination is not separatism or secession but a resumption of the statehood which was relinquished in 1707.\nHow things have changed\nOn 18 September 2014, 55% of those who voted in the independence referendum voted to remain part of the UK. During the last few days of the referendum the Better Together campaign suffered an almighty panic during which even Her Majesty the Queen was pressed into service to defend the union.\nTen days before the vote a sensational You gov poll put support for independence at 52%. It was the first time independence had been in the lead. This caused consternation. Two days before the referendum the leaders of the three main UK wide parties, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg personally pledged that a \"No\" vote would result in the swift delivery of \"Extensive new powers for the Scottish parliament”. Their pledge appeared as a Vow on front page of Scotland’s best-selling daily tabloid. \"This is solemn,\" it said. \"You can trust us.\"\nIt’s an amusing footnote to this episode that 4 years later the former editor who planned the famous front page announced his support for independence and is now the chief press officer for the SNP at Holyrood.\nBut back in 2014 he played an important role in ensuring a vote for the status quo on the understanding that there would be significantly more powers for Holyrood.\nNow, just over 6 years later, the very foundation of the devolved settlement between London and Edinburgh is under threat from the Internal Market Bill (IMB) and 14 consecutive opinion polls have put support for independence at 52% or over.\nOne poll which showed support at 58%, highlighted majority support among both men and women, people in all social class groups and every age group under 65.\nEven the staunchly unionist Times newspaper has recognised in a recent editorial that these successive polls having shown a majority of Scots in favour of an early referendum and that they cannot be ignored.\nSo Scotland most certainly does not stand where she did in 2014.\nWhat accounts for the increase in support for independence?\nSir John Curtice, has concluded that the UK Government’s pursuit of Brexit has undermined Scottish confidence in the Union and led to increased support for independence. His analysis shows that prior to the coronavirus the growth in support for independence occurred among those who were pro-EU.\nHe also found that voters in Scotland are now largely pessimistic about the consequences of Brexit but relatively optimistic about what independence would bring.\nAccording to Prof Curtice as at 31 January, Brexit day, support for independence in Scotland had edged up to 50 per cent.\nBut, the further rise in support since then has been as strong among Leave supporters as Remain voters and has come about as a result of public confidence in the Scottish Government’s handling of the Coronavirus crisis. The polls have shown that the Scottish public think the Edinburgh government and Nicola Sturgeon in particular have handled the pandemic well.\nThey take the opposite view in relation to the UK government and Boris Johnson’s handling of the pandemic.\nAnother very well-respected pollster, Mark Diffley, broadly agrees with Prof Curtice’s analysis. He says that while Brexit provided the initial impetus for the growth in support for independence;\n“The pandemic has given voters a daily reminder that the Scottish Government has the power to make decisions about the most important issues of the day, decisions that can diverge from those of the UK Government and that appears to have resonated with many voters both in their views of pandemic handling and, for some, their views on independence.”\nThese are the views of the pollsters – here are my thoughts\nIn a major speech to the Middle Temple earlier this month Sir John Major said the core change in the new Britain currently being forged is Brexit, albeit for a time it has been hidden behind Covid. I agree.\nThe UK that voters in the Independence Referendum of 2014 voted to remain part of no longer exists.\nThe socialist federalist UK promised to Scots by the unionist left seems even further away than it did 6 years ago. Labour have been all but wiped out in Scotland as a meaningful political force.\nAt last years’ General Election they suffered their worst UK wide defeat for decades.\nIt is hard to see how even a successful Starmer led Labour party can gain back the ground it lost in just one election.\nAfter 10 years of hamstrung Tory governments we are now looking at 10 years of majority government from a Tory party which has espoused such an extreme position that it no longer has room for the likes of Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve.\nThat Boris Johnson would be resident in number 10 seemed even more unlikely than Brexit during the 2014 independence referendum. And those of us who predicted these possibilities were scoffed at.\nThe victory of Johnson and his majority were made in England.\nIn Scotland the SNP rides high in the polls and keeps winning elections rather emphatically.\nWhilst one should never take anything for granted in politics we look set to do so again next year on a clear mandate to hold a second independence referendum.\nIn Scotland there is significant unfinished business from the first independence referendum. The cross-party pledge to create a different form of devolution made in the last 3 days of the campaign has never been delivered.\nFor all the promises of federalism or devo max the advent of a UK Government committed to delivering either is far away.\nThe present UK Government are dedicated to undermining the devolved settlement rather than strengthening and improving it.\nWhat Johnson said about devolution being a disaster and Tony Blair’s biggest mistake was simply the verbal acknowledgement of the hostility shown towards the devolved governments and parliaments during the Brexit process culminating in the Internal Market Bill.\nMy colleagues in the Scottish Government have looked on with envy while the concerns of the Irish Government are placed centre stage in Brussels, but Scotland is ignored or derided at Westminster.\nIt is instructive to review the course of events since Scotland voted to stay in the UK in Sept 2014.\n- In the May 2015 General Election Scotland elected 56 SNP MPs. Scotland only has 59. Yet when the Vow of more powers for the Scottish parliament came to be enacted in the Scotland Bill not one single amendment proposed by the SNP was accepted.\n- Then came the Brexit vote in June 2016. While it was won by a small margin across the UK, Scotland voted by 62% to remain. Northern Ireland by 55%. Yet in drawing up her negotiating red lines Theresa May gave no consideration to the fact that 2 out of the four constituent parts of the UK had voted to remain. There was no coalition building. No reaching out.\n- In December 2016 in the policy paper, Scotland’s Place in Europe, the Scottish Government put forward the idea of a differentiated deal for Scotland or a compromise for the whole of the United Kingdom. It was completely ignored by the UK Government who went on to cut the Scottish Government out of the Brexit negotiations completely.\n- To take just one example, the Scottish Government has been completely excluded from participation in negotiations regarding the future trade relationship despite massive implications for our expanding food and drink industry and for the fishing industry.\n- The Scottish Parliament voted—with the cross-party support of everyone apart from the Tories and one Liberal Democrat—to withhold consent to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, but that, too, was ignored.\n- The Sewell convention which provides that Westminster will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament has been repeatedly ignored throughout the Brexit process. And thanks to the decision of the UK Supreme Court in Miller 1 we now know that convention has no legal force to protect the devolved settlement despite its entrenchment in legislation.\n- When the Scottish Parliament tried to pass its own Legal Continuity Bill, dealing with the consequences of Brexit for devolved powers, it was challenged by the British Government in the UK Supreme Court, and while the hearing of the case was pending before the court, the Tories retrospectively changed the law in the House of Lords by amending the Withdrawal Bill to render large parts of the Continuity Bill ultra vires.\n- When those amendments came back from the Lords to the Commons, Scottish MPs got 19 minutes to debate their implications and all of the time was taken up by the Government Minister. That’s what prompted the SNP walkout of the Commons in June 2018.\n- The withdrawal from the EU proceeded in January of this year despite Scotland electing 48 SNP MPs at the December 2019 General Election and the opposition of all but 6 of Scotland’s 59 MPs.\n- And now we face the undermining of the devolved settlement in the IMB.\nUK Internal Market Bill\nAs well as breaking international law the powers which the UK Government seeks to give itself in the IMB constitute an unprecedented threat to powers of Scotland’s parliament.\nIt runs a coach and horses through the devolution settlement which Scots voted for by an overwhelming majority in 1997.\nIn October we marked the 20th anniversary of the death of Donald Dewar. He was Scotland’s first FM under Devolution and the architect of the scheme of devolution set out in the Scotland Act of 1998. If not specifically reserved, then a power is devolved.\nBut the IMB introduces a new principle into the devolution settlement by providing broad, cross cutting powers to allow UK ministers to enforce internal market provisions across devolved fields.\nClause 50 reserves state aid to Westminster after a dispute as to whether it was already reserved or devolved.\nClause 48 gives UK ministers wide powers to spend in devolved fields.\nchanging the previous assumption that they would spend only in reserved fields and that, with a few exceptions, financial transfers to the devolved administrations would go through the Block allocation governed by the Barnett Formula.\nFor this analysis I am indebted to Professor Michael Keating. Last week he told the Scottish Affairs Select Committee;\n“When were in the EU, the Scottish Parliament was subject to the very general provision that it must legislate within European law. That was a broad transversal principle that applied to everything. The IMB attempts to introduce that principle into UK law but without all the safeguards that exist in the European arrangement. Yes, in the EU there is such a broad provision that cuts across all kinds of fields, but it is subject to proportionality, subsidiarity, a community method of making policy, qualified majority voting and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. None of that is present here. This, to my mind, represents a major constitutional change. ‘\nMike Russell has described the IMB as a very subtle power grab. But power grab it is.\nHolyrood is NOT getting any new powers, but Westminster is getting sole control over state aid and in order to enforce the Internal Market UK Ministers are getting an explicit power to cut across decision making by the Scottish parliament in a whole range of devolved areas from education to building regulations.\nWhat we are seeing here is a rebalancing of the constitutional settlement in so far as devolution is concerned. The clear delineation of Donald Dewar’s scheme will go.\nThis is a very significant change some would say an undermining of the\ndevolved settlement which 75% voted for across party lines in 1997 referendum.\nIt certainly flies in the face of the promise of greater powers for the Scottish parliament which helped win indyref 2014 and on which Michael Gove and others doubled down during the Brexit referendum campaign.\nIt matters not that on 7 October all parties in the Scottish parliament apart from the Scottish Conservatives voted to reject the IMB. We know now that the Sewell convention is not worth the paper it was written on.\nSo the Brexit process has told Scottish voters a lot about the reality of devolution.\nIt has confirmed, if it were ever in doubt, that power devolved is power retained.\nAnd that the United Kingdom is not the Union of equals that we were told about during the 2014 independence referendum but a unitary state where devolved power is taken back to Westminster by executive fiat when convenient.\nWe now know that Scotland does not lead the UK but rather must follow where England wishes to go, whether we like it or not.\nAt a conference in London a couple of years ago I asked the former Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland, John Bruton, what he thought of Scotland’s treatment during the Brexit process. He said that Scotland’s marginalisation within the United Kingdom would not happen in the European Union, and that if the European Union were taking a decision as drastic as Brexit and it had only four nations in it, all four nations would need to agree\nIn the UK, however, it does not matter what Scotland and Northern Ireland say. They can always be overridden by the English vote. That is not an anti-English comment; it is a comment on the constitution of the United Kingdom.\nIf Scotland were a member state of the EU, even though we are a country of only 5.5 million people, we would have the same veto as Ireland over a major decision such as Brexit, in the same way that the the bigger countries have.\nWhen looked at that way the EU seems rather a more attractive future for Scotland than the UK.\nWhy not federalism?\nIt is true, of course, that the cavalier attitude of the UK Government towards devolution during the Brexit process has been experienced also in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nFor a long time in Northern Ireland the voice of the pro-EU majority was without expression at Westminster or Stormont while the attitude of the British ruling party towards the Good Friday Agreement was one of ignorance or insouciance.\nThe Scottish and Welsh governments have worked closely together to try to defend the interests of their devolved parliament and assembly but without much success.\nIn the north of England the intransigence of Westminster was experienced in the row over lockdown and furlough support. Andy Burnham, the major of Greater Manchester, said he was worried by the PM’s comments on devolution and that we live in a very London-centric country which is why it’s a divided country.\nAll this has prompted the usual suspects to start talking about federalism again.\nI have nothing against federalism.\nFederalism works well in Canada for example where the Provinces were in the room for the negotiations over the CETA trade agreement and the provinces run their own immigration programmes.\nBut although federalism is always discussed when support for Scottish independence is on the rise, I see little appetite for it across the UK.\nWhereas Scottish independence is a matter for the Scots by which I mean those living in Scotland. Federalising the UK is a project which requires support across the 4 nations. Only the Liberal Democrats have any sort of meaningful commitment to it as a policy and they are far from power at present.\nOne of my predecessors as an MP, Malcolm Rifkind, the MP for Edinburgh Pentlands from 1974 to 1997, said in 1975 that devolution should be a step towards federalism. However, when in office as Scottish Secretary he did not progress the case for either one jot. In fact quite the reverse. He was part of a Tory administration that turned its back resolutely on the desire in Scotland for devolution in the 80s and early 90s.\nHis recent rediscovery of the merits of an idea he flirted with 45 years ago lacks credibility. I did not think that Prof James Mitchell was harsh when he said that unless Sir Malcolm converts his party and provides a scheme and not a slogan his contribution should be treated with contempt.\nIn August 2014 at an event at the Edinburgh Book festival Gordon Brown said talks on extending devolution should begin the day after the referendum if the No side won and that within 2 years the UK would be a federal state. During that giddy summer he also promised that Labour proposals would move the UK as close to federalism as could happen in a country where 85% of it is comprised of one nation.\nNone of this has come to pass. There is good reason for the cynicism on the nationalist left in Scotland because federalism has promised many times but not delivered.\nIt will not be delivered now because there is no one in government who wants it. The constitutional direction of travel is the other way.\nFurthermore, as Ben Wray of Source Direct observed earlier this week, the increased desire for independence in Scotland is not just an expression of national identity but rather a desire to relocate power from London and to use that power differently.\nEveryone wants to build back better after the pandemic but Scotland needs to do so to our own design.\nFederalism would not allow Scotland to develop the sort of different economic direction that the independence movement wants.\nFederalism would not allow Scotland to get rid of Trident.\nFederalism would not allow Scotland to rejoin the EU.\nAnd in relation to re-joining the EU there is some urgency. The regulatory divergence which the UK Government seems determined to impose upon Scotland may make re-joining EU a more onerous process.\nIt has to be independence\nThat is why the focus of the debate in Scotland is about independence versus union and a second independence referendum.\nTiming\nThe British Government are pressing ahead with their constitutional priorities regardless of the pandemic and its economic fallout.\nWhilst the FM and Scot Government have rightly had their primary focus on the Covid crisis, Scotland cannot afford not to act to counter this agenda.\nRecently Gordon Brown chose to echo the words of T May by saying now is not the time.\nThe trouble is that for Scotland, British politicians telling us not now tends to mean not ever.\nTo those who parrot the words of our former and current FMs during the first independence referendum campaign that it was a once in a generation vote, I would say that that was then, and this is now.\nBesides what constitutes a generation in political terms?\nI’m a member of Generation X born between 1965 and 1980. The next generation is the Millennials born between 1981 and 1996. These are time spans of only 15 years.\nWith respect to devolution 18 years passed between the 1979 and 1997 referendums. So, rather longer than a generation. But we should remember that until Labour won the 1997 General Election Scotland’s renewed desire for devolution was ignored by the Tories for more than a decade. Something to bear in mind for those who say we don’t need a Plan B….\nFurthermore, the political events of the past 6 years have been more tumultuous than we normally experience in a generation.\nIn the years since 2014 we have lived through a number of political generations. The days of Cameron and Clegg feel like ancient history. Theresa May is now in the political wilderness together with a host of well-respected Tories who find themselves politically homeless. The Liberal Democrats who were part of the government until 2015 are now reduced to a rump with their latest leader but one ousted at the last General Election. The Corbyn era has come and gone. Britain has left the EU.\nOn the issue of sovereignty and Irish unity the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that the NI Secretary shall not allow a second border poll any earlier than 7 years before the previous poll.\nEven allowing for the very different context, if 7 years between referendums to leave the UK is acceptable for Northern Ireland why not for Scotland?\nIf the party or parties who have a clear commitment to a second indyref in their manifestos win the Scottish election next year then it would be a Trumpian denial of democracy for it not to happen.\nMechanism\nHowever, if ever any UK leader was capable of Trumpian behaviour then it is Boris Johnson. So, it makes sense for my party to think about what we should do in the event that the PM refuses to agree the means by which a second indyref can be held as David Cameron did with Alex Salmond in the Edinburgh Agreement of 2012.\nAt that time it was agreed that the power to hold a referendum would be transferred to the Scottish parliament under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998.\nA recent poll suggested that two thirds of voters want a fall-back strategy to secure a second independence vote if a section 30 order is refused this time round.\nBut there are some in my party who are very reluctant to contemplate the options in such a scenario.\nThey believe that to do so might detract from the pressure on the PM to do the right thing.\nTo them I say he’s not renowned for doing the right thing particularly when comes to Scotland.\nI understand the argument that his refusal to grant a section 30 order is unsustainable. Whether that is right remains to be seen.\nWhat worries me is that if we are waiting on good will and largesse from Boris Johnson it could be a very long wait\nNo Conservative and unionist PM wants to be the one on whose watch Scotland was lost. But it would be even more ignominious for Johnson because he is the author of the catalyst for independence – Brexit.\nFor now it’s a comforting thought that his position is unsustainable but it’s a hope at best and it is my belief that hope should not prevent us from looking at what leverage we have in the meantime\nIt should also be remembered that the capitulation of David Cameron and the signing of the Edinburgh Agreement came after protracted discussions. It was secured as the result of pressure that was irresistible not just because of the mandate the SNP won in 2011 but also because of the robust leadership and statecraft of the Salmond government.\nSome of the present reluctance to discuss alternative strategies comes from the absolutely correct view that the means by which independence is secured must be both democratic and legitimate in order that the outcome is internationally recognised. I agree and would add that a democratic and legitimate process is also necessary to bring the British Government to the negotiating table after the vote is won.\nA joint paper by the Scottish Centre for European Relations and the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung published earlier this week looked at EU Views of the UK post Brexit. The paper identifies a general expectation that the EU will be neutral in any future referendum in Scotland partly because of the state of EU-UK relations but also because the UK is now a third country and Scotland’s pro-EU stance has been noted. The common view is that provided Scotland becomes independent in a legally and constitutionally valid way, with agreement between London and Edinburgh, Scotland could have a normal accession process to the EU, although there is a high alertness to Spanish sensitivities.\nBut Scotland is not Catalonia. The UK is not Spain. There is nothing in the unwritten British constitution which prohibits Scotland from becoming independent.\nIndeed on the contrary. The British constitution has already shown it is flexible enough to permit an independence referendum for Scotland.\nPrior to the advent of devolution it was thought that a simple majority of pro-independence Scottish MPs would be sufficient to open negotiations on independence.\nThat is why some in my party have suggested using a Scottish election as a plebiscite if a section 30 order continues to be refused.\nThis raises the question of whether we should be so wedded to the idea of a referendum to deliver independence.\nEarlier this year I attended an entertaining lecture at the LSE entitled\nUnions and Their Break-ups: the UK's attempted secession from the EU, and its possible outcomes.\nIt was delivered by Brendan O’Leary, Lauder Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania.\nHis focus was on the domestic constitutional consequences of the UK’s secession from the EU.\nHe defined secession as “formal withdrawal from a central authority”. and he noted that most secessionist movements that have been successful have done so without any central role for a referendum.\nHowever the reality in Scotland is that we had a referendum in 2014 in which the result was No to independence and we need to demonstrate there has been a change of opinion.\nI asked the Professor what he thought we should do and he said he thought it would be very hard for the SNP to depart from its formal commitment to the idea that a referendum will be the mechanism, after we obtain a majority of MSPs, with or without allies, in the Scottish parliament as the trigger for that referendum.\nHowever, I would wish to emphasise that we should not assume that a legitimate referendum can occur only if Boris Johnson agrees to grant a section 30 order.\nIn 2012, before the Edinburgh Agreement was reached, 7 legal academics including 3 distinguished professors published a paper challenging the view that only Westminster has the legal authority to sanction an independence referendum.\nAgain recently Professor Aileen McHarg and her senior colleague, Chris and McCorkindale have reaffirmed this view and pointed out that\n“Although it is frequently asserted that a referendum on independence falls outwith devolved competence (as part of the reservation to Westminster of “the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England”, Scotland Act 1998, Schedule 5, Part 1, para 1(b)), that issue has never been conclusively settled”\nAidan O’Neill, the leading QC, who won the Article 50 revocation and prorogation cases, has produced a detailed opinion setting out the argument that Holyrood has the power to legislate to hold a referendum on the question of independence. He is advancing this argument in the case of Martin Keatings v Adv General for Scotland which is currently proceeding before the Court of Session in Edinburgh.\nOn Brexit day, earlier this year, Scotland’s FM, Nicola Sturgeon, gave a speech in which she considered this issue; She said, and I quote;\n“The issue of whether the specific constitutional reservation in the Scotland Act puts any form of independence referendum outside the powers of the Scottish Parliament – or instead leaves open scope for a non-binding consultative vote – has never been tested in court.\nThat means it cannot be said definitively that it would not be legal, but equally it cannot be described as being beyond legal doubt.\nIf a proposal for a referendum on that basis was brought forward it would be challenged in court.\nIf a court ruled that it was legal, it wouldn’t be a “wildcat referendum” as our opponents like to brand it – it would be within the power of the Scottish Parliament.\nShould the UK Government continue to deny Scotland’s right to choose, we may reach the point where this issue does have to be tested.\nI am not ruling that out.\nBut I also have to be frank. The outcome would be uncertain. There would be no guarantees.\nIt could move us forward – but equally it could set us back.\nSo my judgment at this stage is that we should use our energies differently.”\nShe went on to announce a Constitutional convention and policy papers neither of which have come to pass because of the pandemic.\nIt is my view that if the pro-independence referendum parties obtain a majority at the Scottish election next year and the PM refuses to come to the table to negotiate a second Edinburgh Agreement, the avenue which the FM contemplated earlier this year should be pursued.\nIt would require a carefully crafted bill to be piloted through Holyrood.\nThen, when the inevitable legal challenge came, it would be for the courts to decide whether the bill passed was within the competence of the Scottish parliament and, thus, whether the referendum so authorised could proceed. They would do so by a process of statutory interpretation. The case would undoubtedly end up in the UK Supreme Court.\nIf they found the bill to be within competence, then we would have a lawful referendum. And one which would be hard for unionists to boycott.\nIf we lost then I do not believe we would be any further back than the stalemate that will ensue if Boris Johnson digs his heels in.\nI would expect the UK Supreme Court and indeed Scotland’s Supreme Courts, to look to the wider constitutional context and to have some comments to make about a Government which does not allow a 2nd indyref when there is a clear electoral mandate in favour of one.\nI think it is unfortunate that the debate about the legitimacy of any Scottish vote for self-determination has become so focused on whether or not the UK government will grant a section 30 order.\nWhat this has meant is that we are discussing Scotland’s right to self-determination purely through the prism of a devolved settlement which is barely 20 years old. I believe that this sends out the wrong message at home and abroad.\nThe legislation governing the devolved settlement should not be the last word on whether Scotland can legitimately vote to secede from a union which is over 300 years old.\nThe nature of the UK is not always well understood internationally. I have found that when I explain to international audiences that the foundation of the UK is a Treaty of Union between two ancient sovereign states a penny drops. They realise that the SNP is not a movement for regional secession but for the resumption of a statehood which dates back to the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320.\nArticle 1 of the Treaty of Union states \"That the Two Kingdoms of Scotland and England, shall upon the 1st May next ensuing the date hereof, and forever after, be United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain.”\nHowever the Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland effecting their union in 1800 also included a provision that Great Britain and Ireland would on 1 January 1801 “and for ever after, be united into one kingdom”. Notwithstanding that provision, the union of Great Britain and Ireland came to an end on 6 December 1921 by a constitutional process.\nIt is therefore clear as a matter of UK constitutional law, that a union of the United Kingdom's constituent nations from time to time may be brought to an end by a constitutional process. This argument is being pursued by Aidan O’Neill QC in the Keatings’ case in relation to the central issue of whether the Scottish Parliament has the power to legislate for an independence referendum.\nIn my opinion it is a pity that this case has proceeded in the absence of the sort of carefully crafted bill from the Scottish Parliament that I would like to see. However full legal argument in the case is to be heard in January 2021 and its outcome could yet have repercussions for this debate and the strategy that I favour.\nConclusion\nIn a lecture to a Centre for Governance it is only right that I should focus on process. But before I conclude I want to be very clear that my party is not and should not be complacent about the polls which predict victory for us in next year’s election and in a second independence referendum.\nIt is policy and planning for the transition to independence and membership of the EU that will win the prize of independence. Once the independence campaign proper begins a searing focus will be turned upon our plans for the economy, trade relations with the rest of the UK and the process of re-joining the EU.\nIt is time to expedite publication of the “New Scotland’ policy papers promised by the FM on 31 January. These will provide the information and answers people want on how Scotland can make the transition from a Yes vote to becoming an independent country.\nI absolutely understand why work on these matters by the Scottish Government was paused to allow focus on the Covid crisis but if we are to have an independence referendum soon, this work must recommence.\nThe Tories haven’t halted their plans to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market or to undermine devolution so likewise the SNP should not halt its plans for independence.\nA huge amount of thinking about these matters has been done within our academic institutions and by think tanks and organisations such as SCER, the Common Weal, Business for Scotland and the Scottish Independence Convention. It needs to be pulled together and packaged for consumption by the voters.\nAnd finally, what will be the repercussions of Scotland’s journey back to statehood for the rest of the UK?\nI believe that Scottish Independence could be the catalyst for the sort of constitutional reform in England which is talked about by the chattering classes but for which governments seem to have no appetite. I say England because there is a very real question as to what rUK will consist of after Scotland resumes the status of an independent state.\nOnce more, I find myself in agreement with John Major who told the Middle Temple that Scotland will go first then Northern Ireland will follow and reunify with the rest of Ireland. But what of Wales? For this I defer to others….and maybe next year’s lecture!\nWild Cat or Illegal Referendums\nBoris Johnson’s stubborn refusal to grant Nicola Sturgeon’s request to hold an independence referendum has generated a lot of ill-informed commentary about ‘wildcat’ or ‘illegal’ referendums and misplaced comparisons with Catalonia. I would like to set the record straight.\nUnlike Spain, the UK is not a unitary state. The Act of Union is a treaty between two independent nation states, and it has always been widely recognised that if the majority of Scots wanted to resume their statehood that should happen. The British constitution contains no prohibition against this, whereas the Spanish constitution does.\nI have never advocated a wildcat or illegal referendum. It would be more than a little surprising if I had done so, given my legal background and that I spent a considerable amount of time last year successfully litigating to reverse the effects of unlawful action taken by the British Prime Minister in the prorogation case.\nLike most people, I would like to see a second independence referendum take place under the same circumstances as 2014 where there was a formal agreement between both Governments on the proper lawful basis for the referendum and an agreement to respect the result. However, this is dependent on the largesse of Boris Johnson. That worries me.\nNo Conservative and unionist Prime Minister wants Scotland to be lost on their watch. But it would be even more ignominious for Boris Johnson because he is the author of the catalyst for a second independence vote – Brexit.\nFor now, it’s a comforting thought that his position cannot be sustained in the long term, but this is at best a hope and I believe that this should not prevent us from looking at what leverage we have in the meantime.\nThe argument that the Scotland Act can be read in such a way as to allow for Holyrood to hold a legal referendum without consent from Westminster is well established and Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed the very real possibility of testing this in court.\nIn 2012, before the Edinburgh Agreement was reached, seven legal academics published a paper to that effect. Recently, one of them, Prof Aileen McHarg and her senior colleague, Chris McCorkindale have reaffirmed this view and pointed out that:\n“Although it is frequently asserted that a referendum on independence falls outwith devolved competence (as part of the reservation to Westminster of “the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England”, Scotland Act 1998, Schedule 5, Part 1, para 1(b)), that issue has never been conclusively settled”\nAidan O’Neill, the QC who lead for the winning sides in the Article 50 revocation case and the prorogation case has produced a detailed opinion setting out the arguments in favour of this view.\nIt is fair to say the legal academics who agree that the issue is not settled outweigh those who don’t.\nHowever, if the Scottish parliament were to pass a bill to hold an independence referendum, it is hard to see it not being the subject of a legal challenge. If not by the UK Government, then by a third party with an interest in seeing such a referendum halted, for example, the campaign organisation Scotland in Union.\nUnder section 33 of the Scotland Act within four weeks of passing a Bill, questions about whether it is within the competence of the Scottish Parliament can be referred to the Supreme Court for a ruling by, either the UK Government’s law officers the Advocate General for Scotland and the Attorney General or the Scottish Government’s law officer the Lord Advocate. So, the Scottish Government’s own law officer could choose to do this proactively and there is precedent for this course of action in cases which have been referred by the law officers in Wales and Northern Ireland.\nSo, there are several ways in which the matter could end up before the courts and I am quite sure that it would.\nIn that event, it would be for the courts to decide whether the bill was\nwithin the competence of the Scottish parliament and whether the referendum could proceed. They would do so by a process of statutory interpretation. If they found the bill to be within competence, then the legality of the referendum would be beyond doubt. If they did not then I do not believe we would be any further back than we are now and I would expect the UK Supreme Court might have some comments to make about a constitutional stalemate which does not allow a 2nd vote on independence when the Scottish Parliament has voted to hold one, the party that wants one keeps winning elections and polls show the majority of Scots are in favour of holding a vote and in favour of independence.\nThose of us who advocate this route do not do so because we see litigation as a magic bullet or a fast track to independence. It patently is not. Rather we believe that having Holyrood pass a bill to hold a referendum should be part of a multi-faceted strategy to move us away from the current impasse & stop the constant and unproductive talk about Section 30 orders & seeking “permission” to act from Westminster.\nAs the First Minister said in her recent speech central to our strategy will be providing clear answers to the questions asked by those who have yet to be convinced of the case for independence and building a broad coalition of support. Activists in the Yes movement have been working on this for years and the Scottish Government will soon publish policy papers. It is to be hoped that these and the Constitutional Convention announced by the First Minister can build on and consolidate the work of the Yes movement.\nConstitutional parallels with Ireland\nOver New Year I have been re-reading one of my favourite novels; Extraordinary Women by Compton Mackenzie. It’s a richly comic satire based on his and his wife’s experiences in lesbian society on the island of Capri where they lived during and after the first world war. Unfortunately, it’s out of print but if you can get hold of a copy, I highly recommend it.\nLike many of his fellow founders of the SNP, Compton Mackenzie was an intellectual and a free thinker. If he had not been prepared to question conventional beliefs and the status quo in the 1930s he would not have been able to envisage an independent Scotland.\nMembers of the SNP can rightly be proud of those who founded our party. If we look at the biographies of just a handful of Mackenzie’s fellow founders, we see writers and thinkers abound. Robert Cunningham Grahame, writer journalist and adventurer; Florence Marian McNeill, folklorist, writer and suffragist; and Andrew Dewar Gibb QC, Regius Professor of law at the University of Glasgow and Chairman of the Saltire Society.\nThese people were nationalists and internationalists who celebrated their country’s culture but also believed in vigorous debate and analysis.\nTo all those who have come since the goal of independence has often seemed insurmountable given the obstacles we have faced.\nNow as we enter 2021 our party rides high in the polls and support for independence is at unprecedented levels.\nWe would never have got this far had we and those who went before us not been prepared to be radical and to think outside the box.\nLike others who have been part of the struggle for most of their lives I am acutely aware of the length of time it has taken to get to the brink of realising our dream.\nIn 1980 at the age of 14, together with Ian Blackford and John Swinney, I was a founding member of the Edinburgh Branch of the Young Scottish Nationalists. A few years later, like Ian, I became disillusioned after the expulsion of the left wing radical 79 Group from the SNP and joined the Labour party. At that time this seemed the best way to combat Thatcher’s Britain. During my years as a Labour party member I became involved in the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly then Scotland United in 1992. By that time SNP and Labour party members were making common cause for a multi-option referendum; independence; devolution or the status quo.\nLabour abandoned that idea when they came to power in 1997 but kept faith with the demand for a devolved Parliament and delivered it, but only with the support of the SNP.\nThat support was not given lightly and secured only after a series of private meetings between Donald Dewar and Alex Salmond in which Alex secured a concession that nothing in the Scotland Act would preclude the people of Scotland from subsequently choosing an independent future.\nThis concession is recorded in Hansard during the second reading of the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Bill in the House of Commons on 21 May 1997, Donald Dewar said: “I should be the last to challenge the sovereignty of the people, or deny them the right to opt for any solution to the constitutional question they wished. For example, if they want to go for independence, I see no reason why they should not do so. In fact, if they want to, they should. I would be the first to accept that.”\nIn the same debate Alex Salmond went on to emphasise that “…the Claim of Right referred to the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine a form of Government best suited to their needs. It did not suggest that sovereignty resides with English Members of Parliament and that's the way it will stay.”\nDonald Dewar articulated the democratic norm which would later be enshrined in the Edinburgh Agreement. His concession laid the foundation for the 2014 referendum in recognising the rights of Scots to choose whether to remain part of our voluntary union with England\nI am wholly in agreement with the view that we must find a legal and constitutional way to demonstrate that public opinion in Scotland has changed since the 2014 referendum in order for our independence to be internationally recognised and therefore meaningful.\nI also agree that the easiest and best way to do that would be to replicate the Edinburgh Agreement entered into by Alex Salmond and David Cameron in 2012 by obtaining a section 30 order so that the Scottish parliament may hold a second independence referendum which will demonstrate irrefutably that the result of the first one has been reversed.\nBut what if Boris Johnson continues to refuse to co-operate?\nLast Sunday Andrew Marr asked Boris Johnson what democratic tools are available to Scottish voters who want Scotland to leave the UK. He put to the PM the case of the Scottish voter who wants another referendum but only has his vote to secure it and asked how he can do that. What, he said, is different from the English wanting to leave the EU and being allowed to have a referendum and Scots who want to leave the UK but not being allowed to have a referendum.\nThis is becoming known as the Marr question. And it’s a question which must also concern the SNP.\nIt is foolish and dangerous to rail against having a plan to do things differently, should it be required. Foolish, because it undermines the carefully achieved gains of our movement such as the concession Alex Salmond secured from Donald Dewar. Dangerous, because it reinforces the power of our adversary and cements in the minds of the international community that the only way Scotland can leave the UK and become independent legally and constitutionally is by replicating the 2014 referendum.\nThis is patently not true. One hundred years ago Irish independence came about not as a result of a referendum but as a result of a treaty negotiated between Irish parliamentarians and the British Government after nationalist MPs had won the majority of Irish seats in the 1918 general election and withdrawn to form a provisional government in Dublin. Whilst no one wants to replicate the violence that preceded those negotiations, the Treaty is in legal and constitutional terms a clear precedent which shows that a constituent part of the UK can leave and become independent by a process of negotiation after a majority of pro-independence MPs win an election in that constituent part.\nPrior to the advent of devolution, it was thought that a simple majority of pro-independence Scottish MPs would be sufficient to open negotiations on independence. Mrs Thatcher appeared to endorse this view in her memoirs.\nThat is why some have suggested using a Scottish election or indeed a further General Election as a plebiscite if a section 30 order continues to be refused.\nIt is short sighted to view the question of how we might lawfully end a consensual union of two sovereign nations which is over three hundred years old only through the prism of devolution which has been with us for barely two decades and is not the last word on the constitutional relationship between Scotland and England.\nOn 24 January a virtual SNP National Assembly will take place to discuss ‘the tactics and strategy on the route from here to Independence Day’. SNP Depute Leader Keith Brown is to be commended for securing this important discussion which is open to all party members and will be conducted in private.\nA recent opinion poll suggested that two thirds of voters want a fall-back strategy to secure a second independence vote if a section 30 order is refused this time round. That such a strategy is needed because it may be required is in fact a no brainer. In her speech of 31 January 2020, the FM was careful not to rule other routes out of the question. Others would do well to follow her lead.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_msps-hearing-evidence-on-gra-reform-may-be-guilty-of-confirmation-bias/content_229.html": "MSPs hearing evidence on GRA reform may be guilty of confirmation bias\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 03rd Jun 2022\nI am writing this column in Oxford where I have spent the last two days attending the celebrations surrounding a dear friend’s inaugural professorial lecture. It has been challenging for me because she is a social scientist working in the field of public health, which is outside of my professional comfort zone, but that is no bad thing. In fact, it has been a salutary reminder of the need for politicians to be humble and listen to people who know what they are talking about.\nIn her inaugural lecture, my friend, Professor Nina Hallowell, spoke about the challenges faced by contract researchers, the people who drive forward innovation yet face insecure and precarious contract conditions. This is particularly so for women because of the gender gap, which is currently 11.1% at the University of Oxford and 15.4% across the UK. Considering the Equal Pay Act was passed more than 50 years ago, this is nothing short of disgraceful.\nOn my second evening, I had dinner with graduate students from Nina’s college. Reuben College is Oxford’s newest college and while its premises in the old Radcliffe Science Library are being refurbished, visiting lectures take place next door at the University of Oxford Natural History Museum (below), where we were surrounded by dinosaur skeletons.\nDinner was preceded by a fascinating lecture on the role of Artificial Intelligence in drug discovery, delivered by Charlotte Deane, Professor of Structural Bioinformatics and former deputy chair of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Charlotte has been an outstanding pioneer for women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and it was a privilege to hear her speak.\nAfterwards, we were asked to debate and discuss the problem of bias in research and then one student from each table went up to the microphone to present a summary of our discussions. Charlotte was a member of SAGE, the UK Government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and during her lecture she had reminded us that one of the key takeaways from the Covid pandemic was that the immune systems of men and women are very different.\nThis prompted our table to talk about Caroline Criado Perez’s book Invisible Women, an expose of the data bias in a world designed for men. A good example of this gender data gap is that although heart disease is the No 1 killer of women in the US and Europe, women are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed if they have a heart attack in the UK, and more likely to die, because predictors of and indeed the symptoms of heart attacks are quite different in women – yet most of our data is based on studies of men.\nSuch revelations are a salutary reminder that sex really does matter. But my biggest takeaway from my couple of days of being a student again was the need for all of us, scientists, and politicians, to be conscious of avoiding bias in our work and to look at the evidence carefully before we reform law or policy. I was reminded of this again on Tuesday morning when I watched witnesses giving evidence to the Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee on the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill. They included representatives of For Women Scotland, the LGB Alliance, Keep Prisons Single Sex and the policy analysis collective Murray Blackburn MacKenzie.\nThese organisations have expressed concern about the proposal to allow anyone to obtain a gender recognition certificate without the need for any medical diagnosis, simply after three months of “living in their acquired gender’”. For doing so they have been wrongly condemned as transphobic.\nThe LGB Alliance, an organisation founded by veterans of the gay rights movement and former Stonewall stalwarts, has been accused of being a “hate group” for the sin of organising around the interests of same-sex-attracted people. Strangely, those who mete out such hyperbolic insults don’t seem to have the same problem with trans people organising separately in groups such as the Scottish Trans Alliance. The groups that gave evidence on Tuesday have also been among those expressing concern about shortcomings in the policy process leading up to the presentation of the bill in Parliament, the failure to engender an atmosphere conducive to a civilised public debate and the dismissal of concerns raised about the potential impact of the legislation on women and vulnerable young people. Disquiet about the legislation is not confined to the groups that gave evidence in Tuesday morning’s first session. The Children’s Commissioner has also raised serious concerns about aspects of the proposals and a lack of supporting evidence or research.\nIn addition, more than half of respondents to a Scottish Parliament survey on the bill said they opposed it. The survey, which generated an exceptionally high response rate with 10,800 individual responses, found 59% of people opposed the bill. More than 60% said that the Scottish Government should not remove the need for a medical diagnosis to obtain a gender recognition certificate. A similar figure felt that the period a person must live in their acquired gender should not be reduced from two years to three months.\nTuesday morning’s first session was extended by half an hour but it is clear that more time is needed to explore critical perspectives on the bill. We need more witnesses critical of self-ID to be heard. To take just one example of the shortcomings of balance in the oral evidence heard so far, an evidence session focusing on the impact of the bill on sport heard only from two men and there was no discussion of the asymmetric impact of self-ID on women’s rather than men’s sport, nor any acknowledgement of the reality that sport achieves inclusion through fairness by providing “protected” categories including age, sex and Paralympic classification. I am indebted to another independent researcher, Cathy Devine, for these insights.\nOne area where it is particularly important that critical voices are heard is in the field of data collection. Many esteemed social statisticians have submitted written evidence to the committee on the importance of accurate data collection based on sex as a separate category from gender identity. For example, Professor Alice Sullivan has submitted evidence pointing out that the 2004 Gender Recognition Act was not intended by legislators to have implications for data collection but it did. Inexplicably, she has not been called to give oral evidence. Instead, a man less qualified than her will do so.\nSuch omissions suggest that the committee may be guilty of confirmation bias, by favouring evidence that is consistent with the default position of the majority of MSPs on the committee which is to support self-ID. Fortunately, the committee has not yet announced its full oral evidence programme so there is still time to put this right.\nEarlier this week, a small group of independence activists based in Aberdeen issued a code of conduct calling for respect and tolerance in the debate on Scottish independence. It was dispiriting but not surprising to those of us who have had previous dealings with them to see some of the very people who sat on the panel which issued the declaration conducting themselves in anything but a respectful or tolerant manner within days of signing their “pledge”. Those who saw fit to retweet attacks on some of the witnesses who gave evidence during Tuesday’s first session based on their presumed English ethnicity, particularly those who did so from Twitter accounts seeming to be those of staffers to one of the MSPs on the committee, need to take a long, hard look at themselves.\nThe last thing the independence movement needs is this sort of behaviour. We could also do without being lectured about conduct by people whose own conduct is questionable to say the least. There is no substitute for open and civilised debate. Experience shows it is the best way to make good policy and law. Those who don’t understand that have a lot of growing up to do before they can make a meaningful contribution to the cause of improving our country, whether through independence or otherwise.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_use-cop-to-tell-world-about-our-yes-aims/content_28.html": "Of course we must use events like COP to tell world about our Yes aims\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 05th Nov 2021\nFor all the criticisms it has been very exciting to watch the world come to Glasgow this week to discuss the most pressing issue we face. Despite the best efforts of the UK Government, Scotland has not been side-lined. The FM has succeeded in attracting the attention of the world’s media, and grassroots initiatives from Scots have flourished on the fringes of the COP. It has been a reminder that Scotland has the potential to take our rightful place on the world stage, if only we think big and expand our horizons with confidence.\nAttempts to cause mischief by accusing the Scottish Government of hijacking the COP to spread the independence message were as predictable as they were pathetic, particularly after an interview given by the FM to Channel 4 news in which she emphasised that her focus at COP would be climate change, attracting ire from some sections of the Yes movement. A former SNP leader once advised me that a nationalist parliamentarian should never make a speech without mentioning independence. That is, after all, our raison d’etre. Certainly, when engaged in international diplomacy I think people would expect us to take any opportunity to impart our message even when the focus of discussions is elsewhere. So I am sure the FM will have taken the opportunity to press home her case in her one-to-one meetings with various heads of state. That is what diplomacy is about.\nA couple of weeks ago I attended a conference in Brussels organised by the Friends of Europe to look at the major issues facing Europe today. Climate Change was top of the list and Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken joined us by live link to talk about the imminent COP. I was the only Scottish delegate physically present at the event, and I can tell you that delegates from other countries were keen to know what is happening with our independence campaign. It’s not exactly a surprise to them that this is our mission. They are engaged and more positive than ever before.\nEfforts and initiatives in international diplomacy by our SNP Scottish Government and our SNP parliamentarians are vital to further the cause of independence. As I have previously argued, one aspect of this should be moving the narrative away from the so-called gold standard of a process laid down by a devolution statute barely twenty years old towards reminders of Scotland’s nationhood and previous statehood between 1320 and 1707. While we may be “a nation in waiting” for our independence, we must remind other nation states that Scotland is already a nation which was once a state and never merely a region.\nAs always it is deeds not words that count and a good example of the sort of outreach we need will be seen today on the fringes of the COP with events marking the culmination of an important series of initiatives in the Arctic and Nordic sphere by an SNP parliamentarian and his team.\nIn collaboration with the New York Times Climate Hub, a new Scottish start-up will be holding two sessions today with a focus on young voices. Renew the World aims is to change the way the world talks about and acts upon climate and is eager to help develop the ideas that will come out of COP this week.\nTheir first session will bring four young Scottish delegates together with educators, thinkers, and Arctic representatives to discuss transnational co-operation between Scottish and Arctic youth in order to renew trust and leadership for the polar region.\nThe Arctic has warmed three times as fast as the global average. Arctic sea ice acts as a huge white reflector at the top of the planet, bouncing some of the sun’s rays back into space, helping keep the Earth at an even temperature. As the sea ice melts there is less to reflect the rays, and more heat is absorbed by the ocean, magnifying the warming effect. Sea ice extent has declined 43% between 1979 and 2019. The Arctic also helps circulate the world's ocean currents, moving cold and warm water around the globe. As it melts, sea temperatures around the world change, affecting marine ecosystems and communities that rely on them.\nData from space is vital in monitoring the decline of sea ice and the European Space Agency’s Climate Change Initiative monitors space data on the Arctic from multiple satellite missions. I am proud that a number of organisations based in my constituency and across Edinburgh are involved in this work.\nAlpha Data in my constituency create technology for Earth Observation and work with a range of space sector partners including NASA. Another constituent, Daniel Smith, co-chairs Space Scotland’s Environmental Taskforce. Its initiatives include creating an accessible digital library of space data to help communities around the world plan climate action. Edinburgh-based companies Ecometrica and Space Intelligence also use satellite data to create world-leading forest protection and restoration programmes.\nThe Scottish Government has set out a policy framework for Scotland’s cooperation and partnership with the Arctic which includes a section on climate change: ‘Arctic Connections; Scotland’s Arctic Policy Framework’. It promotes Scotland as the European Gateway to the Arctic and was well received by our High North neighbours and hailed as a shining example for development of a policy framework in this field by the Polar Research and Policy Initiative Think Tank.\nDouglas Chapman MP has said the UK (and an independent Scotland) should have an Arctic ambassador to cover environment, energy and economic issues in that important region. This week Douglas has been in attendance at the Nordic Council in Copenhagen, furthering Scotland’s interests with some of our closest neighbours and in all things Nordic. Could Scotland become a member of the Nordic Council? There is a clear message here that while the UK pursues an insular post-Brexit policy Scotland is looking to forge alliances. Scotland wants to be a good global citizen and a co-operative and collaborative partner…so we certainly fit the model of a Nordic state in that respect.\nAnd, as we have seen from Lesley Riddoch’s excellent work with Nordic Horizons and her fantastic series of films about Iceland, the Faroes and Norway, there is much else to interest Scotland in the north as we move towards independence. This includes the rather different relationships Norway and Iceland have with the EU through membership of EFTA and EEA.\nBack at the COP the second event organised by Renew the World will centre round four young female delegates, one from each of the four constituent parts of the UK. They will discuss how to unlock the potential of young women to contribute to a just transition and examine the issues around gender equality and climate change. Their aim will be to find out how we can facilitate more women in leadership roles across all sectors from STEM to the creative arts and journalism, as part of a more equitable and speedier journey to net zero. They will be joined by scientists, businesswomen and Cabinet Secretary Kate Forbes MSP as well as young women working in clean energy from across the globe and a number of MPs including myself.\nThese events truly will be ‘the People’s COP’ we were promised. It is fantastic that they have sprung from here in Scotland and its more of this sort of action, and the diplomacy which can follow that we need in our journey towards independence. While the focus of these events is climate change, I would expect any SNP parliamentarian present to use appropriate opportunities to advance the cause of independence and to state clearly our mission to international partners.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_israel-must-follow-international-law-in-gaza-we-cannot-see-genocide/content_46.html": "Israel must follow international law in Gaza - we cannot see genocide\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 20th Oct 2023\n“The laws of war must guide Israel’s response to Hamas atrocity.” Not my words but those of a group of eminent Jewish lawyers in a letter to the Financial Times earlier this week. The group included former President of the UK Supreme court, Lord Neuberger, and Philippe Sands KC, one of the world’s foremost experts in international law. Their measured and scholarly letter is particularly impactful because they write as Jews with family and friends directly affected by the terrible crimes perpetrated by Hamas on 7 October.\nThree important points are made in this letter. First, the crimes of Hamas are crimes against humanity. The barbarity inflicted by them and the taking of hostages are war crimes. Second, under international law Israel has the right to respond and to defend itself and its citizens. Third, that response must be in accordance with international law and in particular the laws of war. “These laws apply irrespective of the level of outrageous conduct of an enemy and no exceptions to these rules can be derived from the level of sufferings caused by Hamas actions.”\nThe importance of the international community acting to make sure the laws of war are obeyed, and our collective moral and legal responsibility to avoid another genocide has been at the forefront of my mind after I participated in a delegation to Srebrenica earlier this month. The visit was organised by Remembering Srebrenica Scotland. I hope to write about it in more detail soon but for now what is important is the message of Srebrenica. Never again must the world stand aside while innocent civilians are tortured, raped, and murdered, and never again must the world stand aside while populations are deported or forcibly transferred or have imposed upon them deliberately conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.\nThe lessons of Srebrenica demand a humanitarian response to the suffering of both Israelis and Palestinians. We must resist the idea that collective punishment should be visited upon the Palestinian people for the crimes of Hamas. Whether that collective punishment consists of seemingly indiscriminate bombing or the restriction of water, food, fuel and electricity to Gaza or the order to 1.1 million Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate.\nAmnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross have both stated that Israel’s evacuation order is not compatible with international humanitarian law. Under international humanitarian law a temporary evacuation of a given area may only be carried out if it is absolutely necessary for civilians’ security or for imperative military reasons. For an evacuation to be lawful, Israel is obligated to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the evacuation it is calling for is effected with satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition and that members of the same family are not separated. Evacuees must be returned to their homes as soon as the hostilities cease.\nIsrael’s evacuation order, issued in the context of intense bombardment, and a tightening of its siege of Gaza including the cutting-off of electricity, water, and humanitarian assistance, is incompatible with these obligations. Amnesty International has therefore concluded that Gazans are being forcibly displaced. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has similarly stated that the evacuation order ‘combined with the imposition of a “complete siege” on Gaza may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians – in breach of international law.’\nIn relation to Israel’s restriction of food, fuel, water and electricity, the UN Human Rights Commissioner has said that ‘The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,’. Any restrictions on the movement of people and goods to implement a siege must be justified by military necessity or may otherwise amount to collective punishment.\nEven before these intensified restrictions, Amnesty International identified that Israel’s existing 16 year long illegal blockade of Gaza already amounted to collective punishment, which is a war crime. As the occupying power, Israel has a clear obligation under international law to ensure the basic needs of Gaza’s civilian population are met. The statement of Israel’s Energy Minister Israel Katz, that no ‘electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter [until the] abductees’ are free’ appears to be explicit confirmation that the Israeli authorities are punishing civilians in Gaza for the actions of Hamas, which they took no part in and had no control over.\nAt the UN on Wednesday the USA vetoed a security council resolution that would have called for “humanitarian pauses” to deliver lifesaving aid to Gaza. The UK abstained along with Russia. The US veto is in no way offset by the fact that Biden has persuaded the Egyptians to open the Rafa border crossing to aid convoys, access should also be given through the Israeli border and for humanitarian aid it should be unfettered.\nRussia is a strange bedfellow for the UK at the UN. The UK Government needs to remember that it has duties under international law including the obligation to prevent as well as punish acts of genocide under the UN Convention against Genocide. Genocide is defined as certain acts which are committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, racial, or religious group. Acts of genocide include killings, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction in whole or in part, birth prevention, or forcibly transferring children.\nAt Westminster on Tuesday, I chaired a briefing for MPs by representatives of humanitarian aid agencies on the ground. They are warning that we are in the era of atrocity prevention and currently have a short window of opportunity to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza. Given that Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defence minister has said “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything”, this is not an overstated concern. The agencies also say there must be unfettered humanitarian aid access. Israel must rescind the evacuation order, restore food, water, and power, and there must be a ceasefire.\nFinally, I have deliberately not commented on the deadly strike on the Al- Ahli hospital in this column. The jury is still out on who was responsible and there must be an independent investigation. Those who assumed at the outset that it was the responsibility of the IDF have come in for a lot of criticism. However, after days of seemingly indiscriminate bombing of densely populated civilian areas and the bombing of one of the civilian convoys heeding the Israeli warning to evacuate southwards, it is hardly surprising that people jumped to that conclusion. Moreover, the bombardment meant that about 1,000 people displaced by the Israeli government’s actions were sheltering in the hospital courtyard, hence the extent of the carnage. We need an immediate ceasefire, and the welfare of all innocent civilians must be the priority going forward. A land invasion in somewhere so densely populated would be an absolute massacre.",

Yet that is exactly what has happened.\nLast week, with less than 40 days of parliamentary time left before the deadline expires, MPs were reduced to hijacking the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) Bill to try to prevent the new Tory leader from proroguing parliament to ensure a no-deal Brexit — despite overwhelming opposition to that outcome. While the scale of the government’s subsequent defeat was significant, it does not mean that prorogation cannot happen; just that, if it does, parliament will have to sit for a minimum of five days in October, unless a Northern Ireland Executive has been formed.\nFurthermore, whether five days would be enough to stop no-deal from happening is debatable. If the withdrawal agreement cannot be passed, the only way to stop no deal is to mandate the UK government to seek a further extension, with revocation of Article 50 as a fallback position. While it is not clear that an act of parliament would be required, without one the decision to revoke might be open to legal challenge. To pass such an act, MPs would need to seize control of the order paper and get all stages of a bill through parliament. There is a further complication in that some believe a money resolution — necessary when a new bill proposes spending public money on something that hasn’t previously been authorised by an act of parliament — would be required for a revocation bill, and those are the responsibility of government.\nThere would be more time in hand to resolve these dilemmas if the Labour front bench had supported my motion to replace no deal with revocation as the default position back in April. Instead, the Labour whip recommendation was to abstain. In the event, 121 Labour MPs supported the motion. But, if the 104 who abstained had joined them, the motion would have had 295 votes and come out at the top of the pile of the indicative votes.\nThe evidence that no deal would be disastrous is overwhelming. Last week, the House of Commons select committee on Brexit published a report on “The consequences of ‘No Deal’ for UK business”. It states that crashing out of the EU without a deal would lead to “severe disruption of the economy, pose a fundamental risk to the competitiveness of key sectors . . . and put many jobs and livelihoods at risk.”\nThe report follows on from economic forecasts published by the Office for Budget Responsibility which found that Scotland and the UK would fall into recession next year if there was a no-deal exit.\nThe OBR also revealed that no deal could lead to a plunge in the value of the pound and leave a £30bn black hole in the public finances.\nIn Scotland, where the projected hit to gross domestic product in the event of no deal is 8 per cent, patience is wearing thin. Opinion polls show that support for independence is growing. When a recent Panelbase poll asked what would be better for Scotland, independence or staying in the UK under a no-deal Brexit, the result was 59 per cent for independence and only 41 per cent for no deal in the UK. When asked how they would actually vote in a second independence referendum faced with a no-deal Brexit, the majority for independence was smaller, at 52 per cent to 48 per cent. However, the direction of travel is clear. Perhaps most significantly, a majority of 51 per cent are now in favour of a second independence referendum either while the UK is still negotiating to leave the EU or once it has finished the negotiations.\nIt was a cross-party group of Scottish parliamentarians who, together with the barrister Jolyon Maugham, secured the ruling by the European Court of Justice that Article 50 could be revoked unilaterally. Next week, a cross-party group led by Scottish and Welsh parliamentarians will raise a further action in the Scottish courts to prevent the prorogation of parliament by an incoming prime minister. If we succeed, this will guarantee more time to resolve the dilemma of how to prevent no deal.\nJoanna Cherry QC MP",

Tories lecturing the rest of us about how the civil liberties cost of vaccine passports are worth paying because we are not in ‘normal times’ when they won’t even wear a mask. Asylum seekers giving harrowing evidence before the human rights committee about their journeys to the UK while Priti Patel announced plans for Border Force to turn back refugee vessels in the channel, despite the dangers and the potential breach of maritime law. And, at Scottish questions, it was the usual yah boo sucks carry on while SNP MPs tried in vain to get answers to major questions such as what the UK Government can do to assist in the fight to reverse the terrible toll of drug deaths in Scotland, and what they can do to facilitate a ferry link from Rosyth to the continent.\nI was going to write about the woeful debate that took place on Boris Johnson’s so-called plans for funding social care and the NHS, but it would be impossible to better what Lesley Riddoch had to say in her column yesterday. The debate on these proposals at Westminster was peremptory, although Alison Thewliss made an excellent contribution exploring some of the real issues. While it seems England is incapable of having the debate that is needed about this important problem, Scotland must have it. As Lesley argued, an exhortation to “get your mitts off our NHS” simply won’t cut it. What Scotland needs is a visionary radical challenge to Boris Johnson’ plans.\nWe need an informed debate about what we want by way of social care, and how we fund it. Yes, we are ahead of the game in having free personal care but it’s the ‘hotel’ costs of care home accommodation which are astronomical. How to fund this is a very difficult challenge and we need to make sure that the ambitious plans for a National Care Service don’t end in failure or in being watered down. This is a difficult issue to solve and we need to drag the problems out into the open and talk about them.\nSoundbites are not enough. Indeed sometimes they can be counter-productive if they don’t hit the mark. Johnson’s plans are not a new poll tax. Calling it that is not helpful and detracts from what is really going on here. This is not a properly thought through plan for social care at all. It’s a cynical attempt to balance the books of England’s NHS on the backs of the working poor and small business while letting those with unearned income off the hoo,k and it completely dodges the challenge of how we fund and manage social care in the future.\nOf course, the Tories voted for this despite a few noises off because, ultimately, they are all about protecting their mates and their own backs. Those with most influence on the Tory party have a lot, and I mean a lot, of unearned income and their support and their donations keeps the whole boat afloat regardless of whatever so called red wall Tories might have promised their working-class voters.\nIn this sham of a social care policy we see clearly what’s wrong with Boris Johnson’s government. Protecting vested interests, making policy on the hoof with cynical sleight of hand and rushing decisions through to frustrate proper scrutiny and debate.\nThere was another classic example of this earlier this week with the second reading of the Elections Bill on day one of the new term. Much of the opposition to this bill has rightly focused on concern about the introduction of Voter ID and the impact this might have on disenfranchising already marginalised groups in our society including the disabled, the elderly and BAME and gypsy and traveller communities. The Government have produced no evidence of a real problem with voter impersonation, so it is hard to see why this change in practice is required. Many opposition MPs argued that it’s a deliberate Trumpian ploy by the Tories to make sure the sort of communities who don’t vote for them anyway are less likely to vote. But I wondered if it’s a little more sophisticated and cynical than just that. I suspect the totemic issue of Voter ID is there not to just to benefit the Tories but to distract us from the rest of the bill – both what is there and what is missing that should be there. This Bill plans to give the Government more power over electoral regulation than it has ever had before while at the same time doing nothing to regulate the shadowy groups with anonymous sources of cash that have successfully sought to influence British politics.\nThe Electoral Commission, the independent body that is supposed to scrutinise and adjudicate on the fairness of elections, is to be put directly under the control of Government who will now set its policies and direction. A committee under the direction of the Speaker is the primary mechanism through which the Electoral Commission is accountable to parliament but, for the first time ever in its history, this committee now has a majority of Government MPS. So it seems likely the Electoral Commission, already found wanting over the Brexit referendum fiasco, is to be even further emasculated.\nAt the same time, the bill takes no steps whatsoever to close the loophole in electoral law that allows unincorporated associations to mask the ultimate source of the funds they donate which may include foreign entities of dubious provenance trying to influence politics in the UK. These groups are not listed at Companies House which means that their financial backers can remain anonymous.\nOpen Democracy recently revealed that since 2019 the tory party has accepted £2.6 million in donations from such groups. Thanks also to Open Democracy we know that the Scottish Tory surge in 2016 was in part funded by such ‘dark money’. And, as SNP MPs told parliament, sometimes this stuff is hiding in plain sight with big donors to the Tory party in 2019, including the household of a former Putin Minister, only eight months after the Salisbury poisoning which killed a British citizen, and a weapons dealer and gunrunner who was a personal friend of the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad.\nOn 7 July the Committee on Standards in Public Life published a report suggesting practical steps to modernise and streamline the way in which donations and spending are reported, regulated and enforced. They made 47 recommendations including that political donors should have to be on the UK’s electoral register, greater checks to identify the original source of funds and new rules on donations from businesses to make it harder for overseas donors to anonymously give through shell companies to political campaigns. When I raised with the Minister which of the recommendations she would include in the bill by way of Government amendment she was unable to name a single one.\nIt seems the Elections bill has been carefully tailored to serve the interests of this government rather than democracy. In taking the hammer of Voter ID to crack the nut of the problem of impersonation, this government don’t mind risking voter suppression because those most likely to be suppressed – the already marginalised and dispossessed - don’t vote for them. It is very dangerous for a democracy to pass measures which could have the effect of silencing or marginalising those who seek to challenge the ruling orthodoxy. And its reprehensible to do so while at the same time failing to tackle those who really are subverting our democracy with dark money and hidden donations.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_twitter-risk-failing-to-protect-free-speech/content_298.html": "Twitter must act or risk failing to protect free speech\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 21st Jan 2022\nIt is tempting to write about the Tories’ troubles for a second week running. Instead, I will simply reiterate my warning that independence supporters should not get too fixated on who leads the Tory party or indeed the Government of the UK. It is arguments and policies that will win independence, not personalities. And much as Boris Johnson is described as the best recruiting sergeant our cause has, John Curtice sounded an important caveat this week when he pointed out that this has not, as yet, been borne out in the polls, so far as support for independence is concerned. There is no substitute for the hard work required to put the meat on the bones of the case for indy and to devise a delivery strategy that will work.\nThat said, the shenanigans at Westminster this week have been all about equality before the law or rather the perceived lack of it where Johnson and his cronies are concerned. It is a very important principle that should be upheld across our public life and no more so than in the public forum where issues are debated, including social media.\nLast week parliament debated a report on the Draft Online Safety Bill. The aim of the bill is to establish a new regulatory framework to tackle harmful online content and to mitigate the risks presented by content and activity on social media and other online platforms. The harms needing to be tackled range from extreme pornography to eliminating paid-for advertising used to perpetrate frauds and scams which have led to the victims losing their life savings, their homes and sometimes even taking their own lives.\nIt’s a very substantial bill and so the UK government have produced it as a draft to enable pre-legislative scrutiny. The committee that reported on the bill was a joint committee of MPs and Peers who spent weeks taking evidence on and considering the bill. Their report like the bill, is a long read.\nThe bill starts from the premise that self-regulation of online services has failed and that the companies who make huge profits from the online platforms they provide should be held liable for harms perpetrated by the systems they have created. The committee agree and have produced a list of recommendations to strengthen what they call “two core principles of responsible internet governance; that online services should be held accountable for the design and operation of their systems; and that regulation should be governed by a democratic legislature and an independent regulator – not Silicon Valley.”\nOnline service providers like Twitter have their own content moderation policies but from my own experience and my work on the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) it has become apparent that these policies are flawed and not applied fairly or effectively.\nCodes of conduct only work if there is proper oversight and enforcement. For example, it is common for political parties to stipulate that members should not attack other members in public whether in the newspapers or social media. However, anyone who uses Twitter can see that rule being breached regularly. Indeed, the behaviour of some politicians on social media has got so bad that the Westminster’s standards committee has recommended that MPs should be prohibited “from subjecting anyone to unreasonable and excessive personal attacks” in any medium. Apparently, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner wants to be given the power to investigate social media posts as she has been receiving increasing complaints from the public about what MPs say online.\nAs someone who has been the subject of unreasonable and excessive personal attacks from other politicians, I have some sympathy with these recommendations. My experience has been that when a target is put on one’s back by persons in positions of responsibility, it can encourage further attacks by social media users who view that content as a green light to issue abuse and threats, often of a criminal nature. If political parties won’t act to enforce their own codes of conduct, then it is understandable that parliament should consider taking steps to do so otherwise the world of politics will be brought into further disrepute.\nLikewise, if online service providers won’t moderate their content fairly or reasonably, then then it seems reasonable that parliament puts in place an independent regulator to do so.\nSo far so good, but a number of commentators have expressed a note of caution about the aims of the Online Safety bill and its potential impact on freedom of speech online. The campaign group Big Brother Watch have drawn attention to the tendency of social media companies to censor views and delete accounts haphazardly, often in response to partisan campaigns and orchestrated complaints rather than rule breaches. Big Brother Watch (BBW) fear that the Online Safety Bill will force social media companies to monitor and censor social networks more than ever and that it will be disastrous for free expression online because the UK Government is seeking to clamp down on vaguely defined categories of what should be lawful speech. The fear is that this will result in the silencing of marginalised voices and unpopular views.\nTwo years of research carried out by BBW unearthed many examples of the online censorship of marginalised groups particularly in feminist debates but also in the wider political debate. For example, Twitter recently removed the grassroots “Kill the Bill” campaign – paradoxically a campaign to protect freedom of expression from the curbs on the right to protest in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. No explanation was given for the suspension of the campaign group’s account and when they set up a new account it was also shut down. It was only after BBW complained to Twitter that the accounts were reinstated.\nThe BBW research bears out my experience of dealing with Twitter in the course of my work on the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR). Two and half years ago I grilled a Twitter executive about the way in which they enforce their hateful conduct policy. I put to her a number of cases where Twitter had ruled that threatening tweets incorporating violent imagery aimed at women were acceptable and contrasted that with numerous examples of them suspending the accounts of women who had tweeted factual statements about statistics on male violence and sexual crime. I suggested to her that part of the reason for this manifestly discriminatory approach is that Twitter does not include “sex” as a protected characteristic within its hateful conduct policy and therefore does not take hate directed at women seriously while it polices the speech of women rather over-assiduously.\nAs if to prove my point my intervention led to a tsunami of tweets directed at me containing violent images and threats of violence. Many of these are still visible on Twitter. After this the JCHR recommended that Twitter include “sex’ as protected characteristic in their hateful conduct policy reflecting its protection in the domestic law of the UK under the Equality Act. Twitter have yet to act upon that recommendation and they continue to delete tweets and ban users for stating facts about science, statistics reflecting the profile of sex offenders and other statements which might fall within the category of “gender critical beliefs’ despite it now being clearly established in law that such beliefs are also protected under the Equality Act.\nTwitter thinks it is above the domestic law of the UK when it comes to discrimination and if the Online Safety Bill does not close the purported loopholes which Twitter, and others, are currently using to ignore anti-discrimination law, it will have failed in its duty to protect free speech.\nThe Joint Committee who scrutinised the draft Bill say that their recommendations will protect Freedom of Speech online and that service providers will no longer be able to selectively censor without accountability. I am not so sure. The debate in parliament did not focus on free speech concerns or the discriminatory approach to moderation of platforms such as Twitter. When the final Online Safety bill comes before parliament, I will be looking at it carefully with a view to tabling amendments designed to ensure that online regulation does not breach important human rights including freedom of thought and belief, freedom of expression and the right not to be discriminated against. I also intend to pursue my concerns with Twitter, in particular the basis upon which they think its ok for them to operate in the UK while ignoring domestic anti-discrimination law.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_answers-to-rise-in-knife-crime-look-to-scotland/content_109.html": "Joanna Cherry: To find answers to the rise in knife crime, look to Scotland\nThis article first appeared in The House magazine on 18th May 2018.\nDeath or assault with a knife leaves a scar not just on the victim, but on family, friends, neighbours and the wider community. Homicides, such as the stabbing of Bailey Gwynne at an Aberdeen school in October 2015, create a national sense of shock and profound loss.\nBut despite such a recent tragedy, knife crime in Scotland has plummeted over the last decade and, given the recent spate of stabbings in London, it is understandable that police, politicians and healthcare professionals are now looking to Scotland for a solution to their problem.\nA decade ago Scotland, and Glasgow in particular, had a serious problem with knife crime. In 2004-05 there were 40 murders in Glasgow, more than a third of the total Scottish homicide rate, earning Glasgow the inglorious title of the murder capital of western Europe.\nDuring that time, I served as crown counsel (a high court prosecutor in Scotland) and came face-to-face with the problem on a daily basis. The then Strathclyde police force (now part of Police Scotland) launched a new strategy in response to the epidemic of knife crime.\nA new holistic approach saw the formation of the violence reduction unit (VRU) which sought to treat violent crime as a public health and social problem.\nBy treating violence like a disease, the VRU sought to diagnose the problem, analyse the causes, examine what works and for whom, and develop solutions which, once evaluated, could be scaled up to help others.\nThe VRU works with other agencies like health, education and social work to create lasting attitudinal change in society rather than a quick fix. The now national unit receives long-term stable funding from the Scottish government in order to provide a centre of expertise on tackling violent crime.\nIn 2008, Scotland’s first SNP government sought to significantly change justice policy and focus towards prevention and inclusion. Scotland’s whole system approach (WSA) to young people at risk of offending marked a shift away from previous policies which increasingly sought to criminalise, label and stigmatise young people, such as asbos, and to move towards a policy whose aim was to provide early and effective interventions which kept young people out of formalised justice settings.\nThis work focuses on collaborative approaches between schools, social work, the police, the prosecution service and the third sector in order to reduce offending behaviour. Much of this work was informed by the Edinburgh Study on Youth Transitions and Crime by Professors McAra and McVie.\nIn addition to the VRU, the Scottish government also has a Centre for Youth and Criminal Justice at Strathclyde University (CYCJ) which is dedicated to supporting improvements in youth justice and works to provide knowledge exchange, practice development for professionals working with young people, and research on youth justice issues.\nCrime in Scotland is at its lowest level in 43 years and crimes of handling an offensive weapon have decreased 64% between 2007-08 and 2016-17. The number of under-18s in custody has reduced by 77% and there has been an 82% reduction in children referred to children’s hearings on offence grounds. The children’s hearings system is Scotland’s unique care and justice system for children and young people. It aims to ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable children and young people through a decision-making lay tribunal called the children’s panel.\nTackling violent crime remains a key priority. Since 2007, the Scottish government has invested over £14m in violence reduction programmes for young people. The No Knives, Better Lives youth engagement programme has received over £3.4m funding since 2009, with 24 of Scotland’s 32 local authorities now involved.\nNo Knives, Better Lives is a national initiative which works with local organisations to provide information and support. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the consequences of carrying a knife and provides information and educational materials for use in schools and by other professionals, as well as health advertising campaigns and information on local activities and opportunities for young people. Research suggests that educational work has been particularly effective in making a difference.\nI am pleased that Scotland’s experience is now being shared across the UK, with Met commissioner Cressida Dick visiting Glasgow and the VRU to explore what lessons can be learned.\nThe solicitor general for England and Wales, Robert Buckland QC, has accepted my invitation to come to Scotland to hear more about the whole system approach from the perspective of the prosecution service, particularly diversion from prosecution and our early and effective intervention model.\nHowever, we are not complacent and the work continues to reduce levels of violent crime.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_scottish-independence-and-drug-consumption-rooms/content_164.html": "Why only independence will let us tackle this major issue\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 30th Oct 2020\nLast weekend, you may have noticed people tweeting with the hashtag #IstandwithPeterKrykant. Peter Krykant is a community activist who has been operating a converted minibus as a safe place for drug addicts to inject in Glasgow since August. He has received support from medical students and the former MP Paul Sweeney. But last weekend he was charged with an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act.\nI have to be careful what I say because I would not wish to be seen as seeking to influence the police or the Crown in respect of the prosecution of a particular individual but many people believe that the work Mr Krykant is doing reduces harm and saves lives and that he should be allowed to continue with it.\nIn 2018 there were 1,187 drug-related deaths in Scotland – the highest since records began. Each death is a personal tragedy for the victims, their families and friends. It is also is a public health emergency which requires drastic action.\nSafe drug consumption rooms (DCRs) have been proposed by Glasgow’s Health and Social Care Partnership and have the unanimous backing of Glasgow City Council. A majority of cross party MSPs and many MPs also support their use. My friend and colleague, Ronnie Cowan, MP for Inverclyde, has been a dogged campaigner for drug policy reform since he was first elected to Westminster in 2015. Ronnie has visited Mr Krykant’s facility and spoken powerfully of the international success of safe DCRs in countries like Portugal where their introduction has resulted in a drastic reduction in drug deaths. The work of Ronnie and others has been instrumental in putting a public health approach at the heart of SNP policy with DCRs integral to the approach.\nThe problem is that technically at least there is a risk that such facilities may be illegal under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the subject matter of which is specifically reserved to Westminster under the Scotland Act, Schedule 5. This means that legislation at Westminster would be required to put DCRs on a firm legal footing. In April 2018 Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, introduced a Private Members’ Bill aimed at legalising DCRs. As well as wishing to help addicts, Alison is acutely conscious of the health and safety risks posed to her constituents, particularly children, by needles being discarded in public places. Sadly, like most private members bills hers did not progress into law.\nLast year, under the chairmanship of Pete Wishart, MP for Perth and Kinross, Westminster’s Scottish Affairs Committee carried out one of the most extensive drug enquiries that have ever been conducted in Scotland. Their recommendations included substantial reform of the Misuse of Drugs Act including the decriminalisation of small amounts of drugs for personal use and, and the piloting of a safe consumption room in Glasgow. These conclusions were rejected by the Home Office. However, they were supported by SNP conference and appeared in the SNP manifesto for the General Election.\nCurrently Tommy Sheppard, MP for Edinburgh East, is pursuing another private members bill reflecting the recommendations of the Scottish Affairs Committee including provision for safe drug consumption facilities and decriminalisation as well as reviewing the effects of welfare sanctions on drug users and amending the Equality Act 2010 to recognise drug dependence as a health condition. Unfortunately, due to the Tory majority at Westminster, Tommy’s bill has even less chance of success than the bill pursued by Alison in the last parliament.\nNot surprisingly many are frustrated by the Westminster route and have argued that Scotland should take the law into its own hands. The CEO of the Scottish Drugs Form David Liddell has said: “We’ve got a crisis in Scotland… we shouldn’t wait for the home secretary in Westminster.”\nMichael Gray, trainee lawyer and journalist with the Skotia, has argued that the Scottish parliament could pursue a more assertive strategy pushing the legal boundaries of what can be done under devolution and exploiting grey areas in the Scotland Act. He argues that such action should be pursued to help those suffering most in our society pending a second independence referendum and that if it fails it simply strengthens the case for independence.\nIn theory, provided a Government bill has the support of the Lord Advocate or, in respect of other bills, the presiding officer, Holyrood can pass it and it will become law unless there is a legal challenge. A challenge could be brought by anyone with a legitimate interest but to date the UK Government has only challenged a Scottish Parliament bill once when they challenged The UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill in 2018. The challenge was successful largely due to retrospective amendments to another bill made in the House of Lords. Isn’t British democracy glorious?\nMichael Gray argues that in other parts of the world federal or non-sovereign parliaments commonly test the limits of their powers in courts. Regular readers of this column won’t be surprised that I am in sympathy with Michael’s approach. I am on the record as supporting a Holyrood bill to hold a second independence referendum if Boris Johnson continues to refuse a section 30 order. However, there is a big difference. The question of whether Holyrood has the power to hold a referendum is a grey area. There is a respectable body of legal opinion that it may well have the competence to pass such a bill because the Scotland Act is not clear on this point. In contrast, so far as the Misuse of Drugs Act is concerned, it’s quite clear that it is a reserved matter and if it requires to be reformed to enable DCRs to operate then it seems to me Holyrood legislation is a non-starter. It is possible there might be an ingenious way around this problem, but I have yet to see the argument made.\nSo I have come reluctantly to the same conclusion that my colleagues on the Scottish Affairs Committee reached – the British Government must act to devolve drug policy and the ability to reform the Misuse of Drugs Act to Holyrood, before DCRs can be put on a firm legal footing. What are the chances they will do so? Nil at present. Their attitude was exemplified earlier this year when they cynically held their own ‘Drugs Summit’ in Glasgow rather than engage with the one proposed by Joe Fitzpatrick, the Scottish Government’s Public Health Minister. The Home Secretary didn’t attend either summit and her Junior minister walked out early branding DCRs a distraction.\nOne is left with the conclusion that DCRs, like the causes of drug dependency, namely poverty, inequality, social isolation and consequent poor mental health will not be issues that our country can tackle properly until we have full control over our own affairs.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-conference-can-mark-a-change-in-direction-for-our-party/content_9.html": "SNP conference can mark a change in direction for our party\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 13th Oct 2023\nA bruising defeat in a by-election is not the backdrop to SNP conference that anyone in the party would want. In years to come there will be time for reflection on why some people pushed so hard for a by-election the party was unlikely to win and why former colleagues and supporters turned quite so viciously on an MP who, prior to her covid wrongdoing, had such an impressive track record as a hard-working constituency representative and was the most loyal, enthusiastic, and tireless of activists. But for now, as others have remarked, we must not let a good crisis go to waste. Conference must mark a change in direction for our party.\nStephen Flynn has said it can’t be business as usual. He is right. Just as Kate Forbes was right when she said continuity wouldn’t cut it. Earlier this week in this newspaper Gerry Hassan identified the root of the SNP problems as the suffocation of debate and democracy within the party and the lack of a collegiate approach under the previous leadership. He is also right.\nHowever, there are reasons to be optimistic that the current leadership recognise that such an approach has been damaging and don’t intend to continue it. There is clear evidence from the conference programme that Humza is prepared to facilitate debate in a new way, and I have had also had the benefit of personal meetings with him this week which have made it clear to me that this the case.\nThe focus of this conference must be getting the party’s short to medium term strategy in the right place. The keynote debate at conference will be about our independence strategy. We must resist the media narrative that this means the conference is only about the SNP talking to ourselves. Plenty of other important policy issues will be debated over the 3 days of conference. It is right that independence strategy should come first. Independence is what drives our movement. As a result of strategic missteps by our previous leader, who didn’t allow these matters to be debated at conference, our strategy needs reset. I would have liked that to have been done earlier this year in March as originally planned but the surprise resignation and the leadership election that followed in its wake knocked that plan off course.\nSome hard truths need to be faced up to. It is true that there is cause for optimism in that while support for the SNP has dropped, support for independence stays firm at about the 45-50% mark. However, I don’t think we should get too complacent about this. That is roughly where we were 9 years ago. The years in between have been a wasted opportunity to do the hard work of convincing some of those who voted No in 2014 that independence is the best option for Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon’s government didn’t look serious on independence and the opportunities to advance our case during Brexit were squandered. However, that’s in the past now. We are where we are and what is needed is a medium to long term strategy for the General Election ahead and to win more voters over to independence.\nThe siren voices urging we drop independence from our offering are really in the wrong party. Furthermore, they haven’t properly analysed what has happened, what has gone wrong and why we lost the by-election so badly. Independence was not at the heart of the SNP campaign in Rutherglen and Hamilton West so pushing independence can hardly be blamed for the result. Instead, the focus was on the cost-of-living crisis. Of course, this issue which is currently the main concern of most voters in Scotland should be front and centre, but we need to explain why independence is the only way we can take control of the areas we need to control to change the way our economy and society works and to make sure our message is not hampered by threatening those already hard pressed with tax hikes.\nThe by-election campaign was also hampered by a series of unpopular policies which have hit the buffers. For example, self-identification of sex and the deposit return scheme. The problem is not just that these policies are unpopular but that voters see public money being wasted on expensive mistakes at a time when we should be focused on tackling the cost-of-living crisis.\nAnalysts interviewed in this newspaper have identified that the low turnout was a key issue but that while Labour basically retained most of their past voters or got other voters to vote for them it was the SNP vote that plummeted. Many of those who had voted for us in the past stayed at home and did not vote at all. We need to give them a reason to vote for us again. We should not arrogantly assume we have a vote which must be got out. We don’t own “our voters” but there are former SNP voters who can be persuaded to vote for us again. Putting independence at the heart of our offering and refocusing our policy efforts away from identity politics and virtue signalling and onto the most pressing issues faced by voters is the path to wining back trust and confidence.\nIt would also help if the party were to look united and I want to do my bit to try to achieve this. So, I am pleased to be able to tell readers that I have had the benefit of extensive discussions this week with Humza Yousaf. We are both in agreement that to treat the next General Election as a de facto referendum would be unwise. The narrative of this election has already been defined as getting rid of the Tories. Really nothing we can do will alter that. Furthermore, the party is not going to be able to win 50% or more of the vote even including the votes of other pro-independence parties. The suggestion that this General Election should be a de facto referendum was a misstep by the previous leadership. We need to explicitly rule that out at this conference.\nAs a result of my discussions with Humza it has become clear to me that the strategy favoured by him and Stephen is a demand of the incoming UK government that if the SNP wins the election in Scotland (however so defined in the final resolution) on an independence platform, they must enter into negotiations into how to give that democratic effect. That could encompass immediate independence negotiations, or a referendum, or transferring the power to hold a referendum and other matters such as employment rights, etc, to Holyrood. The leadership will support Tommy’s Sheppard’s amendment which leaves open the possibility of treating the next Holyrood election as a de facto referendum.\nI am very pleased to report that Humza will also support my amendment mandating that a constitutional convention should be set-up with MPs, MSPs and Civic Scotland to take forward our journey to statehood. I am minded not to call for a vote on an amendment which would replace the winning of the most seats with the winning of the majority of votes as the basis for the mandate we seek. In the circumstances I see no need to set a higher bar for us than other parties will set for themselves. I am content this is the right strategy for the situation in which we now find ourselves.\nMy friends at the SNP Trade Union Group who have given their support to my amendments will need to come to a collective decision on whether they can support me on this, but I am grateful to have had the opportunity to explain my position to some of their representatives. They will be coming together at conference to discuss matters. Their fringe event on Sunday is a must attend event discussing how the powers of independence can transform our economy and public services and ensure an environmentally sustainable future. This is an excellent illustration of the sort of issues that SNP members need to be debating to take our party and our cause forward.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_why-risks-of-new-windrush-this-time-with-eu-citizens-are-real/content_237.html": "Why risks of new Windrush – this time with EU citizens – are real\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 02nd Jul 2021\nWith rich irony, yesterday the House of Commons held a debate to mark Windrush day just as another immigration scandal threatens to unfold. On Wednesday the deadline for EU Nationals to apply for Settled Status in the UK passed amidst worries that thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands had missed it. It is important for their sake as well as for the sake of the wider Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic community that we learn from the wrongful detention, deportation and denial of legal rights suffered by so many of the Windrush generation and their descendants.\nThe Windrush Lessons Learned Review commissioned by the UK Government is quite clear. The author, Wendy Williams said,\n“While the Windrush scandal began to become public in late 2017, its roots lie much deeper. Successive rounds of legislation and policy effectively set traps for the Windrush generation… Over decades, legislation progressively eroded the rights of the Windrush generation… The Hostile Environment was another step on the long road towards a more restrictive immigration regime, but it was also a departure in terms of the scale and seriousness of the effects which would be directly felt by individuals… The department developed immigration policy at speed, impelled by ministerial pressure, with too little consideration of the possible impact of the measures.”\nEvidence monitoring the impacts of one of the key measures of the Hostile Environment, the Right to Rent scheme, shows it produces discrimination on nationality and racial grounds by outsourcing immigration enforcement to landlords. Other Hostile Environment policies which outsource decision making to healthcare workers, bank workers and employers carry the same risk.\nWendy Williams found that the Home Office didn’t consider the risks to ethnic minorities appropriately as it developed the right to rent policy and that it carried on with implementing the scheme after others pointed out the risks and after evidence had arisen that those risks had materialised. The policy exemplifies the department’s unwillingness to listen to others’ perspective or take on board external scrutiny, and an approach to policy making which is ideological rather than evidence based.\nAs a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, back in 2018 I was involved in a detailed case study of two of the Windrush cases. We found that those acting on behalf of the Home Office repeatedly ignored extensive documentary evidence that these people had every right to be in the UK. Instead, they detained them and were on the verge of deporting them. Given that treatment it is perfectly understandable that there is serious concern about what might become of those EU nationals living in the UK who have not met the deadline for application to the settlement scheme.\nAs always it will be the vulnerable who suffer most. During the Windrush scandal it was old people who were hit hardest. As the Wednesday deadline approached a Consultant Anaesthetist took to Twitter to set out the story of his 83-year-old German born mother who came to the UK in 1962. She has given a lifetime of dedicated service to the UK and now, like so many of her generation, she has dementia. She has no understanding of the process to gain settled status. Without her son she would have been left unassisted. Even for elderly people without dementia the online process is tricky. What of the elderly or other vulnerable people with no loving family to help them navigate the system? They will be at risk of losing bank accounts, tenancies, access to the NHS and welfare benefits.\nThe lessons which should be learned from the Windrush scandal is that these risks are real. As with the Windrush scandal, many of these EU nationals may be unaware there is any issue with their documented status for years. As for the victims of the Windrush scandal it may come as a horrible shock and cause untold Kafkaesque misery.\nOne of my constituents, a white man in his 70s, returned from holiday one year to be told by Border Force Officials that he was an ‘illegal immigrant’. Born in Canada to a Scottish mother he had come to the UK as a baby and known nowhere else. He had never thought he’d be caught up in the Windrush scandal and was deeply upset and had a genuine fear he was going to be deported until my office were able to sort out his documentation.\nAnother constituent of mine, a British National from the Commonwealth, who has been here from over 30 years, has been unable to get work as a professional driver for the last five years. He was wrongly accused of having hijacked someone else’s identity because two people with the same name ended up with the same national insurance number. His DWP file was eventually cleared and his right to benefits reinstated yet the Home Office didn’t regularise his identity and he can’t get a new passport or driving licence. His life has been destroyed, he now suffers from severe anxiety, and he has had a significant loss of earnings. He came to me desperate to get his driving licence and unaware of the Windrush Scheme which has been set up to deal with the fall out of the Windrush scandal to get people documents proving their right to live in the UK and to compensate those who have been so severely wronged. My office is working with him now to complete a Windrush application.\nResponses to parliamentary questions show that the waiting time under the Windrush compensation scheme is lengthy. Many have been waiting more than a year and, disgracefully, 21 have died while waiting for a response. And yet the home office has massively underspent its budget for the scheme. It's time that decision making was properly resourced, and that legal aid was made available to help claimants through the bureaucracy.\nDespite all this, the UK Government has ignored repeated warnings about EU nationals falling through the cracks of the settled status scheme leading to a repeat of the sort of mistreatment of British residents we saw during the Windrush scandal.\nThe civil penalties and criminal sanctions which can be imposed on employers with illegal EU workers on their books may lead to job losses for those waiting for the grant of a late EU Settlement Scheme application. The administrative burdens of the right to rent checks may lead landlords to discriminate against those with foreign sounding names. It will be just like the days of the signs in the window saying No Blacks and No Irish need apply, except less overt, more insidious.\nThe Windrush scandal should have marked the end of the hostile environment, but post-Windrush the Home Office is as hostile as ever as evidenced by the recent events in Kenmure Street. The local multi-cultural community firmly and peaceably showed what they thought of the British Government’s conduct and the victims of the Border Force raid were released. But they and others are still in danger.\nIt’s a sad fact that the words Hostile Environment were first used by the Labour party and that the Tories plans were ushered in by their Liberal Democrat handmaidens. While the Tories have made the Hostile Environment their own, it is indicative of a direction of travel on immigration that is widely supported by the Westminster based parties.\nThis shameful heavy-handed approach to immigration has no mandate and no place in modern Scotland. It is one of the many reasons why the SNP wins election after election in Scotland and the responsibility to realise the means to do something about it weighs heavy upon us.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_snp-green-co-operation-deal/content_219.html": "Here's a great way to get SNP-Green co-operation deal running\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 13th Aug 2021\nMonday’s move to level zero allowed me to resume constituency visits and I have had a busy week visiting organisations and businesses across Edinburgh Southwest. From paddle boarding on the union canal at Wester Hailes, during what felt like the monsoon season, to learning about how best to make localism work. It's been lively and stimulating.\nSome meetings are still taking place on Zoom and at a Community Council meeting on Monday night the chair asked me what I thought was the most important issue facing his community over the next few years. Following on the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report earlier that day, I had no hesitation in saying it was climate change.\nWe only need to reflect on the torrential rain we have been having: the loss of life in the floods in Germany and Belgium, and the forest fires across Europe and North America, to know how real and immediate this challenge is. After 18 months focused on the pandemic, we must now turn our attention urgently to how to make our lives and our environment more sustainable. Change needs to happen internationally, at national governmental level and closer to home, not just at the level of local government but in our local communities.\nAs the UK Government prepares to host COP26, it needs to get its house in order to deal with the incredible humanitarian challenges to come. It must face outwards and work internationally rather than turning its back on international organisations and going it alone. Foreign aid cuts are particularly unconscionable given the scale of the challenge faced by the less developed world because of the excesses of the developed world and must be reversed. Parts of the world may become uninhabitable, so climate change will mean more not less migration, so all the more need for a humane immigration policy.\nCloser to home, the Scottish Parliament has shown a strong commitment to tackling climate change. Although some of the powers needed to fully realise this commitment reside at Westminster, for now, Holyrood still has sufficient power to effect real change. If there is to be a co-operation agreement with the Greens, it should focus on how to deliver this change rather than virtue signalling and identity politics. Green Ministers could be put in charge of departments where sweeping change is needed to make our lives more sustainable on the issue which is the very raison d’etre of their party.\nThis week’s report from the Common Weal think tank “21 for 21: The Climate Change Actions Scotland Needs Now, launched by my colleague Douglas Chapman MP, shows the way. It lists 21 priority actions which Scotland could embark on during 2021 in order to prove ‘we are serious about making the transition to a zero-carbon future and averting catastrophic change.’ The report focuses on energy, population and consumption as the “three key drivers of climate change in Scotland” but the authors say they could have produced many more proposals. This latest report from Common Weal sits amongst an important body of work advocating a ‘Green New Deal’ to transform our economy, to make it more resilient and to reduce inequality and alleviate poverty, while tackling climate change. One of the major themes is land reform – making the way we use our land and the wonderful natural resources upon it more efficient in terms of creating jobs and incomes. A deal with the Greens is the perfect opportunity to tackle land reform anew. What a shame Andy Wightman is not where he should be when he is needed most.\nAnother issue the coalition might tackle is local government and how we finance it. Both the SNP and the Greens are committed to improving local democracy and how we fund it. The SNP has pledged to have an annual citizens assembly tackling issues like the role of local government and local taxation. As in Ireland these focused assemblies should come up with concrete and detailed proposals which the parliament can enact. A lot of time has been spent discussing the importance of reducing the sizes of councils and giving more local control. It's high time we had concerted action to break up councils and implement real local democracy. The 2022 local government elections should be the last ones contested under the existing system.\nThe unprecedented steps taken by Governments across the world to deal with the Covid pandemic have shown us that sudden drastic change can happen and work, albeit it that it has come at a significant cost. Covid has meant the loss of lives and livelihoods. But it has also shown us that home working is viable for a significant chunk of our workforce. People have spent more time in their local communities than perhaps they had for years, and local organisations and new voluntary groups have taken the lead on food distribution and supporting the vulnerable.\nSo, we are far more open to living and working differently than they would have been before the pandemic. However, managing change is crucial. Government at all levels including local must take communities with them. That means plans developed from and with communities following real engagement and not simply imposed on them. Communities must be properly invested and in control of decisions about change that will impact on their day to day lives.\nIn 2019 the Planning (Scotland) Act introduced a wide range of reforms to Scotland’s planning system, including the opportunity for communities to develop ‘Local Place Plans’. Wester Hailes, in my constituency, was one of the first communities in Scotland to develop its own Local Place Plan. It takes advantage of local knowledge to reflect the aspirations of people of Wester Hailes in order to make it a better place to live, work and visit, to influence decision making on planning and investment and to involve young people and all generations to have their say. One of my constituency visits this week was to see the rejuvenation of the local community space that has happened as a result of this work and to discuss next steps.\nThe Scottish Government’s Place Based Investment Programme aspires to “ensure that all place-based investments are shaped by the needs and aspirations of local communities and accelerate our ambitions for place, 20-minute neighbourhoods, town centre action, community led regeneration and community wealth building”. In a 20-minute neighbourhood everyone should have access to essential services including shops, child-care, schools, GPs, dentists, recreation and public transport within a short walk or cycle ride together with plenty of open green public space. It’s a not a new idea but it's one that we are all more open to as a result of the pandemic and it seems to me that the energy saving benefits of reshaping our local communities in this way will be integral to tackling climate change. The Common Weal agree and making localism work in this way is one of the 21 actions that they say Scotland can take now.\nNone of this is to underestimate the importance of achieving independence to realising the goal of a greener more resilient Scotland. But that won't happen overnight, and, in their latest policy paper, Common Weal have shown yet again that transformative change has to start now and be developed as we move to independence. Embracing their plan would be a great way for an SNP/Green co-operation agreement to get off the ground.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_scotland-should-act-tavistock-clinic-findings/content_197.html": "Scotland should act NOW in light of Tavistock clinic findings\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 26th Aug 2022\nA looming medical negligence scandal in England has implications for Scotland and needs urgent attention. London’s Tavistock gender clinic is facing the threat of legal action from 1000 children and their families who claim they were misdiagnosed and placed on a damaging and irreversible medical pathway without proper informed consent or consideration of alternative therapies.\nThe children concerned were being treated for gender dysphoria, a condition which is best understood as a sense of unease because of a perceived mismatch between their biological sex and what has come to be known as their “gender identity”.\nIn recent years there has been a rapid increase in the number of children presenting with this condition, particularly girls. At the same time the services provided have moved from a psychosocial and psychotherapeutic model to one that also prescribes medical and surgical interventions such as puberty blockers, cross sex hormones and double mastectomies.\nIn Autumn 2020 NHS England and NHS Improvement set up an Independent Review of Gender Identity Services for Children and Young People to make recommendations about the services provided by the NHS in England. Dr Hilary Cass, an eminent paediatrician, was asked to chair it.\nIn March of this year, she submitted an interim report which concluded that the Tavistock clinic has failed vulnerable children and should be shut down by spring of next year at the latest. It will be replaced by regional centres at children’s hospitals who are to offer a more holistic model of care with strong links to mental health services.\nCass found that the current model of a centralised national service for children and young people who experience gender dysphoria puts them at significant risk. Many children have been put on a medical/surgical pathway with insufficient exploration and often little consideration of consent. There has been a lack of follow up of those who have undergone this type of experimental treatment, so Cass also calls for the rapid establishment of a formal research programme in England and Wales to follow up children and young people being considered for hormone treatment into adulthood, with a particular early focus on the use of puberty blockers.\nCass recommends that children expressing distress about their sex should be treated like any other children with psychological problems and offered compassionate and appropriate services which properly address all their needs. Children who experience a sense of unease because of a perceived mismatch between their biological sex and what has come to be known as their “gender identity”, often have other problems, including past trauma and sexual abuse, autistic spectrum disorder, and wider mental health difficulties. Many of these children are lesbian, gay or bisexual and simply need help to be comfortable with their sexual identity as they grow up.\nOne of the most disturbing aspects of what has happened in England has been the efforts to silence whistle-blowers and brand them as “transphobic”. One psychotherapist and child safeguarding expert at the Tavistock, Sonia Appleby, won damages from an employment tribunal after she was vilified and prevented from carrying out her safeguarding role after raising concerns. Her colleague, David Bell, a consultant psychiatrist commented that the service had become “so caught up in the politicisation of the subject of gender identity that it had lost sight of its duty to safeguard children”.\nSome staff have left the service over their concerns. They have spoken of their concerns that the cause of many children’s distress was unchallenged homophobia and have given examples of children who presented as trans after months of bullying for being gay or because of homophobia at home. They reported that many families talked about not wanting their daughters to be lesbian and that young people frequently confided their disgust at being gay. These clinicians said that they felt what they were doing was conversion therapy for gay children.\nConcerns over the treatment given to children suffering from gender dysphoria are not confined to the UK. This week the Sydney Morning Herald reported on the case of a young woman in Australia who has brought a claim for medical negligence against a psychiatrist who advised her to have breasts and womb removed after only three consultations. She was suffering from gender confusion against the background of a complicated home life and worry about her attraction to other girls. Her treatment and living as a man caused her further distress and she has gone back to living as a woman. Her solicitor says she expects extensive litigation in Australia in the coming years from others who have received hormonal and surgical treatment without adequate counselling. The initial referral in this 19-year-old woman’s case described her as “very young” and “clearly’ needing “thorough psychiatric work-up before embarking on hormone treatment”. Many of the children treated at the Tavistock are a lot younger than 19.\nSo, what are the implications for Scotland? We have our own national gender identity service at the Sandyford clinic in Glasgow. It has been operating on the same model as the Tavistock and as you might expect there are strong indications that patients and service users are experiencing similar problems to those identified by Hilary Cass. The Scottish government has said it will carefully consider the final recommendations of the Cass review for the Sandyford clinic. However, the implications of the interim findings are so serious, action is needed sooner. Whether there is time or the need for replicating the Cass review in Scotland is questionable. There is certainly plenty of room for read across.\nUntil earlier this week the position of NHS Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS), which is tasked with improving Scottish healthcare, was that it had never been asked to inspect, review or carry out improvement work with the Sandyford young gender clinic. But now, HIS have confirmed that the Scottish government has ordered it to work on guidelines for the care of children experiencing gender dysphoria.\nIt is more than a little concerning that such guidelines do not already exist. Apparently the newly commissioned ones will not be ready until December of next year. That is too far away. In the light of the Cass review and the looming litigation scandal this issue needs far more urgent attention. That is why I joined forces earlier this month with the former leader of the Scottish Green Party, Robin Harper, OBE, to write to the National Clinical Director, Jason Leitch, demanding swift action.\nThe Scottish health system rightly prides itself on its innovative work on patient safety and data driven health care improvement. Patient safety and person-centred care means ensuring that children and young people in Scotland receive a high standard of care and that the services provided to them are safe, effective and centred around the individual.\nExperience should inform practice going forward so that lessons can be learned, and mistakes not repeated. Press reports suggest that the Sandyford are already contacting patients who have transitioned as a result of their advice and then regretted it. They should also speak with feminist and LGB groups who have been advocating for the more holistic approach recommended by Hilary Cass. It was concerns like those expressed by Cass that led me to argue that it was imperative that a ban on conversion therapy did not extend to a ban on proper talking therapies for children who are distressed about their sex or gender identity. I hope that those who attacked me for doing so will think again in the light of the evidence heard by Cass and her recommendations.\nFor too long those who have expressed concern about the medicalisation of children distressed about their sex have been silenced by unfounded allegations of “Transphobia”. Now that concerns for the welfare of such children have been legitimised by the findings of an independent expert review, it is time for the Scottish Government and NHS Scotland to act quickly. The potential cost to the NHS if they fail to do so should concern us all but it is the irreversible impacts on the lives of the children concerned that is the real scandal.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_a-new-form-of-anti-lesbian-dogma-is-leaving-children-confused/content_22.html": "A new form of anti-lesbian dogma is leaving children confused\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 01st Dec 2023\nAt Westminster on Wednesday a debate was held to mark the 20th anniversary of the repeal of s.28 of the Local Government Act 1988 which prohibited local authorities from promoting homosexuality or the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a “pretended family relationship”. It meant that for over a generation same sex attraction dare not speak its name in schools or colleges across the UK. Homophobic bullying went unchallenged and sex education about the AIDS crisis was hampered at a time when it was crucial to save lives.\nSection 28 was repealed in Scotland more than three years earlier than in England, on 21 June 2000. The Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, which did so was one of the first pieces of legislation enacted by the new Scottish Parliament. Sadly, the repeal was preceded by a vicious campaign against it during which too many politicians sat on the fence. It is right that we should remember and applaud those who took a brave stand including the then Labour Communities minister Wendy Alexander MSP and the MSPs including some from the SNP who supported her.\nWhen section 28 was introduced in 1988 I was 21 and at university in Edinburgh. I had just come out as a lesbian, most of my close friends were lesbians and gay men. There was a vibrant scene in Edinburgh, and we had hope that maybe society was changing. Section 28 dented our optimism, but it did not stop us from campaigning vigorously against it. The wonderful Blue Moon Café at the lesbian and gay centre in Broughton Street in Edinburgh was the hub of anti-Section 28 activism. The Scottish Homosexual Action Group or SHAG for short was set up. They organised rallies and a march in Edinburgh. Buses went to London and Manchester for mass demonstrations. I attended all of them.\nSHAG also organised the Lark in the Park in the Ross Bandstand in Princess Street Gardens. It was a festival of music and comedy with a political agenda, addressed by Sir Ian McKellen, who came out to protest s.28. The Lark in the Park ran for two years and was the precursor of Pride marches in Scotland.\nOne of the interesting things about the campaign against section 28 was that lesbian feminists played a big role. Many had never worked with men before or had not done so for many years. Gay men were sometimes a bit taken aback by all these feisty women, but we worked well together in the end. It was the height of the AIDS pandemic. Many gay men were dying. Some of them were my friends. The LGB movement was united in this fight too. What lesbian feminists brought to the fight was experience of direct action from their campaigns against porn and violence against women and girls. Some lesbians had children and they took offence at their families being called pretend. Lesbians abseiled into the House of Lords and stormed the BBC 6pm news studio as the news went out live handcuffing themselves to the news reader Sue Lawley’s chair. Some lesbians including my friend Julie Bindel even stormed the Ideal Home exhibition to tell everyone that lesbians make the best families.\nIt is important that we remember all of this because lesbian activism is something which is rather frowned upon today unless approved of by straight people and men who think they can set boundaries for lesbians. They cannot and they should not try to do so.\nSection 28 was all about the state clamping down on any support for the idea that it might be normal to be homosexual. To be homosexual means to be sexually interested in and attracted to members of one’s own sex. This might not always have been popular, but it has been well understood for hundreds if not thousands of years. The movement of which I was part in 1988 was a movement for lesbian, gay and bisexual rights – the rights of the same sex attracted. And yes, we had trans supporters, for example the magician Fay Presto, a trans woman, was very involved in the Lark in the park. But the legislation was not an attack on trans people, it was an attack on the same sex attracted.\nStonewall was founded in response to Section 28 and it was focused exclusively on same sex rights. The initials LGBT or LGBTQ were not used until after its Chief Executive, Ben Summerskill, left in 2014. As a recent survey by LGB Alliance shows many lesbians and gays don’t like being called queer. It reminds us of queer bashing which many of us have suffered. The protection of gay people and trans people which was achieved in the Equality Act 2010 was a triumph for two distinct and different movements campaigning separately. In 2011 Stonewall published a guide to the Equality Act for Employers, it was 48 pages long and there was not one mention of trans rights or the acronym LGBT.\nHuman rights and equal rights are universal but, as my friend Allison Bailey, the lesbian barrister who successfully sued her Chambers for discrimination, has said, the rights of lesbians and gay men are not dependent on accepting gender identity theory. By that I mean the belief that everyone has a gender identity and that it somehow trumps the sex with which we were born and is more important.\nThere is no equivalence between the fight against section 28 and the fight to prevent gender identity theory from erasing same sex attraction, although some of the small number of speakers who turned up for the Westminster debate tried to suggest this. I know there is not because, unlike most who draw this false comparison, I was part of the fight against s.28, I was there. I was out and I was campaigning against an attack on the rights of same sex attracted people like me – indeed our very right to be who we were.\nSection 28 meant that teenage girls were left confused and ashamed of their exclusive sexual attraction to other girls and with no one to talk to about this. This for many young lesbians is the same situation now. I have constituents whose same sex attracted daughters are told at school that they must be a boy trapped in a girl’s body. They feel under pressure to deny their exclusive same sex attraction and are bamboozled by a welter of indefinable niche identities like bi-gender, gender queer and demi-fluid which overlap and confuse them. A new form of anti-lesbian dogma is being enforced by the state in school settings just like s.28.\nThank goodness we have organisations like LGB Alliance who exist to promote the rights of same sex attracted people, now that Stonewall has given up on us. The fight against section 28 was a fight against those who wanted to destroy the reality of lesbian and gay lives. They wanted to erase us from contemporary life. Section 28 failed and I hope the contemporary campaign to erase the reality of lesbian and gay men’s lives will also fail.",

For such a long speech it was incredibly light on policy and tangible vision. I like Keir. I think he’s a decent guy, but this speech was distinctly underwhelming.

Notwithstanding the length of his speech, Scotland was mentioned only three times and he had absolutely nothing new or original to say about the union.\nAs Dr Kirsty Hughes noted on twitter, there was nothing in the speech for pro-EU anti-Brexit Scottish voters and nothing imaginative on the UK as a voluntary union. Starmer, and those advising him, cannot be oblivious to the important intervention made earlier this year by Ciaran Martin the former top civil servant who helped negotiate the Edinburgh Agreement. He said that in the face of yet another overall win for the pro-independence parties at the Scottish election, a continued refusal by the British government to co-operate in the holding of a second independence referendum would change the union between England and Scotland from one based on consent to one based on force of law. That, he said, would be the most profound transformation in the internal governance of the UK since most of Ireland left almost a century ago.\nSir Keir and his comrades must see the force of this intervention, yet earlier in the week we heard the same cloth-eared approach from Anas Sarwar and Andy Burnham. The Labour party have embraced the legitimacy of self- determination movements across the world including very close to home, but they seem unable to carry across this enthusiasm when it comes to Scotland.\nInstead, Sir Keir told us that he was very happy to leave settling the future of the union to a Commission led Gordon Brown. In that he’s pretty much alone as no one can have much confidence in Gordon Brown given the broken promises he made in 2014. The bizarre analogy with giving blood which followed was just totally cringeworthy.\nPerhaps Labour have got so out of the way of winning elections they have forgotten that winners, like the SNP Scottish Government, have a mandate to deliver on their manifestos. While he was singing Anas Sarwar’s praises, Sir Keir seemed to forget that, earlier this year, under his leadership, Labour had its worst result in Scotland in over 100 years while the SNP won a fourth election in a row with the biggest share of the vote in the history of devolution. Everyone, apart from Sir Keir it seems, understands that this is because the issue of independence is not going away and dominates Scottish politics.\nAt some point Labour will need to address whether the union is a hostage situation or a union of equals based on consent. Seven years have passed since the 2014 indyref. The British constitution allows a referendum in Northern Ireland on the issue of Irish reunification every 7 years. Sir Keir needs to explain why the same courtesy should not be extended to Scotland. He waxed lyrical on rebuilding Britain’s profile on the world stage and mending broken international relationships, but he needs to face the reality of the broken relationships within the British Isles.\nAt least the trade union leaders, or some of them, get it. Earlier this week the Scottish born Unison leader, Christina McAnea, told BBC Scotland’s the Nine that Labour needed to look at the constitution and Scotland anew. The newly elected leader of Unite, Sharon Graham, has made it clear that she backs self-determination for Scotland and that the policy on independence and indyref2 should be settled by the union’s Scottish membership.\nSir Keir is more interested in making Brexit work than addressing the Scottish question. But he didn’t explain how Brexit could be made to work and he omitted to mention that the mess we are currently in is largely due to the hopeless agreement negotiated by Boris Johnson for which his party voted. Voters in Scotland really don’t like that complicity and they will be reminded of it more and more as Brexit continues to unravel with petrol and food shortages.\nSooner or later Sir Keir will have to wise up. The Scottish government plans to hold a second indyref before the end of 2023, Covid permitting. But there is a very real risk that a General Election may intervene before that happens. At Westminster there is a strong feeling that Boris Johnson will call the next election in the Spring of 2023. I agree with Michelle Thomson MSP that Boris Johnson is highly unlikely to agree a section 30 order for a 2023 indyref. Therefore, the Scottish Government will have to rely upon a Holyrood backed bill surviving a legal challenge in order for the referendum to proceed. Many people are wondering whether there is enough time for such a bill to be passed and, for a legal challenge to be heard and determined before the end of 2023 given that the bill is not in the current programme for Government.\nIf it transpires that a General Election takes place before the Scottish Government are able to hold a second indyref then it could be rather important to the advancement of the case for independence because Sir Keir may find himself dependent on SNP MPs to form a government that functions. Sir John Curtice says that without winning Scotland, Labour will struggle to win a British election even if they take the sort of 12-point lead in England that Blair took in 1997. They will need to rely on the SNP and the price of our support would be a second Edinburgh agreement allowing for a second indyref the result of which would be accepted as binding by both Governments.\nI know many readers won’t want to hear this but it’s the reality of where we are given the timetable set down by the First Minister.\nFinally, I’ll say one thing for Labour, their conference looked like fun and involved lively debate on the issues of the day. Keir Starmer didn’t want to support a minimum wage of £15 per hour but a motion for the same was debated and passed on the conference floor. The fringe was a lively as ever with some people getting themselves into very hot water on matters as diverse as cervixes and dinosaurs. That said, the conference wasn’t much fun for women like Rosie Duffield MP, too fearful for her personal safety to attend the conference floor. Nor was it much fun for the women banished from the official fringe to debate their rights at an off-conference venue, surrounded by heavy security. Apparently, the attempts of the Lesbian Labour group to affiliate to the party have been met with a wall of silence. It seems that Labour, the authors of the Equality Act, have forgotten that same sex orientation is still a protected characteristic under the Act and that it is not lawful for membership organisations to discriminate against people on account of their sex, their sexual orientation or their gender critical beliefs.\nWhilst I would hope we never find ourselves in the situation where any SNP member would have real cause to fear for their personal safety at conference, it would be good to have a conference in person with the sort of lively debate that should involve. Now that Covid cases are starting to fall in Scotland perhaps those who run the party will reconsider their decision to hold the upcoming annual conference online and instead deliver a real in-person vibrant event that will help move the case for independence forward.",

Keir Starmer’s equivocation on women’s rights is pathetic. It is a clear sign of what’s to come and I would urge women to think very carefully when they are casting their votes.\nUntil recently I was the elected chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights at Westminster. I believe that Trans people should be free to live their lives with dignity and respect. I firmly believe in the protections for Trans people enshrined in the Equality Act.\nHowever, I do not accept that any man should have the right, through self-ID, to choose their gender and gain access to single-sex spaces.\nRights can conflict and it is not acceptable for the hard won rights of women to be compromised by gender ideology. If the rules governing single-sex spaces are changed so that some members of the opposite sex are able to enter, those spaces become mixed-sex, and many women will self-exclude.\nIf males who identify as women are housed in women’s prisons, women will feel and be unsafe. If males are allowed to play in women’s sport, then fairness and safety for women are destroyed.\nKeir Starmer’s Labour Party are set to win a majority across seats in England. With a new incoming Labour government it is going to be really important to have strong independent-minded voices in the next parliament to speak up for women & LGB people.\nIf re-elected that’s what I will continue to do.\nand to stand up for the rights of women and girls.\nJK Rowling: Labour has dismissed women like me. I’ll struggle to vote for it\n“As long as Labour remains dismissive and often offensive towards women fighting to retain the rights their foremothers thought were won for all time, I’ll struggle to support them.

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_turning-point-in-debate-on-sex-and-gender-identity/content_299.html": "Turning point has been reached in debate on sex and gender identity\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 28th Jan 2022\nOn Wednesday the Equality and Human Rights Commission released two important documents signalling a turning point in the debate on sex and gender identity in Scotland and across the UK. The first was a letter from the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the cross bench former Lib Dem peer, Baroness Kishwer Falkner, commenting on the Scottish Government’s plan to reform the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and to adopt a policy of self-identification. The second was the EHRC response to the UK Government’s consultation on its plan to ban conversion therapy.\nIn their letter to the Scottish Government the EHRC highlighted concerns about the implications of changing the criteria for obtaining a Gender Recognition Certificate and wrote of “the potential consequences for individuals and society of extending the ability to change legal sex from a small defined group, who have demonstrated their commitment and ability to live in their acquired gender, to a wider group who identify as the opposite gender at a given point. The potential consequences include those relating to the collection and use of data, participation and drug testing in competitive sport, measures to address barriers facing women, and practices within the criminal justice system, inter alia.”\nIn its response to the UK government consultation on Conversion Therapy, the EHRC said that it was supportive of measures to end harmful conversion therapy practices but emphasised that the significant and wide-ranging implications of the Government’s 5 proposals – for criminal and civil justice, clinicians and therapists, families and religious organisations – require careful and detailed consideration. Concern was expressed about the lack of clear definitions of “conversion therapy” and of “transgender”, that the latter has no clear legal meaning, is potentially wider than the concept of gender reassignment in current UK law, and is understood by different people in different ways.\nThe EHRC also noted the lack of evidence in relation to transgender conversion therapy and urged the UK Government to await the outcome of the Cass Review which is currently looking into gender identity services for children and young people. The EHRC want the UK Government to address sexual orientation and being transgender separately and not to proceed with legislation to ban Conversion therapy regarding the latter until detailed evidence-based proposals are available for proper scrutiny. They stressed the importance of any ban not preventing appropriate support for individuals with gender dysphoria.\nLike many who have tried in vain to have our legitimate concerns on these matters addressed respectfully I was pleased by these interventions. The hyperbolic response of some individuals and organisations has been disappointing, but, sadly, not surprising. It’s a shame that so many have sought to attack the EHRC as though it was a mouthpiece of the UK Government. It is not. Ironically, its attackers include bodies who are largely funded by the Scottish and UK Governments and haven’t themselves always seemed as independent of government as one might expect.\nThe EHRC is an independent statutory body with the responsibility to encourage equality and diversity, eliminate unlawful discrimination, and protect and promote the human rights of people across England, Wales and Scotland. It was set up under the Equality Act 2010. Equalities are a largely reserved matter under the Scotland Act, but Human Rights are not, and a separate independent statutory body set up by the Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006 shares responsibility for Human Rights in Scotland. Both organisations have been awarded ‘A’ status as National Human Rights Institutions (NHRI) by the United Nations.\nThe director of the Scottish Human Rights Commission is appointed by the Scottish parliament after an open recruitment process. The director of EHRC is appointed by the UK Government’s Women and Equalities Minister after an open recruitment process and a pre-appointment hearing before Westminster’s Women and Equalities Select Committee and Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR). I know a little bit about this because as a member of JCHR I took part in Baroness Falkner’s pre-appointment hearing. One of the purposes of the hearing is to provide public evidence of the independence of mind of the candidate. Both committees found her to be a suitable candidate for the role of Chair.\nThe Tailored Review of the first ten years of the EHRC had been published in November 2018 and criticised it for not being seen as a robust regulator or enforcer of the law. Accordingly, the MPs who questioned the Baroness were keen to see her ensure that she would up the EHRC’s game. I asked her a series of questions about the importance of treating all the protected characteristics in the Equality Act as equal and alluded to the toxicity of the current debate over sex and gender identity.\nSome of the ire directed at the EHRC seems to be because they have changed their position since 2017. I think there’s two reasons for this, first, the change of leadership at the EHRC has given us a woman who is willing to listen to the concerns of other women. And second, thanks to the dogged work of grassroots feminist and LGB activists, the era of ‘no debate’ is over.\nThe most important thing about the EHRC intervention is the underlining of the importance of the “Established legal concept of sex.” Women’s rights and lesbian, gay and bisexual rights are dependent on the secure establishment of that concept in law. Unfortunately, many government funded bodies both in the women’s’ sector and in the LGBT sector have almost completely signed up to gender identity theory meaning they believe that the gender someone identifies with is more important than their sex. This has led to the absurd and unpleasant phenomenon of same sex attracted women being compared to racists by the head of Stonewall (herself a lesbian) for refusing to date men who identify as women.\nThe rights of women and of same sex attracted people are not conditional on accepting gender identity theory. Yet many women are suffering bullying and harassment in their workplace as a result of their refusal to sign up to the supremacy of gender identity over sex. I have made no secret that I am one. Other high-profile cases include University Professors Kathleen Stock and Jo Phoenix and the artist Jess de Wahl.\nBut there are many other women who are not in the public eye who write to me and organisations like Sex Matters and LGB Alliance about their predicaments. Charity workers, teachers, nurses, police officers and civil servants. Like the more high-profile women I have mentioned their lives have been dedicated to the feminist cause, lesbian rights and other important things like child protection. Yet now they are being called bigots and vilified for raising the sort of concerns that the EHRC have now legitimised.\nIt was for this reason that veterans of the struggle for gay rights broke away from organisations like Stonewall and set up LGB Alliance. The founders, Bev Jackson and Kate Harris, who I am proud to call my friends, are both veterans of the women’s movement and the fight for gay rights. Bev was the only female founder of the Gay Liberation Front in 1970. She has also worked extensively in the field of refugee rights. Kate worked with Women’s’ Aid and is a former volunteer fundraiser for Stonewall. When gender identity theory started to take over, they tried to talk to organisations like Stonewall about their concerns but found the door shut in their face.\nYesterday morning on the Today programme, a senior politician from the Scottish Greens was asked ‘why do you think its right to ignore people who disagree with you?’ She retreated into allegations of transphobia and misinformation. This person is deputy chair of the committee who will examine the GRA reform Bill in parliament. Her response does not augur well for the measured dispassionate examination we should expect from a parliamentary committee. It’s time for both Governments, parliaments and the cheer leaders for these reforms to play the ball and not the man, or woman, as it is usually women in the firing line. The tide is turning.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_tory-asylum-bill/content_296.html": "It's not just 'lefty lawyers' calling out the Tory asylum bill\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 17th Mar 2023\nPoliticians who frame policy and make laws based on prejudice or preconception often come unstuck. Evidence-based policy-making matters. There are many things wrong with the Tories’ Illegal Migration Bill. Last week, I wrote about how it will breach the European Convention on Human Rights and the Refugee Convention.\nHowever, it also suffers from being based on claims made about alleged abuses of the asylum system by the Home Secretary which simply don’t stand up to scrutiny. On Wednesday, as the debate on the Budget raged on in the Commons, upstairs at the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) we were finalising our plans for legislative scrutiny of the Illegal Migration Bill and taking evidence in our current inquiry into the human rights of asylum seekers in the UK. Our focus this week was modern slavery and trafficking.\nModern slavery involves the illegal exploitation of people for personal or commercial gain. Human trafficking involves the transportation or coercion of people in order to benefit from their work or service – typically in the form of forced labour or sexual exploitation. While former prime minister Theresa May is rightly criticised for the hostile environment, she is also widely praised for introducing the Modern Slavery Act 2015 which set up a National Referral Mechanism (NRM) for identifying and supporting modern slavery victims in the UK both British nationals and those who have come from elsewhere. The act applies mostly to England and Wales with some provisions applying to Scotland. We have our own sister legislation, the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Act 2015.\nThe Illegal Migration Bill will disapply many of the modern slavery provisions set out in this legislation to those entering the UK irregularly. Current protections preventing removal from the UK pending a conclusive decision on whether someone is a victim of modern slavery or not and entitlement to assistance and support will be gone if the bill passes.\nReferrals have grown considerably since the act was passed. However, the JCHR heard evidence that this suggests not so much that the scale of modern slavery and trafficking in the UK has increased but rather that it is better recognised and identified because of the act and the training of public authority and first responder officials that followed. Suella Braverman claims that the modern slavery system is being abused through false claims made by asylum seekers trying to “game the system”, particularly those arriving in small boats. However, the director general at the Office for Statistics said in December 2022 that the “statistics do not support the claims that people are “gaming” the modern slavery system, and the source of the claim is unclear to us”.\nAt the same time Professor Dame Sara Thornton, who was formerly the anti-slavery commissioner, told the Home Affairs Committee that “the factor of modern slavery protections has been exaggerated in this whole issue about small boat crossings. I do not think the evidence, as I understand it, supports the rhetoric, and the concern is that the rhetoric is severely undermining the Modern Slavery Act protections.”\nThe Home Secretary’s own departmental statistics show that only 7% of the 83,000 of those who arrived in the UK on small boats between January 2018 and December 2022 were referred to the NRM – that’s about 6000 individuals. Indeed, during 2022 it dropped to 6%. And, crucially, around 85% of these referrals were found by the Home Office to be genuine. Suella Braverman also claims that many modern slavery claims are made late in the day by failed asylum seekers in detention awaiting removal from the UK. During the bill’s second reading on Monday Robert Jenrick, the Immigration Minister, suggested that 73% of people detained for removal after arrival on small boats were referred to the NRM. According to the evidence the JCHR heard, the figure was about 66% between January 2021 and September 2022, 1136 out of 1709 people. However – and again this is the crucial point – 93% of those referrals received a positive reasonable grounds decision from the Home Office. Immigration judges and appeals would also have been involved in many of these cases, so these are decisions that have been taken after careful consideration.\nSo, it is not just “lefty lawyers” who question the Home Secretary’s justification for the bill, her own departmental statistics undermine what she is saying. So does the research of the Centre for Social Justice, a centre-right think tank set up by former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, which has a special Modern Slavery Unit. This week the JCHR heard from the former modern slavery commissioner, Professor Dame Sara Thornton. She completed a three-year term in her post in April 2022. Her predecessor resigned citing government interference in his role. When she left, Professor Thornton said that the Government’s asylum overhaul was driven by “political calculation’ rather than expertise and that the fight against modern slavery in Britain wasn’t what it had been. And that was before the Illegal Migration Bill was even thought of!\nIf you want to hear more about this, you can listen to my interview with her on the Committee Corridor podcast wherever you usually get your podcasts or you can find links to listen online and also the transcript here. Currently, Professor Thornton’s former post lies empty and it’s the Home Secretary’s responsibility to appoint a successor. She was very clear in her evidence to the JCHR that this means there is not a proper evidence base for the bill. The fearless independent voice of the commissioner should have informed the second reading of the bill but it didn’t because the person who wants this unevidenced bill did not want MPs and the public to hear the truth. Now that is what is properly called Trumpian.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_alister-jacks-gender-reform-block-was-no-attack-on-devolution/content_196.html": "Alister Jack's gender reform block was no attack on devolution\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 15th Dec 2023\nQuite a few column inches have been expended in this newspaper since last Friday's court ruling on Alister Jack's block of the Gender Recognition Reform (GRR) Bill. Readers have heard from columnists who are male lawyers and trans rights activists but, as yet, we have had no commentary from the women whose concerns were validated by the judgment, the -'women who wouldn't wheesht'.\nSimilarly on the radio at the weekend, BBC Scotland's flagship politics show interviewed a male Tory MSP and the trans rights activist Ellie Gomersall but again, there was no platform for the women who fought against the bill. They did so in the face of demonisation and opprobrium from large parts of our political class, government-funded lobby groups and a nasty underbelly of misogynistic men and their supporters. They deserve to be heard and so today I am going to put forward their point of view. Before I do, let me deal with the constitutional handwringing.\nThe suggestion that using the Section 35 power to block the act is an attack on devolution does not stand up to scrutiny. Lady Haldane held that Section 35 is an integral part of the devolved settlement. She is right. All devolved parliaments remain subservient to the mother parliament, that is the essence of devolution, hence the phrase 'power devolved is power retained'.\nIndependence is necessary before the sovereignty of the people of Scotland can be embodied in a parliament which is not subservient to Westminster. Yes, there was scope for exploring the limits of the Section 35 power, but Lady Haldane has done that and found that the veto was clearly within the power afforded.\nThe general consensus of legal opinion is that the prospects for a successful appeal are poor. Mine is not the only voice within the SNP urging the Scottish Government not to throw good money after bad by pursuing an appeal. I have repeatedly said that if we are going to pick constitutional fights with the British Government in the courts then we need to pick cases where we stand a good chance of success and have public opinion behind us. This case fails on both those counts.\nLady Haldane held that the Section 35 power was engaged because the GRR bill would modify the law as it related to reserved matters because of its impact on the Equality Act 2010 (EA). She found that it was perfectly rational for Alister Jack to take the view that the impact on the EA would be adverse as regards the rights of women and LGB people in several respects and particularly because of the lack of adequate safeguards in the bill.\nThis is exactly what feminist campaigners such as For Women Scotland and Murray Blackburn Mackenzie argued throughout the passage of the bill. For their troubles they were pilloried. The former first minister said their views were not valid. Threats of violence and sexual abuse were condoned by the silence of those in power who are usually noisy in the condemnation of such behaviour.\nGoing back to Radio Scotland's Sunday politics show, during its newspaper review, Jillian Merchant, a lawyer with an expertise in discrimination law, tackled the oft-cited argument that this piece of legislation was the 'most scrutinised' in the history of our parliament. She made the point that whether that is true rather depends on what was scrutinised. I would say that in the main, MSPs scrutinised only those arguments with which they already agreed. Their arrogance was typified by their refusal to hear evidence from a group of female survivors of sex abuse. Uninformed politicians like Alex Cole-Hamilton lionised pro-self-ID activists who later turned out to have a rather unsavoury history while turning a deaf ear to feminists with years of experience in women's rights and safeguarding. Jillian Merchant concluded that the whole sorry episode should make us reflect on how we do our politics. She is right.\nEarlier this week, I spoke with Caroline McAllister. She was an SNP party member, a councillor, deputy leader of West Dunbartonshire Council from 2017 to 2021 and convener of the SNP's Women's Pledge group. At SNP conference in November 2019, she was elected as the party's women's officer with a mandate to raise concerns about how Gender Recognition Act reform was being approached. Over the next few months, she was hounded from her position and from the party by those who did not want her concerns to be heard.\nHere is what Caroline said to me: 'While women were targeted and abused predominantly by men, many of our political representatives looked away. Those who were directly approached dismissed women's concerns using the disingenuous excuse that both sides were as bad as each other. They seemed to think this gave them immunity from their responsibilities to women and permission to ignore safeguarding.\n'Politicians owe women a massive apology. Had they listened to women's concerns, they potentially could have avoided the nation laughing at them as they tried to justify their decision in the face of the Isla Bryson scandal.'\nCaroline is right. I would like to see an apology to women like her and an amnesty to let them rejoin the SNP should they wish to. Readers should be in no doubt that the way in which this issue has been dealt with by the SNP comes up repeatedly on the doorstep and is a factor influencing former SNP voters who are now undecided. It needs to be put to bed with an apology to those who were pilloried and a firm purpose of amendment to do politics better in future.\nSection 15A of the GRRB declares that 'for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this act modifies the Equality Act 2010'. The court gave this empty claim short shrift. This sort of declaratory nonsense designed to prevent a proper inquiry into factual reality should be consigned to the dustbin of history along with the UK Government's bill declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As the Labour MP Chris Bryant said during the debate in the House of Commons this week: 'You can no more change reality by law or legal dictate than you can by mere imagination'.\nI hope all those tempted to legislate in future to enshrine the belief that gender identity trumps biological sex and that a man can become a woman simply by declaring himself to be so will reflect on these wise words.",

After backstage discussions at the SNP conference in Spring 2019 it was agreed that I would chair a committee to look at the implications of Brexit for the England/Scotland border, after an independent Scotland rejoins the EU. My plan was to take evidence from a variety of people and bodies and then to draw up a paper which would inform party policy for the next independence referendum so that party spokespersons and activists could have answers to the questions on this topic posed so often by journalists and members of the public. Despite prompting, this project never got off the ground. I hope that if conference passes this motion the resources and wherewithal will be found to make it happen.\nBrexit and the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) between the UK and the EU have created hard borders between Scotland and the EU. Free movement of people has gone and the TCA is a basic trade deal which eliminates customs tariffs on goods provided they meet certain rules regarding their origin, but does little to reduce non-tariff barriers such as the specialist paperwork necessitated by the EU’s strict rules on animal and plant health (sanitary and phytosanitary requirements). This is what has caused such disruption to freight and the seafood industry since Brexit happened. When Scotland rejoins the EU, the hard borders which Brexit and the TCA have created with the EU will go but we will trade with England and Wales on the same terms as other EU states meaning new checks and processes will be required on trade across the Anglo-Scottish border. Given the current high volume of trade between Scotland and England this could be disruptive. The question is to what extent can the risk of a hard border between an independent Scotland and rUK be avoided?\nThere is a huge body of expert opinion and advice to draw upon in answering this question. SNP MPs, particularly those of us who sat on the Brexit Select Committee, the Committee on the Future Relationship with the EU and the International Trade Select Committee, have amassed a significant amount of learning on how borders work not just in Europe but across the world. Making use of this knowledge base in preparation for independence is exactly the sort of preparatory work in which SNP MPs should be engaged. Such work will contribute far more to the cause of independence than speeches which fall on deaf ears and work on parliamentary initiatives which have no hope in the face of the Tory majority delivered at the December 2019 General Election. While it is very important that SNP MPs carry out our parliamentary duties on behalf of constituents, our efforts as a political group could be better employed.\nThere is a further significant body of independent opinion on the border issue to draw on, thanks to the work of Dr Kirsty Hughes and the sadly now defunct Scottish Centre for European Relations (SCER) and others. In March 2020, SCER published a report; ‘An Independent Scotland in the EU; Issues for Accession.’, which brought together fifteen expert views on what an independent Scotland’s accession process to the EU might look like and the implications of independence in the EU, while the rUK remained outside the EU. Chapters written by an expert on the Northern Ireland Brexit border issue and Professors of EU law and Economics look at the implications of the Scotland-rUK border for the movement of people, goods trade and Scotland’s economy. This report predates the TCA, however SCER and Dr Hughes have published extensive further commentary on the implications of that Agreement. Another useful resource published post the TCA in March 2021 by Edinburgh University’s Centre on Constitutional Change is ‘Scotland’s new choice: Independence after Brexit’. Edited by Eve Hepburn, Michael Keating and Nicola McEwen, this book includes chapters on the economy, international trade, currency options, immigration, EU membership and interdependence. In the same month the Institute for Government also published a report on ‘Scottish Independence; EU membership and the Anglo-Scottish border’. All these publications are available online.\nA degree of consensus about the issues emerges. The free movement of people across the Anglo-Scottish border could be addressed by Scotland opting out of the Schengen zone and staying within the Common Travel area which covers Great Britain and Ireland. Goods trade is more problematic. But trade frictions would harm rUK exporters as much as Scottish exporters so there would be strong incentives on both sides to reduce them as much as possible. Scotland is likely to want to improve infrastructure to facilitate direct routes to mainland Europe avoiding the need to travel through England to the continent. Likewise, Scotland will want to increase the volume of its trade with other EU countries, as Ireland has done since its EU accession in 1973, but this won't happen overnight.\nTrade in services is important because both Scotland and rUK are service dominated economies. The EU single market in services unlike goods is far from complete and there would therefore be scope for Scotland and rUK to agree sectoral deals on services and to grant each other’s citizens favourable visa terms.\nSo, the border between an independent Scotland and rUK need not be the hard border some have predicted. Talk of a Great Wall of Gretna is ridiculous. Scots are likely to have the best of both worlds with free movement of persons across the EU and rUK but we need to address the issue of customs and regulatory checks for goods.\nThe conference motion seems to envisage that any Borders Commission should also consider the potential benefits of EFTA/EEA membership. This would mean membership of EFTA and the single market but not the customs union thus opening up the possibility of separate deals on fisheries and agriculture. The Alba party have suggested that if Scotland joined EFTA and the EEA and stayed in a Customs union with the UK the chances of a hard border between Scotland and England would be diminished. However, this policy choice would mean both a customs border with the EU and a regulatory border with rUK. Furthermore, members of EFTA are obliged to try to join the existing EFTA free trade agreements with third parties which would not be possible if Scotland remained in a Customs Union with rUK. Besides, if we did, Scotland would be obliged to follow the trade policy of rUK which would hamper our efforts to distance ourselves from Brexit Britain.\nSo, the EFTA/EEA solution is not the silver bullet that is sometimes suggested, particularly as it is clear from the TCA that even outwith the Common Fisheries Policy an independent Scotland will struggle to secure the sort of deals on fisheries that were promised in the event of Brexit but have failed to materialise.\nThis is just a flavour of the serious issues to be grappled with. Our job in the SNP is to endeavour to find solutions. It won’t be easy but there is a wealth of expertise to draw on and the hard work needs to start without further delay.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_boris-johnson-may-break-his-furlough-promise/content_77.html": "Boris Johnson may break his furlough promise, he has form\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 02nd Nov 2020\nOver the weekend the news that the UK Government was refusing to commit to making the full 80% furlough scheme available to Scotland outwith the English lockdown period brought almost universal condemnation. From the STUC to the Scottish Sun editorial there was support for the Scottish Government’s localised approach to tackling the virus and the notion that the furlough must be available when Scotland needs it. Even Douglas Ross seemed belatedly to agree. However, the First Minister and Kate Forbes found it impossible to get a clear undertaking from UK Government Ministers and it appeared that the broad shoulders of the union were not nearly as broad as we were led to believe.\nUnder questioning at Westminster this afternoon, the Prime Minister twisted and turned. His responses to Ian Blackford and other SNP MPs were evasive and conveyed the impression that furlough would only be available throughout the UK for the next month. Not until Douglas Ross got to his feet did the PM seem to commit to making furlough available to other parts of the UK when it was needed there as opposed to only when necessitated by the situation in the south of England. Or did he?\nBoris Johnson is the type of banker, as the old saying goes, who will gladly lend you an umbrella when the sun is shining but wants it back at the first sign of rain. So, it is reasonable to fear that while Scotland can have crucial furlough support now when the Scottish Government is trying to avoid a full lockdown there is no guarantee the money will be available later if the Scottish Government needs it. Moreover, no matter what the Tories say today it is not safe to rely on their promises for future planning. In Brussels, Paris, Berlin and Dublin they know that that this Tory Government’s word is not its bond. If they are prepared to renege on their international legal obligations how much more likely are they to break yet another promise made to the people of Scotland.\nWhat’s really going on here? Was the PM’s latest dance of the seven veils this afternoon just part of a carefully choreographed charade to present the new Scottish Tory leader with a concession which can be spun as a good news story in the face of terrible opinion polls for the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party and their little helpers in Scotland? And will it be conveniently forgotten weeks down the line?\nEither way there is real anger and frustration in Scotland. For months the SNP have asked for an extension of the furlough scheme and been told that it was not possible. Then, well beyond the 11th hour when stricter measures were necessitated by the spread of the virus in the south of England, we are told that the scheme is to be extended for a month.\nFor many it is already far too late. Before this last-minute announcement many businesses had already taken devastating decisions. As a result of Tory policy across the UK thousands have lost their jobs unnecessarily, many good businesses have gone under, and millions have been excluded. We now face a Tory unemployment crisis - and the blame lies firmly with Boris Johnson and the strait-jacket of the UK.\nWhat we should take from this situation is really quite clear. This union is no union of equals. Devolution is not working, and Scotland needs to be in full control of her own affairs. The plans to ensure that we take back control sooner rather than later should be expedited.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_supreme-court/content_61.html": "Supreme Court Judgement\nI note the UK Supreme Court’s judgment on the interpretation of the Scotland Act which settles the disputed issue of the devolved parliament’s competency to hold an independence referendum, although not in the way I would have liked.\nMost of us assumed that the UK was, like the EU, a consensual union. I am puzzled by the court's suggestion that the principle of self-determination is “not in play here” and will need to study the judgment on this issue carefully. Scotland, unlike Quebec, is an ancient nation, which was a state in its own right before it entered into a consensual union with England in 1707. Are the UKSC saying Scotland is perpetually trapped by force of law in what was a union of consent?\nIf the UK Government had any respect at all for Scottish democracy, this court hearing would not have been necessary. At the 2021 Scottish election voters elected a government with a manifesto commitment to hold a second independence referendum. The last time that happened, after the 2011 Scottish election, the UK Government respected that mandate and, after a period of negotiation, Alex Salmond and David Cameron entered into an agreement to put beyond doubt the legality of the independence referendum the Scottish parliament went on to hold. They also agreed that both governments would respect the result.\nSo, there is an established constitutional precedent of the right thing to do in these circumstances. The unwritten British constitution proceeds by way of custom and practice. If the UK Government respected their own constitution and democracy, they would replicate what happened a decade ago, come to the negotiating table and enter into a second Edinburgh Agreement. That they will not do that this time round is unconstitutional as well as a denial of democracy.\nJust think how English voters would have felt if, after they elected a Tory Government in 2015 with a manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union, the EU Commission had tried to block that referendum. You don’t need much imagination to envisage the outrage that would have prompted.\nI would also point out that the idea that voters in Scotland should have to wait indefinitely for another poll does not sit easy with the terms of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 which envisaged that a cross border poll on reunification of Ireland may be repeated after a period of 7 years. Why should Scottish democracy be curtailed in a way that Northern Irish democracy is not?\nThe solution is of course political. The reality now is that if the UK Government will not come to the negotiating table, then the only route to forcing them there is by the ballot box in an election.\nThe people who live in Scotland will determine our future and it's time for the promised Constitutional Convention to be convened to take matters forward.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_uk-not-help-women-ukraine/content_281.html": "It’s a disgrace UK is not doing more to help the women of Ukraine\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 11th Mar 2022\nOn Tuesday the atmosphere was electric when President Zelensky of Ukraine made his historic address to the House of Commons. The one-time comic actor who has in the past been mocked as a political novice showed yet again his gravitas, statesman like qualities, and his grit and determination on behalf of his people. Echoing Winston Churchill he said 'We will fight them in the sea, air, forests, fields and streets... we will not surrender'.\nSadly, the UK Prime Minister has always been more of a joke than a comedian and he’s certainly never been a statesman. Johnson is more Jim Hacker in Yes Prime Minister than Winston Churchill. This week brought one of Jim’s best quotes to mind – PM Hacker says “it doesn’t look good for the government to look heartless and feeble at the same time” to wit the official replies, “perhaps we could arrange it so we look feeble and heartless on different days”. Well, when it comes to the Ukraine refugee crisis, the UK Government is looking both heartless and feeble.\nAt Prime Minister’s questions Boris Johnson told lie after lie as he was repeated pressed on the UK’s woeful response. The performance of Priti Patel fangirling Zelensky in the House of Commons chamber while doing so little to help the people of Ukraine was nauseating, especially in the week she has been caught out lying to the House of Commons. On Monday, in an answer to Sir Roger Gale MP, she said that a visa application centre had been set up en route to Calais and that the Home Office had staff in Calais. We were later told that a visa centre would be set-up away from the port to avoid creating a choke point. Then it emerged that ‘en route’ meant in Lille, 70 miles away. Not only was it not true that there were UK visa processing staff at Calais, the promised visa centre in Lille was not going to accept walk-ins or appointments and its address would not be made public. The so called ‘pop-up’ centre would only be for people arriving at Calais and deemed highly vulnerable. Roger Gale wasn’t the only back bench Conservative angry with their own government with a number of heavy-weight Tories furious with the disaster at the Home Office. Meantime Patel has been busy complaining to the Irish Government that their open welcome to Ukraine refugees would allow them to reach the UK through the back door.\nYesterday morning I joined a cross party group of female MPs to have coffee with the Ukrainian Ambassdor’s wife. The poor woman was brave but distraught. Speaking with her impressed upon me the terrible burden Ukrainian women face as they flee their country with their children leaving their male relatives behind to fight, and uncertain of their destination. The majority of the now millions of refugees fleeing the country are women and children. What these women need is visa free access to the UK with their children. We must match the EU on this - no ifs and no buts. So let’s get on with it. It’s a disgrace that as the Commons marked International Women’s Day, the UK Government is not doing more for these women.\nOur European allies can afford visa free refuge safely and securely, so why can’t the Home Secretary? On TV we have seen queues of upset and exhausted refugees waiting in freezing conditions in Poland. I’ve heard from Scots assisting people that desperate families were thrown out of visa centres so staff could close for lunch after waiting for three hours.\nYesterday the Home Secretary was dragged to the chamber to announce that Ukrainians who have their passports can apply online, as we have all been calling for, and no longer need to get to a visa centre in a 3rd country to have their photograph taken for facial recognition and fingerprints digitally recorded. But there are other ways to address our security concerns after the arrival of refugees, as we do with non-visa nationals and what we did with evacuated Afghans. Not long after she made her statement we heard that the message had not got through to the hapless officials on the ground actually administering the system…\nGovernment lies and obfuscation don’t stop at the Home Office. On Tuesday I asked the Foreign Secretary what she was going to do about the humanitarian aid which is getting stuck at Dover for days or impounded in France as a result of post-Brexit customs rules and volunteers not having the correct paperwork. Her response was to rudely deny that any problems caused by Brexit existed. She didn’t remotely engage with the question and instead rather tersely reminded us that the public are encouraged to donate money to organisations like the Disasters Emergency Committee rather than collect items like blankets, medical supplies and other practical items. But charities and volunteer groups in Scotland are already working in partnership with organisations in Poland, Romania and elsewhere to identify what is needed and try and get it to those in need.\nI have tabled a series of questions to the Department for International Trade and HMRC to put pressure on UK Government to work with their EU counterparts to open up routes for humanitarian aid. I have also written, along with my constituent Oleg Demitriv, to the Scottish Government to see what help and support we can give. Oleg is part of a grass roots volunteer group in Edinburgh organised by people with family in Ukraine. Thankfully, due to Oleg’s business experience of imports and exports their lorries of aid have already reached Ukraine with more on the way. Also, in my constituency, Refugee Action Scotland have been working with expert couriers to get aid to Romania for Ukrainian refugees crossing the border. They are now seeking larger temporary storage facilities with space to accommodate a large transporter – look them up if you can help.\nPeople in Scotland wanting to offer a room to refugees can register with Positive Action in Housing.\nOn International Women’s Day I raised with Kevin Forster, the Immigration Minister, the case of Oleg’s nieces stuck in Ukraine, noting the vulnerability of women in warzones. They were reluctant to flee because what they were hearing on the news made them think it would be very difficult for them to join their uncle in Scotland. They asked him why they should risk their lives to get to a third country when the likelihood of their getting a visa to join him seemed vanishingly small. Foster glibly told me there was a “good chance” they would be accepted. Hopefully after yesterday’s climb down and now they no longer need to get to a UK Visa Centre first there is greater hope that they can come here.\nIt’s worth remembering that, at present, in order to get a visa, Ukrainians need to have family in the UK who are either UK citizens or permanent residents. A Ukrainian student or someone on a work visa couldn’t bring their parents or siblings to safety. Unlike the Syrian or Afghan resettlement schemes which were funded by Government, at some point there is to be a community sponsor scheme where community groups can come together to welcome and fund the resettlement of a refugee family. This already happens on a small scale in Scotland. But Oleg tells me, “I can go to Edinburgh Zoo and sponsor a penguin, what is this a pet refugee for community groups? It’s ridiculous!” His words are harsh but understandable, and, with all due respect to the good people who want to sponsor refugees, this is not a solution to the immediate and large scale problem. It may be many months before anyone is able to use this route when the crisis is now and growing by the day.\nThis UK Government is heartless and feeble and Ministers routinely mislead parliament. It’s a mark of the weakness of Westminster’s so called “sovereign” parliament that we cannot stop it. The refugee support from the UK is in sharp contrast to the EU’s generous offer of visa-free refuge. For now, though, Scots must do what we can at a volunteer level to help. SNP MPs at Westminster will keep on pushing the UK Government and calling out their failure.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_hard-questions-ahead-of-indyref2/content_295.html": "We must not shy away from hard questions ahead of indyref2\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 04th Feb 2022\nAmidst all the sound and fury of the unveiling of Sue Gray’s report this week the 2-year anniversary of Brexit passed with little fanfare.\nBut 31st January 2020 was quite a momentous day in Scotland with grassroots demonstrations across the country, including outside Holyrood, and a major speech from the First Minister setting out the next steps on the road to independence.\nThe FM’s speech contained a number of important announcements. She renewed her commitment to securing a second referendum by means of a section 30 order but did not rule out the alternative of putting an indyref bill through Holyrood, without Westminster’s permission, and defending it in court if necessary. She said that she wanted the referendum to be held in 2020 but conceded it was more likely to be held after the Scottish parliament election in 2021. She outlined a plan to invite Scotland’s elected representatives – MSPs, MPs, the MEPs elected in the last UK EU elections in 2019 and council leaders – to come together to endorse a modern Claim of Right for Scotland through a new Constitutional Convention. And last but not least she promised a series of “New Scotland” policy papers to provide the detail on how Scotland could make the transition from a Yes vote to becoming an independent country.\nAll of that generated quite a bit of its own sound and fury but I was of the view that there was much to welcome in the speech. No-one could have foreseen that less than 2 months later we would be entering a period of lockdown as a result of the worst health pandemic in living memory. And of course all that followed has knocked events off course.\nBut now we are assured that things are back on track, a referendum is planned for next year and a team of civil servants are working on those policy papers. Despite Ian Murray’s ludicrous intervention earlier this week that work is legitimate, and it should continue. The civil service is supposed to assist the elected government to delivers its manifesto promises. Ian Murray’s letter to Simon Case, the Cabinet Secretary and chief UK civil servant, suggesting that this work was an abuse of tax-payers money was at face value profoundly undemocratic and in truth I suspect just mischief making. Nevertheless it was good to see other unionists such as Professor Adam Tomkins argue that Ian Murray was wrong and that the SNP Government must be allowed to pursue the goal of independence with help from civil servants.\nIt's widely accepted now that a new prospectus is required for independence not just because of Brexit but also because of the significant change in the economic conditions as a result of the pandemic. The commitment to tackle the climate emergency also necessitates a different focus for Scotland’s economic future.\nOne of the most important issues the civil service team will need to work on under the guidance of Scottish government ministers is the management of Scotland’s borders after independence which was the subject of a major new report published yesterday. The report is the work of two well respected experts in the field, Katy Hayward, Professor of Political Sociology at Queens University Belfast and Nicola McEwen, Professor of Territorial Politics at the University of Edinburgh, both fellows at the leading think tank UK in a Changing Europe.\nThey say it is not intended to be a comprehensive report, more of a first step in raising some of the issues that might come up if Scottish independence were to result in an EU border across Britain. However it covers a lot of important ground and has already been welcomed by experts in EU relations such as Dr Kirsty Hughes as “detailed and insightful”.\nThe report is much more than just a discussion of tariffs and checks on goods as it also explores the challenges of the movement of people, services, capital and digital data across borders. Nor is it just about border management and control, it also touches on economics and the issue of how an independent Scotland might accede to the EU and manage the transition to full membership.\nAs well as exploring the challenges for our trading relationship with England, the report alludes to the positive benefits of an independent Scotland’s membership of the EU and the ‘de-bordering’ that would be effected in our relations with Europe opening up the markets of the 31 countries in the EU single market.\nAnother positive is that the authors are clear in their expectation that Scotland would secure an opt-out from the EU Schengen Agreement on a similar basis to Ireland. So no more scare stories about the difficulty of visiting your relatives down south or indeed going to live, study or work there as Scotland would remain in the Common Travel area which permits British and Irish citizens to move freely and live, work, study and access services across the islands of Britain and Ireland.\nThe report concludes that if we want to instil confidence in the transition to independence then we need a detailed prospectus which confronts the challenges that Brexit has presented including managing the movement of goods, services and people across our borders. I could not agree more. When framing policy its unwise to shy away from the hard questions and to dismiss valid concerns. As we have seen with the Northern Irish protocol debacle and indeed in controversial matters closer to home it only leads to more problems. It is inevitable that any new prospectus for independence will be pored over. There’s a heavy weight of responsibility on the Scottish Government Ministers leading the work commenced by the new civil service team but as this new report shows there is a wealth of expertise to draw on.\nWe should look forward with optimism to the unveiling of the policy papers and hope too that the constitutional convention idea will be revived but with a commitment to involve the grassroots of the Yes movement.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_disappointing-actions-from-sunak/content_40.html": "Fine words but disappointing actions so far from Rishi Sunak\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 28th Oct 2022\nOne of the main jobs of a member of parliament is to scrutinise legislation. It can be quite demanding while at the same time quite dull. But it is really important. You elect us to do it so you don’t have to. It is our duty and, compared to most of the population, we are paid quite handsomely for it.\nIt is tempting sometimes to leave the job to others, experts, lobbyists, interest groups or just to trot through the lobby or press the button indicated by the party whips, but parliamentarians should not abdicate their responsibility in that way. It is our duty to look diligently at the bills we are called to vote upon to be certain they won’t have adverse or unintended consequences for our constituents.\nOf course, this applies equally to Holyrood as to Westminster. As to the former we don’t have to look too far for an example of a bill which has caused huge controversy and the unintended consequences of which many feminist campaigners and those with knowledge and experience of safeguarding believe MSPs have not considered as fully as they should.\nReaders know my views on the Gender Recognition Reform Bill which passed its first stage yesterday. It allows anyone (not just trans people) to self-identify as the opposite sex with next to no meaningful safeguards and therefore carries with it inevitable risks that I do not believe have been properly acknowledged or considered. While reform of the Gender Recognition Act was a manifesto commitment of the SNP and others, in the case of the SNP, self-identification was not a manifesto commitment and many of us have legitimate concerns about it. Unfortunately, too few have had the courage to speak out. The bill owes its genesis to a lobby group to which I believe many parliamentarians have abdicated their legislative responsibilities, largely out of fear of the consequences for their careers (and, as I know, sometimes personal safety) of doing otherwise. However, I am not going to write about that today. Instead, I am going to write about our new PM and his legislative programme because that is how we should judge him, as we should any leader. At present the right-wing press are whipping themselves up into a frenzy over Rishi Sunak as the saviour of the Tory party and there is a sense that the adults are back in the room and that normal service has been resumed. There is a kernel of truth in this, PM Sunak will be a more formidable ally for the SNP and, indeed the Labour party. Unlike his immediate predecessors he is not a lying charlatan, or a foolish deluded ideologue. But what is he? Let us judge him by his actions. ‘Deeds not words’ as the suffragettes used to say.\nOn Tuesday outside Downing Street, our new PM made a fine if rather robotic speech about how he would fix the mistakes of his predecessors, and work to restore lost trust. He said his would be a government marked by integrity, professionalism, and accountability… and then he reappointed Suella Braverman as his Home Secretary. In a sense that could be the end of this column. By her actions in brazenly breaking the Ministerial Code seemingly for her own internal party-political benefit, Ms Braverman has proved herself to be neither professional nor a person of integrity. By reappointing her the PM has also put his own integrity and professionalism in question and made a mockery of his promise of accountability.\nBut enough about Ms Braverman, many column inches have been expended on her and anyway the facts speak for themselves. She should be nowhere near high office never mind one of the most important and troubled departments of state. I want to test our new PM’s promises against his legislative priorities.\nAs he rose to speak on Tuesday morning Westminster was rife with rumours that the bill which was to receive its second reading that afternoon would be pulled. The Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill is designed to make it easy for ministers to bin many of the regulations which entered domestic law in the UK by virtue of our EU membership. The bill will enable Ministers to get rid of workers’ rights, environmental protections, and food safety standards with next to no parliamentary scrutiny. It represents a huge power grab by the executive, hardly the sort of accountability our new PM was promising. It will also allow UK ministers to act in policy areas that are devolved without the consent of the Scottish Government or Parliament, hardly what one might expect from the avowed intention of the new PM to work with the devolved governments.\nIt is absolutely not about ‘taking back control’ so far as parliament or the people are concerned. Instead, it’s about empowering UK Government ministers to legislate and to side-line parliament. It also risks creating considerable legal uncertainty. Opposition to it has united business and legal experts with trade unions, environmentalists, opposition parties and the devolved governments.\nThere are some very curious provisions in the bill affecting the role and function of Scotland’s law officers. In his speech Sunak also promised to put “the country’s needs above politics.” There is more than one country in the UK. Would he respect the wishes of Scottish voters, the devolved settlement, and his duty to preserve Scotland’s separate and distinct legal system which was underwritten by the Act of Union?\nRumours that the incoming PM would pull the bill reached fever pitch when its author and champion, Jacob Rees Mogg, resigned with barely an hour or two to go before the debate on the second reading of the bill was due to start. The bill is prompted by the sort of extremist Brexit ideology Rees-Mogg typifies. A desperation to point to some so-called Brexit benefits. Yes, Sunak was a Brexiteer, but we hoped he was one of the more sensible ones.\nLegal experts have warned the bill is badly drafted and could lead to chaos. You would think we had had enough of that. Liz Truss has left a mess behind her by pursuing an economic policy most people, including Rishi Sunak, advised her against. Surely, he would not make a similar mistake with huge swathes of the law. Surely the new PM would not pursue another dangerous ideological experiment at the cost of our constituents’ rights and livelihoods? At the cost of our ongoing good relationship with the EU and undermining the Northern Ireland protocol? At the cost of the environment? At the cost of his party’s beloved union?\nBut he did and the bill went ahead. The debate was depressing. Very few MPs spoke about the real problems the bill poses or came to listen. By the time I got called to speak tumbleweed was blowing across some of the benches. The government’s summing up speech did not address any of the issues raised in the debate (as it is supposed to do). Instead it was delivered by the bombastic fool who set off the Tory rammy in the lobbies last week when he wrongly told his colleagues that the vote on fracking was not a confidence vote.\nThe bill passed and just as it did, we heard Dominic Raab was back as Deputy PM and Justice Secretary, meaning that the Bill of Rights, buried by Liz Truss’s government in one of its few rational acts, will be back, tearing up the Human Rights Act and watering down rights protections across the UK. In Scotland, despite a compliant UK media telling us ‘it’s all right now’ and pushing a nonsense line that the ‘grownups are back’ we know that this is really not a different sort of government and it never will be.",

That is why the Scottish Government is committed to taking action to halve the disability employment gap. Leonard Cheshire’s award-winning Change 100 programme works with employers to help them better understand the complexity of disabilities and to better support their employees through specialist advice, training and support. Through Change 100, businesses can become leading disability-inclusive employers. I would urge employers to sign up for the programme and play their part in enabling all of Scotland’s people to achieve their full potential in the world of work.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_tory-attack-on-scottish-legal-powers/content_225.html": "Tory attack on Scottish legal powers is a test for the Union\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 04th Sep 2020\nSNP MPs went back to Westminster this week facing a fight against Tory plans to curtail the powers of the Scottish parliament in order to create a post Brexit “internal market” in the UK. Sadly, this is unlikely to be a fight we can win at Westminster. Last year’s General Election delivered a huge majority for Boris Johnson and took away the leverage the SNP had in the previous hung parliament. But what’s done is done and whilst we cannot win the fight at Westminster, we can win it in the court of public opinion. The polls suggest this is already happening.\nUltimately most readers of this paper know that the only way to protect Scotland’s parliament is by achieving our independence from Westminster rule. Winning more hearts and minds to that point of view is an important task and one to which SNP MPs can contribute albeit that Holyrood will be the engine room in which the next independence referendum is delivered.\nThis week I led for the SNP on the first of a number of legalistic bills required as a consequence of Brexit. On this occasion, it was a bill to ensure Scotland and the UK continue to be part of international agreements regulating cross border financial support and custody disputes in the field of family law.\nThis bill is relatively uncontroversial, and Holyrood has granted a Legislative Consent Motion. However, the Brexit process has told us that where Holyrood does not grant legislative consent the Tories are still prepared to go full steam ahead to deliver their programme, despite its rejection by the overwhelming majority of Scottish voters.\nThis is a big problem particularly as it seems the fight over the post Brexit internal market is not the only attempt to undermine the Scottish Parliament which we are likely to encounter. Quite separately from Brexit there is another potential threat looming not only to Holyrood’s powers but also to the independence of Scotland’s legal system.\nAt the end of July the Lord Chancellor, England’s Justice Secretary, announced an “Independent Review of Administrative Law”. The terms of reference make it pretty clear they are looking to “reform” the process of judicial review across the UK, ignoring Scotland’s separate and distinct legal system and the fact that the system of civil justice in Scotland is fully devolved.\nJudicial Review is the means by which the legality of Government actions and decisions can be challenged in the courts. Perhaps the best-known recent example of a judicial review case is the prorogation case in which the UK Supreme Court ruled that the UK Government’s attempt to shut down parliament for 6 weeks was unlawful. However, judicial review is also used more routinely by litigants challenging government decisions in the fields of immigration and asylum, housing, environmental and welfare. The WASPI women are currently challenging the unfair changes to state pension ages by way of judicial review.\nThe Government want to reduce or limit these cases so as to reduce scrutiny of their actions. Johnson, Cummings and Gove are still sore from the defeat inflicted upon them in the UK Supreme Court. Priti Patel, and many Tory backbenchers, are livid about the number of high-profile immigration cases raised by way of judicial review that they have lost since the turn of the year.\nLast week official government channels shared an animation of deportation flights leaving the UK claiming that ‘activist lawyers’ are delaying the removal of immigrants. But it is not the lawyers who are delaying the flights it’s the courts and they would not do so unless they had found that the UK Government has acting unlawfully or outwith its powers. Lord Faulks, a former Tory minister now a crossbench peer, is to chair the review. His track record does not inspire confidence. He has advocated repeal of the Human Rights Act and a UK exit from the European Convention on Human Rights. He was also vocal in his disapproval of the Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling in the prorogation case. To ask us to see him as an impartial chair is an insult to our intelligence.\nTo understand why the UK Government are so keen to make sure that the scope for challenging their actions is the same north and south of the border it is important to remember the significant influence the Scottish courts had on the outcome of the prorogation case. Two separate legal challenges were brought against the prorogation, one by Gina Miller in the English courts and the other in the Scottish courts by a group of MPs and Peers led by me. At first instance the English Divisional court rejected Gina Miller’s challenge and it took three judges sitting in the Inner House of the Court of Session, Scotland’s Supreme Court, to breathe new life into the cases when they ruled that the prorogation was unlawful. Two weeks later eleven UK Supreme Court judges unanimously followed the Scottish courts lead.\nMake no mistake about it, that is why the Scottish courts are now in the UK Government’s sights. Where UK Government actions have implications across the UK, they can be challenged by litigants affected in either jurisdiction. If Judicial review is curtailed in England only then challenges could still take place in the Scottish courts.\nHowever, the UK Government would be absolutely wrong to interfere with the scope for judicial review in Scotland.\nJudicial review is part of our system of civil justice which is a devolved matter under the Scotland Act and therefore the preserve of the Scottish Parliament. Moreover, the authority and privileges of the Court of Session including its inherent supervisory jurisdiction are protected by Article 19 of the Treaty of Union which states “That the Court of Session or College of Justice do after the Union and notwithstanding thereof remain in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted by the Laws of that Kingdom and with the same Authority and Privileges as before the Union subject nevertheless to such Regulations for the better Administration of Justice as shall be made by the Parliament of Great Britain.”\nLegislation which sought to narrow the scope of the court’s powers and to curtail the right to judicial review could scarcely be described as “for the better administration of justice”. It has been suggested that some parts of the Treaty of Union including Article 19 are so fundamental that the UK parliament does not have the power to legislate in contravention of them, but that argument has never been definitively tested in court. If the Tories intend to attack the right to judicial review in Scotland, then this might be the opportunity to get a court to definitively answer this question. The outcome could have a potential knock on effects for the union.\nMy fellow prorogation case litigant, Jo Maugham QC, has said it would be foolish for the UK Government to try to rewrite the Treaty of Union and undermine Scotland’s separate legal system at a time when Brexit has already delivered majority support for independence in the polls. Yet, on the face of it, that is just what the Tories intend to do. I have written to the Lord Chancellor outlining my concerns. His answer should make interesting reading. Watch this space.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_ten-minute-rule-bill-on-scottish-law-officers/content_101.html": "Ten Minute Rule Bill on Scottish Law Officers - Devolution\nOn 10th January 2024 I introduced a private member’s bill at Westminster designed to give the Scottish parliament the power to amend the role of Scotland’s law officers including dividing the role of the Lord Advocate into two separate jobs. One as head of the Scotland’s prosecution service, and the other as a minister of the Scottish Government and its Chief Legal Advisor. The present Lord Advocate performs both roles and legal scholars and politicians are becoming increasingly concerned that this may give rise to a conflict of interest. No criticism of the current or previous Lord Advocate or of the SNP Government should be implied because the dual role of the Lord Advocate is a historical anachronism which predates devolution.\nThe dual role was rubber stamped by the devolution settlement and to date no Tory or Labour Government has attempted reform. I believe reform is long overdue and I was very pleased when the SNP Manifesto for the 2021 Holyrood election promised to consult on separating the roles. The Scottish Government has committed to review the role of the Lord Advocate by the end of the current parliament, the initial phase of which is to be informed by expert research. I understand that a report will be published soon. However, because of reservations under the Scotland Act 1998 it is not open to the Scottish parliament to either create a new law officer or a new public prosecutor. That is why my bill is necessary.\nThe Lord Advocate is the senior of the two Scottish law officers. The other is the Solicitor General. The Lord Advocate is both a Minister in the Scottish Government and the holder of a historic office which has a range of functions associated with the maintenance of the rule of law and the proper administration of justice.\nShe is head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths and principal legal adviser to the Scottish Government. She also represents the Scottish Government in civil proceeding and the public interest in a range of statutory and common law civil and constitutional functions.\nThe Scotland Act states that in relation to criminal prosecutions and investigation of deaths the Lord Advocate must act independently of other Ministers and, indeed, of any other person. Alex Salmond took steps to underline this independence by depoliticising the appointment process and providing that the law officers should not routinely attend cabinet meetings. The downside of this was that it deprived the Government of the benefit of advice from a lawyer who shares their political persuasion, which was always previously available.\nThe Lord Advocate is appointed by the King on the recommendation of the First Minister, with the agreement of the Scottish Parliament. Unlike other Ministers she cannot be removed from office by the First Minister without the approval of the Parliament.\nThe Lord Advocate also has an important role in relation to ensuring that legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament is within the legislative competence of the Parliament and has powers under the Scotland Act in relation to the resolution of legal questions about the devolved powers of Ministers and the Parliament. We saw this during the ill-fated trip to the UK Supreme Court to find out whether the Scottish parliament had legislative competence to hold another independence referendum. Some, like myself believed an argument could be made for a competent bill, others did not, the current Lord Advocate was not sure, and the rest is, as they say, history. With the benefit of advice from a senior lawyer who supported the cause of independence I think things might have turned out rather differently. At the very least the tactics might have been more politically savvy.\nAccountability to the Scottish Parliament is an important aspect of the Lord Advocate's constitutional role. She may but need not be an MSP. If not an MSP, she is entitled to participate in the proceedings of the Parliament but may not vote. She can therefore be questioned by MSPs about the exercise of her functions, although she is not required to answer questions or produce documents relating to the operation of the system of criminal prosecution about specific cases.\nThere is a tension between the principle that the Lord Advocate should be both independent in her capacity as chief prosecutor but also politically accountable as a law officer. The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe which advises member states on Rule of Law issues recommends they take steps to ensure that their state prosecution systems are seen to act independently of parliament and government.\nElsewhere in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland the two roles are held by different people to avoid any possible conflict of interest or the perception of such conflict. In England there is an Attorney General who is a member of the government of the day, and a Director of Public Prosecutions who is appointed by a public appointment process completely independent of the government. The Lord Chancellor is a third office which performs some constitutional functions. The experts currently advising the Scottish Government might also want to think about something akin to this third role for some of the Lord Advocate’s functions under the Scotland Act.\nConcern about the potential conflicts in the role of the Lord Advocate have increased because of recent high-profile cases including the Scottish Government’s handling of complaints against Alex Salmond, the Rangers FC malicious prosecution scandal and the police investigation into SNP finances.\nThe report of the Scottish Parliament’s inquiry into the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints found that events showed a long-standing tension in the dual roles of the Lord Advocate, and they said that “public perception” was important.\nI believe that it is important that the role of Chief Prosecutor be free from all suspicion of political interference. I also believe it is important that the Scottish Government have the benefit of a legal advisor who shares their political views while still giving independent advice. That after all is what the English, Welsh and Irish governments enjoy. Their law officers are usually parliamentarians from the same party as the government of the day.\nThe Scottish Government has accepted that there is a case for separating the roles. Both the current Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack and his shadow Ian Murray are in support. As are the Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar and the Scottish Conservatives. My bill has support from the Liberal Democrats and Alba as well as SNP colleagues.\nI hope that the existence of cross-party support means it has a chance of becoming law, leaving the final decision where it should be, with the Scottish Parliament.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_internal-market-white-paper-threatens-devolution/content_234.html": "Politics is not on hold – we must keep independence in sight\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 24th Jul 2020\nA week has passed since the UK Government published its white paper on the UK Internal Market and commentators are largely united in agreeing that it poses a significant threat to the current devolved settlement.\nThe Tories proposals will cement the dominance of England in our unequal union through neutering devolution and putting the Westminster parliament firmly back in the driving seat in a range of policy areas which were devolved in 1998. Under the Scotland Act all powers except those expressly reserved are devolved. Brexit is not delivering new powers to Scotland. Within the EU Holyrood was bound by EU law in its exercise of devolved powers but in practice the EU afforded Holyrood quite a bit of discretion. Under the new arrangements the Tories propose to significantly curtail that discretion. If that’s not a power grab, then I don’t know what is.\nAileen McHarg, Professor of Public Law and Human Rights at the University of Durham, has explained that Holyrood will have to accept new cross cutting constraints on its ability to legislate to achieve policy goals orientated towards public health and the environment in a variety of areas including food standards. These constraints will be binding on Holyrood but not on Westminster, which, in the absence of an English parliament, legislates for England, so English standards will prevail.\nMichael Dougan, Professor of European law at the University of Liverpool has said the proposals could “cripple basic elements of devolution” and magnify England’s natural dominance in the union.\nThe White Paper’s consultation period is a measly four weeks over the holiday season and legislation will require to be passed by Christmas. An Act of Parliament will be bulldozered through by Boris Johnson’s substantial majority of English MPs. A Legislative Consent Motion will be required but when the Scottish parliament withholds its consent this will be ignored in the same way that it has been with other Brexit Bills. There will be no legal remedy because the UK Supreme Court has already told us that the Sewell Convention has no legal force.\nActs of the UK parliament cannot be challenged in court. Westminster could abolish the Scottish Parliament if it wanted to and no legal action could change that. But the Tories are not stupid enough to give the Independence movement the massive boost that would provide. Besides they don’t need to abolish Holyrood to get their way post Brexit. All they need to do is to emasculate it and that’s what they are intending to do.\nMike Russell is one hundred per cent right when he says the White Paper is a devious trick to disable devolution and that we should fight it. But the reality is that because “power devolved is power retained’ we cannot win this fight in the context of a devolved settlement which is designed to ensure Westminster’s supremacy. Nor, in the face of Westminster legislation, can we win this fight in the courts.\nSo, what is to be done?\nWell, first off, we must not fall into the trap of conceding that the fight against the Coronavirus and dealing with its economic fallout precludes pursuing the goal of independence. Politics is plainly not on hold. Brexit is proceeding at full speed. Devolution is under attack. The Tories are continuing to pursue their constitutional agenda. We must do likewise.\nThe debate about how we protect the powers of the devolved parliament is inextricably linked with the arguments for independence because the reality is that independence looks like the only way to ensure we can make our own policy choices , even in the areas which we thought had been devolved. How to secure a vote for independence in a way that will result in an outcome that will be respected internationally and therefore will be effective remains problematic. Of course, the route followed in 2014 is the gold standard. But we are in a very different world.\nA strategy which rests solely on the assumption that Boris Johnson will grant a section 30 order if the SNP win just one more mandate is a risky one. Boris Johnson is no respecter of mandates or indeed laws as we saw with the prorogation case and his defence of Dominic Cummings’ cross-country Covid rambles. Moreover, no Conservative and unionist PM wants to be the one on whose watch Scotland is lost and the loss would be even more ignominious for Boris Johnson because his behaviour and the Brexit he has delivered would be the catalyst for Scottish independence.\nFor now, it may be a comforting thought that his position is unsustainable but it’s a hope at best and that hope should not prevent us from looking at what other leverage we might have. I have suggested that we should test the legal argument that is within the competence of the Scottish Parliament to hold an independence referendum and I was delighted earlier this year when the FM indicated that was a route which might be pursued. A litigation currently before the Court of Session may enable this to be done and it will be interesting to see the response of the Scottish and British governments to Martin J Keatings’ legal challenge.\nWhile the rise in support for independence is to be welcomed, the battle for winning over hearts and minds should continue with fully developed policy positions on the challenges for Scottish independence in the post Brexit world. Dr Kirsty Hughes has argued that the white paper lays down a marker for a future argument that Scottish Independence would cut off Scotland from trade with the UK internal market.\nThis is a thistle which needs to be grasped.\nIn my experience knocking on doors in Edinburgh the issue of how to avoid a hard border with England in the event of independence troubles those who voted No in 2014 but who are open to changing their minds in the light of developments. They also want more information on how the process of accession to the EU would work and how long it would take.\nOn Brexit day earlier this year the FM promised policy papers addressing these issues. It is vital that these are now progressed and published. We need to make sure we have all the tools necessary to win the arguments for independence. The preservation of Scottish democracy depends upon it.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_scotland-constituent-assembly-for-independence/content_74.html": "Scotland should consider using a constituent assembly for independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 29th Oct 2021\nEveryone agrees an independent Scotland should have a written constitution. The only real debate is about how it should be drawn up and who should do that.\nAt the SNP conference in September Mike Russell announced that he wants to have a transitional constitution in place next year, ready for the indyref promised in 2023. There was some criticism. What Mike seemed to be envisaging was a constitution drawn up by a panel of self-selected experts albeit in consultation with the wider Yes movement. Lesley Riddoch argued that the job is too big for one party or even one side of the constitutional debate and that the task of framing the constitution should be handed over to the people. I agree with Lesley, but the difficulty is there may not be time to do that before 2023.\nThe SNP have been working on the idea of a written constitution for many years. The late great Prof Sir Neil McCormick QC, a former MEP and former Vice President of the party, did a considerable amount of work on what the constitution of an independent Scotland might look like between 1977 and 2002. He produced several drafts culminating in the publication of a Constitution for a Free Scotland in 2002. The text is on Wikipedia.\nDr Elliot Bulmer, author of a number of works on the Scottish constitution including: A Constitution for the Common Good: Strengthening Scottish Democracy after the Independence Referendum, has identified that since the SNP came to power in 2007 the focus changed from pre-independence constitution making to post independence constitution making.\nIn the summer of 2014, prior to the independence referendum, the Scottish Government carried out a consultation exercise on an interim Constitution for Scotland. They said:\n“The creation of a written constitution will be an important development for Scotland. A written constitution is more than a legal document. It is a statement of intent for the nation. The process of coming together to develop, draft and approve such a document is an important part of defining the sort of nation we wish Scotland to be.” I could not agree with this statement more.\nYesterday I spoke at a symposium on a written constitution for the UK at the Bonavero Institute of Human Rights at the University of Oxford. Those taking part had been asked to comment on a paper by Jeff King, a Law Professor at University College London, who argues that the UK should have a written constitution drawn up by a Constitutional Convention composed of both ordinary citizens and politicians. This is a little different from a Citizens’ Assembly in that the job of a Constituent Assembly would be not just to deliberate and to report but also to draw up the constitution and make sure it is delivered. For this political buy-in is required so that those who hold political power will accept and enact its recommendations.\nProf King thinks the Constituent Assembly should be made up one third of citizens and two thirds of professional politicians. Its job would be to represent the people and debate the right questions in an informed and complete manner. As with a Citizens’ Assembly experts will be on tap rather than on top, the constitution won’t be written by academics, constitutional and legal experts, but rather they will give evidence to and assist those writing in their deliberations. I really like this idea but not for the UK. Scotland would be too marginalised as but a small part of the UK. Besides it's not going to happen.\nBut I like it as an idea for Scotland. The proposal is not an entirely new one. In one of the key responses to the Scottish Government’s 2014 consultation Prof Alan Renwick, also of University College London, recommended a broadly similar approach to the Scottish Government and pointed to the precedent set by Ireland’s Constitutional Convention of 2012–14. He said the body chosen to devise the constitution “should comprise a majority of ordinary citizens chosen at random from the electoral register (though with the option to decline the invitation) and a minority of politicians chosen by parties.”\nHe also said it was important that the convention had the “time and resources for extended learning, deliberation, and decision phases, backed up by consultation with experts, activists, and ordinary citizens.” Finally, “the convention's recommendations should automatically be put to the people in a referendum. There should be no opportunity for political intercession at this stage.” He pointed to the failure of Iceland’s crowd sourced constitution project because party politicians were expressly excluded with the result that political legitimacy was weakened. “In Iceland, despite the quality of the Council's deliberations and despite a positive referendum vote for the implementation of its draft constitution, politicians who felt excluded from the process have blocked its enactment.”\nIn the Irish model concerns were initially raised that the mixture of two thirds citizens to one third elected politicians would not work because the politicians would dominate, and the ordinary citizens' voice would not be heard. Happily, the experience did not bear that out as the whole thing was properly moderated and facilitated.\nAfter the Constituent Assembly submits its constitutional recommendations, Prof Renwick proposed that the Scottish Government should put them to a referendum automatically, without further political interference, and respect the outcome of that referendum.\nIt’s a pity that Prof Renwick’s plan has not been actioned since 2014. I fear the reality is that there is not enough time to action it before 2023 and so Scotland will have to settle in the meantime for a transitional constitution written by an expert elite. It is imperative that we don’t do so without proper consultation with the general public and with civil society. And a firm commitment must be made that the transitional constitution will fall soon after independence happens and be replaced with one drafted by a Constituent Assembly.\nThis would fit with what Mike Russell is envisaging as he has been careful to emphasise that the constitution he has promised next year is strictly one for transitional purposes and that once independence is achieved “all the citizens of the new state can join in the effort.” Let’s make sure that happens.",

The Ayes Have It! The motion is – “This House believes Scotland should be independent.” Preparing my speech has provided a useful lens through which to view the news that has dominated this week’s political headlines.\nFor it seems despite dire warnings to the contrary during the 2014 Independence referendum, Scotland’s oil and gas has not run out after all, and some unionist politicians are now terribly interested in exploiting what remains. At the same time in order to mask their cavalier attitude towards the climate crisis the Tories have finally ended 18 years of dither and delay with a commitment to the major carbon capture project at Peterhead.\nWhat remains lacking is the strategic vision needed to deliver the net zero targets to which the Tories continue to pay lip service. Kate Forbes column in this newspaper on Wednesday was an important contribution to the debate about how we achieve those targets. I was pleased to read that Kate agrees with what I said last week about the importance of not letting the burden fall on those who can least afford it. However, we part company on how best to fund the transition. Whilst I agree with Kate that growing our economy and encouraging private investment is a good thing, I believe we also need to see the sort of state funding and leadership that we are seeing in the USA under Joe Biden.\nThe move to net zero can only work if the state devises an industrial and economic strategy to make it happen using the levers it has at its disposal. Therefore, I favour a move away from neo-liberal economics to a “productivist” economic model where the state is actively involved in growing the economy in a strategic way. Productivism is the term used by Harvard Professor of International Political Economy, Dani Rodrik to describe a socio-economic approach which gives government and community organisations a greater role in shaping investment and production with a view to supporting the creation of well-paid jobs, climate transition and more secure resilient societies.\nThis is the sort of thinking I would like to see the SNP adopt and take to the heart of government. We are not there yet. However, a mission led policy approach to transformative change echoes the thinking of another economist, Professor Mariana Mazzucatao who has in the past had the ear of the Scottish government when it comes to getting public and private sectors to work together.\nWhile it is good for the Westminster SNP Group to fund policy development, Ian Blackford’s “Roadmap for a green industrial future for Scotland” published last month didn’t discuss the sort of state led step change I believe is needed. Rather it seemed to be a call for doing more of what we have done before but doing it better, which only takes us so far. I think what Scotland and indeed the UK needs is a Green New Deal.\nThat phrase was first coined in the USA and advanced by politicians on the left of the Democratic party as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also tackling social problems like poverty and inequality. With this plan the path to net zero also involves the creation of well-paid jobs with government funded training and a focus on the communities where poverty and inequality most need to be tackled.\nIt takes its inspiration from the New Deal launched by Roosevelt to help America recover from the Great Depression combining huge public works programs with financial reforms.\nThe Biden administration has gone some way to putting the Green New Deal into action with an industrial strategy involving the world’s most generous package of climate incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act which is the USA’s Climate Change Bill. It is bold but it doesn’t go as far as the ambitious proposals of the Green New Deal and so it has been criticised by some on the Democrat left. But it’s a step in the right direction.\nScotland does not share the USA’s fear of socialism so a New Green Deal here should be easier to sell. However, it needs a political party to commit to it. While the Scottish Greens seem strangely focused on individualistic and private sector solutions to climate change, there is real space on the left for the SNP to step into the role of delivering change collectively.\nThe Common Weal policy think and do tank have produced some excellent work on what a Green New Deal would look like for Scotland so there is material there with which to work. During the pandemic they produced a Common Home Plan which you can read on their website. They described it as “a comprehensive Green New Deal for Scotland – a process of public planning, organised and implemented by public bodies and paid for out of the public purse. Just as the post-war governments across the West created whole new systems of welfare, healthcare, and infrastructure while also rebuilding Europe after the war, we will do the same for Scotland’s energy, agriculture and housing – with the same benefits of employment, prosperity, and skills. This is a plan not just for our environment, but for our economy and society as well.”",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_union-of-equals-would-furlough-when-needed/content_99.html": "Union of Equals would furlough when needed, not wait on England\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 06th Nov 2020\nThe attempts by Scottish Tories to benefit from this week’s furlough fiasco would be laughable if we weren’t talking about people’s livelihoods. The shambles that have occurred is no way to run a country let alone a supposed union of equals. While Scottish Ministers are trying to take important strategic decisions to protect public health, the Scottish Tories are more interested in trying to ensure Douglas Ross gets a win and puts out a zinger of a tweet. It was tragi-comic to observe how his efforts failed and such glory as he managed to obtain didn’t even last 12 hours. The efforts of David Mundell to pull off the same ‘feat’ the next day were truly pathetic.\nFinally, yesterday, with the PM pantomiming false joviality at his side (he’s obviously been to the same acting school as Ross, Mundell and Ronald Villiers), Rishi Sunak announced an extension of the furlough scheme until the end of March next year. He did so trumpeting the “strength of the union” and the importance of “reassuring people in Scotland” etc. But the damage has been done. Everyone knows that this is a decision to which the UK Government has been dragged kicking and screaming and that without an England wide lockdown it would never have happened.\nFor many jobs and businesses, the announcement came too late. Had the UK government been a step ahead rather than a step behind of what is happening; had they listened to the SNP, jobs and businesses could have been saved.\nAs Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, pointed out, this kind of support is not unique to the UK and many countries have done it more competently and generously than the UK. Plus, there are still 3 million people across the UK excluded from support because of their employment status.\nIt should come as no surprise to us that the Tories are less than enthusiastic when it comes to supporting ordinary people through the crisis. This is a Government and a party which was content to deny children in England free school meals during the half term break, even it meant some of them would go hungry. At the same time, they are showering companies run by their mates with millions of pounds under dodgy contracts. Under cover of the pandemic the Tories have ditched any pretence of open recruitment and procurement processes. Thank goodness the Good Law Project is currently pursuing some of these contracts through the courts.\nEarlier this week my colleague, Richard Thomson, MP for Gordon, coined the phrase #Cronyvirus and set a new hashtag running when he referred to reports that Kate Bingham, the head of the vaccine taskforce showed official sensitive Government documents to an event for US venture capitalists. Meantime the scandal over the appointment of Dido Harding as head of the failing English Test and Trace system rumbles on. Both women are married to Tory MPs. Harding is a mate of David Cameron from Oxford days. Bingham went to school with Johnson’s sister whilst her hubby was Eton chums with Boris. Neither had to go through a competitive process to get their jobs. Frankly, it stinks. Anyone who thinks these people play by the rules is either deluded or naïve.\nScotland has been calling for a full furlough extension, and the devolution of financial powers, for more than six months now - but the Tories have refused to listen and failed to act. When Scotland needed full furlough support Westminster said no. Let’s not kid ourselves. It was only when Johnson was convinced that the south of England needed to lock down that this money was forthcoming.\nIn a union of equals, one would expect additional financial support to be available when needed not just when the larger partner of the union deemed it necessary for itself. If the Tories are the defenders of the Union then why couldn’t they give the certainty needed to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that the same furlough guarantee was available to be drawn upon when needed without all this messing about? Instead, as Douglas Chapman noted in the Commons on Monday, the English tail is wagging the UK dog.\nIn fact, it’s the south-east of England that is determining the Tories strategy just as it always does when it comes to the economy. After the events of the last few weeks England’s northern regions can be in no doubt that this Tory Government despises the limited amount of devolution it has granted to the English north as much if not more than Scotland's Parliament and Wales’ Senedd. Anyone suggesting that further English devolution or federalism is a way to fix the union is kidding themselves. Worse still they are kidding voters in Scotland. It takes two to tango. Federalism has been promised so many times without delivery that it become a running joke. Fortunately, recent polls suggest most Scots aren’t interested in hanging about waiting for something that will never be delivered and which no one in a position of power at Westminster is interested in making actually work.\nThe inevitable conclusion from this week’s deplorable carry-on is that these people are absolutely not to be trusted. But then we knew that already.\nAll this toing and froing to get the details tied down of something which should be have been a given in any functional union is exactly what Mike Russell has experienced in his dealings with the British Government during the Brexit negotiations. There is no reason to doubt that this nonsense will continue. Indeed, it is the shape of things to come. And so, I return to a point that has been the theme of this column for some time. In order to escape a situation in which we are dependent on the Tories largesse with our own money it would be best not to be dependent on their largesse to grant us the means to realise our right to full self-government.\nIt is not prudent to stake the strategy for delivering an independence vote on the assumption that once another mandate is in the bag Boris Johnson will do the right thing. The SNP must have a fall-back strategy to deal with delay and obfuscation when we ask again for a section 30 order. I reiterate my hope that the NEC to be elected at this year’s SNP conference will make sure that such a strategy is devised and in place before next year’s election.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_dire-situation-in-syria/content_297.html": "UK must do more to alleviate dire situation in Syria\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 13th Mar 2020\nThis Sunday, as we mark nine years since the start of the conflict in Syria, I will join with faith groups and many of the Syrian families who have re-settled in Edinburgh for a short remembrance service on the Mound at 1:45pm. Nine candles will be lit: one to remember the dead from each year of this terrible conflict. Nine years on, and now with the direct military involvement of Turkey, what has become a messy international standoff between international and regional powers looks no closer to resolution.\nScotland has played its part in helping cope with the fallout of this terrible situation. Figures from 2019 showed that a fifth of refugees resettled by the UK have been welcomed in Scotland, and the Scottish Government has called on the UK government to do more to help resettle people. Whilst not without issues, the Scottish resettlement programmes have been particularly successful in helping integrate new Syrian Scots in Dundee, Edinburgh, Fife, Glasgow, Inverclyde and Bute. Syrian families I meet at my constituency surgery are now thriving and confident, so much so that they are able to guide later arrivals through the process and help them connect with the local community. People who have had their lives interrupted and witnessed the horrors of war are beginning to find new purpose in their adopted home. Friendships are being forged and new businesses have been created. Visitors to Bute can now enjoy delicious patisserie and award-winning apple tarts in Helmi’s Patisserie in Rothesay.\nBut these are the lucky few. The number of people who have taken part in refugee resettlement schemes across Europe is vanishingly small, and the contrast between the lives of people who have been allowed to move out of camps and those left behind could not be starker. Many Scots have seen this first-hand as volunteers with NGOs struggling to help highly vulnerable refugees in dangerously overcrowded camps in Greece and elsewhere. Last Friday, I met with my constituent Sally Wainwright, who like many ordinary citizens has volunteered helping refugees and migrants on the Greek islands. I heard her powerful testimony about her experiences working in the camps around Greece including the Moira camp on the island of Lesbos. Mytilene, the municipal capital of Lesbos, has a population of 37,890 – the same as Stirling – yet is hosting some 20,000 refugees without proper facilities or infrastructure. Recently, as tensions rise, mobs have attacked press and aid workers, refugee facilities have been set on fire, and NGOs have had to pull out.\nIn 2016, the European Union struck a deal with Turkey to offer money and aid in exchange for Turkey hosting refugees fleeing war-torn Syria and stopping them from moving on to Europe. However, thousands of refugees who have made it to Greece are now trapped there while their asylum claims are processed. Turkey has accommodated approximately 3.6 million Syrian refugees.\nThe 2016 deal had included six billion euros in aid for Syrian refugees in Turkey, re-energising Turkey’s bid to join the EU, and relaxing visa requirements for travel to Europe for Turkish citizens – but the deal is now breaking down. Turkey says that the EU did not disburse the promised money, and last week President Erdogan said that Turkey will no longer be “Europe’s gatekeeper” and that he is “opening the doors” for refugees to enter Europe. Turkey has now opened its borders with Greece and even bussed refugees close to the north-western border. Turkey is using the survivors of war as pawns in a geopolitical game. There have been troubling pictures of hundreds of refugees or migrants attempting to land small boats on the Greek islands. Tens of thousands have headed for the land border and become trapped between Turkey and Greece. Greece has halted all asylum claims for a month, sent riot police and border guards to turn back people trying to enter the country illegally, and taken aggressive measures to deter them including firing tear gas into crowds and deploying razer wire. There have been reports of young men stripped and beaten, a refugee shot dead by live ammunition, and a child dying at sea.\nPresident Erdogan visited Brussels for talks earlier this week, and we heard that the EU is considering taking in up to 1,500 child refugees to ease pressure on overwhelmed camps on the Greek islands. France, Portugal, Luxembourg and Finland offered to join Germany in a coalition of the willing.\nIn his Greenwich speech on 3 February, Boris Johnson said: “the UK is not a European power by treaty or by law but by irrevocable facts of history and geography and language and culture and instinct and sentiment”. Unfortunately, such sentiment seems to be sadly lacking when it comes to child refugees on the European continent. Scots like Sally have done what they can. In the House of Commons earlier this week, I called on the UK Government to do something concrete now to help deal with this humanitarian disaster. The UK Government has insisted that “protecting vulnerable children will remain our priority after Brexit”. It’s time for them to prove willing and join efforts to alleviate this dire situation.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_importance-of-juries/content_300.html": "Jury trials are a bedrock of our justice system\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 03rd Apr 2020\nThe right to a jury trial is a cornerstone of the criminal law of Scotland and should be jealously guarded. So, yesterday, I welcomed the Scottish Government’s decision to remove proposals for jury-less trials from their emergency Coronavirus Bill.\nI have no problem with the suspension of jury trials while we determine whether measures can be taken to cater for the need for social distancing. However, like the majority of lawyers and many members of the public, I don’t think trials of serious crimes such as murder and rape should continue with the verdict determined by a judge or a sheriff rather than a jury.\nThe merits of trial by jury rather than by judge were well expressed by my former boss at the Crown Office’s National Sexual Crimes Unit, Derek Ogg QC, when he tweeted that “Juries in Scotland bring the wisdom, knowledge and understanding of 15 strangers together. From all walks and conditions of life, all beliefs and no beliefs, black and white, gay, straight, poor, old and young. A rich resource understanding people and their foibles. Irreplaceable.”\nHe is right. Although there are now more female judges than ever before and judicial appointments are made from a wider pool than was previously the case, the majority of judges in Scotland are still male, middle-aged or older, and whatever their original background, their choice of profession has rendered them middle class, they earn a high salary and are pillars of the legal establishment. The perspective of a single judge will always be rather more limited than that of a jury panel drawn from all classes and containing both men and women.\nFrom time to time hostility is expressed towards the verdicts of juries, usually when observers with an axe to grind don’t like their verdict. I am not immune to this myself. During my career as a specialist sex crimes prosecutor, there were occasions when I privately railed against a jury’s verdict but on mature reflection, I came to understand that I had performed my function and they had performed theirs and their verdict must not only be accepted but respected.\nRe-trying accused persons in the court of public opinion after their acquittal by a jury is an affront to justice and the rule of law. We should not try to second guess juries who take a solemn vow to “well and truly try the accused and give a true verdict according to the evidence\". Juries are circuit breakers between the individual and the power of the state and therefore very important.\nIn England, trials by jury have been put on hold by the Lord Chief Justice until measures can be brought into place for juries to meet safely. Those under consideration include having smaller juries as was done during World War 2. In Scotland, other solutions have been suggested including remote juries, the use of bigger venues and jury testing for the Covid-19 virus.\nAs presently advised England and Wales have no plans to do away with juries altogether and I am not aware of plans to do so by any other country which employs trial by jury. However, Scotland faces an important problem not faced elsewhere and that is the strict time limits within which accused persons must be brought to trial in our country. But that problem can be addressed by relaxing the time limits and proposals to do so are an integral part of the bill passed yesterday so it is not clear why we require to go further and replace the juries with judges sitting alone rather than just endure the inevitable delays which are occurring in all walks of life at present.\nScotland’s most senior judge, Lord Carloway, has warned of a “monumental backlog” in the system if trials cease altogether, but the Law Society of Scotland have pointed out that administrative inconvenience alone is not sufficient to justify this unprecedented step and Lord Carloway himself has recognised that ultimately the decision must be for parliament.\nOne very important argument against delaying trials which all politicians should take seriously is the plight of victims who will have to wait longer for closure with the completion of a trial. Victims rights organisations are correct to be concerned about the impact on the victims of crime when trials are delayed.\nHowever, the reality is that these are extraordinary times and for nearly everyone at present, life must go on hold as the price of saving lives.\nIn recent times, concern has been expressed about the phenomenon of “policy capture” whereby a small number of influential actors secure a monopoly on Government policymaking through ideologically driven lobbying and privileged access. Thankfully that will not be the case here as the question is now to be thrown open to wider consultation. It is to hoped that a resolution can be found that does not threaten one of the bedrocks of Scotland’s Criminal Justice System.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_holyrood-principles/content_280.html": "Is Holyrood living up to the principles it was founded on?\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Mar 2022\nWhether or not indyref2 happens next year – and readers should appreciate that I am completely out of the loop on the plans– our parliamentary democracy is due an overhaul. It’s easy to criticise Westminster but there are problems closer to home. This is not just my view but the view of Prof James Mitchell, Professor of Public Policy at the University of Edinburgh, and a seasoned commentator on the Scottish political scene.\nIn an article in this month’s edition of Scottish Left Review https://www.scottishleftreview.scot/scotland-as-a-centralised-state/ he deplores Scotland’s over centralised system of government. Lesley Riddoch has written extensively about the shortcomings of local government in Scotland compared to every other European nation. She reprised some of these points in her column yesterday, so I am going to concentrate on the implications of Professor Mitchell’s critique for Holyrood.\nProf Mitchell concludes that the failure to address the deficiencies in our system\n“….makes Scotland stand out as an outlier along with the rest of the UK in European local governance. For all the talk of being more European, of abandoning the Westminster model of government, today’s Scottish polity looks as insularly British with a Holyrood cherry on top of that which existed pre-devolution. How we constitute ourselves is one of the most basic, if multi-faceted, issues in politics. It has to be about more than creating a Parliament and accumulating power for the executive in the Parliament’s name. We have lost sight of the ideals of self-government that animated earlier debates and stuck with a Scottish variant on the system that was supposed to be rejected. For all the talk of popular sovereignty, what has emerged is a mini-Westminster in which the executive is dominant, Parliament is compliant, and any other potential sources of legitimacy are denuded of authority.”\nThis pointed criticism should concern all parties in Holyrood, not just those who support independence. However, it poses a particular challenge for the independence supporting parties because we are supposed to be fully committed to doing things differently to Westminster. So how will those parties respond to this challenge and when? The creation of the Scottish Parliament was informed by four key principles; sharing power between the people, the legislators and the executive; - accountability of the executive to the Parliament and of both to the people; - access and participation of the people and legislators in decision-making and the promotion of equal opportunities for all. The Constitutional Convention that brought about devolution had identified that at Westminster, power was too concentrated in the hands of the executive, and they wanted the Scottish parliament to be different. But is it? And is it living up to its founding principles?\nIf we look at just one example identified by Professor Mitchell, the answer is no. He argues that the Scottish Parliament’s committee system is much weaker than Westminster’s which was reformed over a decade ago. He is right. At Westminster there are standing select committees established to scrutinise the work of each government department. The chairs of these committees are directly elected by MPs in a secret ballot ensuring their independence from the government of the day. Ordinary seats on the committees are much sought after, and MPs in the Labour and Tory party have to submit themselves to internal elections to secure a place. In the SNP who gets to sit on a committee is up to the group leader, an approach which we could do with revisiting.\nIn practice even chairs from the ruling party act independently and are not afraid to criticise the government trenchantly. Separate bill committees are constituted to scrutinise each government bill. At Holyrood the two functions are combined, and the chairpersons of the committees are determined by party whips meaning they are far more likely to toe the party line. Fairly constituted committees with independent chairs are particularly important to ensure scrutiny of government actions and legislation, especially where there is no second or revising chamber.\nThe shortcomings of the Holyrood system were highlighted this week when it emerged that the membership of the committee charged with scrutinising the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill was dominated by MSPs who are members of a cross party pressure group which supports self-identification and has excluded lesbians and feminists who disagree. Concerns had already been expressed about the partiality of the deputy convenor who is on record of accusing people who disagree with self ID of transphobia . No one expects MSPs not to have a position on government legislation informed by the manifesto commitment on which they stood. But in this respect, it is worth remembering that only the Liberal Democrats and the Greens explicitly supported self-identification in their party manifestos and together they have only 12 of the parliaments 129 MSPs.\nFurthermore, the issue is not so much that the majority of MSPs on the committee are on one side of the argument but that they have embraced an approach which shuts down debate and seeks to silence the other side and demonise their views. When lesbians and feminists are only allowed to be part of the parliament’s cross-party group on LGBTI+ issues if they espouse gender identity theory, we are a long cry from the parliament’s founding principle of equal opportunities for all.\nParliament’s function is to hold the government to account. That means every single MSP who is not part of the ministerial team, not just those on the opposition benches. The opposition are there to put forward a case that they should replace the government, however backbench MSPs of the party of government should be there to cajole, improve and stretch the government of the day to do better. MSPs are not answerable to the press teams of their parties or paid party staffers. They work for the people and for the greater good of the country. As Edwin Morgan put it in his poem for the opening of our parliament; “What do the people want of the place? They want it to be filled with thinking persons as open and adventurous as its architecture. A nest of fearties is what they do not want…… A phalanx of forelock-tuggers is what they do not want.”\nScotland’s first citizens’ assembly was charged with thinking about what kind of country we are seeking to build. They addressed the issue of MSPs working to party lines rather than engaging in critical thinking of their own, recommending that MSPs be encouraged to act on the views of their constituents, rather than sticking with party lines. They said MSPs should actively consult with constituents on matters which may have an impact on their community and on matters about which a significant number of constituents have shown concern.\nSome of their key recommendations included the involvement of citizens in decision making with a proposal for a House of Citizens to scrutinise government proposals and give assent to parliamentary bills, a sort of second chamber if you like. Alternatively, they recommended the regular use of citizens’ assemblies to look at difficult issues where politicians cannot come to agreement, and to ensure accountability for follow up.\nJust think how the use of a citizens assembly might have improved the debate around and scrutiny of proposals for reform of the Gender Recognition Act, as it did in Ireland on the equally fraught issue of abortion rights. This is something I first proposed, together with a trans constituent, back in June 2019. Sadly, our pleas fell on deaf ears.\nThe innovative proposals of the first Citizens' Assembly are very much in keeping with Scotland’s constitutional tradition of the people being sovereign and I hope they will not be left to languish on the shelf. It is interesting to think how Scotland’s constitution may have developed had Scotland not become part of the union. However, we do not need to wait for independence to start acting on some of these suggestions. Indeed, our parliament and our parliamentarians need to be ready for the challenges ahead.\nIf, as Ian Blackford has suggested, the second independence referendum is to be further delayed, we need a revamp of Holyrood. If the indyref is indeed imminent, Prof Mitchell’s analysis shows how important it is that work on an interim constitution focuses on proper checks and balances on executive power and meaningful scrutiny mechanisms.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_trans-people-and-scotlands-jails/content_310.html": "The question of trans people and Scotland's jails\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 27th Jan 2023\nWESTMINSTER’S Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) on Wednesday published our report on Dominic Raab’s Bill of Rights Bill and recommended it should be scrapped. Its impact in Scotland was rather lost amid all the sound and fury about the placing of a rapist in a woman’s prison. When I did the media round to talk about the report on Wednesday morning that was all anyone really wanted to talk about.\nHowever, the report makes points about human rights which might help us navigate the issue of how we deal with this situation, including the importance of the principle that human rights are universal and that no law should carve out groups of people for whom human rights are watered down or made more difficult to enforce. A quick recap. In their 2019 General Election manifesto, the Tories, still smarting from the prorogation defeat in the UK Supreme Court, promised to redress the balance between Parliament and the courts and “update” the Human Rights Act (HRA).\nLast summer, when Boris Johnson was still PM, Raab, his Justice Secretary, produced the Bill of Rights Bill, which shocked many by proposing to repeal the Human Rights Act altogether but the bill has yet to be debated in Parliament. Liz Truss sacked Raab, and binned the bill, probably the only worthwhile thing she’s ever done.\nBut Sunak put Raab back in his old job where he remains – despite multiple complaints of bullying – and he’s determined to resurrect the bill, which is very much his baby. That said, Sunak seems less than enthusiastic about it, and I hope our report might be the final nail in its coffin. The JCHR believes that a Bill of Rights should reaffirm and reinforce the fundamental rights that protect everyone in the UK. But this bill would remove and restrict certain human rights protections the UK Government finds inconvenient and prescribe a restrictive approach to the interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in the courts of our domestic legal systems.\nIf the bill was enacted, it would result in more barriers to enforcing human rights, more cases taken to Strasbourg and more adverse judgments against the UK. Decades of precedent and case law, that the UK still plays a key role in developing, would be abandoned, leading to legal uncertainty and litigation. It’s as far away as the UK could get from following the approach of the European Court of Human Rights without leaving the ECHR. But we think if the UK is to stay in the ECHR, it needs to be done with integrity.\nThe JCHR is also very concerned about the adverse impact of the bill on the constitutional arrangements of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to which the HRA and the ECHR are central. We recommended that the bill should not be passed without the consent of the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Of course, you and I know that such weight would never be given to the Scottish Parliament’s wishes – that’s why we need independence.\nThe theme of the universality of human rights runs throughout our report. We also emphasise that the majority of those who gave evidence to us and responded to our consultations and survey supported keeping the HRA. Most people like the fact that the HRA makes sure everyone living in the UK can access and enforce the same rights regardless of where they come from or what their status in our society. Even prisoners have human rights. Women’s and victims’ groups repeatedly emphasised to us how important the HRA has been in vindicating the rights of women and girls and protecting them from male violence. Women in prison have the same human rights as you and me, including the right to be free of inhuman and degrading treatment and the right to dignity and privacy.\nAnd so back to the case of the rapist temporarily housed in a woman’s prison. Over the last few days we have heard politicians and commentators say repeatedly that this issue is completely separate from the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill (GRR Bill). They are wrong. The same ideology underlies both the current Scottish Prison Service (SPS) policy and the GRR Bill.\nThe policy collective Murray Blackburn MacKenzie have written extensively about the current SPS policy to accommodate self-declared transgender prisoners on a case-by-case, risk assessed basis. It identified that the Scottish Trans Alliance (STA) was closely involved in the development of the policy. In the STA’s own words: “We strategised that by working intensively with the Scottish Prison Service to support it to include trans women as women on a self-declaration basis within very challenging circumstances, we would be able to ensure … that all other public services should be able to do likewise.” I don’t have a problem with STA being involved in shaping the policy but other voices should also be listened to and I fear the impact on the rights of women prisoners has not been properly considered.\nI am also worried that it seems women’s prisons, which contain some of the most vulnerable women in our society, appear to have been used as a testing ground for a policy which has proved to produce the very risks to and impacts upon women’s safety of which I and other feminists have warned. I was pleased to hear at FMQs that this rapist will not now be held at Cornton Vale. However, there are women’s units elsewhere in the prison estate, including at HMP Edinburgh in my constituency which I visited recently, and I do not believe that a rapist should be anywhere near any of them.\nAs events unfolded yesterday it was clarified that he will be held in the male estate. Good news for women prisoners but this decision also has wider ramifications, for it seems at last to be an admission by those in authority that some men who self-identify as trans, may not actually be trans at all, which is what I and others have said all along.\nRhona Hotchkiss, the former governor of Cornton Vale, has confirmed there are, and have been, a significant number of other transgender prisoners housed in the women’s estate, that some have caused problems and that she has never known any of them to have gone through surgical changes. Recent Scottish research revealed that many transgender prisoners in women’s prisons only self-declared as women after they were imprisoned and that some go back to living as men on the outside.\nFrankly, this suggests that some at least are gaming the system. The fact the rapist in the current scandal did not begin transitioning until he was charged with rape might also strike some people as a tad suspicious. I understand the current SPS policy has been under review for three years and will be reissued “in the coming months”. In the light of the events of the last few days, it needs to take a fresh look at its draft.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-leader/content_307.html": "Why I won't be standing to become SNP leader this time\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 17th Feb 2023\nTHE resignation of Nicola Sturgeon means that the SNP will have its first leadership election for nearly 20 years. This could be a turning point for the independence movement but only if we can honestly appraise where things have gone wrong and radically reset our approach.\nThe time for shooting the messenger is over. We need a frank recognition of the shortcomings of the SNP at party and government level and a plan to put things right. Prospective leadership candidates will be challenged to come up with the answers in the heat of the contest to come. But if we are to learn anything from our recent past, we must recognise that the answers are not to be found in one person. Successful leaders build teams, and it is for the next leader and her team to take us forward together. It’s a tall order but it’s doable.\nThere can be no doubt that Nicola Sturgeon was a consummate political campaigner and very good at getting her message across. However winning elections and making big promises is not enough in politics. Delivering change is what counts. The SNP now has a chance to pause and reflect how we do that. The reason our party exists is to win independence for our country, but we also exist to make life better for everyone who lives in Scotland.\nIn order to realise those goals, we need to reset the policy programme of the devolved government as well as our independence strategy. Everywhere I go in my work as a constituency MP businesses, charities and third-sector organisations tell me that while the SNP government has high ideals and makes great promises it is deficient when it comes to delivery. This needs to change. So too does the way our party makes policy and the tenor of the debate which accompanies it. What went wrong with the Gender Recognition Reform (GRR) Bill is a microcosm of everything that has been wrong with our party’s approach in the last few years. An ill-thought-through policy that was never debated on the floor of conference, a refusal to listen to those with legitimate concerns, the demonisation of dissenters and above all, as the opinion polls show, a failure to take the public with us. It is also pretty much what has gone wrong with our independence strategy. Testing the competence of Holyrood to legislate for a second independence referendum and the idea of a plebiscite election were ideas that when first mooted were shot down in flames, without a debate and with opprobrium heaped on those who dared to suggest them. Against this background it is hardly surprising that when these ideas where belatedly taken on board their execution should have proved so problematic.\nI agree with Stephen Flynn that the special conference set for March 19 should be postponed. The debate about strategy and the way forward can now take place as part of the leadership election and whoever wins must be allowed to develop her stance and vision in collaboration with a new team unfettered by the strategy adopted by the previous leadership.\nI also agree with Stephen that it will be very important to hear from the leadership candidates about what they propose to do about the cost-of-living crisis, the economy, and the NHS as well as other big issues including energy policy, and current challenges facing the Scottish government over ferry delivery, the deposit return scheme, the dualling of the A9 and bridging the attainment gap. The public find it hard to understand why so much priority has been given to the GRR Bill when there are so many more pressing issues.\nThe reset which the SNP’s new leader and her team must achieve should extend beyond the independence strategy and government policy to reform of our internal party democracy and to reform of the democratic institutions of our parliament and civic society. Never again should our party be run by a small impenetrable cabal with the democratic choices of the party membership for NEC outvoted by members co-opted without a democratic mandate. The rules for selection of candidates should be designed to ensure people of talent step forward to represent our party and movement rather than abused to marginalise independent thinkers. Our complaints procedure should be applied fairly to all rather than utilised to marginalise those guilty of \"wrong think\". Several party members have been suspended on spurious grounds and without due process. The party needs to put this right as anyone wrongly excluded from voting in the leadership election could legally challenge the result.\nGiven the multiple failures in due process at SNP HQ and the question mark hanging over the current chief executive’s management of party finances the election for the party leadership should not be run under his control. I suggest we have an interim CEO drawn from the ranks of elder party statespersons, someone like Roger Mullin. Over the last two years the party has lost many members who have left in despair at the failure to progress the cause of independence and the treatment of women with concerns about the policy of self-identification. I am aware from discussions with colleagues across Scotland that we have lost some of our most hardworking activists. All those who left over that period should be invited to re-join the party and participate in the leadership election. This could reinvigorate the party’s finances as well as party democracy.\nFinally, turning to our parliament, the progress of the GRR Bill has illustrated some of the shortcomings in Holyrood’s structures. The partisan blinkered nature of the committee scrutiny which took place, shockingly overlooking any balanced analysis of the human rights implications of the bill, could be addressed by having committee chairs elected by backbenchers rather than appointed by party whips. The cross-party review currently being undertaken by Professor James Mitchell on issues of accountability and scrutiny in our parliament should be compulsory reading for the new leader. We also need to look at the closeness of some of our third-sector organisations to government, the way in which those who give evidence to committees are selected and the way in which organisations almost entirely dependent on government funding have such easy access to policy development and effectively become cheerleaders for government policy. This is not a healthy aspect of our democracy.\nBeyond parliament the independence of our justice institutions could be improved by addressing the anomaly whereby the Lord Advocate is both government legal adviser and head of the prosecution service. Because of the way the Scotland Act is phrased this might require a Section 30 order, but it is hard to believe one would not be forthcoming, as in this respect we would be emulating the English system which, unusually, is more in tune with international requirements regarding the strengthening of the autonomy of prosecution services. We also need a renewed look at reform of local government and its financing. Finally, as it seems unlikely the new leader will want to fly in the face of public opinion with a legal challenge to the Section 35 order vetoing the GRR Bill, I suggest we park the issue of GRA reform until it has been properly scrutinised in line with our manifesto commitment. This could be achieved by setting up a Citizens' Assembly to report to parliament. In parallel the new leader should set up an independent review (like England’s Cass review) into the operation of the Sandyford clinic and look at the reasons for the exponential rise in the number of young women seeking to transition. Evidence-based policy making is the way forward.\nI won’t be running for leader of the SNP this time. The gerrymandering of the rules for Holyrood selection before the last Scottish election have made it a practical impossibility for me to do so. Our next leader must be able to become First Minister and so she must come from within the current Holyrood contingent and it should be someone with at least some ministerial experience. I stand ready to give my support to the candidate who I believe is best placed to break with the past and to put together a team to deliver the root and branch change needed. That change must involve a recognition that independence will only be achieved by a team effort. The messianic leadership model has not worked. The new leader needs to reach out across the party and the movement and to adopt a more collegiate approach. If we are to go forward united to achieve our goal of independence, we need to face up to what has gone wrong and put it right.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_cherry-backs-extension-of-bereavement-leave-pay/content_173.html": "Joanna Cherry QC MP backs the extension of bereavement leave and pay\nMPs and Lords are supporting the extension of bereavement leave and pay to employees experiencing a close family bereavement\nJoanna Cherry QC MP for Edinburgh South West attended a Parliamentary event on 2 March in support of extending bereavement leave and pay to employees experiencing a close family bereavement.\nThe event was hosted by the CIPD, the professional body for HR and people development, Patricia Gibson MP, Lucy Herd (The Grief Educator and mother of Jack, after whom Jack’s Law is named), and Lord Knight of Weymouth.\nJack’s Law was introduced in Great Britain in April 2020 and focuses on the right to parental bereavement leave and pay. It applies to employed parents who lose a child under the age of 18 or suffer a stillbirth (from 24 weeks of pregnancy), irrespective of how long they have been with their employer.\nParents with at least 26 weeks’ continuous service with their employer and weekly average earnings over the lower earnings limit are also entitled to Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay.\nThe CIPD and Lucy Herd have been campaigning to change the law to ensure that employees who experience the loss of a close family member receive bereavement leave and pay*.\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, many employees will have been affected by losing a loved one and some may have been unable to take appropriate leave from work to grieve or to make suitable arrangements.\nMs Gibson brought a Ten Minute Rule Bill to Parliament, Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill, which introduced paid bereavement leave. The Second Reading is due on 18 March 2022.\nThe CIPD and Ms Gibson invited MPs and Lords to the drop-in session to pledge their support to their campaign and Ms Gibson’s Bill to extend bereavement leave to employees.\nJoanna Cherry QC MP said: “I fully support extending paid bereavement leave to employees and was pleased to attend this important event. When someone suffers a bereavement it can have a huge impact on their mental health and wellbeing and as such they might not be able to perform as usual at work. Access to paid bereavement leave can support an employee by giving them time away from work to grieve and assist with any practical matters as necessary.”\nThe CIPD’s latest research found that 75% supported an extension of Jack’s Law so that more employees experiencing a close family bereavement will be able to take leave and be paid for it.\nClaire McCartney, Senior Resourcing and Inclusion Adviser at the CIPD comments: “Employees that have experienced a close family bereavement will need time to come to terms with what has happened and will be highly unlikely to be able to perform well at work if they are forced to return too quickly. While many organisations provide paid bereavement leave to support employees at one of the most difficult times of their lives, this is far from universal and extending the statutory provision is likely to give employees time and space to grieve rather than worrying about paying their bills and financial worries.”\nLucy Herd, The Grief Educator and mother of Jack said: “When I started this campaign nearly 11 years ago, I had always hoped legislation would be created for everyone to be able to take time off should they need to, in the event of a family death. Time is precious and we should not have to worry about taking time off from work because our whole world has altered due to grief. Therefore, we are working towards ensuring Jacks Law is amended, to better protect future families from being told they can’t take ‘time’.”\n*(Paid parental bereavement leave is available to employees with 26 weeks’ continuous service with their employer and weekly average earnings over the lower earnings limit (earning on average at least £120 per week before tax). The CIPD recommends following the same approach to extending bereavement leave.)",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-westminster/content_220.html": "SNP still have a job to do at Westminster\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 14th Jul 2023\nOn Tuesday evening MPs spent the best part of four hours walking round in circles voting on the Lords’ amendments to the Illegal Migration Bill. Ludicrously we spent longer voting on the 18 amendments in issue than we spent debating them. The hours of walking around to vote were a terrible waste of everyone’s time. The mechanics of voting at Westminster are crazy. With electronic votes taking say 5 minutes each, voting on the amendments could have been dealt with in about an hour and half.\nHowever, the madness of the voting system should not be allowed to detract from the importance of the subject matter of those votes. As Stuart McDonald MP the SNP Immigration Spokesperson said in the debate the legislation is “a rotten, utterly misconceived and cruel Bill that will not stop small boats but will cause immense suffering to people who have fled persecution and harm.”\nThe Tories say no one has an alternative strategy for stopping the small boats but this is simply not true. Three of the Lords’ amendments set out an alternative strategy. More safe and legal routes, a souped-up role for the National Crime Agency in dealing with the people smuggling and a new ten-year strategy for tackling refugee crises affecting migration by irregular routes, to be developed in collaboration with other countries and to include measures to tackle people smuggling. Under my chairmanship parliament’s cross party Joint Committee on Human Rights produced a detailed report which concluded that “the Bill would result in the UK turning its back on the vast majority of refugees, in breach of a number of binding international human rights obligations.” The Lords amendments go some way to reversing this but of course the Tory Government and most but not all of their backbenchers dutifully voted them down. It’s a paradox that it has taken the unelected Lords to address some of the worst parts of the Bill, but it illustrates the importance of having a revising chamber. Stuart pointed out that this is exactly the sort of bill that the second chamber should be voting down particularly as it was not a manifesto commitment of the Government.\nA second chamber is something I would be anxious to see in an independent Scotland alongside a constitutional court and strengthened independent select committees in parliament to provide the necessary checks and balances on executive power and to protect minorities. The Labour party have been talking about House of Lords reform for decades without doing anything about it. Ditto meaningful constitutional reform. Thus, the only hope for a written constitution setting out the checks and balances needed in a modern democracy is an independent Scotland. Because independence is not as imminent as we would like, we need to continue to send MPs to Westminster to represent Scottish voters. I know some Yessers think that’s pointless, but the reality is that the majority of Scots don’t, and they are not ready for Sinn Fein style abstentionism.\nUntil independence is achieved, we will need Scots MPs at Westminster to represent our constituents’ interests in reserved matters and it is better that we have MPs from a party that believes in independence. Yes, opposition is hard -that is why I and others would prefer to be in the Scottish parliament in government. But there is a job to be done by nationalist MPs. Every parliament is different. The next parliament could offer opportunities the current one does not present.\nThis parliament feels tired and finished, but it could limp on for over another year. That gives those of us who support independence the time necessary to consider how best to use the next general election to elect independence supporting MPs and how they should use their position once the make-up of the next parliament is known. Stephen Flynn has injected some much-needed energy into the leadership of the current SNP group, but a strategic re-think is needed overall. Otherwise, we will see more MPs stand down, tired and disillusioned.\nThat said, I do not find Westminster to be a toxic environment. Yes, there are some toxic behaviours, but I believe most MPs and their staff work hard to do what they believe to be the right thing. The back-up staff are incredible and work long shifts in catering, security, and hospitality to keep the place going. I support independence not because I think Westminster is a toxic place but because the arithmetic of this so-called equal union means Scotland’s representatives can always be outvoted in the UK parliament and the mandate of Scottish voters is mostly ignored. It is true that some of the procedures at Westminster are archaic. Some good work has been done on modernisation but there is a great more that could be done. However, Westminster has its plus points. Debates are not just an endless list of parliamentarians reading out short speeches prepared for them by party whips but real and sometimes vibrant with some great oratory. The cross-party scrutiny committees have teeth and produce detailed reports that get torn into weaknesses in government policy even when the chairs are from the government party. These are both areas where Holyrood could up its game.\nAs to the suffering of Scottish MPs. Yes, the travelling is tiring, and a drag and I have recent experience of how hard it is to have to leave loved ones every week especially when they are ill or dying. But no one forced me to do this. Albeit in the heady days of 2014/15 I didn’t think I would be down here for quite such a long time….but that’s another story.\nWestminster is a place of privilege for those of us elected as MPs. The salary is considerably better than most of our constituents could ever hope to earn, we enjoy subsidised food and drink, the benefit of free travel and a place to stay in central London to enable us to do our jobs. Speaking for myself I am blessed with a fantastic support team of office staff to help me deal with my constituency and a decent budget to pay for them, although I would like to pay them more.\nThe toxicity in politics comes from a public debate where it has become common place for MPs, particularly female MPs, to be called foul names, bullied threatened and attacked for simply doing their job or following their conscience. The leadership needed to instil respect for the legitimacy of different viewpoints and the importance of promoting debate and understanding has, in the main, been sadly lacking in this Westminster parliament. But it is also lacking at Holyrood.\nI am not one for Scottish exceptionalism. Holyrood has passed some flawed legislation in recent years although nothing as morally reprehensible as the Illegal Migration Bill. We need independence for Scotland not because Scotland is innately better than England. It isn’t. But because the union between Scotland and England is an unequal one in which there is a glaring democratic deficit.\nWhile we wait for a strategy to be devised that will deliver that independence, I believe that we should continue to send MPs to Westminster to represent our constituents in relation to reserved matters. However, the SNP needs to rethink how best to use the time of those MPs once they are elected as well as having a clear strategy about how best to use elections to move things forward on independence.\nTomorrow I am attending Winnie Ewing’s memorial service in Inverness. She had a hell of a lot more to put up with at Westminster than any of my generation of MPs, yet she did it with dignity and fortitude because she knew the cause of independence was a noble one. We should remember that.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-brexit/content_292.html": "SNP should have done more to leverage power on Brexit\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 24th Mar 2023\nYesterday, I participated in a webinar to mark the publication of a book called The Parliamentary Battle Over Brexit And The Constitution. The book charts the fierce arguments that took place over the role of the UK’s political institutions and asks whether what happened demonstrated fundamental flaws in the UK constitution and whether there were ways that things could have been handled better. It also ponders whether lasting political damage has been caused by the tensions that occurred. If you watched Boris Johnson squirming and squealing over his partygate lies in front of the privileges committee on Wednesday afternoon, I suspect you will agree with me that the answer to that last question is obvious.\nThe book contains a lot of detail about key political moments including the Brexit referendum campaign itself: Gina Miller’s first court case establishing that parliament must give the go-ahead for the triggering of Article 50; the problem posed by the Irish border (which Brexiteer insouciance had not foreseen); Theresa May’s disastrous decision to go for a snap General Election in 2017; parliament wresting control of parliamentary business from the Government; the election of Johnson and the rise of populism typified by media headlines about judges being “enemies of the people”; the claims by both May and Johnson to be on the side of the public against a recalcitrant parliament; and, of course, the unlawful prorogation of parliament.\nThe book explodes the myth that a “Remainer” parliament stopped May from delivering Brexit and illustrates that what really stymied the process were the arguments within the Conservative Party – and that it was Johnson and other Eurosceptics who really blocked May’s path. However, as I read the book in preparation for the webinar what struck me most was how largely absent Scotland and the SNP were from the account of events. This could be put down to metropolitan bias, but I know one of the authors well, and both she and the Constitution Unit at University College London where she works take a real interest in the Scottish dimension of current British politics.\nIndeed, the book acknowledges that devolution should have challenged the sovereignty of the Westminster parliament. There is also some discussion of the tensions between Westminster and the devolved institutions during the Brexit process. The truth is that while some Scottish politicians made significant interventions in the Brexit process, neither the SNP nor the Scottish Government got any concessions out of the whole damn mess despite the SNP being the third party in a hung parliament. Apart from pushing the solutions canvassed in the excellent paper Scotland’s Place In Europe, the SNP’s parliamentary strategy seemed largely to exist of standing up and declaiming that Scotland would not be taken out of Europe against its will without engaging in any meaningful activity to ensure that would not happen.\nThe result was that Scotland was taken out of the EU against our will and we ended up with nothing to show for two and a half years of parliamentary wrangling when you might have thought that a block of 35 SNP votes in a hung parliament could have put us in a powerful bargaining position. In the spirit of self-examination occasioned by the recent events surrounding Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation and the SNP leadership election, I think we need to look at what went wrong and take some learnings from it. Particularly as another hung parliament is a distinct possibility following next year’s General Election.\nMany of the significant parliamentary initiatives emanated from a cross-party group of backbenchers from the two big parties and others from the smaller parties (except the DUP) of which I and Philippa Whitford were part. In what was often a fast-moving situation we met daily and engaged in detailed discussions of tactics and strategy. So far as I am aware, the SNP group did not have anything like this strategic engine room. In the 2015-2017 parliament, Alex Salmond established an SNP Brexit strategy group which met regularly. In the 2017-2019 parliament, no such group existed or if it did, neither I nor Philippa were invited to take part and I am not aware of any initiatives which emanated from the SNP.\nThe initiatives in which I participated were devised with the assistance of politicians from other parties like Andy Wightman and outside advisors like the barrister Jolyon Maugham. Andy’s court case – in which I was a co-litigant – established at the EU Court of Justice that Article 50 could be unilaterally revoked thereby opening up an important way out of the mess the Tories had got us into. However, when I first mooted supporting the case a senior Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary tried to talk me out of it. It was just as well I ignored him as the inclusion of at least one MP among the petitioners proved vital and the case could not have gone forward without a Westminster MP.\nMPs needed to know what the options were when the meaningful vote on the Brexit deal was finally taken, and the case made it clear that the UK could revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU rather than crashing out without a deal as it looked like Boris Johnson was prepared to do. Likewise, when I decided to lead the case challenging the unlawful prorogation in the Scottish courts, the SNP leadership at Westminster and at Holyrood were not terribly interested until it became clear we were going to win. Yet, the existence of the Scottish case proved pivotal when, after Gina Miller’s case failed in the English High Court, the Inner House of the Court of Session breathed new life into the legal challenge with their unanimous finding that the prorogation was unlawful, which paved the way for victory in the Supreme Court. The Scottish courts played a pivotal role both in the Article 50 case and in the case against prorogation.\nIn my opinion, Scottish politicians could have had a pivotal role if the SNP had had a strategy for exploiting the potential power we had after the 2017 election. Yes, we too had lost seats and gone from 56 to 35 MPs, but we were the third party in a hung parliament where the PM was facing frequent rebellions. There are well-founded rumours that May’s civil servants advised her to be prepared to make serious concessions to the Scottish Government in return for some cooperation from SNP MPs in getting her softer version of Brexit through parliament. What these were and whether they might have been attractive in the sense of protecting our country from the worst excesses of Brexit or indeed furthering the goal of independence, we shall never know as it is said the confrontational attitude adopted at early meetings led to the decision that cooperation would not be forthcoming. Certainly, when May held cross-party talks in January 2019, I am not aware of the SNP having got anything out of it, despite her desperation at that stage to find a way forward.\nShould the SNP ever find itself with such potential influence in a hung parliament again, we need to find a way to prosecute our advantage. All the leadership candidates now seem to accept that the party needs a bigger tent approach which harnesses all the talents in the party. We also need a better approach to statecraft. Sometimes you need to tough it out and not be bowed by outside influences. Sometimes you need to be prepared to work with your political opponents to get what you want. This was done very successfully by the SNP during the years of our first minority government from 2007-2011. It was my biggest learning from the Brexit process and it’s a lesson the new SNP leader would do well to take on board.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_local-election-campaign-focus-on-local-issues/content_276.html": "The local election campaign must focus on local issues\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 25th Mar 2022\nIt’s been a frenetic week in the phoney war over indyref2. Several storms caused by ill-advised analogies with the situation in Ukraine, another tedious Broontervention and at least one attempt to breathe life into the local government elections by suggesting that they are about winning the case for independence. Newsflash – they are not.\nI have a few requests for my SNP colleagues and indeed the wider independence movement.\nFirst, please could everyone stop trying to draw parallels between the debate about Scottish independence and the war in Ukraine. It comes over as crass and insensitive and it takes us nowhere. Scotland is in a consensual union with England. When last we got the chance to say whether we wanted to leave that union the answer was No. Ukraine has been invaded and its people subjected to war crimes. In the light of these facts there can be no comparison, meaningful or otherwise.\nSecondly, could people please stop piling on journalists with whom they disagree. By all means criticise, expose poor work or phoney arguments but the attacks on Kathleen Nutt for that Herald headline this week were unwarranted. We have had an SNP government for nearly 15 years. It is hardly surprising that their policy record should come under scrutiny in the newspapers. Journalists and indeed columnists don’t choose the headlines put on their pieces. As Kathleen herself pointed out it’s the job of journalists to interrogate statements made by those in power. Her Ukraine/Putin/Indyref2 story was prompted by an SNP press release saying a pause to indyref2 would be ‘grist to the Kremlin mill.” This in turn was part of the dance of the seven veils in which Ian Blackford and others have been engaged over whether the Ukraine war would justify a further delay in Indyref2. Enough!\nAnd so, to my third and penultimate plea. Please let’s campaign on local issues for the local elections. Another columnist in this newspaper has suggested that we use the local election vote to “win the argument for independence”. I disagree. The local elections should be about local issues. I am enjoying being out and about again in my Edinburgh Southwest constituency campaigning with some of our hard-working local SNP councillors. Constituents are keen to talk about their concerns and we have a story to tell here. I have been particularly struck by my conversations with women, the mothers, the carers and often too the breadwinners. Their voices, their concerns, and practical policies to support them, such as the Scottish Child payment, need to be at the forefront of our campaigns. It is the Tories who want to make this about the constitution, Yes parties should make it about running Scotland well at every level.\nThe importance of local services has been highlighted by the vastly increased amount of time people have spent at home during the pandemic. When more people are working from home overflowing bins are more likely and more objectionable. While in Edinburgh we enjoy excellent public transport, car owners struggling with the cost of fuel complain about the cost of constantly replacing tyres and getting their suspension fixed because of the state of the roads. These are the issues people really care about when it comes to local elections, and rightly so.\nLocal SNP councils such as mine in Edinburgh have a good story to tell not just on local services but on building energy efficient affordable homes and new schools, delivering 21,000 jobs with a city deal and cutting their carbon footprint by about 60%. Face to face services to help EU citizens secure settled status after Brexit were established in the face of Tory opposition and our record on resettling Afghan, Syrian and now Ukrainian refugees is a proud one.\nIt is unfortunate that across the parties some who have been chosen as candidates have revealed prejudices and behaviours that suggest they are not fit for public office. Sadly, this a symptom of the coarsening of our public discourse about which I have warned repeatedly. Most councillors are good people who work hard for very little return. While poor remuneration is one reason it has proved hard to get candidates to stand this time round, I think political apathy or atrophy caused by the stalemate in the constitutional debate could be another one.\nA symptom of this is the degree of agitation about Gordon Brown and the RUSI story. Gordon Brown is not worth the energy. He has never delivered on past promises and as the years go by , he is becoming increasingly irrelevant. His latest intervention irritated both sides of the argument. Let’s just leave it at that. As to RUSI , sadly that institute’s commentators have form for setting their impartiality to one side when it comes to the independence debate. They have an important role to play in the debate on defence and security policy based on their expertise, but partisan interventions are just that, no more.\nAs one might expect, the most nuanced contribution to the debate about indyref2 in the last week came from Kevin Pringle. He pointed out the intellectual poverty of the Tories attempts to use the local elections to send a message to the SNP that people don’t want another indyref and the need for these elections be about local issues and policies. He also expressed a scepticism which I share about the likelihood of an independence referendum next year given “the hurdles to be overcome and extensive preparations required.”\nAs we mark the second anniversary of lockdown, the world in which we live has changed irrevocably. The horrors of a global pandemic have been overtaken by the new horrors of a brutal war in Europe. While we face the worst cost of living crisis in decades we must also dig deep to help the victims of war and offer sanctuary to refugees on a scale not seen in more than half a century. In doing so we are hampered by a Spring Statement from the UK Chancellor that does little to help those most struggling in our society and an anti-refugee bill which breaks international law. These are the policies of a government that Scotland did not elect and yet by the next UK General Election we will have been stuck with it or variations of it for nearly 15 years. The list of policies imposed on Scotland against our will are legion. Brexit and benefits and pensions cuts top the list as perhaps the most egregious. The devolved settlement has been seriously undermined.\nAll these things strengthen the impetus to independence. However, we cannot guarantee that the case for independence will survive the full glare of a second campaign proper if it is not refreshed to take account of the changed circumstances in which we find ourselves.\nAnd so, to my final plea. To be brutally frank the independence debate is stalled. It will continue that way until those in a leadership position inject some life into it. A clear plan and a fresh prospectus are needed. Many grass roots groups with experts of considerable standing are working on projects and more are waiting in the wings to assist. What we need is a signal from those at the top that these efforts will be taken on board and given focus.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_call-for-citizens-assembly-on-gender-reform/content_248.html": "A renewed call for a Citizens’ Assembly on gender reform\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 11th Jun 2021\nI make no apology for writing about the issue of free speech and equality law for a third week running. Yesterday saw a landmark court judgment which has the potential to change the tenor of the current debate. It is important to be clear what that judgment means and what it does not mean. One group, the gender critical, have had their rights reaffirmed. No group, particularly not trans people, have lost any rights.\nTim Hopkins, Director of the Equality Network and my former comrade from the struggle for LGB rights, has asked me to spell out my objections to Stonewall’s Diversity Champions Scheme. I had hoped that my last two columns made clear that I share the concerns widely held by lawyers and other commentators, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the expert author of an independent report commissioned by the University of Essex, all of which have been the subject of numerous recent news reports. In summary these concerns are that misleading advice has been given as to the protected characteristics under the Equality Act, that the law on unlawful discrimination and free speech has been misrepresented and that this may have led to discrimination particularly against women, people with gender critical beliefs and same sex attracted lesbians.\nThe fact that so many organisations have left and are leaving the Stonewall scheme shows that these concerns are real and substantial. Yesterday’s judgment makes it quite clear that guidance which leads to women with gender critical views being dismissed as bigots is wrong in law and discriminatory. A further legal challenge is pending in England amid concerns that police forces signed up to the Stonewall scheme are breaching police rules on political activity and risking their impartiality by association with groups that could create a conflict of interest.\nSimon Fanshawe, one of the original founders of Stonewall, says the problem is that Stonewall have embarked upon a course of action which is divisive. In their zeal to support self-identification of sex they have represented the law as they wanted it to be rather than as it is, refused to acknowledge legitimate concerns and said that anyone who believes that sex is binary is a bigot. Their director even went so far as to compare such views to anti-Semitism which caused understandable outrage in the Jewish community.\nYesterday’s judgment shows that she was quite wrong to say that.\nA fellow National columnist suggested that it might be of assistance for them to read out the Equality Act to me. This suggestion betrays a rather naïve understanding of how statute law works. The law on the page requires to be interpreted and applied. Where there is disagreement as to how that should be done, people may resort to the courts to seek an authoritative ruling.\nYesterday we got one of those from the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in a case brought by Maya Forstater, who lost her job because of her gender critical beliefs. The case defines these as the belief that biological sex is real, important, immutable and not to be conflated with gender identity. The EAT held that such beliefs are protected under the Equality Act and Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nThe court said that gender critical beliefs are protected because they are beliefs that are widely shared, including amongst respected academics, and are also consistent with the law on sex and gender. Holding or expressing such beliefs does not inherently interfere with the rights of trans people, even though some people may find them offensive or even distressing. This does not mean that people with gender critical views can ‘indiscriminately’ or ‘gratuitously’ refuse to use a trans colleague’s preferred pronouns. To do so may constitute unlawful harassment of that person. But expressing such views does not necessarily constitute harassment and whether it does in any given situation will depend on the facts and circumstances.\nSo now it is crystal clear that holding gender critical beliefs is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act and that it is unlawful for employers, service providers or membership organisations to discriminate against, harass or victimise their employees, service users or members simply for holding or expressing such beliefs.\nTrans people will still have the protection of the law against discrimination and harassment both because they hold the protected characteristic of gender reassignment and because their philosophical belief in gender identity is equally deserving of protection. But this judgment will help to protect women, and men, from spurious claims of transphobia designed to shut down the articulation of arguments flowing from the belief that sex is immutable and sex matters.\nStudents like Lisa Keogh, as well as academics who have had to endure disciplinary investigations for expressing gender critical views may have legal remedies against their university. Members of trade unions and political parties who have been hounded from office or party membership for holding gender critical beliefs may have legal remedies against their union or party.\nMost importantly, this judgement will make it easier to have a proper, informed debate about whether there is any conflict between self-identification of sex and women’s sex-based rights under the Equality Act. Stonewall and other advocacy organisations should not stick their heads in the sand about this judgment or misrepresent it. It is categorically not an attack on trans rights. Leading LGB equality advocates such as some of the founders of Stonewall who are now in the LGB Alliance have not suddenly turned into bigots overnight. Nor have lifelong feminists. Concern is widespread and the debate needs a reset. It would help to reconsider what we are trying to achieve. Most people, apart from the Tory MPs howling at the moon yesterday during a debate on the rights of asylum seekers, believe in equality and fairness for all. It is easier to listen respectfully to different views on how this might be realised when we recognise that we all share the same goal.\nEmployers, service providers and membership organisations need to revisit their equality and diversity policies to make sure they state the law correctly and don’t discriminate against any of the protected characteristics. Political parties and trade unions need some sort of truth and reconciliation or conflict resolution process to bring back into the fold members who have left, or been side lined for holding gender critical beliefs. They will also need to address the problems that have been caused by members who have wrongly been given the impression that they can make unfounded allegations of transphobia to marginalise their political rivals.\nGovernments across the UK will no doubt be acutely aware that under the Equality Act, the Public Sector Equality Duty obliges them to foster good relations between groups with different protected characteristics. This is never more important than when reforms are contemplated that risk putting the rights of groups with different protected characteristics at loggerheads. In 2019, together with a trans woman constituent I wrote to the Cabinet Secretary with responsibility for Equalities suggesting that the tensions over reform of the Gender Recognition Act might be resolved by a Citizens Assembly.\nWe wrote that we believed that the majority of the issues thrown up by moves to reform the current GRA process can be resolved. However, we equally conceded that there are issues which may not be resolved and that these must be brought into the open and properly examined. Now seems a good time to renew that call.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_covid-19-health-screening-at-borders/content_284.html": "UK border health check failings risk Scottish lives\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 24th Apr 2020\nAfter the excoriating Sunday newspaper critique of Boris Johnson and his government’s mishandling of the current crisis, a lot has been written about whether Scotland should be taking a different path. Many argue that the facts speak for themselves. However, although I know it may disappoint some, I am not going to second guess Nicola Sturgeon’s strategy in this column. Put simply she has the responsibility of running the country. I don’t. She also is privy to information and advice which none of the rest of us have.\nSome excellent analytical pieces have been written in this newspaper by independent commentators like Lesley Riddoch and Kirsty Hughes. The FM herself has said her government’s strategy may diverge from the UK government’s strategy going forward and we will hear more about that later this week.\nHowever, some of those who have chosen to snipe at the Scottish Government rather than produce the sort of thoughtful analyses referred to above seem to have conveniently forgotten the realities of devolution and the rejection of independence in the 2014 referendum.\nThe devolved Scottish Government simply does not hold many of the powers crucial to dealing with the fallout from this crisis, because these powers are reserved to Westminster. They cannot deliver business bailouts or the basic income which I, along with long time advocates such as Ronnie Cowan MP, have demanded. This is not because Scotland is an economic basket case or would be if independent, it is because Scotland’s government does not have the powers to shape macroeconomic policy.\nIt simply isn’t fair to criticise Nicola Sturgeon for not emulating Jacinda Ardern. Scotland is not New Zealand. Scotland is not an independent country. Scotland also shares an island with England and Wales and, as the FM has said, the virus does not respect borders or boundaries and border control is the responsibility of the UK Government. That is why, as the SNP’s shadow Home Secretary, I have raised the issue of the lack of health checks and quarantining measures at our airports and ports with Priti Patel.\nSignificant numbers of people are continuing to enter the UK at airports without any health checks or quarantining. When I first raised this with the Home Secretary before Easter, she said it was largely a matter for the Department of Transport, and that the current approach is based on advice from Public Health England but subject to review by the Scientific Advice Group for Emergencies (SAGE).\nHowever, border control is a matter for the Home Office and in contrast to the UK many other countries across Europe and the world have some form of health checks at airports plus quarantining for arrivals.\nThere seems now to be general agreement that we should be moving to a system of testing, contract tracing and isolation. As we do so, new systems will need to be put in place. I have suggested to Priti Patel that COVID19 assessment points are set up at airports after Border Control with health checks, including virus testing, and instructions and advice for quarantine as a condition for admission to the UK.\nI fully accept that health checks, even testing, would not catch every case of the virus that comes into the UK before communication. Some people may not yet have developed symptoms, and that is why health checks must be combined with 14 days quarantining or self-isolation for all who arrive, as happens in Ireland. Moreover, given the rate of transmission of this virus any significant interruption of the chain of transmission would surely be worthwhile.\nBorder health control measures of the sort adopted by other countries would also serve to increase public confidence and support for the general approach as we move towards consideration of the conditions for a relaxing of lockdown.\nThe UK government keep saying they are following the science but it’s hard to understand why their approach to border health checks is so out of step with other countries who are presumably also following the science. The scientific advice is not uniform. Political decision makers still have agency.\nIf Patel fails to act, then there are measures the Scottish Government could take. Health protection is devolved and Schedule 19 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 gave Scottish Ministers the power to make regulations “….for the purpose of preventing, protecting against, controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination in Scotland (whether from risks originating there or elsewhere).” This specifically includes requiring persons to submit to medical examination and isolation or quarantine.\nHowever, the reality is that only about 3% of the 260,000 passengers continuing to enter the UK on a weekly basis come through Scottish airports. The vast majority arrive at Heathrow first and then take onward flights to Scotland or travel elsewhere internally. To demand that the FM “closes the border” with England is not realistic. There is no border to close and no means for her so to do.\nThat is why Patel must act. Why doesn’t she? Perhaps because this is not about keeping foreigners out, which seems to be what normally floats her boat. Regulations would apply equally to British citizens and residents returning home from abroad. This is not about immigration control it is about health.\nWe need to keep the pressure up on this hapless Tory Government. Decisions taken, or not being taken, at Westminster are shaping our lives as never before. The First Minister has said that the time has come to look at what we can do differently. We may well be in the realm of damage limitation given what has gone before and the limited powers of Holyrood, but the time has surely come to use the latter to the utmost degree.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_identifying-as-scottish-is-important/content_245.html": "There is a reason why identifying as Scottish is so important to us\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 19th May 2023\nI tried to tune out the nonsense and the bile emanating from the National Conservative conference in London this week, but it wasn’t easy. For a start, I had to walk past the venue on my way to and from work at Westminster every day and as well as seeing the assorted loons coming and going, inevitably some of their far-right Trumpian nonsense has cut through.\nOn Wednesday I read that, as he railed against devolution, Sir John Hayes MP claimed that the rise of “Welsh and Scottish identities” devalues British identity. Sir John is a back-bench Tory MP who pulls the Home Secretary’s strings, has strong links with the Republican Party and thinks the Public Order Act is a “moral” piece of legislation in which the government is acting “justly and rightly in defence of law-abiding, decent patriotic people.” At least that’s what he claimed in his contribution to Tuesday’s SNP opposition-day debate in the Commons on repealing the Tories’ latest crack down on the right to protest.\nHe has also misguidedly claimed that the departure of Nicola Sturgeon together with the advent of the Windsor framework (Rishi Sunak’s renegotiation of the Northern Ireland Protocol) means that the UK is “more united now that it has been for years”. Thank goodness he speaks from a position of ignorance.\nWhatever the SNP’s temporary troubles, the polls show that support for Scottish independence is undiminished and in Northern Ireland the once-dominant force of Unionism lost its majority in the province’s political institutions in 2017, its majority at Westminster in 2019 and the office of first minister of Northern Ireland in 2022. So, Sir John is out of touch with reality so far as events in Scotland and Northern Ireland are concerned. Nevertheless, his claims about Welsh and Scottish identities devaluing British identity need to be challenged. For a start it is not exactly on-message with the picture of a glorious Union of equal partners that the Tories seek to portray. But, more importantly, it betrays a very poor understanding of the way in which multiple identities can sit together, and why, for Scots at least, the identity they prefer is Scottish.\nI was reminded of this when preparing for and participating in one of a series of Conversations about Britishness and Irishness in Dublin on Monday evening. The event was held at the Royal Irish Academy under the auspices of an initiative called Analysing and Researching Ireland North and South (ARINS). Its purpose is to generate authoritative, independent and non-partisan research and analysis on a range of important issues for contemporary Ireland. The Conversations are designed to facilitate open and respectful discussion about cultural and political identities in and relating to Ireland. The other people on the panel were Northern Irish politicians, Claire Hanna, the SDLP MP, and Doug Beattie, the Official Unionist MLA. I was invited to add a third dimension as a British politician of Irish descent who thinks Scotland should be an independent country. We were asked whether we agreed with a leading Irish columnist that Irishness and Britishness currently sit together more comfortably than at any time in history. Despite the provocation of Brexit, the wrangling over the Irish border and the Northern Ireland Protocol, thanks to the calm reaction of the Irish Government, the pragmatism of the EU and the advent of the Windsor Protocol, we all found ourselves in agreement with this statement.\nAnother factor is that emigration from Britain to Ireland now outstrips emigration the other way. This, of course, is partly a function of the easy availability of Irish passports for British people who like me are lucky enough to have an Irish parent, with the benefit of free movement enabling travel and work across the EU. People are also choosing to be Irish because, with the fastest-growing GDP in the EU, Ireland is an economic success story. It is also a vibrant, young nation that has modernised and secularised. Sure, it faces its problems particularly in housing and health, but it punches above its weight on the international stage, so why wouldn’t it feel confident?\nWhen more British people are looking to Ireland for advancement than vice versa and when the British Government has learned that when it tries to push Ireland around the Irish will have the international community on their side, then no wonder Britishness no longer feels like a threat to the Irish. At the same time Brexit has revealed Britain as backward-looking while Ireland looks thoroughly modern. Alert readers will notice that I have referred to myself as a British politician. I don’t have a problem with multiple identities, plus we are born into some identities, while for others we make a positive choice.\nI was born and live on the island of Britain. I work and represent my constituents in the British Parliament. But, like most Scots, I primarily identify as Scottish (and in my case also Irish). The social attitudes survey has shown that three in four Scots consider themselves Scottish rather than British. People in Scotland are seven times more likely to feel more Scottish than British than the other way round. The ratio in Wales is just two to one and in England identification is almost equal, with half explicitly stating their identity to be equally English and British.\nSo why are the Scots so keen to claim our distinctive national identity and why does someone like Sir John Hayes find it such a threat? The reality that Sir John finds so hard to accept is that Britain is not a nation. It’s a state comprised of nations like Scotland and Wales who, in the absence of statehood create a cultural narrative for their people. The devolution which Sir John loathes has given the people of Scotland a Parliament to express that cultural narrative and a tantalising taste of what statehood might have to offer, encouraging rather than diminishing the desire for self-determination. Perhaps,even more importantly, just as Brexit has illustrated Ireland’s strengthened hand in the union of equals that is the European Union, it has highlighted Scotland’s subordinate position in a union that no-one can seriously describe as one of equals.\nScotland’s marginalisation within the United Kingdom would not happen in the European Union. If the European Union was taking a decision as drastic as Brexit and it had only four nations in it, all four nations would need to agree. But, as we know, within the UK, Scotland’s voice can be ignored again and again without any constitutional consequences. To make matters worse the Supreme Court appears to have acquiesced in the view that the Union is for now at least a hostage situation and even gone so far as to suggest Scots don’t enjoy the right to self-determination. So, for Scots claiming our national identity as our primary identity is an act of defiance. The challenge for the Yes movement and the pro-independence parties is to harness that defiance and channel it into the confidence we need to embrace statehood.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_assist-those-left-behind-after-taliban-takeover/content_200.html": "We must do more to assist those left behind after the Taliban’s takeover\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 24th Sep 2021\nIt’s been another week of ignominy for the UK Government’s efforts to assist those left behind after the evacuation of Kabul. The revelation of yet more serious data breaches in relation to sensitive information about Afghans who worked for the British Government was particularly shocking because it meant lives have been put at risk. The Defence Minister, Ben Wallace, was quite right when he said that it should not just be the person who sent the email who was held to account but the chain upwards to make sure this does not happen again. The problem for Mr Wallace is that the chain upwards leads to him and his other cabinet colleagues. Multiple and critical failings in relation to highly vulnerable people who are at immediate risk of death are clear evidence that the systems the Government have in place are inadequate and I have written to the Information Commissioner in this regard asking her to launch an investigation.\nWhilst it is only right to praise the efforts of those British forces, civil servants and NGOs on the ground who worked hard to get as many people out as possible, their efforts should not be a shield for their political masters to hide behind. MPs continue to receive desperate pleas on behalf of the left-behind, but the UK government machine cannot even get its act together to answer MPs’ inquires individually and the PM is quite happy to mislead the House of Commons by suggesting that this has been done.\nAs well as helping constituents with inquiries about friends and family in Afghanistan, I have also been approached to speak up for the plight of LGBT plus people under the Taliban and the plight of female judges.\nA debate about the former was held at Westminster this week and I summed up for the SNP. Many of the important questions I and other MPs raised with the Minister are of relevance to all Afghans seeking sanctuary, not just LGBT plus people. How do we support vulnerable Afghans who manage to make their way to neighbouring third countries who are not sympathetic to the rights of women or minorities? How do we co-ordinate the international response? How do we provide safe legal routes to the UK for those who strive to come on their own steam to seek asylum and how do we ensure they are treated humanely once they get here and not criminalised for coming by irregular routes?\nSadly no proper answers were forthcoming from the Minister. Just fine words, flannel, banal generalities and a total failure to address the adverse impact the Nationality Bill will have on asylum seekers.\nThe UK Government pursed a foreign and defence policy which encouraged people in Afghanistan to participate in creating a democratic state where human rights were protected. Due to the failure of that policy many of these people are now at risk. There is a moral responsibility to take proper steps to help them. What is needed is less hand ringing and more action.\nWe all know that women face particular oppression under the Taliban. The briefings which Stonewall and the Rainbow Migration project prepared for MPs emphasised that being a woman considerably decreases someone’s ability to move or to act to protect themselves in Afghanistan. Even if they make it to a third country, lesbians and bisexual women are even less likely to come forward to UNHCR or other humanitarian agencies than gay or bisexual men, because as women they are even more likely to experience persecution within their homes and from family members, and to have less mobility and fewer resources open to them. If they make it to the United Kingdom, it is often hard for them to prove their sexuality, because they have led such hidden lives and have often been in forced marriages. The reality is that in their own country and in the UK, these women are discriminated against twice over, for their sex as well as their sexuality.\nIt’s the same for the brave women who became judges, prosecutors, policewomen, human rights defenders and women’s rights activists. Now their lives are in mortal danger. So are those of many of the men they worked alongside but the women’s lack of freedom to move and to take the means to leave the country themselves is restricted by the severe discrimination women face under the Taliban.\nI am working with a former Afghan judge and feminist activist to try and highlight the plight of lower-level female judges in provincial villages whose lives are particularly at risk because they live in small communities and are therefore more readily identifiable. Marzia Babakarkhail came to the UK in 2008 after two attempts on her life by the Taliban. She is now a British citizen and lives in Oldham. Her story is featured in the People’s Museum in Manchester which houses the black Samsonite bag given to Marzia by her mother, as a present to congratulate her on her success as a lawyer. One of the few possessions she was able to bring with her to her new life.\nMarzia is in contact with over 200 female judges trapped in Afghanistan. They are in imminent danger of persecution from the Taliban, and the dangerous criminals and other terrorist groups the Taliban have released from prison. The Taliban's opposition to the formal justice system of Afghanistan is well-known. They are strongly against state-building and justice reconstruction efforts by ‘Westernising’ forces, favouring Sharia as the source of justice, which is underpinned by a strict interpretation of Islam. In the past, they have targeted and brutally killed many judges.\nThe men they have released from prison are now heavily armed and free to trace and target their enemies without fear. Many female judges were involved in the indictment and punishment process of these criminals and terrorists and are prime targets for revenge attacks. The Taliban are conducting house-to-house searches. Many of the judges are now in hiding where they receive threatening phone calls asking them about their whereabouts. They are contacting Marzia in fear and desperation.\nIn 2003, the CEDAW (the Convention for the Elimination of Violence against Women) was ratified by Afghanistan under Western influence. Based upon this law, specialist courts were established in 34 provinces, under the control of female judges. The Taliban and other conservative groups in Afghanistan consider this law to be un-Islamic and its judges infidels and foreign collaborators. Any of the female judges who sat in those courts are at risk.\nHelena Kennedy QC, the Head of the International Bar Association’s (IBA) Human Rights Institute, is working with a large team of pro-bono lawyers in the UK and across the world to try to save some of these women. She has launched a fund raiser and a petition to parliament. But Marzia is worried that junior female judges in the provinces will be overlooked and so I am working to raise their profile with both the IBA and the British Government. Earlier this month I brought Marzia into parliament to meet with Helena, the Justice Committee and the then English Justice Secretary, Robert Buckland QC, who impressed her with his obvious concern. Unfortunately, he lost his position in the Cabinet reshuffle. His replacement is Dominic Raab who, so far, has not covered himself in glory over Afghanistan. Doing something to help these women would be a way for him to make amends and I will press him to do it.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_internal-market-bill-cuts-out-devolved-decision-making/content_221.html": "UK is a rogue state, Scotland needs a more innovative strategy\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 11th Sep 2020\nIn a crowded field this has been yet another unprecedented week in British politics. While all eyes in Scotland were focused on the anticipated attack on Holyrood’s powers in the UK Internal Market Bill, nothing had quite prepared anyone for the shock of finding out that as well as overriding the devolution settlement the British Government intended to explicitly disavow their international treaty obligations and their duty to obey international law.\nIt is difficult to overstate the enormity of this. The UK Government is openly threatening to depart from its obligations under two international treaties – the Withdrawal Agreement and the Good Friday agreement. A major trade treaty and a major peace treaty with significant implications for human rights.\nIf the Internal Market Bill is passed into law what moral authority the UK still has on the world stage will be gone. Indeed, some may say the damage is already done. Why should China care about the UK’s condemnation of the National Security Law they imposed on Hong Kong? So what if it is in violation of China’s international obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration? How can the UK Govt ever again call out those who flout international law.\nSo what’s really going on here?\nIn so far as Devolution is concerned, most people recognise that Brexit necessitates a rethink on how free trade operates within the UK in respect of both goods and services. We won’t be operating under EU law anymore so there is a need for common standards to be set across the UK. The devolved governments have accepted this and offered to work with the UK Government on setting up new frameworks. But what this bill effectively does is to cut the devolved governments out of any decision making and impose new rules top down from Westminster. This means is that if Westminster is happy for you to be eating chlorinated chicken you will be eating it regardless of any food safety or animal welfare concerns Holyrood might have.\nFurthermore, under clause 46 of the bill, EU funding for infrastructure projects in devolved areas such as health, education and housing, previously funnelled to suitable projects by the Scottish Government, will be replaced by direct funding from the Westminster government. The devolved institutions will be by-passed and public subsidies will be set according to the political priorities of a Tory Government, which most Scots didn’t vote for, rather than the SNP Government in Edinburgh which we elected to make decisions in these devolved areas.\nWestminster is taking back control and recentralising the UK. This is not what the overwhelming majority of Scots voted for in the 1997 Devolution referendum. In fact, it is quite the opposite.\nIn so far as the UK Government’s obligations under the Withdrawal Agreement are concerned, the bill is all about getting Boris Johnson off the hook he hoisted himself onto in order to get a deal before last year’s deadline. In order to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the Northern Ireland protocol the UK Government agreed to special arrangements for Northern Ireland, making it subject to the EU customs code and the rules of the single market so far as most goods are concerned. This meant a customs frontier between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and the UK’s agreement to abide by EU rules about state aid in respect of trade between Northern Ireland and the EU. Under EU law state aid government subsidies for industry is not allowed without special permission because its seen as an anti-competitive practice which undermines free trade. There was also a significant continuing role for the Tories bete-noire, the European Court of Justice.\nIn order to get around this, clauses 42, 43 and 45 of the bill will enable ministers to make regulations about goods leaving Northern Ireland and state aid which will have effect “notwithstanding their incompatibility with any rule of international or domestic law whatsoever”. And Ministers will also be empowered to block the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Commission over state aid rules despite the UK’s explicit agreement to accept this jurisdiction in the Withdrawal Agreement.\nEven if this power is never used, (and why pass it if you don’t intend to use it), its very existence breaches the Withdrawal Agreement, Article 4 of which states that the UK must ensure that the agreement is available and enforceable in domestic law so that it has the same effect that EU law has in the other member states. Once the power is used articles 5 and 10 of the Northern Ireland protocol will also be breached.\nIf this happens a hard border on the island of Ireland could be back on the table.\nFinally, for the legal geeks, clause 45 of the Bill seeks to prevent judicial review on any normal domestic law or human rights grounds of any regulations to be made under clauses 42-43 of the bill. Generally, the courts take a dim view of attempts to oust judicial review of secondary legislation and so a potential court battle over the true extent of parliamentary sovereignty could be on the cards. This might dovetail nicely with a Scottish challenge to the Governments broader plans to ‘reform” judicial review on the grounds that they would breach the Treaty of Union.\nBut where does this leave Scotland more generally?\nProfessor Brigid Laffan, the eminent Irish political scientist and Director of the Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies at the European University Institute, tweeted “The Scots need to wise up to the kind of state that Brexit UK has become and take back control.” She is of course right. But these developments surely pose potential problems for the strategy of staking all on the grant of a section 30 order from this UK Government. How should we deal with a Government that doesn’t obey international law? A Government that tries to oust the jurisdiction of the courts? A Government that is prepared to disregard the overwhelming mandate won for the current devolved settlement in the 1997 referendum? Just how does one negotiate with a rogue state? Is it reasonable to continue with a strategy designed for dealing with a state that obeys the rule of law and respects democratic mandates or is something a little more innovative required?\nThe Scottish Government has not ruled out recourse to litigation either in respect of the provisions of this bill or, indeed, in respect of the future refusal of a section 30 order. But what will we do if court action fails or if we win but this rogue Government refuses to respect the judgment of the court?\nFor the time being at least, it has been made very clear to me that these are decisions above my pay grade, but they are decisions which will require to be taken nonetheless.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_written-constitution/content_227.html": "A written constitution highlights the excesses of Westminster\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 23rd Jun 2023\nToday is the 7th anniversary of the Brexit referendum. The economic damage is plain to see but Labour doesn’t want to talk about it and of course, neither do the Conservatives. The only way Scotland will re-join the EU is with independence.\nLikewise, we know that the only way meaningful constitutional reform will come about in Scotland is with independence. We saw a prime example of that this week, when, after nearly a century of talking about reforming the House of Lords and recently promising to abolish it and replace it with an elected upper chamber, Labour briefed out their plans to pack the place with new peers if they win the General Election.\nFrom the unlawful prorogation to the post Brexit power grab of the Internal Market Act the last few years have amply demonstrated that the unwritten British constitution does not work to protect our institutions or our people from the tyranny of governments who don’t play by the rules. The Tories, particularly under Johnson, have been able to undermine parliament, the independence of the courts and the devolution settlement. With a written constitution none of this would have been possible, or at least a great deal more difficult. Yet we know that just as with re-joining the EU neither Tories nor Labour are interested in establishing a written constitution for the UK.\nSo, this week’s white paper from the Scottish Government was a welcome reminder that an independent Scotland will have a written constitution reflecting the international norm.\nA written constitution is a basic necessity to control the excesses of majoritarianism (see Boris Johnson), to protect our institutions, to provide checks and balances on the power of government and to put democracy, human rights and equality at the heart of everything we do as a nation.\nThe SNP’s commitment that an independent Scotland should have a written constitution goes way back. Much work was done on this by Prof Neil MacCormick QC prior to his untimely death in 2009. In 2002, after several drafts, he published a Constitution for a Free Scotland. In 2014 prior to the independence referendum the Scottish Government produced and consulted on an interim written constitution and plans to involve civic Scotland in drawing up a permanent constitution after independence was won. For several years Constitution for Scotland have been conducting an online public consultation on what such a constitution might look like. In 2018 the Common Weal Think tank produced a policy paper called Foundations for Freedom which has much in common with the new Scottish government white paper. Both credit Dr Elliot Bulmer who has worked hard to promote the idea of a written constitution for an independent Scotland. Accordingly, it has never really been in question that an independent Scotland should have a written constitution. The real issues for discussion are what it should look like and who gets to decide what is in it.\nLet’s start with who decides. What the Scottish Government propose now by way of process is not all that different from was proposed in 2014 however there is a welcome expansion of the detail of what our written constitution might cover both in the interim and the long term. On process, the interim constitution drawn up by the Government takes effect on day one of independence and is later replaced by a permanent constitution drawn up by a constitutional convention which will be a body independent of parliament and representative of the people of Scotland.\nBy contrast Common Weal want to see the interim or provisional constitution drawn up by a representative constitutional conference with further deliberation post-independence in an inclusive and participatory process to expand upon the basic interim constitution, for example, by including the question of whether Scotland should be a republic and the expansion of rights to include socio-economic rights. It is good that everyone wants to see citizen participation in the framing of the constitution. The real difference is whether that happens before or after independence. Like my fellow columnist Lesley Riddoch, my preference would be for the former.\nAs to what is in the constitution the SNP white paper sets out some of the important institutional frameworks and safeguards for a democratic state. Likewise, the Common Weal paper recognised that the “priority for a provisional constitution should be to protect Scotland’s existing institutions by placing them on a firm constitutional foundation, while adjusting them to an independent state.” Both recognise that Scotland is fortunate in already having in place many of the building blocks of statehood such as a parliament, a government, courts and a legal system, a police force, an ombudsperson, an auditor general and most aspects of internal administration.\nLaudably the Scottish Government white paper wants to “spread power among the institutions and communities of Scotland rather than locating it in only one place”. For example, the interim constitution would include a provision reflecting and protecting the specific interests and needs of island communities and for the long-term it says the Scottish government would support the constitutional protection of the islands interests and needs.\nThe Scottish Government white paper rightly puts the basic human rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) at the centre of the protection of universal human rights in the constitution. This is an absolute necessity for Scotland’s accession to both the Council of Europe and the European Union. It also seeks to enshrine socio-economic rights such as the right to access healthcare free at the point of need and the right to an adequate standard of living as defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Common Weal draft were content to leave these rights for those deliberating on the final constitution. I think they were right to do so.\nWhether and how to incorporate socio-economic rights is an issue fraught with political controversy. Many take the view that economic and social rights are better left as aspirational policy goals rather than enforceable legal rights. It is also argued that incorporating such rights in law would allow the courts to usurp the functions of the democratically elected Government and Parliament and that it would lead to judicial involvement in resource allocation which is constitutionally inappropriate.\nPost-Apartheid South Africa’s decision to incorporate such rights in their Bill of Rights has posed considerable challenges for the ANC government. Yet Albie Sachs has argued that a country which does not include social and economic rights in some form in its Bill of Rights is a country which has “given up on aspiration”.\nThe bottom line is this, no matter what it says about an adequate standard of living a written constitution won’t put food on the table for families across Scotland. For that we need a growing economy and wealth redistribution. Enshrining the NHS won’t help us get healthcare when we need it. For that we need to keep our NHS properly resourced, organised and staffed. Likewise enshrining the specific interests and needs of island communities will not give communities the power to thrive without ensuring local people have proper control of their local areas and aren’t just small parts of enormous local authorities. Nor will mere words ensure the modern efficient ferry service our islands so desperately need.\nWhile reiterating our commitment to a written constitution is worthwhile, the inclusion of aspirational goals is no substitute for the hard work that needs to be done on policy to deliver a flourishing economy that creates the wealth needed to fund public services that work well for all. Here also the Scottish Government should look to the policy papers of Common Weal for inspiration, as my colleagues Kate Forbes, Ivan McKee and Michelle Thomson have already advocated.\nAfter I had finished writing this column, I heard the sad news that Winnie Ewing, ‘Madame Ecosse’, has died. She was an icon of our independence movement. What she achieved should inspire us to look beyond and above current difficulties and to remember that our goal and the transformative change that could come with it are possible.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_coronavirus-modernise-uk-parliaments/content_308.html": "Now is the time to modernise the UK's parliaments\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 20th Mar 2020\nThree weeks ago, when Gail Ross announced she was standing down from parliament, no one could have guessed how relevant some of the issues she raised were about to become for all parliamentarians. Gail explained that she was finding the demands of travelling to Edinburgh every week, covering the ground in her sizeable rural constituency and caring for a young family too much. She suggested that MSPs who faced similar challenges should be afforded the opportunity to use online technology for meetings and voting. Now, as the Corona Virus spreads and Scotland and the UK go into lockdown, the mechanics that could make her suggestion work need to be looked at as a matter of urgency.\nWe keep hearing that the Westminster parliament did not shut down during either World War or the Spanish flu but in those days, there was not the option of digital technology which makes both remote working and remote voting possible. As the virus swept across continental Europe the EU parliament cut its timetable down to one plenary session without voting on 9 March, and on 10 March MEPs said their good-byes and returned to their home countries to work remotely. They do not know when the European Parliament will reconvene. In the USA a Democratic Congresswoman suggested that they adopt remote voting if the crisis worsened to the extent that it would be imprudent for representatives to travel.\nAt Westminster, at Prime Minister’s Questions on 4 March, Carol Monaghan pointed out that MPs are often jammed into crowded voting lobbies with hundreds of other MPs and wondered how many of us would be taking the virus back to our constituencies. That practice continued despite Carol’s concerns and as she predicted it appears that some MPs have indeed taken the virus back home with them. Dr Philippa Whitford has raised the same concerns pointing out that while the UK Government has argued that asymptomatic spread is incredibly rare that has not been the experience of the Asian countries that have been through the worst of the crisis. For these reasons and others Dr Philippa was an early advocate of the social distancing that is now the norm.\nLast year the Westminster parliament became a little more family-friendly when it introduced the practice of allowing MPs on maternity or paternity leave to vote by proxy but there seems to be little inclination to go any further. Repeated demands by SNP MPs for electronic voting have fallen on deaf ears even though most modern parliaments like Holyrood use this every day.\nAt Holyrood Gail Ross asked the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee of the Scottish Parliament to see if there was any possibility that members could video into meetings and remote vote. She was advised that the committee has identified concerns over remote voting and did not think it feasible to pursue it “at this time” but, it would consider the potential for proxy voting.\nI understand why remote voting is approached with caution in normal times. There is a risk that if MPs or MSPs don’t need to be at parliament they will be under immense pressure to spend more of their time in the constituency working on local issues which might be better taken forward by others and thereby neglecting the important functions of making laws and scrutinising the Government of the day. There needs to be a proper balance between parliamentarians’ local and national duties and democracy benefits from parliamentarians meeting together in person to swap ideas and experiences as well as to debate and vote.\nHowever the current unprecedented public health crisis is surely a good opportunity for Westminster to trial electronic voting and for both parliaments to trial remote voting and video conferencing for important committee meetings. It seems inevitable that neither parliament can continue to meet as normal at least for the height of the crisis but it is imperative that representative democracy continues and that the executive is kept under scrutiny particularly in relation to the wide-ranging emergency powers that are contemplated.\nFinally, while it is entirely right that large gatherings like the SNP June Conference and the scheduled National Assemblies should be postponed, it is most unfortunate that party members won’t have these forums to discuss and debate policy and strategy as the UK teeters on the edge of cutting itself off from the rest of Europe even further. I agree with those who argue that it is wholly unrealistic to think that Indyref2 can now happen this year. However, the issue of Scotland’s constitutional future will return to the top of the agenda when this crisis is over. The SNP has a record of digital innovation and now would be the perfect opportunity to use this know-how to improve internal party democracy by facilitating participation in discussion and decision making through digital democracy platforms.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_tory-attack-human-rights-scottish-independence/content_222.html": "Tory attack on human rights will help drive up support for Scottish independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 24th Jun 2022\nAfter years of huffing and puffing about the Human Rights Act (HRA) and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the Tories have published their Bill to “repeal and replace’ the Human Rights Act. No one should be in any doubt that they intend to achieve a seismic shift in the way in which human rights are enforced across the UK. The contents of the bill also mean major changes to the devolved settlement and will necessitate the amendment of the Scotland Act.\nThe Tory manifesto promised simply to “update” the HRA, but this bill goes a lot further. While it purports to protect the same convention rights as the HRA (with one or two cosmetic extras) it directs the domestic courts to a much narrower interpretation of those rights and limits the enforceability and universality of those rights by introducing a new requirement for permission to proceed with a claim and by creating categories of individuals who are exempt from some of the Convention rights or for whom damages for breach can be curtailed.\nHere is one particularly shocking example: the bill purports to strengthen the right to free speech (already protected under Article 10 of the ECHR), by mandating that domestic courts give “great weight” to the right, but then it exempts criminal proceedings from this duty thereby insulating its anti-protest laws in the Police Act and Public Order Bill from challenge by those penalised or silenced by the draconian measures in that legislation. So as leading human rights lawyer Adam Wagner neatly puts it – free speech is protected unless you are charged with a criminal offence for expressing yourself. If nothing else this should cause any democrat to shudder. It also exposes the Tories’ utter hypocrisy.\nThe irony is that by staying in the ECHR but restricting the ability of people in the UK to bring a case in the domestic courts when their Convention rights are breached, the UK Government is likely be found in breach of the Convention by the Strasbourg court far more frequently than is currently the case. But perhaps this is what the Government wants so it can continue to rile up its base by railing against ‘foreign courts’.\nIt’s my privilege at this anxious time for human rights across the UK to have taken over as chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights whilst Harriet Harman QC MP steps aside to chair the Privileges Committee inquiry about whether the PM knowingly misled Parliament over partygate. We will be carrying out in depth scrutiny of the bill, and we started our preparations to do so at our weekly meeting the same day the Bill was introduced. We don’t think this is evidence-based policy making. We have already published two unanimous cross-party reports which concluded that the Human Rights Act is working well and does not need to be repealed or replaced. That was also the conclusion of an independent review of the HRA which the Government commissioned last year and then ignored.\nWhen a JCHR delegation visited Strasbourg last week, we were told that UK Government Ministers have given repeated assurances that the UK will remain in the ECHR, and I was pleased to hear the Secretary of State reiterate that assurance in parliament this week. However, the Prime Minister made some veiled threats about leaving last week after Strasbourg’s Rwanda ruling, so I am not betting on the British Government keeping its word. Frankly, who would?\nIn any event, even if the UK is to stay in the ECHR, it needs to be done with integrity. The UK cannot pick and choose which convention rights it wants to observe or for whom it wants to observe them. This bill is a calculated attempt to disengage from the ECHR by watering down the rights it ensures, limiting the ability for them to be enforced and permitting the domestic courts of the UK to ignore judgments, decisions, and interim measures of the European Court of Human Rights. This last measure is in clear violation of article 34 of the Convention and therefore a breach of the UK’s international treaty obligations. But then we know that the current UK government is happy to breach other international treaties including one they signed just recently – the Withdrawal Agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol – and another which is a guarantee of peace on the island of Ireland – the Good Friday Agreement (GFA). Incidentally the Bill of Rights may also breach the GFA.\nAnother issue on the international front is that the UK’s disengagement from the ECHR risks giving encouragement to populist Governments in eastern Europe who have scant regard for human rights or, indeed, the rule of law.\nIf the above is not enough to make you angry and alarmed, then the implications for devolution should be. The UK Government’s own explanatory notes to the bill accept that large parts of it will require legislative consent motions for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nAt present ECHR rights apply in Scotland both via the HRA and the Scotland Act. ‘Convention rights’ in the Scotland Act are defined by reference to the HRA so that’s going to need amended for a start. But it goes further than that. When Professor Aileen McHarg gave evidence to the JCHR on what might occur if the HRA was “updated’ she said that changing the rules on how the courts interpret convention rights would change the ways in which those rights limit the actions of the Scottish Government and the competence of Scottish legislation. Changes to the remedies available for breach of convention rights could have knock on effects for legal action taken under the Scotland Act.\nThe Scottish Human Rights Commission warned us that proposals to create a right to a jury trial, a permission stage hurdle for human rights claims and reduction of damages for conduct of the claimant would impact the administration of justice which is a devolved matter. They also expressed their extreme concern about the impact of proposals curtailing human rights protections on access to justice.\nThe JCHR concluded that reform of the HRA really should not go ahead without devolved consent. The problem is of course that we know the Scottish parliament will never consent to this but that the UK Government will proceed anyway. The Sewel Convention is as dead as a dodo.\nOn the upside, at a time when preparations for a second independence referendum are under way, such a root and branch attack on a fundamental aspect of the Scotland Act which has widespread support in Scotland across party lines and in civic society can only aid the case for independence. It also reminds us of the importance of embedding the ECHR in the constitution of an independent Scotland. It's really no accident that this bill was published on the eve of the 6th anniversary of the Brexit referendum. Distancing the UK from the ECHR is simply the next step in the ‘take back control’ agenda. However, what is important to appreciate is that is not the parliaments of the UK that are taking back control, far less the people, but the UK Government who are anxious to avoid scrutiny and being held to account and therefore on a mission to curtail the ability of the courts and indeed our parliaments to do that.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_uk-finding-it-difficult-to-grasp-rules-of-war/content_33.html": "UK finding it difficult to grasp rules of war\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 27th Oct 2023\n“The laws of war must guide Israel’s response to Hamas atrocity.” Not my words but those of a group of eminent Jewish lawyers in a letter to the Financial Times earlier this week. The group included former President of the UK Supreme court, Lord Neuberger, and Philippe Sands KC, one of the world’s foremost experts in international law. Their measured and scholarly letter is particularly impactful because they write as Jews with family and friends directly affected by the terrible crimes perpetrated by Hamas on 7 October.\nThree important points are made in this letter. First, the crimes of Hamas are crimes against humanity. The barbarity inflicted by them and the taking of hostages are war crimes. Second, under international law Israel has the right to respond and to defend itself and its citizens. Third, that response must be in accordance with international law and in particular the laws of war. “These laws apply irrespective of the level of outrageous conduct of an enemy and no exceptions to these rules can be derived from the level of sufferings caused by Hamas actions.”\nThe importance of the international community acting to make sure the laws of war are obeyed, and our collective moral and legal responsibility to avoid another genocide has been at the forefront of my mind after I participated in a delegation to Srebrenica earlier this month. The visit was organised by Remembering Srebrenica Scotland. I hope to write about it in more detail soon but for now what is important is the message of Srebrencia. Never again must the world stand aside while innocent civilians are tortured, raped, and murdered, and never again must the world stand aside while populations are deported or forcibly transferred or have imposed upon them deliberately conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction in whole or in part.\nThe lessons of Srebrenica demand a humanitarian response to the suffering of both Israelis and Palestinians. We must resist the idea that collective punishment should be visited upon the Palestinian people for the crimes of Hamas. Whether that collective punishment consists of seemingly indiscriminate bombing or the restriction of water, food, fuel and electricity to Gaza or the order to 1.1 million Palestinian civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate.\nAmnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross have both stated that Israel’s evacuation order is not compatible with international humanitarian law. Under international humanitarian law a temporary evacuation of a given area may only be carried out if it is absolutely necessary for civilians’ security or for imperative military reasons.\nFor an evacuation to be lawful, Israel is obligated to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the evacuation it is calling for is effected with satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition and that members of the same family are not separated. Evacuees must be returned to their homes as soon as the hostilities cease.\nIsrael’s evacuation order, issued in the context of intense bombardment, and a tightening of its siege of Gaza including the cutting-off of electricity, water, and humanitarian assistance, is incompatible with these obligations. Amnesty International has therefore concluded that Gazans are being forcibly displaced. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has similarly stated that the evacuation order ‘combined with the imposition of a “complete siege” on Gaza may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians – in breach of international law.’\nIn relation to Israel’s restriction of food, fuel, water and electricity, the UN Human Rights Commissioner has said that ‘The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law,’. Any restrictions on the movement of people and goods to implement a siege must be justified by military necessity or may otherwise amount to collective punishment.\nEven before these intensified restrictions, Amnesty International identified that Israel’s existing 16 year long illegal blockade of Gaza already amounted to collective punishment, which is a war crime. As the occupying power, Israel has a clear obligation under international law to ensure the basic needs of Gaza’s civilian population are met. The statement of Israel’s Energy Minister Israel Katz, that no ‘electrical switch will be turned on, no water hydrant will be opened and no fuel truck will enter [until the] abductees’ are free’ appears to be explicit confirmation that the Israeli authorities are punishing civilians in Gaza for the actions of Hamas, which they took no part in and had no control over.\nAt the UN on Wednesday the USA vetoed a security council resolution that would have called for “humanitarian pauses” to deliver lifesaving aid to Gaza. The UK abstained along with Russia. The US veto is in no way off set by the fact that Biden has persuaded the Egyptians to open the Rafa border crossing to aid convoys, access should also be given through the Israeli border and for humanitarian aid it should be unfettered.\nRussia is a strange bedfellow for the UK at the UN. The UK Government needs to remember that it has duties under international law including the obligation to prevent as well as punish acts of genocide under the UN Convention against Genocide. Genocide is defined as certain acts which are committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, racial, or religious group. Acts of genocide include killings, causing serious bodily or mental harm, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction in whole or in part, birth prevention, or forcibly transferring children\nAt Westminster on Tuesday, I chaired a briefing for MPs by representatives of humanitarian aid agencies on the ground. They are warning that we are in the era of atrocity prevention and currently have a short window of opportunity to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza. Given that Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defence minister has said “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything.”, this is not an overstated concern. The agencies also say there must be unfettered humanitarian aid access. Israel must rescind the evacuation order, restore food, water, and power, and there must be a ceasefire.\nFinally, I have deliberately not commented on the deadly strike on the Al- Ahli hospital in this column. The jury is still out on who was responsible and there must be an independent investigation. Those who assumed at the outset that it was the responsibility of the IDF have come in for a lot of criticism. However, after days of seemingly indiscriminate bombing of densely populated civilian areas and the bombing of one of the civilian convoys heeding the Israeli warning to evacuate southwards, it is hardly surprising that people jumped to that conclusion. Moreover, the bombardment meant that about 1,000 people displaced by the Israeli government’s actions were sheltering in the hospital courtyard, hence the extent of the carnage. We need an immediate ceasefire, and the welfare of all innocent civilians must be the priority going forward. A land invasion in somewhere so densely populated would be an absolute massacre.",

Instead, I wish that the post 2014 leadership of the SNP had spent half as much time on advancing the cause of independence as they have spent on identity politics. Had they done so, Scotland might already be an independent country or at the very least considerably further down the road to independence.\nI sense a bewilderment on the part of many SNP members at the focus of our Holyrood parliamentarians and, on the doorsteps, I hear real anger from constituents who think that too much time is spent on virtue signalling and not enough on the issues they care most about such as health, transport, housing, and education.\nIn her podcast this week, Lesley Riddoch said that she sensed a lot of the annoyance with the Hate Crime Act was because it’s not what people want to see the Scottish Parliament spending its time on. I think she is right about that particularly given that our law already contained robust protections against crimes aggravated by hate and against the stirring up of racial hatred, a crime for which there is a well-documented need.\nHowever, there are people, including an army of unpaid feminist volunteers, who have spent a lot of time looking at the detail of the new Act and the motivations behind it. On their behalf, and as someone who is trained to understand the law, I want to set the record straight on a few issues.\nLet’s start by exploding a few myths. Scotland is not disappearing under a tsunami of hate. Here is a graph from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service’s latest report on trends in hate crime reported in Scotland under the law which pre-dated the new Act.\nTrends in hate crime reported, 2003-04 to 2022-23\nWhile it shows an increase in the total number of charges reported to the Crown by the police in respect of sexual orientation and disability, it shows a downward trend in those reported in respect of race, religion, and transgender identity. Only 55 charges with an aggravation of prejudice towards transgender identity were reported in 2022-23, a 36% per cent drop from the 86 charges reported the year before. That’s good news just as the significant drop in racial hate crimes is also good news. I hope this puts things in perspective.\nScotland is not a hate filled country. It IS a very disputatious country. Hate and disputatiousness are not the same thing. Just think how annoyed Yessers were when our enthusiastic support for independence during the 2014 referendum campaign was wrongly portrayed as hateful towards unionists or English people. That is pretty much how many long-standing feminist and lesbian activists feel when our legitimate concerns about the implications of gender identity ideology for women’s privacy, dignity and safety are wrongly portrayed as hateful towards anyone who identifies as trans.\nSome people believe that human beings can change sex. Others, including me, do not. Science and biology are on our side. However, we do not want to prevent the expression of the belief that sex is mutable; we just don't want our belief that sex is immutable to be silenced. In this the law is generally on our side as reflected in important recent judgements which have established that gender critical beliefs are “worthy of respect in a democratic society”.\nHowever, aspects of the new Hate Crime Act risk undermining the protections we enjoy for freedom of belief and free speech under the Equality Act and the Human Rights Act. That need not have been the case if the Scottish parliament had followed the recommendations of the judge who carried out the independent report which preceded the Act. He wanted the Act to include a defence that said there would be no prohibition or restriction of discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult, or abuse of the belief that sex is not binary. The Scottish parliament did not follow his recommendations in this respect (although they did for religious beliefs) and attempts to amend the bill to do so were strongly opposed by lobby groups who adhere to gender identity ideology.\nNext, let me explode another myth. England does not have identical legislation to the new Scottish Act. The legislation in England that deals with stirring up offences covers race, religion, and sexual orientation. It does not cover transgender identity. It deals with behaviour which is threatening, not behaviour which is threatening OR abusive, and it has properly tailored defences of the sort recommended by Lord Bracadale.\nWhen the English Law Commission looked at this matter recently, they recommended that if an offence of stirring up hatred based on transgender identity was to be introduced in England it must be accompanied by the sort of tailored defence Lord Bracadale recommended.\nThe more widely drawn offence in Scotland and the absence of the tailored defence has led to legitimate fears that the law would be used to silence gender critical women. Anyone who is paying attention to the debate on social media knows that it is nonsense to say those fears were unfounded. Furthermore, on Monday morning a government minister suggested that misgendering might be a police matter so it is undoubtedly the case that JK Rowling's intervention and the statement by police that she would not be charged were significant. However, I suspect that if an ordinary woman had tweeted in the same terms as JK Rowling, she might not have got off so lightly.\nIn 2021, I returned briefly to my practice at the bar to defend a woman who had been charged under laws then in force in respect of tweets which were not dissimilar to JK Rowling’s. If anything, they were a bit tamer. However, she was not a rich internationally respected writer and philanthropist, she was just an ordinary working-class woman.\nThe charges were dropped after detailed legal representations were made that they breached her rights to freedom of belief and freedom of speech. However, not before she had been put through the ordeal of attending a police station and court on several occasions and having her face all over the newspapers.\nGoing forward the decision not to proceed against Jo Rowling has set a standard that will require to be followed for everyone because of the principle of equality before the law.\nThat principle has further ramifications for what has occurred this week. Police Scotland say that they received more than 3000 complaints in the first 48 hours of the Act being brought into force. Some of those complaints were against Humza Yousaf for his “white” speech in parliament a few years ago. While it's a historic speech it is still widely published on the Internet which means that it could be caught by the new law. I think the police’s swift decision that the speech was not criminal was correct.\nHowever, I am troubled by Police Scotland’s announcement that they will not be logging “non-crime hate incidents” in respect of the multiple complaints made against Humza and JK Rowling. Their current policy is to record a non-crime hate incident where a hate crime allegation does not reach the threshold of criminality. Many have urged that they change this policy not least because of a court decision in England finding a similar policy there unlawful. However, Police Scotland have not changed their published policy. Now it seems they are revising it on the hoof to avoid the embarrassment of recording non-crime hate incidents against an internationally renowned author and philanthropist and the First Minister of Scotland.\nThis really isn't good enough and it calls into question the entire application of the policy to date. The policy should be applied equally to everyone or to no one at all. Police Scotland are already facing a legal challenge from a Tory MSP in relation to the recording of a non-crime hate incident against him. They could now also face very serious allegations of political bias. They need to wipe their existing database of non-crime hate incidents and to carry out a proper review of their policy or else they could be facing a torrent of legal claims.\nFinally, I think it is important that the blame for this flawed legislation does not rest just with the Scottish Government and SNP and Green MSPs. This bill had some enthusiastic cheerleaders in the Scottish Labour party and the Lib Dems who now seem to have gone to ground. And as for the Tories, it's a bit rich for Rishi Sunak to attack the new Scottish legislation given the many attacks on free speech that have taken place in England under his party’s watch. Judging by his Government’s recent rhetoric, he has a few more planned for those who dare to disagree with his policies. He has also renewed his threats to leave the ECHR, the very underpinning of our rights to freedom of belief and freedom of speech.\nAcross the UK, including Scotland, we are seeing a growing tendency to weaponise our laws and police to silence critics of Government policy. This is most emphatically not what was envisaged for Scotland’s future in the heady days of 2014, and it needs to stop.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_forced-adoption-uk/content_309.html": "Forced adoption has caused so much pain for families\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 10th Feb 2023\nBetween 1949 and 1976, across the UK, thousands of children of unmarried women were adopted even though their mothers did not want to let them go. This forced adoption scandal did not happen just at the instigation of church and religious communities but with the full involvement of the state, the NHS and the social work departments of the day. For those affected it has meant a lifetime of suffering and heartache. It's time there was some redress both practical and symbolic.\nThe right to family life is protected under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. One of the most fundamental aspects of family life is the right of a child to be with their mother and the right of a mother to be with her child. Last year the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) conducted an inquiry into the experiences of these women and their children. We took harrowing evidence from those involved at formal evidence sessions and at informal roundtables and we concluded that the UK government should issue an apology. We also made some practical recommendations relating to counselling, the availability of medical records and the like.\nOur report was confined to England and Wales, but the Scottish Government has made a commitment to “fully consider the issue of historical adoption practices in Scotland” and there have been similar calls for a public apology from the Scottish Government.\nIt's more than six months since the JCHR published our report and a response from the British Government is well overdue. We don’t know whether it will be accompanied by the recommended apology. When the Minister responsible gave evidence to our committee he seemed very reluctant to commit to one.\nEarlier this week I was reminded of just how much an apology matters to both the mothers and their grown-up children when I recorded a podcast with two of them. The Committee corridor podcast brings together MPs and experts to discuss topical issues. The current series is focusing on justice and human rights, and I am hosting it for six episodes. We have already looked at modern slavery and later in the series we will be looking at the Bill of Rights and Human Rights at work, including the right to strike. However, this week I recorded interviews with Ann Keen, a mum forced to give her son up for adoption in 1966 and Liz Harvie, who was removed from her unmarried mum and given up for adoption in 1974.\nAnn went on to train as nurse and to serve as the Labour MP for Brentford and Isleworth from 1997 to 2010 but her experiences as a young woman of 17 have never left her. Sent away first to stay with a family friend, who abused her, and then to a mother and baby home, she gave birth without pain relief, having been told that would make sure she would ‘never make the same mistake again’. Her little boy was taken from her, and she was treated quite brutally by some nursing staff. Eventually as an adult her son traced her, and they have formed a strong relationship. Tragically he was never told that he was adopted, his adopted parents divorced when he was 3 and, until he met Ann, he had spent years wondering why the man who he thought was his father was so uninterested in forming a relationship with him.\nLiz was adopted at eight weeks old. She wanted for nothing with her adopted family who were honest with her that she had been adopted but the feeling of being different and having been unwanted haunted her until she met her birth mother at age 28 and learned that she had had no choice in the matter of her adoption. Her description of the joy and wonder she felt at their first meeting will stay with me for ever.\nThe experiences of Ann and Liz are typical of many of the mothers and grown-up children whom I met during our inquiry. For the mothers, the terrible anxiety and shame they endured, the degradation and the unbearable pain of being separated from their babies. For their children, the pain and trauma of being separated from their birth mothers, the loss of their heritage, the confusion over their identity and the lifelong quest to learn who they really are.\nIn 2016, the Catholic Church in England issued an apology for the role it played in these adoption practices. In Australia in 2013 the then Prime Minister Julia Gillard delivered a historic national apology in parliament for similar practices in Australia. She also committed $5 million Australian dollars to support services for affected families and to help biological families to reunite.\nThere are several instances of the UK Government making apologies for occurrences in the past which have caused pain and suffering and in which the State was involved in a way which was clearly wrong. The apologies for Bloody Sunday, the suppression of the Mau Mau insurgency and the Child Migration programmes were all made as statements in the House of Commons. I would like to see something similar happen here without further delay. And indeed, this is what the campaign group, the Movement for an adoption apology, have asked for.

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_cross-party-working/content_305.html": "Key to winning independence will be working together\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 27th Mar 2020\nIf you want to get something done in politics, you need to build alliances not just in your own party but cross-party and beyond into civic society and grassroots organisations.\nDespite the huge majority Boris Johnson won in England in the General Election last year, dealing with the coronavirus crisis cannot work without cross-party support. There has even been renewed talk of a “Government of National Unity’. For the first time for years, there has been cordial and respectful collaboration with the devolved governments; particularly in drawing up the Bill currently passing through Westminster affording all four governments in these islands emergency powers.\nAnd where the devolved Governments led, Westminster followed. Mike Russell was the first Government Minister to raise legitimate concerns about civil liberties aspects of the Emergency Powers legislation when he made a statement about it at Holyrood last week. There was some predictable petty sneering from the likes of Jamie Greene MSP who seemed not to understand that parliamentarians from all parties rightly care about civil liberties and even in a time of crisis, perhaps especially so, you need to make sure that we don’t simply hand power to the Government of the day unfettered. However, the grown-ups got on with the job and Westminster Tories David Davies and Andrew Mitchell joined forces with myself and Labour’s Harriet Harman to sponsor amendments designed to ensure better ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of the powers being afforded to all four governments and in particular to limit the duration of the powers from 2 years to 6 months. The UK Government capitulated and now the powers will require parliamentary approval for renewal after 6 months.\nOther cross-party initiatives have been less successful. It’s a bridge too far for the Tories to heed the call for a Universal Basic Income, led by the SNP, and long championed by my colleague Ronnie Cowan. However, the idea is now firmly in the public consciousness. Meantime the SNP are leading the fight to win proper support for the self-employed during the lockdown.\nCross-party working is also taking place at a local level. In my constituency and across the city of Edinburgh grassroots organisations are coming together with MPs, MSPs and councillors from all parties joining forces with community councils to assist the elderly and vulnerable during the crisis.\nThe Scottish Parliament was designed to be less confrontational than Westminster and its voting system was supposed to ensure that no one party could have an outright majority. In the early years of the first SNP Government at Holyrood, Alex Salmond had to work hard to build alliances but this did not prevent his Government from innovating and passing policies that, a decade later, are still listed as the most important achievements of the SNP in Government. It is often forgotten that the current SNP Government do not have an outright majority, and this is perhaps a tribute to the how Holyrood works.\nSome of the best work that goes on at Westminster in terms of effective scrutiny of the Government takes place in the cross-party select committees which often succeed in producing reports which have been unanimously agreed.\nThe fight to stop a No Deal Brexit and secure a Peoples Vote is now a distant memory but the greatest victories that were scored over the May and Johnson Governments came as a result of cross-party working –securing a Meaningful vote on the deal, the victory at the European Court of Justice which established that Article 50 could be unilaterally revoked and made a second vote possible and, of course, the UK Supreme court victory which stopped the unlawful prorogation of parliament. The court victories were made in Scotland by MPs from SNP, Labour, and the Greens with mass public support through crowd funding.\nThe sea change in Scottish politics which followed the Independence Referendum was not just the work of the SNP, it was also down to alliances built with the Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party, and, importantly, the work of hundreds of small grassroots organisations.\nRobin McAlpine has pointed out that what connects the anti-Thatcher campaigns of the mid-1980s, the anti-Poll Tax campaign of the late 1980s, the Scottish Constitutional Convention, the 1997 devolution referendum and the 2014 independence referendum is that each of these campaigns was fought by coalitions, none was led by a single party leader.\nWhen the current crisis is over the issue of Scotland’s constitutional future will return to the top of the agenda. On the 31st of January the First Minister announced that a Constitutional Convention would be called, it is impossible for it to be convened now but as soon as this crisis is over it should be convened without further delay. I believe its membership should include civic society, particularly the trade unions and members of grassroots organisations. When we gain independence, it will have been through reaching out to as broad a coalition of folk as possible. Perhaps the cross-party working and the alliances that will be built during the crisis will make this easier.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_rwanda-bill-is-nothing-less-than-an-attack-on-the-rule-of-law/content_37.html": "Rwanda bill is nothing less than an attack on the rule of law\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 08th Dec 2023\nSunday is Human Rights Day and the 75th anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Rather than celebrating this momentous occasion, the UK Government is introducing a bill which fundamentally breaches the UK’s obligations to uphold the human rights of asylum seekers under international laws to which the UK is a signatory, including the Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).\nThe ECHR, signed just a couple of years after the UDHR, was the first instrument to crystallise and give binding effect to the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those rights were finally made part of the domestic law of the United Kingdom with the passing of the Scotland Act and the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998. Twenty-five years later, the UK Government is merrily trashing its commitments to the universality of those human rights and the ultimate jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.\nThe Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill starts with a declaration that the Home Secretary is unable to make the statement required by the Human Rights Act that the provisions of the bill are compatible with Convention Rights. In a sense that tells you all you need to know, albeit that James Cleverly seemed a bit coy about it when questioned closely in the Commons as he made an emergency statement on Wednesday evening.\nHowever, the bill is not just an attack on human rights but also on the rule of law which requires the UK to honour its international legal obligations and the principle of the separation of powers between executive, legislature, and judiciary. The Home Secretary might as well drive a coach and horses through the British constitution, such as it exists. Three weeks ago, the UK Supreme Court (UKSC) ruled that asylum seekers could not be sent to Rwanda because it is not a safe country. They did so having carefully considered evidence about the position on the ground in Rwanda. The first thing the bill does is to declare that, notwithstanding that finding by the highest court in the UK, Rwanda is henceforth to be considered a safe country and no court can look beyond that statement. It is extraordinary for the law to state that the facts are other than what they are, and then to oust the jurisdiction of the courts from determining whether that is the case.\nThese are not just my views but those of Jonathan Sumption KC, a distinguished former UKSC judge who is most definitely not a lefty lawyer. Parliament might as well declare the moon is made of cream cheese. Lord Sumption goes on to point out that ousting the jurisdiction of the courts is a fundamental breach of Article 6 of the ECHR which among other things guarantees everyone the right of access to a court. Notwithstanding that, the bill will prevent our domestic courts from hearing any case which suggests that sending someone to Rwanda might breach the HRA or the Refugee Convention. Various provisions of the HRA are to be disapplied and any domestic law that might prevent Rwanda from being considered a safe country must also be ignored.\nAny interim order issued by the European Court of Human Rights to prevent the removal of a person to Rwanda must also be ignored by the UK’s domestic courts. It will be up to a minister of the Crown to decide whether to comply with the interim measure and I think we all know which way that decision will go. Yet even this red meat is not enough for some of the more crazed Tory backbenchers, including former ministers Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick, the latter resigning from his post as immigration minister as soon as the bill was introduced.\nWhat’s bothering them is the part of the bill which will preserve the right of an asylum seeker threatened with removal to Rwanda to mount a court challenge on the basis that Rwanda is not a safe country for them based on their individual circumstances. However, they would need to produce ‘compelling evidence’ and, in the meantime, an interim order to prevent them from being sent to Rwanda while they wait for the outcome of their claim could only be granted if the court or tribunal were satisfied that they faced ‘a real, imminent and foreseeable risk of serious and irreversible harm’.\nSumption says in practice this means that flights to Rwanda will only be stopped in the most extreme circumstances. I think he’s right about that. The real reason why Suella and Co are so annoyed is because they wanted this bill to disapply the HRA and the ECHR in their entirety to asylum cases as the thin end of the wedge to repealing the HRA and leaving the ECHR completely.\nIt is ironic that the only reason Rishi Sunak has not gone as far as Suella and Co wanted is because the Rwandan government dug their heels in and said that that they would not accept the UK basing their scheme on legislation that could be considered in breach of their international law obligations.\nClearly Rishi thinks he is just inside that line. I disagree and so will many based on the Government’s own declaration on the face of the bill. Yet, undaunted, at his press conference yesterday, Sunak told us that should anyone take a court challenge against this scheme directly to the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg and win then he would do whatever is necessary to uphold the express wishes of ‘our sovereign parliament’. It seems the option of leaving the ECHR is most definitely still on the table.\nSo, what happens next? Well, the bill has a second reading in parliament next week and we are told that the Government want it passed by the Commons by Christmas on a rushed timetable. Suella and Co will put down amendments to make it more severe but ultimately will they vote against it? What will Labour do? The SNP will oppose it root and branch and the Joint Committee on Human Rights will be taking a hard look at the bill. Once it gets to the House of Lords it is likely to get bogged down with a lot of amendments.\nUltimately, if passed, the bill could face legal challenges. Its interference with the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts might face challenge in Scotland’s Supreme Court. The right to judicial review in Scotland is protected under Article 19 of the Treaty of Union and it is a devolved matter under the Scotland Act 2016. It would not be the first time the UK Government got a bloody nose from constitutional legal action started in Scotland - that is how we stopped the unlawful prorogation of parliament.\nSeparately, someone might want to seek a declaration that the bill in its entirety is incompatible with the HRA but, as the domestic courts cannot strike down an act of the UK parliament, it would be up to parliament what to do about any such declaration.\nFinally, there would be nothing to stop asylum seekers going direct to the Strasbourg court on the basis that they would have no domestic remedy and if the European Court of Human Rights ruled in their favour that’s where the real fireworks would begin. However, something tells me we are going to have fireworks in Parliament over the next fortnight and that the Prime Minister will be taking fire from behind him as well as from the SNP benches.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_women-have-every-right-to-be-concerned-about-hate-crime-act/content_8.html": "Women have every right to be concerned about Hate Crime Act\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 22nd Mar 2024\nOver the last few days, a succession of men have taken to print and to the airwaves to tell you there is no cause for concern about the new Hate Crime Act coming into force on April 1. One headline even proclaimed concerns were 'silly'. I'm here to tell you that these men are wrong as well as patronising, and that, if you are a woman, you have every right to be concerned.\nI have no problem with consolidating and updating the existing hate crime aggravators. I believe that if an assault on a gay or a trans person is motivated by hatred of their sexual orientation or their gender reassignment, that should be reflected in the charge and the sentence. When I worked as a senior prosecutor in the High Court, I helped prepare and prosecute such cases.\nI am concerned about the creation of the new offence of stirring up hatred against the protected characteristic of transgender identity. Not only is the offence vague but the characteristic is very widely drawn. For example, it extends beyond people who identify as trans to include cross-dressing men. I'll explain more below but first get this - biological sex is not included as a protected characteristic in the Act, despite women being one of the most abused cohorts in our society. This means that cross-dressing men will be better protected under the law of Scotland than women.\nWhen the bill was passed three years ago, we were assured that work would be progressed on a standalone crime of misogyny but suffice to say that work has proceeded at a snail's pace and seems not to be a priority at Holyrood. It is well documented that women, particularly those who take part in our public political discourse, are at the receiving end of a lot of abuse and threats. The women who took to the public square in Dundee last weekend to talk about their experiences of domestic violence etc should not have had to endure being spat on by men in the crowd that assembled to try to silence them. But they did and I don't think we saw any arrests.\nA woman at a similar event in Aberdeen last year was punched by a trans rights activist. The police decided he should be merely admonished. Such is the level of protection which women who dare to speak up for their rights enjoy in contemporary Scotland. This legislation is only going to make the situation worse.\nOver the last few years, women who hold the view that sex is immutable, that people cannot transition from male to female, and who wish to speak clearly about this, have been at the receiving end of abuse, threats, and violence. I know whereof I speak. A small but noisy minority in our society wishes to silence such women. Misguided aspects of this new law look likely to give them a new weapon. And if you think they are not delighted about that, just take a look at social media. The weaponisation of hate crime laws to silence gender-critical women is a risk which has been recognised by legal experts who have looked at the issue in recent years both north and south of the Border. The retired Scottish judge who prepared the independent report which preceded this new hate crime legislation, Lord Bracadale, recommended that there should be a tailored freedom of expression protection for such women in it.\nWhen the bill was first introduced to Parliament, this recommendation was not reflected in the bill. I approached Humza Yousaf to discuss my concerns, he listened, took my concerns on board, and a tailored defence for gender-critical women was produced at the end of January 2021. Here's what it said: 'Behaviour or material is not to be taken to be threatening or abusive solely on the basis that it involves or includes discussion or criticism of matters relating to transgender identity.'\nThe amendment was drafted and published by the SNP Scottish Government, but when I tweeted my support for it, I was accused of transphobia. Nicola Sturgeon tweeted her now infamous broom cupboard broadcast, I was sacked from my position on the SNP front bench and the amendment was ditched in what I can only describe as an atmosphere of hysteria. A similar defence was introduced at a later stage but it is expressed in very limited terms compared to the protections afforded to those who wish to discuss or criticise religious beliefs. Those who are religious sceptics are afforded protection if they wish to express 'antipathy, dislike, ridicule or insult' towards religious beliefs. Those of us who are sceptics about gender identity ideology don't get the same leeway.\nWhat Lord Bracadale was suggesting was that the sort of defence that will be open to religious sceptics should be open to the gender-critical so, for example, statements that some people might find hateful, but others would regard as important statements of fact or protected belief such as 'lesbians don't have penises' and 'trans women are men' could be made without incurring police interest.\nIn a situation where it is enough for a statement to be construed as merely abusive as opposed to threatening, it is quite likely that the police will feel they need to investigate the intentions of those of us who wish to continue to be able to make such statements, particularly when their guidance and training is being framed and delivered by activists.\nAnd so here we are three years on with the legislation about to be introduced. Promises to consult further with groups representing gender-critical women have been broken, social media is alive with threats from trans rights activists to swamp the police with complaints about prominent feminists after April 1, and the police have said they will investigate every single one of those complaints, notwithstanding their recent statement that they would no longer be investigating all other types of low-level crimes.\nThe nature of guidance and training being given to the police is also causing widespread concern including in the Police Federation. A Freedom of Information request revealed materials prepared by a charity noted for its trans rights activism which was engaged to train the police on the operation of the Act, and which did so using thinly veiled references to prominent feminists which were both snide and potentially defamatory. I am sure I will not be alone in feeling deeply uncomfortable that the very activists who agitated for women to be unprotected by this Act are now training the police how to implement the law. It stinks.\nAnd just where is the evidence that such hate crime is wreaking havoc in Scotland as one MSP put it this week? It is telling that in recent years the director of a prominent trans rights charity encouraged people to report stickers with slogans 'Female is a biological reality' and 'Woman. Noun. Adult Human Female' to police as hate crimes because: 'We need the stats.'\nFor all these reasons I stand by concerns that the stirring up provisions in the Act risk being a charter for those who wish to make malicious complaints against gender critical women and thus to exert a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Scotland. A cursory look at social media shows that such activists already have at least one high-profile woman in Scotland in their sights. Experience shows that working-class women will also fall victim to their attentions. It is some consolation that when such women are dragged to court, if they can afford a lawyer, they will have a good chance of arguing that their prosecution breaches their rights to freedom of belief and freedom of expression under the European Convention of Human Rights. But let us be clear, for many the process will be the punishment. Being under police investigation will be stressful, costly, damaging to reputations and could lead to problems in the workplace.\nTo make matters worse, under existing Police Scotland policy, officers are required to record all 'hate' incident reports even if there's no evidence of a crime, based on the perception of the person who reported the incident to them. This means that even if no criminal proceedings are advanced against a woman accused of 'hate', somewhere in Police Scotland archives there will be a record that she was involved in a hate incident. I think this will seem sinister and unfair to any right-thinking person. After a successful legal challenge to a similar policy in England and Wales, police officers must now not record anything that is 'trivial malicious or irrational'. Police Scotland has said it intends to review its own policy in response to the development, but it seems no changes will be made prior to this new Act coming into force.\nSo, from April 1, officers will be required to regard all reports of 'hate' as subjectively true based on the perception of the complainer. Yet, those who seek to reassure women about this Act say that in deciding whether a reasonable person would regard what was said as threatening or abusive and whether it is intended to stir up hatred, the police will apply a high threshold. The two things are clearly contradictory.\nI fear the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament are heading for another embarrassing legal car crash over this legislation. The really annoying thing is that this and the consequent reputational damage could have been avoided if the Government had stood by the advice of Lord Bracadale. This would have been the best chance of seeing off those trying to weaponise this legislation to silence those with whom they disagree.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_scotland-could-provide-grounds-to-challenge-tories-vile-rwanda-bill/content_133.html": "Scotland could provide grounds to challenge Tories' vile Rwanda Bill\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 19th Jan 2024\nIt's a measure of how low British politics has sunk that at Prime Minister's Questions this week, the Prime Minister taunted the leader of the Opposition for having written a book about European human rights law.\nApparently, it's so good that in the past the Ministry of Justice ordered a large number of copies. It is out of print now, but if there was an up-to-date edition, they would be well advised to buy a shipment to be read by the Prime Minister, his cabinet and his more nutty backbenchers.\nThe book was written after the Human Rights Act (HRA) was passed in 1998. The act incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into the domestic legal systems of the United Kingdom meaning that human rights claims based on the rights enshrined in the ECHR could be brought in the domestic courts of the UK rather than the long and expensive process of going to Strasbourg. It has also achieved a culture shift in the approach taken by public authorities by embedding human rights law into their policy-making and how they deliver services.\nJust like the Illegal Migration Act before it, the Rwanda Bill disapplies several key provisions of the HRA so public authorities including the courts in the UK will be encouraged to ignore human rights when dealing with asylum seekers, earmarked for deportation to Rwanda.\nWhile the media and the commentariat have focused on the Tory psychodrama surrounding this bill, we are in danger of not marking properly just what an outrage this is from the point of view of those of us who believe in human rights, constitutionalism and the rule of law.\nHuman rights are meant to offer a fundamental level of protection for every person on the basis of their humanity alone. If those protections can simply be set aside when they cause problems for a policy goal, they lose the fundamental and universal quality that characterises them. This is particularly the case when they are disapplied in respect of a particular group of people, in this case migrants who have come to the UK without prior permission.\nIt's important to remember that when this bill becomes law together with the Illegal Migration Act, it will apply not just to people arriving in small boats on the south coast of England, but to asylum seekers anywhere in the UK. This means that asylum seekers living in Scotland could be selected for removal to Rwanda. When that happens, and when they look to the Scottish courts for protection, the Scottish courts will be prevented from applying the HRA to stop their deportation.\nThe Scottish courts will also be prevented from looking at the issue of whether Rwanda is in fact a safe country because Parliament will have deemed it to be so regardless of the situation on the ground. This constitutes a very serious intrusion on the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts and a serious interference with the separation of powers between legislature, executive and the courts. It is anathema to the Scottish constitutional tradition, and people in Scotland don't want it. You won't find any opinion polls carried out in Scotland which support the bill.\nAs the great Scottish judge Lord President Cooper noted, in the case of MacCormick v Lord Advocate in 1953: 'The principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law.'\nIn Scotland, the people are sovereign. This makes a difference to our view of how constitutionalism works and our views on the separation of powers. It is of the essence of the Scottish constitutional tradition that executive power should not be unchecked. We can see this as far back as the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 when Scottish nobles asserting the sovereignty of the people of Scotland in a letter to the Pope told him that if the king of Scotland should seek to make Scots subject to the king of England or indeed the English, they would drive him out and seek to find another king to defend them. In Scotland, the sovereignty of the people is our guiding principle, not the sovereignty of the monarch nor the sovereignty of the UK parliament.\nWhen the Treaty of Union was entered into between Scotland and England, the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts was deemed sufficiently important to require particular protection. Under article 19, the authority and privileges of the Court of Session, including its inherent supervisory jurisdiction and its nobile officium, were protected against future interference. The nobile officium is a special power of the court where it can, within limits, offer mitigation if the law is too strict or provide a legal remedy where none exists.\nSeparately, since the modern advent of devolution and by virtue of the Scotland Act 1998, the civil jurisdiction of the Scottish courts, including judicial review, has been a devolved matter and therefore one properly for Scotland's parliament.\nWhen I spoke in the debate in parliament on Wednesday, I put forward amendments designed to prevent the bill from extending to Scotland without the legislative consent of the Scottish Parliament. I also tabled a new clause for the bill, which would have ensured that, notwithstanding anything in the act, the supervisory jurisdiction and the nobile officium of the Court of Session would be preserved.\nMy aim was to ensure that asylum seekers in Scotland would still have the protection of the courts in accordance with our constitutional tradition but the arithmetic in the House of Commons meant that my amendments had no chance of being passed.\nIt goes without saying that I would rather this bill didn't apply anywhere in the United Kingdom, and of course I and my SNP colleagues voted against it. The much-heralded Tory rebellion did not materialise, and the bill has passed the House of Commons, but it is likely to be taken apart in the House of Lords. This is the benefit of having a second chamber, albeit I wish it was one that was elected and accountable to the public.\nEven if it passes the House of Lords and becomes law, it is likely to face court action seeking a declaration of incompatibility with the HRA. Curiously, and to the annoyance of some Tory backbenchers, the bill leaves that possibility open. If such a declaration were to be made, the government and indeed parliament could ignore it, but it would not be without political consequences.\nSome legal commentators have suggested that the bill is so offensive to the rule of law that it might face a constitutional challenge of the like we don't usually see in the United Kingdom because of the principle of the sovereignty of parliament.\nIt would be my advice to anyone seeking to go down that route that they should seek to do so in the Scottish courts, where, partly for some of the reasons I've outlined in this column, they might receive a more sympathetic reception than in the English courts albeit that ultimately the final decision will end up in the United Kingdom Supreme Court.\nAll this could be rendered academic if the Rwandan government loses patience with the whole saga. There was an indication this week that that might well happen when the Rwandan president told a journalist at Davos that there were limits to how long attempts to implement the deal with the UK could drag on and indicated he would be happy for the scheme to be scrapped. In an otherwise grim week, this afforded a moment of light relief.",

The political inquest into the fiasco of a seemingly unplanned withdrawal will continue when Westminster resumes next week. The chaos and human suffering that we witnessed as desperate Afghans and their families sought to flee Kabul has been harrowing. The terrorist explosion and the horrific loss of life which followed was shocking but predictable. Now we learn that British staff on the ground may have sent Afghans forward to their deaths despite the terrorist attack warning.\nI have no doubt that this was done unwittingly. British forces and civilian staff on the ground have conducted themselves with courage and dignity while their masters in the UK government have behaved with extraordinary ineptitude - holidaying while others suffered unimaginably; unaware of the number of UK nationals left behind and forced to admit that the security guards who guarded the British embassy are amongst hundreds if not thousands of Afghan citizens who despite aiding the British, have now been left to their fate.\nThat Raab should be so clueless about the position on the ground came as no surprise to MPs and their staff who, the week before last, worked hard to assist the friends and families of constituents caught up in the crisis. Nor did the horrifying news that the foreign office email box to which we and others sent our desperate pleas for help was left unmonitored.\nMy office dealt with many cases in the desperate days before the last US transport left Kabul airport. These included requests from British army officers stationed at the barracks in our constituency to help their former comrades, fellow Afghan officers left to fend for themselves once their usefulness had been outlived. Church communities asked us to help Afghan Christians fleeing the Taliban. We also took up the cases of the families of Afghans who had worked for the British and who were eligible for the Afghan relocation and assistance policy but had been given no information or assistance about how to access it from the British government they had risked so much to assist. These men had many dependents, children and elderly relatives, some were in Kabul, some were at the airport. We weren’t able to help everyone and we don’t yet know the fate of those left behind but what we do know is that our desperate efforts to help them were not met with the sort of response one might have expected from the Foreign Office because the email address we were given was an account no one was even reading.\nOne UK Government minister who acquitted himself well in the crisis was Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, he gave worried MPs his personal email as a way to chase inquiries. It seemed a little odd at the time but now we know why. The incompetence of the foreign Secretary, incumbent in what used to be known as one of the great offices of state, is emblematic of what the British Government has become under this charlatan of a PM and of the endemic failure of the British state. After the British embassy had been abandoned, we learned that the usual protocols of destroying sensitive information had not been followed and documents containing contact details and CVs for Afghan workers had been left scattered around the embassy for the Taliban to find.\nMeantime, as my constituents and others look around to see what they can do to help the left behind and the influx of refugees to Europe and the Middle East that is likely, another great British cock up is likely to stand in their way. Yes, amid the worst foreign policy disaster in living memory, and a new migration crisis for Europe, Brexit has reared its ugly head to interfere with the attempts by Scottish charities to export humanitarian aid in order to help refugees.\nRefugee Action Scotland (Re-Act) are a Scotland wide charity based in my constituency and run by volunteers in Edinburgh, Fife, Falkirk and Aberdeen. Their main focus is the delivery of emergency aid to refugees in camps throughout Europe and the Middle East and assisting the resettlement and integration of New Scots. They are well connected in the charity aid sector providing support to refugees across Europe particularly in Greece and France. Prior to Brexit they sent many containers of aid abroad each year as well as using their own lorries to deliver aid and support. Now, as a result of Brexit they are facing significant problems sending humanitarian aid to the very camps that many Afghan refugees are likely to end up in.\nAfter support from my office the charity successfully registered for an Economic Operators Registration and Identification number (EORI) and sent their first pallet of aid to Greece since Brexit. This was a complex and difficult process, and each subsequent consignment will require customs paperwork. Unfortunately, despite the provisions in the UK-EU Cooperation and Trade Agreement this first pallet of aid was subject to huge customs and VAT charges which have proved difficult to resolve.\nRe-Act tell me that charities across Scotland are facing similar problems and have been very daunted by the new customs requirements. It seems that at least part of the problem is EU rules of origin regulations. Goods made in the UK are eligible for zero-tariff sales in the EU but many of the clothes etc. that charities seek to export are made elsewhere, for example China, and so fall foul of the regulations. Humanitarian aid is supposed to be exempt from customs and VAT charges but complex customs arrangements have to be navigated and charities here have to ensure that the recipient charities in the EU are properly registered with their government to receive such foreign aid free of customs duties.\nThere is an urgent need for charities, like businesses, to be able to attend export training tailored to the needs of exporting humanitarian aid.\nThe situation in Afghanistan is likely, in a few weeks’ time, to lead to a massive increase in the number of refugees arriving in Greece and elsewhere in Europe and the situation is therefore very critical. Scottish Charities want to play their part in helping refugees in camps in Europe and it is vital that charities have the skills and confidence that they can export aid successfully. The need is urgent.\nI am hoping that the Scottish Government will be able to access UK Government funding to help to provide the training needed in short order to ensure people in Scotland can play their part in helping alleviate suffering. The British Government will also need to step up to the plate to intercede with counterparts in the Greek Government to ensure there are pathways of support available between charities in our two countries and to ensure that customs problems do not arise.\nIt would be unforgiveable if the unintended consequences of Brexit were to undermine the efforts of Scots to help Afghan refugees and to make up for the appalling dereliction of duty by the British Government.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_justice-system-can-better-serve-women-raped/content_136.html": "How justice system can better serve women who have been raped\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 31st Dec 2021\nHere is a quite staggering statistic: sexual offences currently account for 70% of the criminal business dealt with by Scotland’s High Court. And, as we head into a new year, Scotland’s criminal courts are facing a serious backlog of cases, the vast majority of which involve rape and male violence against women. The backlog has built up since the courts had to close at the start of lockdown in 2020, but even before then the system was struggling to cope.\nIt is against this background that the Lord Advocate has told MSPs that “radical action” is needed. The World Health Organisation describes sexual violence against women as a major public health problem and a violation of women’s rights which perpetuates gender inequality. The delay in bringing cases to trial is having a particular impact on women and girls at a time when we face an epidemic of male violence against women.\nThe Lord Advocate is also concerned about the low conviction rate in sexual offence cases. Scottish Government statistics show that just 43% of cases of rape and attempted rape in 2019-2020 resulted in a conviction rate – compared to a rate of 88% for all crimes.\nAnd so, the Lord Advocate told MSPs on Holyrood’s Criminal Justice Committee, the time has come to look into doing away with juries in trials for sexual offences. I opposed pursuing juryless trials to keep the courts moving at the start of the pandemic and I have serious reservations about this latest suggestion. I agree with Helena Kennedy QC that the jury system is not perfect, but the diversity of thought juries bring to the decision-making process will always make jury trials a preferable option to relying on a single judge to administer justice in the most serious of crimes. However, this time round, no one is proposing getting rid of jury trials wholesale. In a recent review, Scotland’s second most senior judge, the Lord Justice Clerk, Lady Dorrian, proposed a pilot project to test out judge only rape trials ‘to enable the issues to be assessed in a practical rather than a theoretical way’.\nAnd there is an evidential background to the proposal. Fiona Leverick, Professor of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice at the University of Glasgow has published research into jury decision making in which she found “overwhelming evidence’ that jurors hold “prejudicial and false beliefs” about rape that affect their evaluation of evidence at trial. These include the belief that a “real’ rape victim would have injuries and that even a short delay in reporting a rape is suspicious.\nThese findings are concerning. However, in my experience, they could be met by adducing expert evidence that in the vast majority of rapes there are no visible injuries and by the judge directing the jury to ignore rape myths. I served as one of the first specialist sex crime prosecutors in the National Sex Crimes Unit which was set up in 2008. I spent three years prosecuting mainly sexual offences in Scotland’s High Courts and dealing with the consequent appeal cases. The low conviction rate is a historic problem, and I met many complainers who were deeply dissatisfied with their experience of the system despite all the efforts that have been made to improve it. Both the Lord Advocate and the Lord Justice Clerk are right that something needs to be done. But we must do the right thing.\nPreviously, it was proposed that we do away with the requirement for corroboration. However, I never thought this would improve the conviction rate. One of the main problems with prosecuting sexual offences is the lack of independent evidence to substantiate the complainer’s story in a crime where there are rarely eyewitnesses. The police need to be encouraged to gather more evidence not less in order to make sure juries can be convinced of guilt beyond reasonable doubt. By contrast, in cases where there are two or more complainers, giving evidence of similar behaviour against the same man, it is vanishingly rare not to get a conviction, unless of course the complainers are not believed because there is evidence from the surrounding facts and circumstances, including defence evidence, which shows that they have not been telling the truth.\nJust before Christmas the Lord Advocate announced a review of how prosecutors deal with reports of sexual offences. At the same time the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal service will also carry out a review of its Victim Information and Advice Service.\nThe Lord Advocate has acknowledged that whether to do away with jury trials is ultimately a question for MSPs. She is right and I hope they will look at all the evidence and hear all interested parties. I also hope that they will cast their net wider and look at the treatment of those who report sexual offences throughout our system from start of finish.\nEarlier this year it was alarming to hear that some MSPs thought the feelings of medical examiners and their personal validation were more important than the very well evidenced preference of women who have been raped to be examined by a female forensic medical examiner. Ultimately parliament saw sense but some of what was said during the course of the debate was frankly outrageous.\nNow, plans to allow men accused of rape to self-identify as women in official police and court records are causing concern not just to the survivors of rape and sexual abuse but also to the police themselves and academics. Many feel that it is wrong to prioritise the feelings of alleged rapists over the feelings of their victims and academics are worried about the distorting impact on sexual crime statistics as well as the impact on victims. Yet it seems that Police Scotland have a policy of recording men who have been accused of rape as women provided the alleged attacker “identifies as female”, despite the fact that there is no legal requirement for them to do so. It was a relief to hear our Justice Secretary, Keith Brown, concede that “allowing rape suspects to self-identify as women after they are arrested is not without its ‘dangers’”, but parliament needs to look at this more closely.\nA similar issue causing concern to survivors, academics and lawyers is the notion that a woman who complains of rape or other sexual assault should be compelled to use female pronouns in court in relation to her attacker, if he self identifies as a woman. Again, it is important to stress at that at present there is no legal requirement for such compelled speech. However advice that it is best practice has found its way into the bench book guides for judges both north and south of the border. And in England there have been cases where the female victims of male violence have been forced to refer to their attacker as a woman in court, to their visible distress. At the trial of Karen White, a transgender woman who was imprisoned for murder in 2018, the prosecutor reported that “Her penis was erect and sticking out of her trousers”.\nThe new Equal Treatment Bench Book for England and Wales has rowed back on this position and sets out circumstances where witnesses will not be compelled to use preferred pronouns which don’t align with biological sex including explicit exceptions for women giving evidence about their experience of sexual and domestic violence. I hope we will see a similar revision to the bench book in Scotland. I believe passionately that we must strive to have a scrupulously fair trial system whilst at the same time working to improve the experience of those who complain of rape or sexual abuse from end to end of the system. This starts with the complainers’ first encounter with the police and the forensic medical examiner and continues with their experience of rape crisis and victim support as well as the prosecution process including the trial and the aftermath.\nThere is no point in being prepared to take the drastic step of ditching jury trials in the name of improving the prosecution of rape from the victims’ point of view if the system permits the gaslighting of victims in court by their attackers and the skewing of important statistics by self-identification of sex by the perpetrators of rape.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_scottish-lord-advocate-role-needs-reform-my-bill-will-do-it/content_192.html": "Scottish Lord Advocate role needs reform. My bill will do it\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 05th Jan 2024\nNext week I will be introducing a private member’s bill at Westminster designed to give the Scottish parliament the power to amend the role of Scotland’s law officers including dividing the role of the Lord Advocate into two separate jobs. One as head of the Scotland’s prosecution service, and the other as a minister of the Scottish Government and its Chief Legal Advisor.\nThe present Lord Advocate performs both roles and legal scholars and politicians are becoming increasingly concerned that this may give rise to a conflict of interest. No criticism of the current or previous Lord Advocate or of the SNP Government should be implied because the dual role of the Lord Advocate is a historical anachronism which predates devolution.\nThe dual role was rubber stamped by the devolution settlement and to date no Tory or Labour Government has attempted reform. I believe reform is long overdue and I was very pleased when the SNP Manifesto for the 2021 Holyrood election promised to consult on separating the roles. The Scottish Government has committed to review the role of the Lord Advocate by the end of the current parliament, the initial phase of which is to be informed by expert research. I understand that a report will be published soon.\nHowever, because of reservations under the Scotland Act 1998 it is not open to the Scottish parliament to either create a new law officer or a new public prosecutor. That is why my bill is necessary.\nThe Lord Advocate is the senior of the two Scottish law officers. The other is the Solicitor General. The Lord Advocate is both a Minister in the Scottish Government and the holder of a historic office which has a range of functions associated with the maintenance of the rule of law and the proper administration of justice. She is head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths and principal legal adviser to the Scottish Government. She also represents the Scottish Government in civil proceeding and the public interest in a range of statutory and common law civil and constitutional functions.\nThe Scotland Act states that in relation to criminal prosecutions and investigation of deaths the Lord Advocate must act independently of other Ministers and, indeed, of any other person. Alex Salmond took steps to underline this independence by depoliticising the appointment process and providing that the law officers should not routinely attend cabinet meetings. The downside of this was that it deprived the Government of the benefit of advice from a lawyer who shares their political persuasion, which was always previously available.\nThe Lord Advocate is appointed by the King on the recommendation of the First Minister, with the agreement of the Scottish Parliament. Unlike other Ministers she cannot be removed from office by the First Minister without the approval of the Parliament. The Lord Advocate also has an important role in relation to ensuring that legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament is within the legislative competence of the Parliament and has powers under the Scotland Act in relation to the resolution of legal questions about the devolved powers of Ministers and the Parliament. We saw this during the ill-fated trip to the UK Supreme Court to find out whether the Scottish parliament had legislative competence to hold another independence referendum. Some, like myself believed an argument could be made for a competent bill, others did not, the current Lord Advocate was not sure, and the rest is, as they say, history. With the benefit of advice from a senior lawyer who supported the cause of independence I think things might have turned out rather differently. At the very least the tactics might have been more politically savvy.\nAccountability to the Scottish Parliament is an important aspect of the Lord Advocate's constitutional role. She may but need not be an MSP. If not an MSP, she is entitled to participate in the proceedings of the Parliament but may not vote. She can therefore be questioned by MSPs about the exercise of her functions, although she is not required to answer questions or produce documents relating to the operation of the system of criminal prosecution about specific cases.\nThere is a tension between the principle that the Lord Advocate should be both independent in her capacity as chief prosecutor but also politically accountable as a law officer. The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe which advises member states on Rule of Law issues recommends they take steps to ensure that their state prosecution systems are seen to act independently of parliament and government.\nElsewhere in the UK and in the Republic of Ireland the two roles are held by different people to avoid any possible conflict of interest or the perception of such conflict. In England there is an Attorney General who is a member of the government of the day, and a Director of Public Prosecutions who is appointed by a public appointment process completely independent of the government. The Lord Chancellor is a third office which performs some constitutional functions. The experts currently advising the Scottish Government might also want to think about something akin to this third role for some of the Lord Advocate’s functions under the Scotland Act.\nConcern about the potential conflicts in the role of the Lord Advocate have increased because of recent high-profile cases including the Scottish Government’s handling of complaints against Alex Salmond, the Rangers FC malicious prosecution scandal and the police investigation into SNP finances.\nThe report of the Scottish Parliament’s inquiry into the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints found that events showed a long-standing tension in the dual roles of the Lord Advocate, and they said that “public perception” was important.\nI believe that it is important that the role of Chief Prosecutor be free from all suspicion of political interference. I also believe it is important that the Scottish Government have the benefit of a legal advisor who shares their political views while still giving independent advice. That after all is what the English, Welsh and Irish governments enjoy. Their law officers are usually parliamentarians from the same party as the government of the day.\nThe Scottish Government has accepted that there is a case for separating the roles. Both the current Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack and his shadow Ian Murray are in support. As are the Scottish Labour Leader Anas Sarwar and the Scottish Conservatives. My bill has support from the Liberal Democrats and Alba as well as SNP colleagues. I hope that the existence of cross-party support means it has a chance of becoming law, leaving the final decision where it should be, with the Scottish Parliament.\nFinally, I want to take issue with what Mhairi Black said about some SNP MPs being too comfortable at Westminster. There is a difference between being comfortable and doing the job you were elected to do. It is not easy being an opposition MP for years on end, but with painstaking work and the building of cross-party consensus, good things can be achieved. I showed this with the cross-party coalition I built to stop Boris Johnson’s unlawful prorogation of parliament in 2019. Other colleagues have worked hard on important campaigns which have delivered real change such as Ronnie Cowan on gambling reform, Patricia Gibson on paid bereavement leave, Carol Monaghan on the right of LGB army veterans to compensation and Marion Fellows on disability rights.\nTo do this, we must be present and performing our jobs at Westminster as well as spending time working in our constituencies. The SNP is not an abstentionist party. Those who want that policy to change, need to do the work to build a campaign to get it debated and changed at conference. Just as those of us who were worried about the governance of the party and the management of its finances under the previous leadership had to campaign and stand for election to the NEC to do something about it. We could have done with the support of those only now speaking out because, at the time, we were thwarted. However, I don’t think anyone could seriously argue that we have not been vindicated by subsequent events.\nI hope that by being present at Westminster, doing the job I am elected and paid to do, I can get this piece of legislation through to the benefit of the good governance of Scotland and the nationalist cause. That’s how politics works.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_international-women-s-day/content_311.html": "Independence is the best hope for women and girls\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 05th Mar 2020\nOn International Women’s Day this year, women in Scotland can reflect on the sort of country they want to be part of. Would an independent Scotland, (like Ireland did last year) be using the date to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence – the ‘Istanbul Convention’? Or, like the UK, would we be still languishing as one of only 6 EU countries that have yet to ratify it?\nBefore I entered politics a significant part of my legal career was spent dealing with the consequences of violence against women and girls. As a student I worked on a project monitoring the effectiveness of rape shield legislation designed to prevent women who made allegations of sexual violence having their sexual history or character attacked while giving evidence.\nLater in my career I worked as a prosecutor at the Crown Office, in 2009 I became one of the first Specialist Sex crimes prosecutors in Scotland in the new National Sex Crimes Unit. I went on to spend a number of years prosecuting rape and historic sex abuse cases in Scotland’s High Court and defending convictions in the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Later, I represented my professional body, the Faculty of Advocates, on the Justice and Safety Human Rights Action group, working with groups from across Scotland to implement the Scottish Government’s National Action Plan on Human Rights. The main focus of our work was the Scottish Government’s Equally Safe strategy to take action on all forms of violence against women and girls. I also served on the Advisory Group which developed the Scottish Women’s Rights Centre in partnership with Rape Crisis Scotland, Strathclyde University Law Clinic and the Legal Services Agency.\nGiven this experience, now working as a politician, I am acutely conscious of the importance of having proper legal protections in place to combat violence against women and girls.\nIn 2017 I was pleased to support my then colleague, Dr Eilidh Whiteford, when she led a successful campaign to pass a law requiring the UK Government to ratify the Istanbul Convention. This was the first time an SNP MP had managed to get a private members bill into law. Three years later the U.K. Govt have yet to ratify the Convention.\nThe Council of Europe describe the convention as based on the understanding that violence against women is a form of gender-based violence that is committed against women because they are women. It is the obligation of the state to address it fully in all its forms and to take measures to prevent violence against women, protect its victims and prosecute the perpetrators. Failure to do so would make it the responsibility of the state. The convention leaves no doubt: there can be no real equality between women and men if women experience gender-based violence on a large-scale and state agencies and institutions turn a blind eye. Because it is not only women and girls who suffer domestic violence, parties to the convention are encouraged to apply the protective framework it creates to men who are exposed to violence within the family or domestic unit. Nevertheless, it should not be overlooked that the majority of victims of domestic violence are women and that domestic violence against them is part of a wider pattern of discrimination and inequality.\nI raised the failure to ratify the convention in the House of Commons last week and received a pretty mealy-mouthed answer from the Justice Secretary. In particular, I asked whether it was the requirement to support migrant women experiencing domestic abuse that was holding things up. Migrant women often find it impossible to access emergency protection because of the “no recourse to public funds” condition and are highly vulnerable to domestic abuse and coercive control as a result of their immigration status.\nA Domestic Abuse Bill was going through Westminster in the last parliament but fell when the General Election was called. The draft Bill has been reintroduced this week and it will address some of the remaining issues which prevent ratification, such as extra-territorial effect, but will still fall short in one key area – yes, you’ve guessed it - the provision of services for migrant women.\nThe Scottish parliament has passed all the necessary legislation to enable ratification from in respect of devolved matters. Does anyone think that the Scottish Government would still be quibbling after all this time about extending services to highly vulnerable migrants?\nThe best thing the British Government could do to mark this International Women’s Day would be to ratify - but it can’t. The delay and the reasons for it are yet another indication of where the UK intends to position itself on the world stage post-Brexit. The track record of the Scottish Government shows that the best hope for women and girls in Scotland is independence. Then Scotland’s parliament would have the power to take the necessary measures to follow in Ireland’s footsteps by ratifying the Istanbul Convention.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_uk-attitude-to-refugees-channel-tragedy/content_38.html": "Tragedy in the Channel must change the UK's attitude to refugees\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 26th Nov 2021\nThe tragic loss of life in the channel this week came as shock, despite its inevitability. But this tragedy was avoidable, and it is therefore imperative that the disaster heralds a change in approach from the UK Government. We need to give people a way to claim asylum in the UK without having to risk their lives. As the charity Care for Calais argued eloquently on Radio Scotland yesterday, the people smugglers are a symptom not the cause of the problem. The underlying issue is that you cannot claim asylum in the UK until you are here and that is why people will risk their lives to get into the country.\nYes, there are resettlement schemes available, but they apply only to a tiny percentage of the world’s refugees. Less than 1%. Routes to family reunion are also wholly inadequate. We need more safe legal routes. The Government's current strategy of pretending that the cross-channel route can be made \"unviable\" while spending millions of pounds displacing the crossings further up the coast has succeeded only in making journeys riskier with more deaths resulting. Meanwhile the conditions in which those waiting to cross are living in Calais are horrendous, no food, no shelter and no sanitation.\nWhile asylum arrivals have become more visible over the past 18 months - mainly due to COVID - the number of arrivals has remained relatively low. In 2020 there were under 30,000 asylum applications in the UK. In the early 2000s there were over 80,000 per year. We accept far fewer applications per year than France & Germany. Those making the Channel crossing are fleeing Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and other oppressive regimes. They are torture and sexual violence survivors, LGBTQI+ people, modern slavery victims and children.\nYet Priti Patel persists with virulent schemes to put people off claiming asylum in the UK. From the madness of wave machines in the channel to the sinister plans for offshore processing at remote locations, her heartless spite knows no bounds.\nPart 3 of the Nationality and Borders Bill will make a number of changes to immigration law and enforcement designed to deter refugees from seeking asylum in the UK by arriving through “irregular’ routes. The legislation will criminalise those who arrive in this way and make it an offence to assist someone to do so. Powers of maritime enforcement will be strengthened including the ability to turn boats around at sea – known as ‘pushbacks’. You don’t need much experience at sea to understand how risky such procedures could be for the small unseaworthy vessels that we see on our TV screens.\nThe Joint Committee on Human Rights is holding an inquiry into the human rights aspects of the Bill. Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights which is part of the domestic legal systems of the UK by virtue of the Human Rights Act, protects the right to life. The state has a positive obligation to adopt laws and practices which do that and the UK is also bound by a number of international refugee and maritime conventions which this bill will breach if enacted into law.\nThe committee has received a large volume of written evidence and also held several oral evidence sessions on the government’s proposals. Our full report on Part 3 of the bill will be out next week. The weight of the evidence is that the most effective way to deter illegal entry and to stop the business of people smuggling is to create safe and legal routes for asylum seekers. In particular we need a fairer and more efficient system for dealing with asylum claims.\nOne charity which submitted written evidence came up with a concrete proposal which I put to the Home Secretary in the Commons earlier this week. Donate4refugees provides grassroots support to asylum seekers and refugees. Their founder and CEO, Amber Bauer, is a Scot based in London who regularly travels to Calais and Greece. She and her husband have hosted refugees in their home. Her suggestion is that the UK allows people to claim asylum at the UK frontier controls operated by the UK in France under the Treaty of Le Touquet, signed in February 2003. They would claim asylum to UK officials at the border on French soil, complete the first stage of their application there and, if their initial application for asylum is accepted by the Home Office in the UK, then the Home Office would transfer them to the UK on regular transport – by ferry or Eurostar/Channel Tunnel. They would be given their Asylum Registration Card in France as their permission to travel and, upon safe arrival in the UK, they would start the “normal” UK process of dispersal accommodation and asylum support to wait through their asylum decision.\nThis proposal would severely reduce demand for smugglers. The UK’s borders would be better controlled because the Home Office would determine who gets to enter as they would be checked on border watch lists etc before crossing. It would stop the need for millions of pounds to be given to the French Government to fund border security in northern France and it would enable some refugees to arrive in the UK with their own money and to be self-sufficient at least in the short term, whilst their applications are processed.\nIf the objectives as stated by the Home Secretary and Prime Minister are to stop lives being needlessly put at risk making the treacherous irregular crossings of the Channel, to stop the very lucrative smuggler rings and to reduce the burden on lorry drivers (as this continues as an irregular route across the Channel and can reasonably be expected to increase again in winter and post-COVID,) then safe, regular alternatives have to be established.\nBut when I put this proposal to Priti Patel she dismissed it out of hand. The tragedy which transpired on Wednesday means she must revisit it.\nThe good news is that, working together with cross-party MPs, another refugee charity, Detention Action have prepared an amendment to the bill which will be tabled when it returns to the Commons in December and which proposes a similar scheme. The plan is to create a humanitarian visa for people in France seeking to come to the UK to make an asylum claim and to ensure that adults and children whose claims have a good prospect of success are granted safe passage. Detention Action argue that given that 98% of those making this crossing claim asylum on arrival and the vast majority will have their protection claims upheld, a workable humanitarian visa policy would drastically reduce small boat crossings and help undercut the business model of the people smugglers. This humanitarian visa route also has the support of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants whose Policy and Advocacy Manager Zoe Gardner has given powerful testimony against the UK Government’s approach both to the JCHR and in the media.\nThe amendment is due to be tabled in the coming days. In the words of Care for Calais – for these deaths to be happening at the British border when there is a workable alternative is deeply shameful. If one good thing comes out of this tragedy meaningful cross- party support for this amendment and its passing will be a fitting memorial to those who lost their lives on our borders.",

The phrase is rarely defined and often employed to avoid addressing the detailed arguments of feminists who want to defend rights based on biological sex and LGB people who wish to defend their legal right to be same-sex attracted. If you are sick of this issue and want to stop reading at this point, please don’t and instead try to conjure up a picture of how you would feel if your right to discuss and campaign for independence was under attack and you were stopped from speaking out to defend it or from meeting with others who are like-minded.\nImagine how you would feel if you were prevented from going to a screening of one of the Nation films by Lesley Riddoch and Al McMaster. Even worse, try to imagine how you would feel if you were bullied out of your job and the means of earning a living because of your beliefs. The history of totalitarianism from fascist Germany to Stalin and Putin’s Russia certainly shows us that the demonisation of one’s opponents can be an effective weapon against rational argument and free speech. But is this really where we want Scotland to be?\nOn Wednesday night at the University of Edinburgh, women were prevented for a second time from meeting to view and discuss a film called Adult Human Female. It is a documentary which looks at the clash between women’s rights and trans ideology. It challenges the idea that it is harmless for men to identify as women and that it is progressive to modify the bodies of young people in the name of changing their gender. The film features several leading feminists and lesbians including three dear friends of mine. Dr Shereen Benjamin is a senior lecturer in primary education at Edinburgh University. Shereen is a Jewish lesbian and a dedicated trade unionist and Labour Party member who has been a human rights activist since the 1980s. Lucy Masoud is a black lesbian who survived the bombing of the Admiral Duncan pub back in 1999, in which her girlfriend was seriously injured. This was an attack by a neo-Nazi on same-sex attracted people drinking in a gay bar. Three people were killed. We will mark the 24th anniversary this weekend. Lucy went on to be a firefighter involved at Grenfell and she is now a barrister who frequently represents women who have suffered male violence. Jo Phoenix, also a lesbian, and a former dean of Durham University was a Professor of Criminology at the Open University (OU) until a public campaign of harassment made her work life unbearable. She is now taking the OU to an employment tribunal because, she alleges, they sanctioned and enabled a campaign of harassment and vilification of her on account of her views on sex and gender. In the film Shereen, Lucy and Jo speak of how important it is to be heard about their lesbian identity and experience.\nThe mob that stopped other women from seeing them do so on Wednesday appeared to consist of an awful lot of white, straight men. Many covered their faces with masks or presented in women’s clothing and make-up while howling their hate with unmistakable male voices and aggression. But, hey ho, it’s OK to see women, many of them in their 50s and above, subjected to misogyny and ageism if it is in the name of a culture war. As the mob prevailed, Edinburgh University tweeted about how it was flying a flag for Lesbian Visibility Week and about what an inclusive environment the university is. It would be laughable if it wasn’t such a tragedy and a scandal to see the university of our capital city, the home of the Enlightenment, brought so low.\nI am a graduate of Edinburgh University and I am ashamed of its failure to facilitate freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and academic freedom. University College London managed to show the film, notwithstanding a protest and its Professor Alice Sullivan has rightly posed the question of what underlies Edinburgh’s failure to do so. She asks whether it is cowardice, misogyny, incompetence or all three? I shall certainly be following up those questions with the university authorities.\nEarlier this week at Westminster I chaired a meeting where three women from the field of the arts and academia told MPs and peers about the experiences of losing their livelihoods because they dared to stand up against an ideology which seeks to erase the reality of women’s experience and the right of LGB people to be same-sex not same-gender attracted.\nRosie Kay, a multi-award-winning dancer and choreographer and Scottish-born star of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was forced to resign from her own dance company after she was formally accused of transphobia by some of her dancers following remarks she made about the difference between sex and gender at a dinner party in her own home. After resigning, she found that her ability to earn a living was severely curtailed.\nDenise Fahmy worked for the UK’s biggest arts quango as a grants officer for 15 years. She blew the whistle on them for alleged homophobia and discrimination when a grant to make a film about the changes experienced by gay men during the late Queen’s reign was withdrawn from the LGB Alliance when some quango staff complained about the fact that the charity advocates exclusively for same-sex-attracted people. Denise believes she was targeted as a result of calling this discrimination out and is taking her case to an employment tribunal.\nDr Laura Favaro is an academic who has been researching silencing, discrimination and harassment against female academics who raise questions about gender identity theory, including those who are gender critical. As a consequence, she has been ostracised, subjected to false complaints, had her research stopped, her research data taken away, and lost her job. She is also taking her university to an employment tribunal.\nPoliticians have a responsibility not to feed the flames of this “war”. When they tell women that their views are “not valid” or make unfounded allegations of bigotry, transphobia, racism, or whatever pejorative comes to hand then they make things worse, not better. They also elide the real issues when they claim “both sides” are as bad as the other. You won’t find gender-critical politicians standing beside signs demanding the violent death of trans people.\nAnd I defy you to find me a case in Scotland or the UK where a trans person has lost their livelihood for refusing to espouse the belief that sex is a material reality or where trans people have been prevented for coming together to view a film or have a discussion about their experiences.\nRecently an event featuring trans activists Katy Montgomerie and Grace Lavery went ahead at Edinburgh University. There was no attempt to stop it by feminists or lesbians despite the fact that both speakers have frequently attacked our views. Mob rule and the heckler’s veto is a tactic of only one side of this debate.\nIf there is a war going on in our culture it’s a war against women’s rights, the rights of same-sex-attracted people, artistic and academic freedom and the rights of freedom of belief, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. This should concern us all.",

Innocent people have been once again caught in the cycle of violence that has torn apart so many lives.\n\"I am deeply concerned about the situation. I visited the West Bank on a cross-party parliamentary delegation with the Council for Arab-British Understanding (CAABU) and Human Appeal in October 2016 and was shocked with what I saw there. I have continued to raise my concerns about Palestinian human rights in Parliament and in the media. On Tuesday I helped chair a panel at Westminster with CAABU, Medical Aid for Palestinians, Amnesty UK and Oxfam International where we were briefed on the unfolding humanitarian disaster in Gaza. They are warning that we are in the era of atrocity prevention and currently have a short window of opportunity to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in Gaza.\nThe collective punishment of civilian populations is not acceptable and is against international law.

The Minister had no answer & referred to correspondence regarding the #ICJ. #Gaza pic.twitter.com/99dMuc3qpb\n— Joanna Cherry KC (@joannaccherry) May 20, 2024\nNational Article\nFirst published in The National, Friday 17 May 2024\nOn Monday it was reported that right wing protesters in Israel had blocked aid trucks destined for Gaza, throwing food packages onto the road and ripping open bags of grain.\nWhilst the UN Aid Agency confirmed that Northern Gaza is now experiencing full-blown famine, video footage showed fit young men in their late teens and early twenties stomping on food parcels and throwing their contents down a ravine.\nThe attack happened at the Tarqumiya checkpoint, west of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. US national security adviser Jack Sullivan said: “It is a total outrage that there are people who are attacking and looting these convoys coming from Jordan, going to Gaza to deliver humanitarian assistance.”\nThat same day in Westminster Hall in the House of Commons MPs from across parliament came together to call for urgent family visas to allow people with loved ones in Gaza to bring them to the safety of the UK temporarily. I spoke in the debate alongside SNP colleagues. I started by declaring my support for the Balfour project. It was set up in 2011 by husband-and-wife Roger and Monica Spooner. They had been on holiday to the middle East with friends who were Jordanian and were shocked to learn about Britain’s role in Palestine.\nPromises were made by Britain to Arabs in 1915 that a state would be created stretching across the Near East including Palestine in return for a military alliance with the British against the Ottoman Empire an ally of Germany during the first world war.\nHowever, those promises were betrayed notwithstanding the Balfour Declaration in 1917 which appeared to promise a Jewish homeland whilst doing nothing to prejudice the rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\nOn their travels the Spooners met many Palestinians who blamed Britain for the loss of their nation and the dispossession of their land during the Nakba. Nakba, Arabic for \"catastrophe,\" refers to the 1948 displacement of roughly 700,000 Palestinians.\nFollowing the UN partition plan for Palestine, war erupted between Palestinians and Jewish forces. Many Palestinians fled violence or were forcibly expelled from their homes. The Nakba remains a central point of tension in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nPalestinians seek a right of return to their lost lands, a demand disputed by Israel. The Nakba's legacy is one of dispossession and longing for a homeland.\nThe Spooner’s work on raising awareness has grown into the charity the Balfour Project. It has three broad aims, to acknowledge Britain’s historic role in shaping 20th and 21st century Palestine/Israel, particularly in light of the Balfour Declaration and the policies of the British Mandate; to Support Palestinians and Israelis in building a peaceful future based on equal rights, justice and security for all, and to work for the British Government’s recognition of the State of Palestine.\nThe British Government recognised the State of Israel in 1950, but Palestinians remain stateless, exiled, refugees or second-class citizens within Israel and the Occupied Territories.\nThat is why so many people in the UK feel that Britain bears a responsibility for what has happened to the Palestinians since the Nakba and why the UK Government should be doing far more than it is at present to help Palestinians who have been so cruelly caught up in the war.\nOf course, none of this condones the evil actions of Hamas on October 7 but it does go to underline the plight of innocent civilians in Gaza suffering as a result if Israel’s backlash and to put the whole terrible situation in its historic context.\nMPs called on the UK Government to allow British Citizens with immediate and extended family members in Gaza to come to the UK on temporary visas. My constituent Dr Eman El-Bahnassawy is a specialist dentist who managed to evacuate her 79-year-old mother from Gaza to Cairo.\nAs a child, this now elderly lady witnessed the Nakba and she has endured all the recent wars on Gaza. She has already been displaced 9 times during the current war and her home has been destroyed by the bombing, so she has nowhere to go back to.\nThe UK Government has previously introduced successful bespoke pathways for those fleeing persecution in Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong so it can quickly introduce visas when it suits it. What is being called for here, however, is not akin to homes for Ukraine. British Citizens living and working here simply want to be able to house and support their own family members and get them out of Gaza before they are killed.\nIn the absence of a specific family route, they can only rely on existing visa routes, such as a family visa for example as a spouse or partner or based on refugee family reunification, or a skilled worker dependent visa. These types of applications involve prolonged waits, up to 6 months for a family visa, and hefty fees - £1846 per person if applying from outside the UK to join one’s partner, parent, or child, in addition to an immigration health surcharge of at least £2587.50 per adult.\nSo many of the children in Gaza have been orphaned because of the war, under the existing schemes it is very difficult for the remaining extended families to rescue their kin, so these existing routes do not fit in the current crisis.\nYou cannot apply for a visa unless you are able to have your fingerprints scanned and a digital photograph taken of your face in a UK Visa processing centre. You cannot get out of Gaza to the UK without these scans and you cannot have them without getting out of Gaza. The only remaining option is to evacuate to Egypt.\nThis evacuation process has forced many families to crowdfund tens of thousands of pounds to pay private companies to facilitate their loved ones’ exit from Gaza into Egypt.\nThat option is now also closed due to Israel’s recent occupation of the Rafa crossing. Those who have already fled to Egypt are trapped in limbo - unable to join their loved ones in the UK because they are waiting for the outcome of an application (if they can afford it) or because they are simply ineligible under existing routes. Palestinians’ precarious immigration status in Egypt also means they lack effective access to state support to rebuild their lives.\nSome online commentators reacting to the debate in parliament said that neighbouring Arab countries should accept refugees from Gaza and that it is not the responsibility of the UK. However, what is being talked about here is people with family ties to British citizens being allowed to join their families in the UK.\nThe refusal of Egypt and Jordan to accept large numbers of refugees is rooted in their fear that Israel wants to permanently expel Palestinians into the Sinai desert to finally end Palestinian demands for statehood.\nMany Palestinians live as refugees in other countries, 300,000 people fled mostly to Jordan during the 1967 Middle East War. Displacement is at the root of the ongoing conflict.\nThe UK Government has repeatedly failed to introduce more safe and legal routes for refugees to come to the UK. They show no sign of agreeing to allow Palestinians living in the UK to bring any relatives here, even when they are old ladies or children, and family sponsorship is promised.\nIt’s a humanitarian outrage and a dereliction of the UK’s historic moral responsibilities.\nGaza Family Reunion Visa\nJoanna Cherry calls on the UK Government to grant visas to Palestinians who are family members of UK Citizens so they they might be reunited with their families and come to the UK to be supported by their relatives.\nThe UK Goverment should urgently set up a visa scheme so the relatives of British people who are trapped in #Gaza or who have fled to Egypt can be reunited with their families in the UK @GazaFamReunited pic.twitter.com/VqXKM9njjP\n— Joanna Cherry KC (@joannaccherry) May 14, 2024\nLetter demanding the creation of a Gaza Family Scheme\nJoanna Cherry has signed a letter to Home Secretary, James Cleverly MP, demanding the creation of a Gaza Family Scheme to allow Palestinians in the UK to bring their family members trapped in Gaza to safety.\nQuestion on safe and legal migration routes\nJoanna asked when the U.K. Government will introduce new safe and legal migration routes, including family reunion schemes for relatives in Gaza, as well as humanitarian visas for women at risk in Afghanistan and Iran\nToday I asked when the U.K. Govt will introduce new safe and legal migration routes including family reunification visas so UK Citizens can get their families out of #Gaza safely.

If Scots continue to remain part of a political union with England these are the implications soft No/wavering Yes voters must continue to weigh up.\nSome people will argue that we should be pleased the Commons eventually voted for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. That is true. However, the impact of that vote has been lost in the chaos generated by the chicanery that went on behind the scenes and the nonsense that was played out on television screens across the globe.\nThat is not just my view but that of the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, Husam Zomlot, as reported in this newspaper yesterday. Furthermore, unless the UK Government act upon the motion, which seems unlikely, Israel will not be dissuaded from continuing its violations of international law and the slaughter of innocent civilians in what is left of Gaza.\nAccusations of playing politics against the SNP are spurious. We've been consistent in our support for a ceasefire and the observance of international law. The Labour Party have not. Instead, they have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support a ceasefire and are still not prepared to call out the enormity of what Israel has done to innocent civilians in its legitimate quest to wipe out Hamas.\nIt seems that it's OK for the Labour Party in Scotland to call out the collective punishment of people in Gaza as they did in their recent conference motion but beyond the pale for the SNP to have it clearly and unequivocally in a parliamentary motion.\nLabour have had ample opportunity to bring forward a motion for a ceasefire. Since October 7, 2023, the Labour Party have had four Opposition days with eight opposition motions. On none of these occasions did they seek to debate the situation in Israel or Gaza. Instead, they equivocated and dragged their feet on the question of a ceasefire.\nThen when they faced being put on the spot by an SNP motion, they nobbled the Speaker and hijacked the debate to have their own heavily watered-down ceasefire motion take precedence. What they did was all about getting Keir Starmer and Labour off the hook rather than focusing on the obvious suffering in Gaza and the appalling breaches of international law.\nAt Westminster as at Holyrood and indeed in most parliaments, government business dominates the agenda. Opposition days exist to give opposition parties the opportunity to hold debates and votes on the issues that matter to them. Labour get these very regularly. The SNP get a handful in every parliamentary session.\nHow these debates are conducted is governed by longstanding convention and under Standing Order 31 of the House of Commons. Normally what happens is that the opposition party move their motion first and if the Government have an amendment they move that in reply. Then at the end of the debate the opposition party's motion is voted on.\nIf it is not passed then there is a vote on the Government amendment. The procedures were introduced in 1979 with the specific purpose of allowing a vote to take place on the motion laid down by the Opposition party on their allocated day.\nOn Wednesday there were three amendments to the SNP motion, a Labour one, a Government one and a LibDem one. What the Speaker allowed to happen was for the first vote to be on Labour's amendment to the SNP motion with the inevitable result that if it was passed there would be no vote at all on the SNP motion.\nWhen the Speaker announced his decision to upend the rules and prevent a clear vote on the SNP motion, he said that there was precedent for approaching matters this way. When he said that I believe he misled the Commons.\nThe Clerk of the House's letter of advice to him which has been published and which you can read on my Twitter feed explains that there have only been two occasions in the last 25 years where an amendment has been moved by an opposition party other than the one to which the day had been allocated, but, crucially, in those circumstances no government amendment had been tabled.\nSo, if precedent and the rules had been followed, the first vote that occurred should have been on the stronger SNP motion.\nA story is now being spun that Starmer asked the Speaker to upend the rule book because of threats that were being brought to bear on his MPs.\nHowever, journalists with very well-placed sources say there were multiple conversations with the Speaker which included messages being passed to him by Labour Party MPs that if he didn't do their bidding they would not support him for Speaker on the other side of the General Election. If the Speaker gave in to such threats then he has fatally compromised his impartiality.\nI fear that the threats narrative is being used to detract from the shabby reality of what occurred on Wednesday and to let Sir Keir Starmer's Labour Party off the hook. However, if it is true that threats of violence influenced the Speaker's decision then that is also a very serious matter. It should not have been allowed to happen.\nIt is a sad fact of our modern democracy that politicians do sometimes face threats to their personal safety for doing what they believe to be right. I have personal experience of this because of my support for women's and LGB rights.\nI have even faced criminal threats from within my own party and at times my professional life has been made close to intolerable, but I have never let it stop me speaking out for what I believed to be right or from doing my job.\nNor have I sought to bend the rules or to nobble those who are supposed to be impartial in order to get off the hook of following my conscience.\nI am in no doubt that the Speaker of the House of Commons should resign or be removed from office over what he did on Wednesday. However, it is not only his integrity that is an issue. Starmer looks like being the future prime minister of the United Kingdom. If this is an indication of how he and his party intend to handle matters, then we should be very concerned.\nI know that many of my constituents who might otherwise think about voting Labour are already concerned about Labour's equivocation on a ceasefire. I suspect they will be equally concerned about the dirty dealing that went on behind the scenes on Wednesday.\nIt certainly strengthens my offer to them and that of any other SNP MP who is prepared to follow their conscience and do the right thing rather than indulge in party-political stitch-ups.\nOpposition Day - SNP Motion for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel\nThe SNP’s full motion is:\nThat this house calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel; notes with shock and distress that the death toll has now risen beyond 28,000, the vast majority of whom were women and children; further notes that there are currently 1.5 million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah, 610,000 of whom are children; also notes that they have nowhere else to go; condemns any military assault on what is now the largest refugee camp in the world; further calls for the immediate release of all hostages taken by Hamas and an end to the collective punishment of the Palestinian people; and recognises that the only way to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians is to press for a ceasefire now.\nStatement on proportionality\nI call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

Songkran is Thailand's most famous festival and an important event on the Buddhist calendar. The water festival marks the beginning of the traditional Thai New Year. The name Songkran comes from a Sanskrit word meaning 'passing' or 'approaching'.\nI was happy to wish the Thai Community Happy Songkran and acknowledge the Temple’s wonderful support for the Thai community in Edinburgh. Abbot Prasert Prommala gave blessings to the attendees, thanks to everyone’s support to temple and his gratitude to the Thai and Scottish people throughout Scotland who have welcomed the thousands of Thai people who visit, study, work and those who settle here.\nThe food was made by many of the Thai community chefs that work in restaurants throughout Edinburgh and was wonderful. I enjoyed the vibrant displays of Thai dancing and a showcase of Muay Thai boxing.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_forge-new-social-and-economic-vision-for-scotland/content_127.html": "This is the time to forge a new social and economic vision for Scotland\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 30th Sep 2022\nDo not underestimate the mess we are in. Thanks to the hapless Truss and the arrogant but inept Kwarteng, last week’s mini budget has plunged the economy of the UK into the worst crisis since Black Wednesday, thirty years ago. Funnily enough both crises have happened under Tory Governments. What a nonsense that makes of the Tories hype that only they can run the economy effectively.\nWe need to sort things out. Quick. Parliament needs to be recalled. Steps taken to reverse some of the most disgustingly greedy and insane aspects of the budget and then we need a General Election to get rid of the Tories. The economist Richard Murphy has suggested that, in the short term, what is needed is a cross-party coalition to stabilise things followed by a General Election next year to elect a new government with real vision and courage.\nThe Tories are never going to relinquish control, so such a cross-party coalition, a government of national emergency if you like, won’t happen. But if it did should the SNP be part of it? Damn right we should. It is not in Scotland’s interests for the UK economy to go under and SNP MPs have a duty to do everything we can to save our constituents from the penury threatened by the Tories' hubris. I believe that the siren voices who demand our immediate disengagement from Westminster, pending independence, are wrong. That is not the mandate we were elected upon. Even with a Yes vote in the promised referendum next October, there will be a period of negotiation before Independence Day, and, during that time, decisions effecting Scotland will still be taken at Westminster. SNP MPs need to influence those decisions if we can, and we could be particularly influential in the event of a hung parliament. Keir Starmer keeps bleating on about ruling out any deals with the SNP. What he is effectively saying is if he wins the election in England that gives him the right to rule the whole of the UK because the majority of English voters have chosen his party but, if the SNP win the election in Scotland the wishes of the majority of Scottish voters should be ignored. That’s a curious position for someone who professes to want to keep the union going.\nThe one situation, short of a mandate, that might justify the disengagement of SNP MPs from Westminster would be an outright General Election win for Tories or Labour in which the SNP would be without effective influence. For now, our engagement is what is required but that should not stop SNP MPs doing other useful stuff for the independence cause, including joining the Constitutional Convention promised in January 2020 which I hope will be convened soon.\nOne thing we do know with certainty is that with the present Tory majority at Westminster, Scotland is pretty powerless and on the side-lines of this mess. The SNP may have been the first party to demand a recall of parliament but it won’t happen unless Tory backbenchers demand it in sufficient numbers. While there are things the Scottish parliament can do to alleviate the pain of the fallout, its budget is limited and ultimately it lacks the economic powers to make a real difference. That said, mere hand wringing and emoting really won’t do. We need to take some big learnings from this mess and apply them to the vision for independence.\nEarlier this week Kenny Farquharson, a well-known unionist columnist for another newspaper, wrote a thoughtful piece in which he argued that the sterling crisis joins Brexit as a key argument against the union. The sterling crisis, he argues, has fatally undermined the argument, which held such sway in 2014, that the UK offers financial stability in a hostile world. He put it like this – now, when a No voter asks a Yesser “what’s your currency plan?”, a credible reply is: “What’s yours?”. He concluded that while the argument for the union is not yet lost, if and when it is, history will see this past week as a key moment.\nI think he’s right, but I would sound a note of caution. The broad shoulders of the UK argument may be dead in the water but that does not mean the SNP do not need to provide reassurance and vision. The case for independence is being made for us but the prospectus needs a reboot and only we can do that.\nMuch detailed policy work has been done by groups like Commonweal and the Scottish Currency Group. Our message is being shaped by Believe In Scotland, Voices for Scotland and many others to show that Scotland can afford to be an independent country but there are still some major questions to be answered on cross-border trade, the timescale for re-joining the EU and yes, what currency we will use. All three questions can only be meaningfully answered in the context of a broader socio-economic vision for an independent Scotland.\nThe Growth Commission, already unpopular with those of us on the left of the independence movement, has been overtaken by events. At the time it was published, many commentators felt it did not adequately address what might be required if Scotland was to re-join the EU. To be fair it was written at a time when the shape of the final Brexit deal was not known but we know the full horror now and taking that together with the changes wrought by the Covid pandemic, a war in Europe, the energy crisis and increased recognition of the need to ground all our future plans in tackling the climate crisis, so much has changed. A renewed socio-economic prospectus for independence is required. It cannot and must not tie us into the UK’s fiscal and monetary policies. We will need control over our money and how it is managed. What is the point of independence but to do things differently and better? This is the time for us to be bold and forge a new economic and social vision.\nThe Commonweal have argued convincingly that there is more we could do under devolution to incubate projects for the economic and social transformation that will only be possible with independence. SNP programmes for Government under devolution need to be hooked into a bigger plan that rolls us forward towards independence, and they need to be more adventurous.\nThese are issues that the SNP Conference needs to debate and there is still time for them to be added to the agenda for our upcoming event by way of emergency or topical motions. Conference motions that merely reiterate the familiar refrain of “up with this we will not put” will not be enough. The party needs to bite the bullet of addressing a world that has changed hugely since publication of the Growth Commission. The ideal outcome of the SNP conference would be a fresh, concrete and comprehensive vision for Scotland’s future under independence together with a plan for delivery.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_brexit-process-illustrates-limits-of-devolution/content_247.html": "Brexit process has clearly illustrated limits of devolution\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 26th Jun 2020\nThe fourth anniversary of the 2016 Brexit referendum passed earlier this week, with little fanfare. Even the most zealous Tories seemed reluctant to celebrate given the double whammy coming at the British economy with the economic downturn caused by the Coronavirus crisis due to be significantly exacerbated when Brexit finally takes effect at the end of the transition period on 31 December.\nAlready Brexit has cost the British economy dear. According to Bloomberg Economics Brexit will have cost the UK more than £200 billion in lost economic growth by the end of this year. This means that Brexit is on course to cost the UK more than its combined total of payments to the EU budget over the past 47 years. But hey who cares? It’s worth it for a blue passport even if you can’t go anywhere because Britain is the sick man of Europe owing to Boris Johnson’s incompetent handling of the Coronavirus crisis.\nOf course, the costs of Brexit are not just economic. Guy Verhoftsadt responded to the Bloomberg figures by tweeting that the real costs are uncertainty and the loss of opportunity. The latter is something that will be felt keenly particularly by young people across the UK losing their right of freedom of movement.\nLosing freedom of movement also has major implications for the Scottish economy. The report of the Scottish Government’s Independent Advisory Group - Towards A Robust, Resilient Wellbeing Economy for Scotland – is unequivocal that the impact of Brexit is likely to hamper economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis. They conclude that, even with the sort of basic trade deal that is likely, the combined impact of the disruption to supply chains and the heightened uncertainty could result in widespread businesses closures and job losses over and above those resulting from Covid-19 alone.\nScottish Government analysis has revealed ending the transition period in 2020 could remove £3 billion from the Scottish economy in just two years - on top of the impact of coronavirus. The Advisory Group also make much of the Scottish Government’s earlier analysis which showed that the loss of freedom of movement will be particularly damaging to Scotland. Because of our ageing population we need a buoyant working age population with the appropriate skills to staff our essential public services. Without an easy flow of inward migration from the EU it’s hard to see where that will come from. Of course, the Tories are hoping that the economic fallout from Brexit will be buried in the economic fallout from the pandemic. That’s why it is so important that SNP MPs work hard at Westminster to scrutinise what the Tories are up to and to highlight the economic impacts of their plans.\nNext week the Immigration Bill returns to the Commons. Stuart McDonald and Brendan O’Hara have done a sterling job highlighting the Scottish Government’s concerns about the loss of freedom of movement. In respect of the health and social care sector, Dr Philippa Whitford has pointed out the impact of Brexit on an NHS already struggling to cope with the coronavirus. Whether it’s the impact of the loss of NHS staff and care workers from the EU or the increased cost of pharmaceuticals when, after the end of the Brexit transition period, all four health services in the UK and Northern Ireland will face increased bureaucracy and increased costs to import drugs from Europe. On top of that, it has been estimated that a trade deal with the United States of America could increase the drugs bill from £18 billion to £45 billion.\nIn relation to food standards, Deidre Brock and Dave Doogan have put pressure on Scottish Tories, dubbed the “Supine 6”, and their Westminster bosses to protect the high food standards currently in place and to avoid a race to the bottom that will devastate Scotland’s world leading food and farming sector.\nWe know, of course, that all of these pleas will fall on deaf ears. Nevertheless, the Tories won’t have things all their own way nor should we let them.\nIt is likely that some sort of a trade deal with the EU will be reached later this year, but the devil will be in the detail. The Tories are already rowing back on some of the binding commitments they made in haste to secure the Withdrawal Agreement last year, particularly under the Northern Ireland Protocol. And as we have seen from the Advisory Group’s report any deal will be bad for the Scottish economy. The economic impacts they have identified are imminent. There will be no extension and the idea that Scotland could ask for a separate extension is pie in the sky, ignoring the simple fact that Scotland is not the member state but rather, so far as the EU are concerned, just a region of a member state.\nThe powers of the Scottish parliament to limit the economic impacts of Brexit are limited and so are its powers to remain in regulatory alignment with the EU.\nThe Brexit process has very clearly illustrated the limits of devolution. So, while SNP MPs must do the job we were elected by our constituents to do at Westminster, the reality is that only action taken in Scotland to secure independence can secure a future where this sort of unwanted chaos cannot happen again. It’s great to see an increase in support for independence in the opinion polls but this, together with the SNP riding high in the polls, takes us no further forward unless we have a plan for how to secure our independence and what to do with it.\nThose who want to discuss and debate such plans are to be applauded. The time for avoiding discussion of Plan B is over. That discussion and proposals like those of the Common Weal for a Resilient Scotland should be centre stage if, as mooted, the SNP Conference and National Assemblies go online this Autumn.",

Keir Starmer’s equivocation on women’s rights is pathetic. It is a clear sign of what’s to come and I would urge women to think very carefully when they are casting their votes.\nUntil recently I was the elected chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights at Westminster. I believe that Trans people should be free to live their lives with dignity and respect. I firmly believe in the protections for Trans people enshrined in the Equality Act.\nHowever, I do not accept that any man should have the right, through self-ID, to choose their gender and gain access to single-sex spaces.\nRights can conflict and it is not acceptable for the hard won rights of women to be compromised by gender ideology. If the rules governing single-sex spaces are changed so that some members of the opposite sex are able to enter, those spaces become mixed-sex, and many women will self-exclude.\nIf males who identify as women are housed in women’s prisons, women will feel and be unsafe. If males are allowed to play in women’s sport, then fairness and safety for women are destroyed.\nKeir Starmer’s Labour Party are set to win a majority across seats in England. With a new incoming Labour government it is going to be really important to have strong independent-minded voices in the next parliament to speak up for women & LGB people.\nIf re-elected that’s what I will continue to do.\nand to stand up for the rights of women and girls.\nJK Rowling: Labour has dismissed women like me. I’ll struggle to vote for it\n“As long as Labour remains dismissive and often offensive towards women fighting to retain the rights their foremothers thought were won for all time, I’ll struggle to support them.

The lecture series is inspired by President Franklin D Roosevelt’s 1941 speech in which he extolled Four Freedoms; Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Fear and Freedom from Want. The last of the 4 lectures will be given by Darren McGarvey, author of Poverty Safari and will definitely be worth a listen.\nThere’s too little space in this column to do justice to Chimamanda’s wide-ranging discourse on the febrile atmosphere caused by cancel culture, arguments about wokeness and the attack on Salman Rushdie. However, her explanation of how autocrats and populists are undermining the very notion of accepted fact-based truths is more than worth a listen.\nShe argues that we should be interested in the ideas of those with whom we disagree not only because it is good to hear different sides of an issue but also because by understanding our opponents’ arguments, we are better able to tackle them. Chimamanda also reminds us that the 19th Century philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote that all silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility and that, with all due respect to the Pope, nobody is infallible.\nI don’t think I will be the only National reader who was troubled by the advice to guests at Zero Tolerance’s 30-year anniversary celebrations to “refrain from discussions of the definition of a woman and single sex spaces”. The silencing of one of the most pressing debates in current feminist circles seemed strangely out of step with the taboo breaking ethos of the founders of the organisation who they were gathering to celebrate. Clearly, at least one of the members of the largely hand-picked audience agreed. She interrupted the FM’s speech to say that women who campaign for women’s rights are not anti-trans and should not be threatened or indeed silenced for so doing. Vulnerable women, she said, should be allowed to have their own spaces away from any male. To her credit the FM departed from her prepared speech to acknowledge the intervention and I want to focus on part of what she said because it was very significant.\nThe FM said, “In my long experience most men who commit violence against women don’t feel the need to change gender to do that. Those who do, my argument is that we should focus on them because they are men abusing a system to attack women.”\nThis is an important acknowledgment that the system of self-identification of sex is open to abuse by men. That is exactly what critics of the legislation have been saying for years. We are not talking about trans people acting in good faith, we are talking about men acting in bad faith.\nIt is also in essence what Reem Alsalem, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against women and girls, said in her 9-page letter setting out her concerns. Those who dismiss her letter lightly would do well to bear in mind the FM’s acknowledgment that the basis for her concerns is valid. They should also heed Chimamanda’s advice above.\nThe FM’s acknowledgement that some men might abuse the system of self-identification to commit violence against women also undermines the assertion of those who say that there is no evidence from other countries that moving to a system of self-identification puts women at risk. As Murray Blackburn MacKenzie (MBM) have argued, this ignores the fact that some countries who have de-medicalised their process of legal gender recognition have retained other checks on applicants which are not present in the Scottish bill. There are examples of violent men obtaining access to women’s spaces using a gender recognition certificate in Ireland where self-identification is already enshrined in law – the Barbie Kardashian case, and closer to home where de facto self-identification is already allowed – Katie Dolatowski in Scotland and Karen White in England. Google these cases. They are frightening.\nMBM also point to the chilling effect of such legislation – two women in Norway have been pursued formally for hate crimes because they objected to the presence of a male in changing room. There is ample evidence to suggest that women will self-exclude from hitherto women only spaces for fear of encountering anyone who is clearly male without the right to object. Such self-exclusion will occur for reasons for dignity, privacy, and religious reasons as well as safety concerns.\nThose seeking to demean or downplay the UN Special Rapporteur’s intervention would do well to remember that attempts to shoot the messenger don’t always work. When the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) aired concerns about self-identification earlier this year, a coalition of groups led by Stonewall called on the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (Ganhri) to remove the EHRC’s “A” status. Their intervention failed and the EHRC’s “A” status has been renewed for another five years. It turns out that interventions from human rights bodies calling for clear definitions and evidence-based law making are not transphobic but actually part of their job.\nTo say that other Special Rapporteurs with different mandates or UN spokespersons support self-identification is beside the point. Reem Alsalem’s mandate is violence against women and girls, that is her expertise, she deserves to be listened to on that and for the detail of her arguments to be engaged with. I was pleased to hear the First Minister announce at FMQs yesterday that the Cabinet Secretary dealing with the bill will meet with Reem Alsalem next week. The FM also renewed her acknowledgment of the problem of ‘bad faith actors”.\nGroups who have raised concerns about self-identification including MBM, For Women Scotland and the LGB Alliance, have repeatedly emphasised that the issue is not whether or not a person is trans but what their sex is. The concerns raised about women’s single sex services and spaces are about the potential outcomes of admitting males to those services and spaces simply on their assertion that they are female. Likewise concerns raised by lesbians forced to admit people who say they are female to our dating pool don’t rest on prejudice against trans people but on the fact that as lesbians we are same sex attracted and therefore not attracted to people who are biologically male.\nRecent guidance from Scotland’s Supreme Court in the first case about the Gender Representations on Public Boards Act and from the EHRC on single sex services and spaces identify that the correct focus when considering the protected characteristic of sex under the Equality Act is whether someone is biologically male. This understanding of the meaning of ‘sex” would also be important to a consideration of whether someone is being discriminated against, harassed, or victimised on account of their sexual orientation. Trans people are protected under the protected characteristic of gender reassignment. What concerns those who oppose the current Gender Recognition Reform Bill is that as the proposed system of self-identification stands there is no way of distinguishing between those men who might seek to abuse it and good faith trans people.\nThe repeated misrepresentation of concerns about sex-based protections, and specifically men, as being concerns about trans people has led to a failure to examine these concerns properly and a toxic atmosphere in which most people who share these concerns are afraid to speak up and those who do are demonised and abused. Earlier this week I heard a colleague in the House of Commons talking about institutional bullying. If ever there was a case of institutional bullying it has been the treatment of women in workplaces and other public spaces across Scotland and the UK who have dared to raise concerns about self-identification. Is it too much to hope that the First Minister’s honest and frank response to her heckler will put a stop to this? I hope not.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_changing-of-guard-is-not-what-the-yes-movement-needs/content_161.html": "'Changing of guard' is not what the Yes movement needs\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 01st Sep 2023\nA lot of column inches have been expended in this newspaper extolling the virtue of tomorrow’s Yes march and rally in Edinburgh. I want to sound a note of caution. Not against marching but against imagining that this march is what is needed to rejuvenate the cause of independence. If that were true, then a rejuvenation wouldn’t be needed as some people have been marching for years. I attended and spoke at a sizeable AUOB march in Glasgow in May. Some of the people I met there have marched all over Scotland, often without the benefit of much support from our elected nationalist parliamentarians. So, I mean no disrespect to those who march or to those recently converted to the idea that marches and rallies might be a good thing. As Lesley Riddoch argued yesterday a big march and a rally with rousing speeches is an important sign that our movement is still alive despite the stasis of the last 9 years. It is also good for the morale of the marchers. So of course, I hope it goes well.\nHowever, those marching on Saturday particularly those leading a march for the first time should not make claims for it which disregard the efforts of those who have marched for years. Nor should they fall into the trap of thinking that another march for the already converted is what is needed to move our cause forward. I am afraid it’s a good deal more complicated than that. Support for independence has barely moved from where it was 9 years ago at the time of the 2014 independence referendum. This is disappointing particularly because, as the organisers of tomorrow’s march have identified, Brexit has made many soft Nos more sympathetic to independence because it offers the prospect of re-joining the EU. Indeed, research carried out by the Scottish Independence Convention has identified that there is a substantial section of the Scottish electorate who voted No in 2014 who could be persuaded to vote Yes. What is needed to persuade them is not a big march but some hard painstaking work to address their aspirations and concerns.\nThere is no substitute for the work needed to instil confidence that we are prepared and ready to deliver an independent Scotland that will be a good place to live. I am out and about regularly speaking to voters in my Edinburgh Southwest constituency. There is palpable disgust at the way in which the Tories are running things at Westminster. There is also a notable lack of enthusiasm for Labour’s offering. People are amenable to the idea that Scotland could do better than Westminster, but they have misgivings and questions that need to be answered.\nWe must have clearly thought through positions on the big issues such as the economy, currency, re-joining the EU and the implications of that for borders and trade. Once this work has been done it can be distilled down into key messages that can be communicated by our spokespersons and activists. We also need to work harder at governing well under the present devolved settlement. Unfortunately, we currently face a situation where many people are not overly impressed with some of the policies of the SNP/Green coalition. They are shocked by the police investigation into the SNP finances although many make the point that Tory corruption seems not to have prompted the same degree of police interest.\nTo win these people over a policy reset is needed. A return to the sort of good governance that the SNP were famed for prior to 2014 and which gave so many people the confidence to vote Yes. Not much can be done about the police investigation which must be allowed to take its course, but some hard decisions need to be taken about breaking with a way of doing things in our party that has led to the mess which prompted the police investigation. It is also important that we do nothing to alienate the voters who could be won over to Yes. To do this, we need a movement which is truly inclusive rather than one that merely pays lip service to inclusivity.\nThose promoting Saturday’s event have put a lot of emphasis on it being an “inclusive’ event. However, the meaning of the word has been somewhat debased of late. What is meant by an event or indeed a movement which is inclusive? Surely it should mean that everyone should be and feel welcome and that there should be room for respectful debate and disagreement. There is no point in reinventing the wheel. This is how the SNP and the Yes movement used to be. What has changed? The change I see is that now some people want to vet those who support Yes and exclude them if their opinions on all issues don’t fit with what a small self-appointed group consider acceptable. That is not inclusion it is exclusion.\nKelly Given wrote in this newspaper yesterday that “The notion that politics is just for old white men is on its way out.” I’ve got news for Kelly. It’s a notion that went out a long time ago. Our two major parties are led by men from Scotland’s Asian community. Yes, they were both privately educated and one of them is rich, but this should not detract from the importance that they have reached the top of our politics as Asian Scots.\nThe independence movement has a proud history of strong female leaders since Winnie Ewing came to prominence in the 60s and Margo MacDonald in the 70s. Indeed, the SNP’s tradition of strong women goes right back to some of the artists and writers who were there at the founding of our party in the 1930s and are sadly often forgotten or in the shadow of the more flamboyant men. Our Yes movement is full of women who fought long and hard for equality and don’t want to see those rights undermined.\nI am proud to be one part of a group of parliamentarians that boast some of the best LGB representation in Europe. Yes, there are no trans parliamentarians in Scotland as yet, but I don’t think anyone could seriously suggest that trans rights are not something that is top of our public agenda. Our parliamentary representation is also well served with young people.\nWhere we fall down is the lack of adequate representation of the elderly and the disabled. Just this week the Scottish Human Rights Commission said our parliament is not moving fast enough on enhancing the rights of the disabled. It would be good to hear more support for these minorities.\nSo, let’s not reinvent the wheel. But let’s also not risk alienating people. Women make up 50% of our population. Many have felt alienated by some policy decisions taken in recent years. Their rights including their right to be listened to are not dependent on them accepting other people’s beliefs or value systems. Equality is for everyone, and human rights are universal.\nThe independence movement will move forward not by “changing the guard” as some of the new cheer leaders have suggested but by attracting new and diverse support and by reaching out to those not yet convinced. We can ill afford to lose the supporters we already have. Moreover “the guard” cannot be self-appointed. Leaders are elected by putting together coalitions of support not by assuming the right to speak for a movement. An inclusive movement is one where everyone is welcome. The Yes movement was and is inclusive, but parts of it must learn to be more tolerant. Now that would be worth marching for.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_the-snp-must-keep-opposing-the-house-of-lords/content_18.html": "The SNP must keep opposing the House of Lords\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 26th Jan 2024\nMany column inches have been expanded this week on the question of whether the SNP should sit in the Lords. I am clear that we should not. Quite apart from anything else the loss of face would be hard to bear. For years colleagues have railed against the place as if it was the devil incarnate. (It isn’t but it is a very flawed institution.) You cannot attack the place in the Commons, on the conference floor and on twitter and then trick in there yourself without looking like a monumental hypocrite. Can you imagine the optics of former SNP MPs, who have declined to put themselves up for re-election or been rejected by the electorate, donning the ermine, and partaking in all the other flummery? It does not bear thinking about.\n“In Scotland, the people have the sovereign right to self-determination and to choose freely the form in which their State is to be constituted and how they are to be governed. All State power and authority accordingly derives from, and is subject to, the sovereign will of the people, and those exercising State power and authority are accountable for it to the people.” The opening clauses of the draft interim constitution for an independent Scotland make it plain that in Scotland those exercising state power and authority are accountable to the people. The biggest problem with the House of Lords is that it is unaccountable.\nI firmly believe that an independent Scotland should have a second or revising chamber for its parliament, but it must be one which is accountable to the sovereign people of Scotland through an electoral process, such as happens in other countries. Sadly, too much Scottish parliament legislation is passed without adequate scrutiny or revision and this, as we have seen, can lead to badly flawed legislation. Westminster is not a model to be held up as a good example, but the highly detailed work that is done to tidy up and improve legislation that goes on in the House of Lords can make a significant difference albeit that their work often ends up being binned when the bill comes back to the Commons.\nI do not wish to rubbish thoughtful contributions from the likes of Stephen Noon but in my view and the view of many Yessers the question of whether to have SNP representatives in the unelected House of Lords is not a thorny one. It’s barely something that merits discussion, so it has been very odd to see the kite flying that’s been going on in recent weeks. Analysis by the SNP after the 2015 general election, showed the House of Lords was a “dumping ground for party cronies”, perhaps that’s what some people have in mind.\nNot uncommonly when this issue is discussed the first counter argument is that our sister party Plaid Cymru nominate people to the House of Lords. It is worth pointing out that Plaid Cymru has, like the SNP, opposed the unelected House of Lords for decades. Devolution to Wales has been slow and uneven. In 1998 the Welsh assembly, now the Senedd did not have full law-making powers. Later, the Government of Wales Act 2006 enabled the Assembly to legislate in certain areas via Legislative Competency Orders, subject to approval from the Secretary of State for Wales and both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. As legislation coming from the Senedd needed to be approved in the Commons and the House of Lords (before further devolution in 2011), Plaid Cymru started to nominate peers from 2007 onwards. Speaking to Radio Cymru in 2022 about his intention to retire Plaid Peer Lord Dafydd Wigley said “Plaid Cymru were then blocked from entering the House of Lords by the previous Labour UK Government. According to what Labour members said to me then, Gordon Brown had said ‘over my dead body does any nationalist go into that chamber’. “And so, from 2007 until 2010 we were blocked, they refused to fulfil the promise”.\nPlaid were given the impression that after the 2010 General Election three new Plaid peers would be created to equal the number of MPs they had in the Commons. In the end however only Dafydd Wigley was made a peer. Speaking about his potential successor, Dafydd went on to say “Trying to run a one-person party in a 700-member chamber, with the whole range of policies, much of it relevant to Wales, is next to impossible, and the workload is going to be significant. There is a limit to how much one person can try to row such a boat”. A lone SNP Lord would be in a similar position. The mechanism for getting any peers in there in the first place is manifestly unfair and controlled by the government of the day so the SNP would not have anything like the representation to which we should be entitled.\nSo, there being little to no benefit in practice, we next must ask what would be the political signal which would be given. In short it would be a complete and abject capitulation of our aims. We are not at Westminster to try to revolutionise the internal workings of the UK and thank goodness because I can tell you that would be a more difficult task than achieving our independence. There is absolutely no appetite in England to radically alter the UK parliament.\nYes, some liberal and intelligent unionist voices lamented the fact that there was no SNP Lord to speak up for devolution during the various bits of Brexit legislation that hobbled Scotland’s parliament. But experienced senior members of the Lords including retired Scottish judges put forward amendments on Scotland’s behalf and were ignored. Ignored in the same way that the SNP was ignored in the Commons and the votes of Scotland’s parliament, its Government and its Ministers were ignored. It is the UK that is the problem not the SNP’s principled opposition to the Lords. Stephen Flynn has been crystal clear than there will be no SNP Lords on his watch.\nAt Westminster this week I was delighted to meet up with the Catalan MEP Clara Ponsatí. Talking about the importance of political leadership and a renewed push for independence she said: “Poor political leadership is our most important problem because self-determination is above all, the task of those who identify with the “self” that aims at determination. As Michael Walzer (the American political theorist) eloquently says: ‘The members of a political community must seek their own freedom, just as the individual must cultivate his own virtue. They cannot be set free, as he cannot be made virtuous, by any external force’.”\nThe SNP should provide the leadership and create the political conditions that will make Scotland a state. This will not happen by further enmeshing ourselves in the UK by entering the House of Lords.\nFinally, we could speculate endlessly on the price of a peerage for an erstwhile SNP MP. But whether it’s a defection to the Tories or merely loss of face, the price is too high. The result of such a monumental U-turn on longstanding SNP policy would be the loss of trust from both our membership and the wider independence movement. Those who helped put SNP MPs in Westminster expect us to maintain a healthy scepticism about the place. An independence of mind if you like. That does not include lining up for peerages. On the day after Burns night, I don’t think I can really put it better than the Bard himself.\n“Ye see yon birkie ca’d a lord,\nWha struts, an’ stares, an’ a’ that,\nTho’ hundreds worship at his word,\nHe’s but a coof for a’ that.\nFor a’ that, an’ a’ that,\nHis ribband, star, an’ a’ that,\nThe man o’ independent mind,\nHe looks an’ laughs at a’ that.”",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_potential-to-upset-peoples-right-to-protest/content_191.html": "Potential to upset should not affect people's right to protest\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 16th Sep 2022\nEarlier this week, I found myself standing on the platform of a packed London tube station, trying to explain to a Tory MP the complexity of the Scots’ feelings towards the late Queen, the monarchy in general and how this relates to the independence question. A thoughtful politician, he understood that support for independence is real and growing but he could not square that with the extraordinary scenes on the streets of Edinburgh, and indeed in rural Scotland, as thousands turned out to pay their respects.\nBecause the Queen chose to die here, Scotland was the centre of the world’s attention for several days. Edinburgh and Scotland shone, and we should be proud of that. The beautiful autumnal sunshine showed our country off in its best light from the splendours of Deeside, through the glens of Angus to the majesty of Edinburgh’s old town. Sombre and dignified, drenched in atmosphere as well as sun, what the world may remember most this week are those scenes. Whatever your views – monarchist or republican – it would be a cold heart that would not be moved by the pageantry and dignity of the occasion. All nations need symbols and ceremonial, what de Gaulle used to call the politics of grandeur.\nWhen I spoke in the House of Commons during the tributes to the Queen, I sought to remind people that the current royal family is a direct descendant of Scotland’s Stuart kings and queens. One of the most poignant moments of the last week was when the ancient crown worn by Mary Queen of Scots was placed on the late Queen Elizabeth’s coffin. These events over the past few days have shown just how important our history and culture is to many Scots.\nI was disappointed when my speech was met with some sour comments. Clearly, some people don’t do subtlety or understand that parliamentary time set aside for tributes to the deceased monarch is not the time for an MP to engage in a republican tirade. We would do well to emulate the generosity of spirit shown by Irish nationalists, such as Speaker Alex Maskey’s (below) comments at Hillsborough Castle on Tuesday.\nThere was, of course, deep hurt felt in 1979 and in 2014 when the Queen was seen to state a personal preference on devolution and independence. But just as banks and financial institutions already operate in different jurisdictions across the world, so too does the monarchy and, despite any resistance to change, both are highly capable of adapting as needed and could do so when Scotland regains its independence. People from all sides of the discourse have spoken about how the Queen was a great form of support and source of encouragement for the Scottish Parliament and MSPs in its early years. She was happy for the first presiding officer, Sir David Steel, to describe her “in the historic and constitutionally correct manner as Queen of Scots”. To be queen of a people, not of a territory, requires a lightness of touch, humanity and humour. As Scots, we are less deferential, but we are warm and affectionate, and people across Scotland did have an affection for the Queen and respect for the way she carried out her role.\nThere are people in the Yes movement who support the monarchy and see our independence as an opportunity to restore the ancient kingdom of Scots with its symbols, dignity and tradition. Many others do not and want to seize the opportunity for a new modern democratic constitution.\nThe pursuit of an independent Scotland and a fully democratic republic are perhaps two sides of the same coin. One would undoubtedly be required to enable the other. It is highly unlikely that if the UK continues in its current form, it will choose a different constitutional set-up in my lifetime. However, the Irish model of an elected national figurehead is a possible option for Scotland, someone who, in many ways, is the cultural head of the nation rather than the political one – a philosopher or a historian, perhaps, or a poet as we have seen lately in Ireland. Someone who can bring inspiration and comfort when needed at times of national importance. However, whilst I am at heart a republican and continue to believe that a future independent Scotland should elect its head of state, the arguments for independence and for a republic remain separate, and as a nation and a movement, we should tackle them one at a time.\nRuth Wishart was right when she said that it would be useful to decouple the constitutional debate (by which she meant the independence debate) from the monarchy about which many Scots hold very different views. Indeed, that has been the policy of the SNP for a long time and was reflected in the tributes from both our current and former leaders. Notwithstanding the respect shown to the monarchy this week, independence will continue to be top of the political agenda in Scotland because of the significant political and social divergence between Scotland and England that has developed over the last 70 odd years.\nRespect for the late Queen and indeed for the monarchy is shared by both those who support Scottish independence and those who do not. Equally, there are republicans on both sides of the constitutional debate, and they must be allowed to make their views known – including by public protest. I am very concerned by the heavy-handed arrests of people who have seen fit to protest this week in the name of republicanism, anti-imperialism or, indeed, disapproval of the behaviour of Prince Andrew. Whilst some might question whether this is the appropriate time for such protests, the right to protest is fundamental to our society and should be facilitated.\nThe founders of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) described freedom of expression as “the touchstone of all freedoms”. The European Court of Human Rights has made clear that: “Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society … it is applicable not only to ‘information’ or ‘ideas’ that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference but also to those that offend, shock or disturb”. A democracy which loses sight of this is in trouble. Unfortunately, both north and south of the Border, we have allowed a degree of authoritarianism to creep into our public life, with police turning up at members of the public’s doors to “check their thinking”.\nNew public order measures in England and Wales and the, as yet not in force, Hate Speech legislation in Scotland could both be subject to legal challenge for violating fundamental ECHR rights including not only freedom of expression but also, freedom of belief.\nThis week, I have spent some time observing a court case in which one charity is trying to have another charity removed from the register because it disagrees with its objectives. It’s an extraordinary attack on the freedoms of belief, expression and association. Shutting down the expression of views with which we disagree is not a path we should go down as a society.\nIt is not surprising that people wanted, quite legitimately, to protest the proclamation of a new king. The fact that that might upset some people does not affect their right so to do. In future, greater care will need to be taken by the police to facilitate the right to protest, particularly during the coronation.",

By processing criminal record checks for individuals who have applied to work in roles where safeguarding considerations apply, the DBS allows organisations to access key information that will assist them in making safer recruiting decisions. The ability of a DBS check to play this role in safeguarding rests entirely on the relevance, completeness and accuracy of the information returned and displayed on the DBS certificate. In December 2003, Ian Huntley was convicted of the murders of two 10-year old girls, Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells. At the time of committing the murders, Huntley had been employed at a local college as a caretaker, a position that facilitated his access to children. Although he had previously come into contact with the police over alleged sexual offences on many occasions, this information had not been disclosed during the vetting check carried out at the time of his appointment. It is no exaggeration to say that the murders of the two girls and the subsequent discovery that Huntley should, and could, have been prevented from taking up the role of caretaker had a profound effect throughout the country. In 2004, following an independent inquiry, the Bichard Inquiry Report was published. This concluded that there had been extensive omissions and failures in the vetting process. Significantly, Huntley had been able to change his name by deed poll to Ian Nixon and the criminal record check he underwent had only been carried out against this new identity. By presenting a new identity, Huntley had successfully severed the link with his existing police records meaning that the records held against the name ‘Ian Huntley’ were not disclosed. Eighteen years later safeguarding loopholes created where applicants submit identity documents for DBS checks that display a new identity remain.\nAlthough the government has acknowledged the safeguarding loophole created where registered sex offenders are able to change their name by deed poll, the ability to change identity in a more fundamental way, by simultaneously changing both name and gender, remains unaddressed. Any individual can easily, and for any reason, change their name and gender on documents commonly used to establish identity via a process of self-declaration. These documents, that include passport and driving licence, can be presented for the purposes of a DBS check and will show the individual’s new name and their acquired gender instead of, and as opposite to, their sex.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_lgb-alliance/content_224.html": "The story of the LGB Alliance should concern us all\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 07th Jul 2023\nIN October 2019, two women organised a meeting to set up a new gay rights organisation. One was a former Stonewall fundraiser; the other had been a founding member of the Gay Liberation Front in the 1970s. Their names are Kate Harris and Bev Jackson and I am proud to call them my friends. Their intention was that their organisation would campaign for the rights of those who are same-sex attracted.\nThose rights are protected under the Equality Act and the Human Rights Act. They are freestanding and not conditional on accepting the belief that gender identity should supplant biological sex. The rights of those who believe in the immutability of sex are protected under the protected characteristic of religion or belief. Equally, the rights of trans people are protected under the protected characteristic of gender re-assignment. There is no hierarchy of rights. Equality and human rights are universal. Both Kate and Bev had become very disillusioned with Stonewall and other organisations originally set up to campaign for gay rights. They were concerned that these organisations had become almost wholly focused on trans rights and would only give voice to gay people who accepted gender identity was more important than sex, and that this was fuelling a new homophobia. They had tried on many occasions to have a dialogue with Stonewall etc about their concerns but they had been rebuffed. So, they set up a new organisation called LGB Alliance.\nToday, I am going to devote my column to telling the story of LGB Alliance. Even if, like me, you are sick of identity politics please read on because this is a cautionary tale of what can happen when there is a concerted attack on the freedom of expression and those with the power to stop it fail to speak out and, worse, participate. It could happen to a cause dear to your heart, maybe our shared endeavour of independence for Scotland, so this is a story which should concern us all.\nWithin 12 hours of its launch, LGB Alliance was branded a hate group by a gender identity campaigner who tweeted: “LGB Alliance is a hate group – pass it on”. This happened before LGB Alliance had made a single public statement and was followed by a flurry of slogans such as: “No LGB without the T”. The implication was clear – all LGB people must campaign for gender identity and think alike, that there are the right sort of gays and the wrong sort of gays – a horrible echo of the past. Some politicians abused parliamentary privilege to make defamatory attacks on LGB Alliance. Many media outlets carried misleading stories about it and refused it a right of reply. Campaigners tried to prevent the organisation from finding space to hold its annual conference. At its first conference, delegates had to cross a picket line of protesters including a straight married MP protesting the right of lesbians to meet and talk about their rights. Again, it felt like going back in time.\nDespite daily attacks on its honesty and integrity, LGB Alliance has grown fast. Thoughtful LGB people around the world welcomed it and many said how excluded they felt from the new “LGBTQIA+ community”, where people whose sexual orientation is exclusively towards the same sex have been derided as “genital fetishists” or compared to racists and antisemites. The abuse was hard for Kate and Bev and their many supporters to endure, particularly as so many of them had fought decades ago for the rights now enjoyed by some of their attackers who were themselves safely in the closet at the time. Also, the constant fight to defend themselves from attack undermined their ability to pursue their wider objective of furthering the case of LGB rights and combating homophobia.\nAllison Bailey, a lesbian barrister who tweeted about the new organisation, found herself the victim of a campaign to take away her livelihood and had to take her Chambers to an employment tribunal. The Arts Council of England withdrew a grant to LGB Alliance to make a film about gay life in Britain during the Queen’s reign and its employees harassed a colleague, Denise Fahmy, who called out the underlying homophobia. Both Allison and Denise won their tribunal claims for discrimination. Yesterday, in another court case, the LGB Alliance had another significant victory when it successfully defended itself against an attempt to have its charitable status removed.\nIn 2021, the Charity Commission accepted LGB Alliance’s application to register as a charity. A virulent campaign to overturn its decision culminated in legal action to have LGB Alliance struck off the register. The case was brought by Mermaids and the Good Law Project. Mermaids is a charity which was set up to support children and young people questioning their gender identity. It fails to countenance the possibility that not everyone who questions their gender identity is trans – and that there could be other reasons for doing so, for example, sexual orientation. It says those of us who do question this are transphobic. We fear that if not actually homophobic, it is encouraging homophobia. A Charity Commission inquiry into Mermaids was launched last year after concerns were identified about its governance and management.\nMermaids’s legal action meant that as the only charity in the UK that stands exclusively for the rights of LGB people, LGB Alliance had to defend its charitable status at a costly six-day tribunal. While the tribunal’s judgment turned on the narrow issue of whether the law gave Mermaids the right to challenge LGB Alliance’s registration as a charity, it held it didn’t. In political terms, this is a major campaigning win for LGB Alliance.\nIt has, however, come at a considerable cost. While Mermaids is a wealthy charity, LGB Alliance has had to rely on small donations from ordinary LGB men and women to fund its case. Its legal fees amount to more than £250,000 – money that would have been better spent on projects such as its helpline for young people, its LGB Archive and its Friends Network. The litigation was also very stressful. Kate broke down in tears under cross-examination about the right of lesbians to be same-sex attracted. On the upside, the case provided a welcome opportunity to talk about the LGB Alliance’s work in a public forum. Media bids flooded in yesterday and the decision is another nail in the coffin of the era of “no debate”.\nIt is to be hoped the Alliance will now enjoy fairer and more balanced coverage. Perhaps it will also mean opponents such as Mermaids will actually have to engage with the arguments. Although – predictably – a witness in the case and a campaigning lawyer from the Good Law Project took to Twitter yesterday to misrepresent the tribunal’s decision.\nThey would do well to pay attention to what the tribunal said, when it quoted the widely respected jurist Lord Bingham: “The fundamental rationale of the democratic process upon which our society is founded is that when competing views, opinions and policies are publicly debated and exposed to public scrutiny, the good will over time drive out the bad and the true will prevail over the false. Only when differing views are expressed, contradicted, answered and debated will the legislature be able to obtain the fullest picture of the views held by those they represent.”\nWe have heard a lot about toxicity in politics this week. On Monday I am due in court, again, to give evidence in a criminal trial about frightening threats made against me. This has become a regular occurrence because of my activism for women’s and lesbian rights and my support for the LGB Alliance. I am glad that the police in Scotland take these threats seriously. Two MPs have been murdered in recent years. To all who complain of toxicity in our politics, I say disagreement and debate is not toxic – abuse and threats are. It should not be hard to tell the difference. The toxicity in our politics will only stop when those who have the privileged platform afforded to them as parliamentarians show leadership and engage with the issues of the day respectfully rather than participating in or condoning the demonisation, intimidation and abuse of those with whom they disagree.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-salmond-yes-candidate-strategy/content_252.html": "SNP must swallow pride and consider Salmond’s Yes candidate strategy\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 09th Jun 2023\nYESTERDAY, this newspaper reported on the anger within the SNP following Keith Brown’s announcement that the convention due to happen later this month won’t decide the party’s official independence strategy. Senior unnamed sources were harsh in their criticism. I was not one of them. Firstly because I prefer to put my name to my views but also because I don’t know why anyone was surprised.\nA “convention” has no status in the party’s constitution. Only conference can make policy decisions.\nIn my opinion, what the SNP should be doing this month is holding the special conference originally scheduled for March of this year to finalise our independence strategy and then focusing on campaigning on the bread-and-butter issues. We need to move away from talking about process and on to explaining to people why we need independence.\nFinalising our strategy won’t now happen until October, which is a pity, but it’s nonetheless vital that we utilise the talking shop on June 24 to explore all options on the table so that the proposals – between which delegates will decide in October – are as well-informed as possible. That is why I think the party should be considering the option put forward in a letter from Alex Salmond to SNP MPs earlier this week.\nThe idea of having a single independence mandate candidate in each parliamentary constituency would offer us a strong opportunity to defeat the Unionist parties by moving them off the ground upon which they will want to fight – SNP difficulties, policy issues at Holyrood – onto the ground on which we want to fight – the argument that things will only change in Scotland with independence. Such a platform would unite all those who support independence under one banner and given that support for independence now outstrips support for the SNP that can only be a good thing for my party.\nIn fact, I don’t see what the SNP would have to lose from Alex Salmond’s proposal. Effectively, our sitting MPs (or our replacements for those standing down) would be the candidates in all 45 seats that we currently hold, badged as “SNP, Scotland United for Independence”. The Alba members would fight the two seats they currently represent. After all, one of them was won by an independence candidate in the first place and as regards to the second, frankly all forecasts show the SNP losing it. The remaining 10 seats would be distributed among SNP, Scottish Greens, Alba and perhaps some independent candidates from the Yes movement, with most of them going to the SNP in recognition of our dominance.\nAs Alex says in his letter “in the lee of the ill-starred venture to the Supreme Court, the referendum route to independence is closed off, for the time being at least”. He was the person who devised the referendum strategy and I agree with him that while it might re-emerge as the way to proceed in the future, recent experience shows that a referendum is unlikely to be achieved by campaigning for it in a General Election. As MP Angus Brendan MacNeil put it, the SNP need to move away from being the referendum request party back to being the independence party.\nI know some of my colleagues will find it very hard to swallow their pride, having participated in attempts to trash Alex’s reputation for the last few years. We saw that in the knee-jerk reaction of at least one to his proposal. However, others will be more thoughtful and acknowledge that in taking the SNP into government and to the brink of success in the independence referendum, Alex has proved himself a master strategist and therefore his proposal is worthy of consideration. Indeed, recent statesmanlike performances on Question Time and Debate Night have been a salutary reminder of what he has to offer to the movement.\nThat said, I do sympathise with SNP MP colleagues who are sick to the back teeth of being slagged off by some Alba members on Twitter simply for doing the job of representing their constituents at Westminster despite that being the very thing they were elected to do. I know how they feel. I don’t usually get the same stick from Alba members, but I am very weary of being slagged off by SNP members and fellow parliamentarians for daring to stick up for the rights of women and lesbians and having some independent minded thoughts on the way forward for the party. It really is time for the nastiness within the independence movement to stop. MPs and MSPs have a responsibility to take the lead on this and show a good example, but truth be told many of the activists are there already.\nWhen I was out campaigning in my constituency last Saturday and signing up people for postal votes, I was doing so under the Yes banner. Often when we do this Alba and SNP members work side by side as comrades and with no problem.\nThere is some congruence between Alex’s plan and what Gerry Hassan called for in his column in this newspaper earlier this week. Now, I think it is fair to say that Gerry is no fan of Alex or indeed of my good self. I understand he thinks I am “not a team player” which is the phrase of choice for those in the movement who don’t believe parliamentarians should think for themselves. I believe the copyright belongs to Ian Blackford. But putting this to one side, I like what Gerry has said on this occasion. He argues that we need to tackle the “lack of progress, detail and momentum” in the independence campaign with genuine cross-party cooperation that transcends the “poisonous divides and spats” to a “new vision”. His idea is a little different in that he advocates setting up a campaign for self-determination that nurtures collaboration across and beyond parties, like the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly did in the 1980s and 1990s rather than focusing on the immediate opportunity afforded by the General Election.\nHowever, I think his idea also has a lot to commend it and while I am not for a moment saying it is the same as Alex Salmond’s idea, what it has in common is a recognition that the SNP alone cannot rejuvenate the cause of independence. I hope that both of these proposals will be on the table at the SNP convention later this month. I want to hear more about both, and I think they should be given very serious consideration. In his letter to SNP MPs Alex says that that idea of the independence parties working together has the support of the movement. I think he is right. He also says there is currently research in the field to establish whether the public would show similar enthusiasm. He has offered to share that data with SNP MPs, and I would be keen to see it before the convention discussions.\nAfter I had finished writing this column, I read that the leadership of the Scottish Greens have rejected working with Alba in any cross-party arrangement. I think this is misguided and out of step with the wider independence movement. I hope they will consult their membership and reconsider.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_uk-must-open-doors-more-refugees-ukraine/content_283.html": "Why UK absolutely MUST open doors to more refugees from Ukraine\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 04th Mar 2022\nFor a brief moment at PMQs this week Boris Johnson told the truth when a Labour MP challenged him on the UK’s inability to guarantee the territorial integrity of Ukraine. While stressing that nobody wants war, Chris Bryant made a fair point by drawing a contrast with the energy and sacrifice expended when Belgium and Poland were similarly invaded in the first half of the 20th century.\nThe PM replied that the stark reality is that no country in the west is going to afford the Ukrainians direct military assistance because the consequences of a direct confrontation between western countries and Russia would “not be easy to control”. Everyone in the chamber knew what he meant. Despite the spontaneous outpouring of support for the Ukrainian Ambassador in the gallery above us, people are rightly terrified of an escalated conflict and the threat of nuclear war. Chris Bryant urged swifter and more exacting enforcement of sanctions and he was right to do so. The other thing that the UK must do is much more to help the soon to be millions of people displaced by Russia’s war of aggression.\nYesterday the UN reported that already one million people have fled Ukraine. This is predicted to increase to 4 million. In the face of those figures what the UK has promised so far is woefully inadequate. And it wasn’t long before Boris was back to telling porkies again when he claimed that the UK had taken more vulnerable people fleeing theatres of conflict since 2015 than any other country in Europe. This is simply not true. Germany took in more in a single year in 2019 (70,000) than the UK did in 6 years from 2015 to 2020 (66,000). So, let’s stop with the lies and the hyperbole about Britain’s proud record.\nThe consequences of the conflict in Ukraine could dwarf any refugee crisis Europe has seen since the Second World War. For the UK to play a proper part in tackling it will take a sea change in Tory policies. As the expert immigration lawyer Colin Yeo said earlier this week, UK refugee policy is not just woefully inadequate to the scale of this particular crisis but it is isolationist and cruel.\nThat cruelty was exemplified in Junior home office Minister Kevin Foster’s tweet suggesting Ukrainian refugees could come to the Uk if they were prepared to pick fruit. This arrogant fool should have got the sack for his tweet but the truth is he takes his lead from his boss Priti Patel, who was at her snarling worst when the SNP’s refugee and asylum policy expert Stuart McDonald took her inadequate plans apart in the Commons this week.\nWhat’s really needed is to get rid of Priti and co, tear up what’s gone before and install a pragmatic humanist in the Home office. Maybe David Davis? Unlikely but he was one of a group of senior Tories who wrote to Boris Johnson warning that the policy underlying the anti-refugee Nationality and Borders Bill is dangerous and would see the UK significantly breach key international obligations. The senior Tories were joined by 1000 faith leaders representing the six major faiths across the UK who begged the PM not to close the door on refugees.\nThe crisis in Ukraine shows that the UK government must change course and more and more people are realising that. While many including the Scottish Refugee Council graciously welcomed Patel’s relaxation of visa requirements for extended family members of Ukrainians living in the UK and a new sponsorship programme, they are right to say these measures don’t go nearly far enough. As Stuart McDonald argued in the House of Commons this week the UK needs to emulate the EU by waiving visa requirements for Ukrainians. This would do away with the sort of red tape that has seen the parents of one of my constituents, having escaped the fighting, stranded in a third country while their paper visas for the UK sit in Lviv in the visa application centre.\nPriti Patel has fallen back on unexplained security concerns to justify taking a different approach to our European neighbours. But, as Stuart also pointed out, when you think of the UK’s open land border with the Republic of Ireland which is taking a far more generous approach, this explanation doesn’t really add up. And, while the humanitarian sponsorship pathway could be a welcome addition, such schemes are notoriously slow. Furthermore, they must not be a way for the UK Government to shuffle its responsibilities off onto cash strapped local authorities and community groups.\nThe much maligned House of Lords realises that big changes are needed. In a string of defeats for the UK Government this week their lordships have removed some of the most egregious parts of the Nationality and Borders Bill including the criminalisation of asylum seekers and plans for offshore processing. Peers also voted for amendments laying a path for unaccompanied children in Europe to be reunited with family in the UK when they claim asylum, for an annual refugee resettlement commitment of 10,000 and for a new safe route for people to have their claim for asylum in the UK received and considered overseas when under risk of genocide. And in a huge victory for campaigners from Maryhill Integration. the Lords also voted to lift the ban on asylum seekers working.\nAt the very least these changes to the bill must be preserved when it returns to the Commons. It would be horrifying if in the midst of the current crisis the Commons were to pass legislation that would criminalise Ukrainians who arrive here seeking asylum outside the limited schemes announced by Priti Patel. Tory MPs have a moral responsibility to quell the moral panic about the number of asylum seekers crossing the channel to come to the UK. The evidence heard by the Joint Committee on Human Rights last year was that Greece, Italy, and Spain have all received many more such arrivals in recent years. The UN reports that in 2020, Italy had around 34,000 sea arrivals, Spain 40,000, and Greece 10,000, compared to the UK's 8,500.\nYou don’t need a visa to seek asylum and asylum seekers must not be criminalised. But the focus must now be on creating more safe, legal routes so that the UK’s response to this humanitarian disaster goes some way to atone for our inability to stop it from happening.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_groundwork-scottish-independence-laid-without-delay/content_255.html": "The groundwork for independence should be laid without delay\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 21st May 2021\nI want to start this column with a big thank you to all the National readers, columnists and journalists who sent me good wishes after I announced my intention to take time off to focus on my health. I’m glad to have made a return to public duties.\nIt seems not much has changed while I’ve been away. It's business as usual at Holyrood with another pro-independence majority, albeit with an increase of 3 seats, and it's business as usual at Westminster. The Queen’s Speech reminded us that the UK Tory Government’s priorities are miles away from those of most Scots. Their new legislative programme is far removed from what is needed to tackle the inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic, or to ‘build back better’. As we saw on Kenmure street, their policies on immigration and refugees continue to appal and it all takes place against a background of dodgy lobbying, dodgy procurement and flagrant Ministerial conflicts of interest.\nAnd so the case for independence is reinforced. But it really is time to put a bit more meat on the bones of what an independent Scotland would look like and to have answers ready for the big questions that not just the media, but voters, will quite reasonably ask during a second independence campaign. So I hope that from now on the independence debate will be more about policy than process. During the election campaign the First Minister indicated that the Growth Commission report needs to be revisited and, that, following on Brexit and the pandemic, there is work to be done on the economic case for independence, the timetable for Scotland’s accession to the EU and how we handle cross border trade with the rest of the UK. I look forward to hearing who the FM will put in charge of getting this work done before the next independence referendum campaign starts and I hope to be able to make a useful contribution.\nThe death of an otherwise fit and healthy young woman from Covid earlier this week shows that the FM is right to put managing the pandemic and Covid Recovery at the top of her list, but there ought to be space for others in the cabinet to lay the groundwork for indyref2 without further delay.\nThat tragic death amidst a spike in the virus in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, also underlines why, from a public health point of view, it was so completely unacceptable that, for the second time this year, a section of the Rangers fanbase were able to run amok in our second city committing acts of vandalism and violence and abusing their fellow countrymen and women. The police said the violence they witnessed was some of the worst seen in twenty years. The concern felt is not confined to Glasgow. My inbox was swelled this week with emails from horrified Edinburgh South West constituents and members of the Irish and the Catholic communities from across Scotland who have had enough of being the object of such venomous bile.\nThese correspondents are concerned not just about the scale of the disorder and the fact that it happened in violation of Covid restrictions, again, but also about the foul abuse directed against members of the Irish and the Catholic communities and the vandalism and intimidation that occurred at Catholic churches across the city and beyond. This behaviour disgraces our country. At a time when Scotland is looking to take its place on the world stage, it is imperative that this bigotry and racism is addressed, particularly as the racism is directed against one of our most important European allies. There is also the risk that Scotland’s reputation will suffer serious damage internationally if this emboldened anti-Catholic hatred seeks to manifest itself during the planned visit of His Holiness Pope Francis to the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\nI am not alone in being struck by the contrast between the policing of these fans and other groups in our society. That contrast is so stark that it is reasonable to ask whether the principle of equality before the law is being respected by Police Scotland. Earlier this year a woman was visited by police to be warned off after chalking an inoffensive political slogan. Recently, I had brought to my attention the case of another woman who was phoned by police and ordered to present herself at a police station under threat that if she did not do so she would be arrested, and her children taken into care, because someone had taken offence at a tweet. The apparent difference in approach between the policing of these women and the policing of football fans engaging in the foulest and most objectionable abuse of our fellow citizens of Irish and Catholic descent, should give any reasonable person pause for thought.\nIn the course of the last parliament we heard a lot about the importance of tackling hate crime. Statistics regularly show that the Catholic community bears a disproportionate burden of religiously aggravated hate crime, yet this did not seem to be an issue on which the debate was focused. I hope that will now change.\nIt was good to see what happened raised in an Urgent Question at Holyrood this week and to note the almost universal disapproval, but the debate was rather brief. Far more light needs to be shone on why the situation in Glasgow last Saturday was allowed to get so out of control, particularly given its foreseeability. We need to know why the police appear to be following a different approach to the policing of women’s speech and the policing of football fans, and we need to know what steps the Scottish Government will be taking during this parliament to tackle the specific problems of anti-Irish and anti-Catholic bigotry in our society.\nAs past experience and the failed Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act shows, these problems are not going to be easy to solve. Deep structural change is needed, and I don’t mean getting rid of Catholic schools or any other sort of victim blaming. Yes, poverty and alienation play their part in this story but there’s more to it than that. It’s time to ask why our society tolerates marches by organisations hostile to Catholics, routed past Catholic churches and designed to render parts of our cities and towns no go areas for Catholics.\nI declare an interest as someone who is half Irish and brought up in the Catholic tradition, but if this behaviour was directed at any other religion or indeed any other minority in our society it would be considered intolerable. It’s time to make the promise of equality real for all.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_the-brexit-deal-vote/content_55.html": "So much has been thrown under the bus to achieve one Tory aim\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 30th Dec 2020\nYesterday’s debate in parliament was a historic event and the SNP were right to take a full part in it and to vote against the bill designed to implement Boris Johnson’s deal into domestic law.\nIt wasn’t hard for us to reach the unanimous decision that we would vote against the bill. Scotland’s Government and its representatives were cut out of the negotiations that led to the deal implemented by the bill and therefore, unsurprisingly, our country’s interests are not served by it. The bill grants sweeping powers to the British Government without proper parliamentary scrutiny and threatens to make yet further inroads into devolved competences. Our heads would need to zip up the back for us to agree to own this mess. Even the Scottish Labour party can see that, apart from the ignominious Ian Murray.\nYesterday’s vote was not a meaningful vote on the deal because the Westminster parliament for all its glorious sovereignty does not have the power to overturn the agreement Boris Johnson has reached with the EU. One of the first things he did when he got his majority was to re-table the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill having removed the provisions which committed the Government to giving parliament a final vote on the deal. This restored the default position that the UK parliament has no power to ratify or reject international treaties. That power lies with the Government who consult parliament only by a convention given statutory force in the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010.\nThe argument that by voting against the bill SNP MPs voted for No Deal is legally and constitutionally illiterate. These are not my words but those of expert commentators Luke Cooper and Sam Fowles of the London School of Economics. I was disappointed not to get selected to speak at Westminster yesterday where I would have made this point, so I was pleased to hear Mike Russell make it clear in what was a memorable speech in the Scottish Parliament yesterday.\nWhat MPs were voting on was not whether to approve the deal but whether to give the British Government the powers necessary to implement the deal in domestic law. If a majority had voted against the bill it wouldn’t have stopped the government from ratifying the deal. So, let’s knock on the head once and for all that the principled stand of SNP MPs risked a no deal Brexit.\nI also respectfully disagree with those who argue that SNP MPs should have abstained or stayed away. I toyed with the idea of abstention early on, before I concluded that yesterday’s vote was about what opposition parties thought of the deal achieved rather than avoiding the chaos of no deal. It is a bad deal for the UK and Scotland. There is very little in it for our service economy, it will damage trade and cost jobs and research shows that, as usual with Tory ideology, it is the poorest who will suffer most. As Philippa Whitford said in her speech yesterday, we now see how the promises of the Leave campaign compare with reality. While tariff free access to the single market has been secured, contrary to Johnson’s lies, non-tariff barriers have been erected meaning manufacturers and farmers will have to deal with time consuming and bureaucratic checks at borders for things like customs, and plant and animal health.\nContrary to the sea of opportunity promised by Gove, analysis by the Scottish Government shows that for some key stocks UK fishing communities now face a worse deal than they had under the Commons Fisheries Policy. Even the pro-Brexit Scottish Fishermen’s’ Federation says the deal “falls very far short’ of what was promised.\nAnd on security, Priti Patel told a flat out lie when she said that the deal makes the UK safer. As a third country, the UK has lost access to key databases including the SIS II which allows for real-time sharing of data relating to wanted or missing persons or objects. Evidence to parliamentary committees showed that the UK police forces consulted this source 600 million times in 2019. All these interests were thrown under the bus to gain the prize of leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Except under the Northern Ireland Protocol, where the ECJ still has a say on matters such as state aid with some reach into the UK.\nFurthermore, the Brexit process revealed that the antipathy towards the court wasn’t just rooted in xenophobia, but in a more general antipathy to fundamental rights and the rule of law. This has not gone unnoticed by the EU who have insisted on a clause in the deal allowing them to suspend the part covering Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters if the UK fails to sufficiently protect fundamental rights or the rule of law. Watch this space.\nThe EU have done an excellent job looking after the interests of their member states including those of Ireland. The contrast with the UK Government’s capitulation on their red lines and their total failure to look after Scottish interests is striking.\nEndorsing the SNP’s principled vote Dr Kirsty Hughes of the Scottish Centre for European Relations said that the “EU understands very well, and agrees, that staying in the EU or a closer relationship was preferable and that putting up barriers is damaging. There is plenty of sympathy for Scotland.” Charles Grant, the director of the Centre for European Reform said, “If Scotland were to gain independence through legal means, and then seek membership, most EU leaders would be delighted.” Ian Blackford ended his speech yesterday by saying; “There is now an empty seat at the top table in Europe. It will not be empty for long.”\nPolitics in Scotland in 2021 will be dominated by the question of how we get there.\nNext month SNP members will meet at a National Assembly to consider a plan of action if Boris Johnson continues to refuse a section 30 order. I have already suggested how the legal route might be further explored with a bill crafted by the Scottish Government. Others wish to see a plebiscite election considered and I hope this will also be discussed.\nI believe what is now required is a multi-faceted strategy to pressurise the British Government into co-operating with us to ensure that the people of Scotland are afforded a means to reconsider the option of independence in such a way that the outcome will be internationally recognised.\nMany, including most recently Prof John Curtice, have talked about the possibility of SNP MPs participating in parliamentary disruption if a section 30 order is refused after the Holyrood election. Whilst I respectfully disagree with the suggestion that SNP MPs should boycott Westminster at this stage, (because we are not elected on an abstentionist platform and have constituents who expect us to participate), I agree with Kenny MacAskill that we need to think about how our parliamentary tactics might change.\nMy participation in the struggle to protect women’s sex-based rights over the last two years has reminded me of the slogan - Deeds not Words. It’s a motto we in the SNP would do well to adopt in 2021.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_caledonian-brewery-to-close/content_95.html": "Caledonian Brewery to close\nThere was sad news this morning that the last brewery in Edinburgh is set to close with the loss of 30 jobs. This would mean that there will be no brewers in Edinburgh pending the construction of the proposed new Innis and Gunn brewery at Heriot-Watt.\nCommenting on the announcement local MP Joanna Cherry QC said:\n\"I am shocked to hear of these proposals by Heineken and the loss of skilled brewing jobs for the city is greatly concerning. Retaining brands by outsourcing production under licence to Bellhaven/Green King in East Lothian is no substitute for the loss of jobs and the heritage of brewing in Edinburgh. I am calling on the company to think again. Edinburgh has a proud history of brewing and a fantastic stream of highly qualified graduates from Heriot-Watt's international centre for Brewing and Distilling.\"\nHeineken announced that they plan to close the Caledonian Brewery in Slateford with the potential loss of 30 jobs. The brewer has announced that they will enter a 30-day consultation on redundancies with staff and their trade union representatives. I have been in touch with Unite to offer my support and contacted Skills Development Scotland to ensure that early support from PACE will be offered.\nHeineken intends to enter into an agreement with Green King to brew their Caledonian brands, Deuchars, Coast to Coast and Maltsmiths IPA and Lager under licence at the Green King Belhaven brewery in Dunbar, East Lothian.\nThe Heineken announcement explained that over the last decade, production of cask beer at Caledonian Brewery has steadily declined as they have evolved their portfolio and that the Victorian Caledonian brewery has significant inefficiencies and costs associated with operating the site, especially when the brewery is operating at lower capacity. To modernise the brewing operations, and meet their sustainability commitments would require considerable ongoing investment, and makes operating the brewery economically unviable.\nThe company go on to say that they have not taken the decision lightly and have spent considerable time exploring a number of options to address the challenges faced and to keep the brewery in operation, including looking for a buyer to take over the site and to continue to operate it as a brewery. But have been unable to find a viable option to sell the brewery as a going concern and the proposal now is to close the brewery.",

There is no going back. The current frenetic activity taking place in Brussels and London is only about the terms of our future relationship with the EU. We left the EU on 31 January and entered a transition period where we remain in the single market and customs union without voting rights until midnight on 31 December. The time for seeking an extension of the transition period is long past. The only thing left to be decided is whether we leave the transition period with or without a deal governing the future relationship.\nIf there is a deal MPs will be asked to choose between that deal and the prospect of leaving with No Deal. That vote will neither be an endorsement of nor an opportunity to stop Brexit. Brexit is history. Scotland now needs to decide what to do about that.\nAs regards Northern Ireland a solution appears to have been found but the details are being kept under wraps. That said, the headline news is one that can be used to Scotland’s advantage.\nAccording to Michael Gove, businesses in Northern Ireland will “enjoy the best of both worlds: access to the single market and at the same time unfettered access to the rest of the UK market’. Well who knew? Presumably this means there is no reason that an independent Scotland in the EU could not also have the best of both worlds – access to both the single market and the rest of the UK market. No hard border. No infrastructure on the border. Only the ‘light touch, minimal checks’ of which Michael Gove is so proud. Well we shall see. But the Tories must never again be allowed to get away with claiming Scottish independence means a hard border with England is inevitable.\nThe agreement reached regarding the border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK means that the international law-breaking clauses can be removed from the Internal Market Bill. But this does not mean that damage has not been done. It is now known across Europe and internationally that this British Government are prepared to break their word on an international treaty in order to get their own way. Of course, we knew that this Government were prepared to break their word in Scotland already—and, for that matter, so did the Irish—but now everyone knows it across Europe and the world, including the new American Administration.\nRegaining the trust of the EU member states and re-establishing the UK’s reputation will take a long time. Even sensible Tories realise this hence the fury of many Tory grandees in the Lords even some who were pro Brexit.\nBut to adapt an old Irish Nationalist phrase, England’s difficulty here could be Scotland’s opportunity. We already know that there is much greater international sympathy towards Scotland’s desire for independence than there was in 2014 as a result of the British Government’s Brexit antics. Now is the time for us to build on the work already done by the Scottish Government and SNP MPs with a major diplomatic offensive to secure some significant diplomatic gains from all that goodwill. The opportunity should also be taken to reiterate that Scotland is not a region of the UK seeking to secede but an ancient nation which entered into a union with England and in seeking to leave that union merely seeks to regain its statehood. The narrative needs to change and now is the perfect time when we have receptive ears.\nI meet regularly with diplomatic missions in London and have seen how things have changed. This was reinforced earlier this week when Dr Philippa Whitford gave evidence to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on EU Affairs and impressed her audience of Irish parliamentarians with an eloquent exposition of Scotland’s position on Brexit and the real implications for our industries including fishing.\nWhat of the UK Parliament? To their credit members of the House of Lords, as well as amending the Internal Market Bill to take out the law-breaking parts, also amended it to remove or ameliorate the power grab on devolution. The deadlock with the Commons over these amendments continues but ultimately what the UK Government wants will prevail. Lord Hope, former Lord President of the Court of Session and Depute President of the UK Supreme court and a unionist, said that initially when he heard SNP politicians talking about a power-grab he thought it was hyperbole but after reading the bill he agreed.\nLike the SNP, the majority of peers in the House of Lords saw through the Tory lie that Holyrood is getting new powers. They identified that Westminster is getting sole control over state aid and in order to enforce the Internal Market UK Ministers are getting an explicit power to cut across decision making by the Scottish parliament in a whole range of devolved areas from education to building regulations.\nWhat we are seeing here is a rebalancing of the constitutional settlement in so far as devolution is concerned. The delineation of Donald Dewar’s scheme for devolution with its clarity – where everything which isn’t reserved to Westminster is devolved to Holyrood- is to go. So, what are Labour doing to preserve Donald Dewar’s legacy? It is to their eternal shame that, earlier this week, whilst Gordon Brown was howling at the moon about federalism they sat on their hands and abstained on the Lords amendments to prevent the hollowing out of the devolution settlement by enabling Westminster to spend in devolved areas bypassing the Scottish Parliament which is elected by the people of Scotland to control these things. What a way for the handmaidens of the Vow to behave. No wonder they are finished in Scotland.\nThe changes to the devolved settlement being made under cover of Brexit fly in the face of the promise of greater powers for the Scottish parliament which helped secure a No vote in the Independence Referendum of 2014 and on which Michael Gove and others doubled down during the Brexit referendum campaign. It is a disgrace that Brexit, something Scotland did not vote for, is being used to undermine devolution, something Scots did vote for and in huge numbers.\nWhat does it matter to Westminster that on the 7th of October all parties in the Scottish Parliament (apart from the Scottish Conservatives obviously) voted to reject this Bill. We knew already that the Sewell convention which is supposed to prevent Westminster legislating in devolved areas without the permission of the Scottish Parliament is not worth the paper it was written on.\nThe Brexit process has told Scottish voters a lot about the reality of devolution. It has confirmed, if it were ever in doubt, that power devolved is power retained. And that the United Kingdom is not the Union of equals that we were told about during the 2014 independence referendum but a unitary state where devolved power is taken back to Westminster by executive fiat when convenient.\nScotland does not lead the UK but rather must follow where England wishes to go, whether we like it or not.\nThe good news is that 15 opinion polls in a row show that voters in Scotland now realise what has happened and they don’t like it. The reality is that what happens at Westminster is increasingly irrelevant to the debate in Scotland. So, before long it will be Scotland’s turn to take back control. When and how Scotland does so should not be at the say so of Westminster but at the say so of the sovereign people of Scotland.",

The discriminatory and restrictive environment, the climate of fear and the lack of accountability for the wide range of violations documented by the experts in the present report make it impossible for women and girls to exercise their rights, restrains all persons and organisations from defending them, and emboldens further abuses. The pattern of large-scale systematic violations of women's and girls' fundamental rights in Afghanistan, abetted by the Taliban's discriminatory and misogynistic policies and harsh enforcement methods, constitutes gender persecution and an institutionalised framework of gender apartheid.'\nEarlier this week I helped launch 'Shattering Women's Rights, Shattering Lives', a cross-party parliamentary report which chronicles the oppression of women and girls in Afghanistan and Iran and makes some recommendations about what the world and the UK Government can do to tackle it. The authors of the parliamentary report share the concerns expressed to the UN Human Rights Council. We hope that our recommendations, ranging from enshrining gender apartheid as an internationally recognised crime to the provision of humanitarian visas for Afghan women to come to the UK, will be listened to and acted upon. If not by this UK Government, then by the next.\nWhoever that government is, they will also have a big task closer to home.\nLast month the UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, Reem Alsalem, completed a 10-day visit to the UK. The findings in her preliminary report show that we cannot be complacent when it comes to the protection of women's rights in the UK, including in Scotland.\nMs Alsalem found that 'entrenched patriarchy at almost every level of society, combined with a rise in misogyny that permeates the physical and online world, is denying thousands of women and girls across the UK the right to live in safety, free from fear and violence ... A woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK, one in 30 women in the UK are raped or sexually assaulted each year and four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime.'\nWe have heard a lot of outrage recently about high-profile murders but where is the outrage about all these other murdered women and the shocking overall statistics? Those of us who have worked in sectors which seek to combat violence against women and girls ('VAWG') know that more is needed.\nAccording to Reem Alsalem, while governments across the UK have high ideals, their ability to realise the full potential of their legislation and policies on violence against women is undermined by a number of factors. These include the antipathy of the UK Government towards its international human rights obligations; its general hostility towards human rights, particularly those of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees; and the fragmentation of policies on male violence against women and girls across devolved and non-devolved areas.\nMore is required to translate the political recognition of the scale of violence against women and girls into action. Reem recommends a bringing together of all the different legislative and programmatic strands of intervention on the issue, upgrading and formalising responsibility for discrimination and violence against women and girls in government, anchoring it in human rights commitments, improving co-ordination between all parts of government and with civil society, and committing sufficient resources to translate legislative aspirations into action.\nRather than lumping in women and girls who make up over 50% of the population with 'equalities' briefs, she wants to see the creation of a Ministry for Women and Equality with a separate cabinet minister and brief.\nShe also expressed concern about the degree to which the burden of fighting VAWG is falling on grassroots organisations and specialised frontline service providers working with women and girls who fall through the cracks, and are not covered by statutory service providers. Such organisations face a struggle to survive in the context of rising living costs, a deepening housing crisis and a critical lack of funding.\nShe was particularly scathing about the UK Government's policy of NRPF - no recourse to public funds for migrants - which has accelerated situations of destitution, homelessness and vulnerability for many migrant women and girls. She recommends its immediate abolition.\nReem also highlighted the long-standing lack of adequate disaggregated data, including by sex, gender, ethnicity and disability, and the emphasis on sex - and gender-neutral approaches in the design and implementation of interventions as key challenges hampering effective monitoring and progress.\nHer report reminds everyone that discrimination on the grounds of sex and sexual orientation are prohibited in international law. There are times where it will be necessary, legitimate, and proportionate to give primacy to rights based on sex - and for such considerations to be reflected in current and future policy and legislation, including on self-identification of gender identity, health care, and hate speech.\nIn a week that has seen the publication of the Angiolini Inquiry into the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard and the announcement of a public inquiry into the botched investigation into Emma Caldwell's murder, who could possibly doubt that Reem Alsalem is right in her conclusions. When it appears that misogyny and a lack of respect for women so permeates the very institutions meant to protect us then we have a problem.\nOn Tuesday evening I attended an 'in conversation' event with Doreen Lawrence to mark IWD. Her persistence in fighting for justice for her murdered son, Stephen Lawrence, led to a public inquiry that made a finding of institutionalised racism in the Metropolitan police.\nI believe that the backlash against the rights of women and girls is so serious in the UK right now that we are in danger of seeing institutionalised misogyny. While there can be no comparison with the plight of women in Afghanistan or Iran, the root of our oppression at home is the same - the desire to control and silence women.\nWhether that desire comes from a twisted version of religion or a twisted belief that the rights of men or any other group should be placed above the rights of women, we must be vigilant to make sure these desires do not become embedded in our institutions. There is no hierarchy of rights. Human rights are universal and today, more than ever, the rights of women merit some attention.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_snp-nec-independence-not-personal-vendettas/content_210.html": "Being on SNP’s NEC should be about independence, not personal vendettas\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 25th Sep 2020\nYesterday was the first anniversary of the UK Government’s defeat in the Supreme Court in the prorogation case. Recent events suggest that for this Tory Government law breaking is habit forming. Lady Hale has had a crack at them again this week over the Internal Market Bill telling Times Radio that any judge must uphold the law whether domestic or international.\nAt Westminster this week SNP MPs led the attacks on the Internal Market Bill. My Justice team took aim at the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General for remaining in their posts despite the resignation of the Tories’ Scottish Law Officer, the Advocate General, who said that he found it increasingly difficult to reconcile his obligations as a Law Officer with the Government’s policy intentions.\nOn Wednesday the Brexit select committee took evidence on the bill from Catherine Barnard, Professor of European Law at the University of Cambridge. She was crystal clear that while the UK parliament may be sovereign under domestic law this does not impact on the rules of international law and Articles 26 and 27 of the Vienna Convention mean that international legal obligations take precedence.\nIn response to my questions she explained that there is also a strong argument that the bill puts the UK in breach of their duty of good faith in Article 5 of the Withdrawal Agreement, which they signed less than a year ago, even before the powers in the bill are used. This evidence was so damaging that one of the Tories on the committee who had forgotten to mute her microphone was heard to say “Are we still on Joanna Cherry. 20 minutes. It’s unacceptable.” Such moments make great reality TV. They also show that the Tories think the SNP MPs at Westminster should be seen and not heard particularly when they are eliciting evidence from an independent legal expert about the illegality of the Government’s actions.\nArmed with this great ammunition Stuart McDonald, our shadow Attorney General, and I were ready to have a go at Suella Braverman, the Attorney General, at her question session yesterday. She has justified her support for the Internal Market Bill by reference to the English legal doctrine of the supremacy of parliament and the judgment of the UK Supreme Court in the case Gina Miller took against the UK Government in 2017 where it was held that the triggering of Article 50 required an Act of Parliament. In that case the Supreme Court said that to be binding in domestic law, treaty obligations require to be enshrined in an Act of parliament. However, they also said that treaties between sovereign states (such as the EU Withdrawal Agreement between the UK and the EU) have effect in international law and are not governed by the domestic law of any state. They were quite clear that such treaties are binding on the UK under international law regardless of domestic law. I was curious why the Attorney General had omitted reference to this part of the Miller judgment in her legal opinion, particularly as lawyers are under a professional duty not to selectively cite case law.\nOf course, there was no good answer to my question, so she chose to get personal implying that I was a hypocrite to raise issues about the rule of law and breaching the rules. She suggested that I should direct my “anger closer to home: towards her SNP colleagues and those who sit on the National Executive Committee, who, as we speak, appear to be changing the rules to prevent her exclusively from standing as an MSP? Breaking the rules, the SNP could write the textbook on it!”\nI took a point of order to correct some of the things she got wrong but as readers of the National know it was impossible for me to correct what she said about the NEC because it is true. It is deeply aggravating to be undermined like this by the party’s ruling body when scrutinising this law-breaking Tory Government but unfortunately, this is not first time I have found myself undermined by the actions of some members of the current NEC.\nIt is already in the public domain that this time last year when I was on the verge of winning the prorogation case in the Supreme Court, members of the NEC attempted to have me deselected as an MP, in anticipation of the snap general election, despite my record and the fact that I had already passed vetting. This attempt took place at a meeting which I, as a member of the NEC, was prevented from attending. Members of the NEC are usually afforded the facility of joining meetings by conference call when it is not possible for them to travel to the venue, which can be anywhere in Scotland, but on this occasion I was informed by SNP HQ that this facility would not be available.\nDuring the General Election campaign briefing against me from NEC sources continued. This was upsetting not just for me but also for the SNP activists who were working hard in winter weather to have me re-elected as an SNP MP rather than sitting at home briefing unionist newspapers against SNP candidates.\nIt was this sort of behaviour that led me not to seek re-election to the NEC at last year’s conference. This year’s elections should be imminent. In terms of the SNP Constitution National Conference is the supreme governing and policy making body of the party. It meets as Annual Conference once a year and as National Conference on at least one other occasion a year on dates and at a place fixed by the National Executive Committee. The bulk of NEC members come up for re-election at conference. We have not as yet had a conference this year and of course the pandemic makes the usual conference impossible. However, it is over time that members were told when the much-promised online conference will take place so that they can register as delegates and ensure they are able to vote. I would hope that they would consider replacing those who are bringing the party into disrepute by using their position on the NEC to conduct personal vendettas or to clear the field of competition for their own candidacy bids or those of their friends. What we need on our NEC are members whose only priorities are the furtherance of the cause of independence, our country, its people and the party.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_human-rights-of-bame-people-and-eunice-olumide/content_238.html": "Scotland should consider black heritage centre\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 10th Jul 2020\nLater today I will be taking part in the online annual Human Rights conference organised by the all-party campaign group Justice and joining a panel reflecting on a keynote address by Sandie Okoro, the General Counsel and Senior Vice President of the World Bank. She will talk about her journey from black schoolgirl in South London to law school and a stellar global career in legal and financial services. Naturally, she will talk about the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThe stark reality of the difference between black lives and white lives in the UK was brought to our attention again earlier this week when English athlete and Commonwealth Games medallist Bianca Williams accused the Metropolitan Police of racial profiling after the car in which she was travelling was stopped and searched while she and her partner were handcuffed. After initially robustly defending their officers the Metropolitan police have climbed down and reported themselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and Ms Williams has received an apology.\nThis is just one of a number of recent high-profile incidents in which young black professionals driving high performance cars have been stopped and searched while going about their lawful business in London.\nEarlier this week Baroness Doreen Lawrence OBE was giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) and I asked her about these incidents. Sadly, she is of the view that despite the fallout from the botched police investigation into the racist murder of her son, Stephen Lawrence, when it comes to police on the beat in London, nothing much has changed, and racial stereotyping is still rife.\nThe current JCHR inquiry is looking at the unequal protection of Black people’s human rights in the UK. We also recognise that in relation to policing many of the issues young black men face are also experienced by young Muslim people. In particular, the committee is seeking to understand why recommendations from numerous reports produced on the inequalities faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people in our society have not been implemented by the UK Government nor resulted in lasting change.\nOne particular question we are looking at is whether the Human Rights Act has been effective in protecting Black people’s rights since it came into force in 2000. There is concerning evidence that the BAME community do not have confidence in the human rights protections which are supposed to be there to safeguard everyone in our society. Unpublished research from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) carried out in 2018 found that people from an ethnic minorities and Muslims were less likely to say that human rights work well for ethnic minorities or people of different religious beliefs, compared with Christians or white people.\nOne possible explanation for this is the lack of a bespoke public body dedicated to campaigning for racial equality and human rights, with an oversight function and empowered to take enforcement action. If such a body existed, it would be less easy for the UK Government to cynically set up endless reviews in order to diffuse legitimate anger and then to sweep their recommendations under the carpet. It may have been a mistake to get rid of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) which previously had these functions.\nWhilst we have the EHRC, their budget and staff numbers have been substantially cut and there is a widespread view that they have not been able to do what the CRE was able to do in relation to race and that they lack the grassroots contacts. Not surprisingly, given her experiences, Doreen Lawrence was more cynical. She said that people in authority don’t like to talk about race. They prefer to cloak discussion in the catch-all term of ‘diversity’. Society needs to listen to the experiences of Sandie Okoro, Bianca Williams and Doreen Lawrence. Three strong black women from South London who have stood their ground and fought for equality before the law and human rights for black people.\nThis week I met with another strong black woman, this time from Edinburgh South West, who is campaigning to tackle racial inequality and prejudice. Eunice Olumide, MBE is an international supermodel, fashion designer, DJ, actress, broadcaster and ambassador for good causes. She was born in Wester Hailes, brought up in the Calders and went to Balerno High School. She holds dual Scottish and Nigerian citizenship and she is on a mission to ensure that BAME people are better understood and respected and to tackle discrimination.\nEunice has produced a five-point plan to make sure this happens.\nHer plan includes setting up the first ever BME heritage museum in Scotland and finding space in central London for a fitting monument to the contribution made by the Afro-Caribbean community to British society. She has launched an African Diaspora Business Support Fund and she is seeking funding to direct her first short film on race relations in Scotland.\nHer fifth request is being advanced through a petition to the Scottish Parliament urging the Scottish Government to make sure that pupils in our schools learn about Afro-Scottish Caribbean history and the contribution that community has made to Scottish and British society. The Scottish Curriculum for Excellence is not prescriptive, and teachers have the freedom to teach about black history – but what would be good would be to make sure they have the resources to do so effectively.\nEunice’s campaign will help achieve this and chimes with the One Scotland strategy introduced by the Scottish Government in 2008 and with the Race Equality Framework for Scotland. Above all her campaign is about giving black and white children positive black role models as a major tool in the fight to tackle racism.\nWhilst the Scottish Government has a better record than the UK Government on these matters there is no room for complacency and Eunice Olumide’s campaign is an important contribution to the debate about how Scotland responds to the Black Lives Matter movement.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_tories-scotland-human-rights-act/content_290.html": "Tories will trample over Scotland to take teeth out of Human Rights Act\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Feb 2022\nLast week I wrote about the Tories plans to water down the Human Rights Act. The implications for Scotland are stark. The Joint Committee of Human Rights (JCHR) at Westminster took evidence on this last year. We heard from Judith Robertson, the Chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, who reminded us that the Human Rights Act (HRA) is intertwined with the Scotland Act and the whole establishment of devolution, and that weakening or changing that framework might have complex implications that are not yet fully understood.\nShe is right. While the Human Rights Act is a reserved matter, human rights are not and although the conduct of international relations is reserved “observing and implementing…. obligations under the Human Rights Convention’ is specifically excluded from that reservation. Accordingly, experts such as Nicola Busby, Professor of Human Rights, Equality and Justice at the University of Glasgow, argue that responsibility for the observation and implementation of rights is at least to some extent devolved to the Scottish Parliament. This is the position of the SNP and the Scottish Government and it’s good to know it has strong expert support.\nThe JCHR concluded that it was essential that the UK Government should take account of the unique role the Human Rights Act has played in the constitutional arrangements of Scotland and that they should not pursue reform of it without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. However, we know all too well that the chances of this Tory Government taking heed of that cross-party recommendation are zilch. If they need to trample all over the devolved settlement to take the teeth out of the HRA they will do so.\nThe Sewell convention, which is supposed to stop Westminster legislating where powers are devolved to Holyrood, is a dead duck. We have already seen with the UK Supreme Court’s decision on the Scottish parliament’s bill incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that there are significant limits to the extent to which we can build up our human rights protections within the devolved settlement. So called reform of the HRA is likely to further highlight this. It will take independence for Scotland to be a country where the rights of our citizens are properly protected and can’t be usurped or trampled over by changes made at Westminster, by a government we didn’t vote for.\nAn independent Scotland will need a written constitution to protect fundamental rights and freedoms. A written constitution will also serve to provide the necessary checks and balances on executive power, arguably lacking from the current devolved settlement. A second chamber and a constitutional court are things which should be in the mix. But rights protections must be central.\nDemocracy is not just about majority rule. The rights of minorities and every individual must be protected. In an early and important judgement under the HRA establishing the rights of same sex couples to inherit their partner’s tenancy, Baroness Hale said, “Democracy is founded on the principle that each individual has equal value. Treating some as automatically having less value than others not only causes pain and distress to that person but also violates his or her dignity as a human being. …[I]t is a purpose of all human rights instruments to secure the protection of the essential rights of members of minority groups, even when they are unpopular with the majority. Democracy values everyone equally even if the majority does not”.\nAn independent Scotland’s written constitution must protect the rights of all, including unpopular minorities. In doing so it will promote tolerance and invigorate our democratic process by ensuring freedom of speech and other associated political freedoms. An independent Scotland will want to avoid the sort of clamp-downs on the right to protest which we are currently seeing in England with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill and in Scotland, outside the Scottish Parliament.\nFurthermore, where rights protections are concerned, it is essential we send out the right message to our friends and allies in Europe. Accordingly, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should be the foundation of our rights protections. However, it’s a floor not a ceiling and there is no reason why we could not go further and also enshrine certain economic and social rights. Mike Russell is currently working on a transitional constitution which would come into effect on Independence Day and be in place until such time as a permanent constitution is devised through a participatory process that would involve the citizens of Scotland as well as our elected representatives. Mike is consulting on his draft with various groups within the wider Yes movement and until such time as the document is in the public domain, I cannot comment on it.\nHowever, we can get a clue to what it might include from the Consultation on an Interim Constitution for Scotland which was published in the heady days of summer 2014 just before the indyref. It included a draft bill setting out an interim constitution in which ECHR rights were central together with a commitment to equality for everyone consistent with the principles set out in the Equality Act and the protected characteristics of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy or maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. The aim was to “guarantee Scotland’s existing progressive approach to equality and human rights and place Scotland firmly within the mainstream of contemporary European constitutional thinking.”\nThe adoption of ECHR based standards will also be important if we want to rejoin the EU. The EU is committed to the counter-majoritarian vision of democracy with rights protections based on the ECHR and expanded upon in the Charter of Fundamental Freedoms.\nThe Constitution for Scotland, a Scottish registered charity with the remit to promote a public consultation on Scotland’s constitution, also focuses on the adoption of European standards of human rights in their draft constitution. They want to go further and include such socio-economic rights as the right to free quality healthcare at the point of need and the right to free education up to secondary level and beyond on the basis of qualification. Their website which seeks to facilitate a real-time grassroots public consultation can be accessed at www.constitutionforscotland.scot.\nThere were other aspects of the 2014 draft bill which were perhaps less adventurous than many would like. For example, retention of the monarchy (the constitution for Scotland website proposes a post-independence referendum on that), a unicameral parliament and no constitutional court as such, but these are perhaps issues for a later date. What was admirable about the 2014 Bill was the insistence that it was a temporary measure and that post-independence a permanent written constitution must be drawn up by a Constitutional Convention, entirely autonomous from the Scottish Government. In the foreword to the consultation Nicola Sturgeon said “That proposal reflects our strong belief that the process by which Scotland develops and adopts its written constitution will be as important as its content. It should be inclusive and participative, reflecting the fundamental constitutional principle that the people, rather than the politicians or state institutions are the sovereign authority in Scotland.’\nAmen to that. Our plans for a transitional constitution are not perhaps the biggest thing we need to fix in advance of indyref2 but they are important because they are the very foundation of the state which we seek to create. I hope that when Mike Russell’s plans are finalised, they will include not just the incorporation of the ECHR but also a time limited sunset clause on the transitional constitution and firm plans for the participative process to create a permanent constitution envisaged by our current First Minister back in 2014.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_uk-government-shirking-humanitarian-responsibilities-manston/content_56.html": "It's time the UK Government stops shirking its humanitarian responsibilities on Manston\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 04th Nov 2022\nEvery day this week has brought a new horror story about the conditions in which asylum seekers are being housed at the Manston facility in Kent.\nAround 4,000 people have been held for weeks in a facility designed to process rather than detain people. The centre has a capacity for 1,600 to stay for a maximum of 48 hours. People, including families with children, are sleeping for weeks on end on the floor of marquees designed for summer use with only kit mats and blankets, and sometimes squashed between rows of chairs. There are reports of detainees not allowed to go out into the fresh air despite some very lengthy stays. Detainees at the screening building were not allowed to use the toilets in private. There have been outbreaks of disease including scabies and diphtheria.\nOn Tuesday of this week, Her Majesty’s Inspector of Prisons identified a lack of child safeguarding measures with unaccompanied children being housed alongside unrelated adult men. In the light of reports of rape and sexual assault of teenage boys at other detention facilities this is very serious. The inspector also found scant attention being paid to other vulnerabilities, including physical and mental health-related disabilities – not a single disabled person or woman with a disclosed history of abuse or trafficking had been designated an adult at risk.\nThings reached a nadir when former detainees were found wandering the streets around Victoria bus station in London late on Tuesday night having been abandoned there because of yet another hapless Home Office cock up. It seems this is part of a pattern of desperate attempts by the Home Office to bus people out of Manston without proper planning as to where to take them. The abandoned men were inappropriately dressed, some with flip flops and blankets around them to keep warm. They had blisters on their hands and feet, and some were suffering from fungal infections. One man was in so much pain he could not sit or lie down. The men had crossed the channel three weeks ago and were a combination of Syrians, Iranians and Afghanis, all from countries wracked by war or division and human rights abuses. They deserved better when they came to the UK seeking sanctuary.\nHowever, there was no contrition on show when Suella Braverman came to the chamber to answer MPs questions. Few would have thought it possible that the Tories could find a more objectionable home secretary than Priti Patel, whose last outing at the despatch box was marked by her telling the opposition to “Shurrup”. However, in Suella Braverman she has been outdone. Ranting about illegal immigrants and describing what is happening as an “invasion” she seemed unconcerned about the potential effect her inflammatory language could have and unconcerned about the legalities of the situation.\nWhen I reminded her that whilst it is not illegal to seek asylum, it is illegal to detain people without a proper basis in law and asked her whether she was ignoring legal advice, she ducked the question. However, the position is reasonably clear. There appears to be no lawful basis for the detention of individuals beyond 24 hours in holding rooms (or five days for holding facilities). Therefore, many individuals held at Manston have been unlawfully detained in terms of the domestic law of the UK. They could also claim for unlawful deprivation of liberty and inhuman and degrading treatment in breach of Articles 5 and 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The news that the Home Office is now facing a legal challenge over the conditions at Manson was inevitable.\nSo, what is to be done? As chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) I have written to the Home Secretary, together with the Chairs of the Home Affairs Committee (HAC), the Women and Equalities Committee and the Justice Committee to express our concern and to try to get some clarity on what what policies the Home Office has in place to: a) address these conditions in the short term, b) ensure that Manston does not face such overcrowding again in the medium and longer terms, c) reduce the number of small-boat arrivals and d) reduce as a matter of urgency the backlog in cases currently within the asylum system.\nNext week I will visit the Manston facility as part of a delegation from the HAC and JCHR. I am very pleased that Alf Dubs, himself once a child refugee and now a well-respected campaigner for the rights of refugees is to be part of that delegation. We need to remember why people come to the UK seeking sanctuary. Our latest JCHR inquiry is on the human rights of asylum seekers. Last week we took evidence from expert witnesses on this very question. Here is what they told us.\nRecent Refugee Council research shows that 91% of people crossing the channel in small boats came from 10 countries where we see human rights abuses. 80% of refugees across the world live in the global south. The vast majority of refugees, about 70%, live in neighbouring countries. Of the refugees who then travel onwards to Europe to seek safety, statistics for 2021 show that far more people go to Germany, France, Spain or Greece than the UK. The main reason why people come to the UK is because they have family or community connections here. We can all imagine that if we were forced to rebuild our lives elsewhere, the first place we would go is somewhere where we had family or community ties. A 2018 study found that more than half of more than 400 people in northern France who wanted to travel to England had a family member already in the UK.\nAnother reason why asylum seekers come to the UK is that they speak the language. English is the third most spoken language in the world; it tops the list of second languages spoken. It is also important to remember that Britain's colonial legacy is often why people from certain countries speak English. Most states where English is an official language are former territories of the British Empire.\nSome people come to the UK because they have no choice; they have been trafficked or forced here by smugglers. Last year, at least 10,000 children and adults were trafficked to the UK and forced into exploitation or modern slavery. Contrary to Braverman’s claims, there is absolutely no evidence that people are gaming the system set up to tackle modern slavery.\nAs to why so many are now crossing the channel, we were told that the simple answer is that the UK Government are forcing people to make dangerous journeys across the channel, because there are no functioning safe legal routes. At present people can only claim asylum once they are actually in the UK. What we need are better and fairer rules about family reunion for refugees and a way to enable people to be granted visas and entry clearance to come to the UK or to seek asylum while they are still abroad. This is what we have done for Ukrainians and that’s why there are none of them are among the small boat cohorts.\nThe United Kingdom has humanitarian responsibilities in what is a global crisis. It’s time for the UK Government to stop shirking them.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-house-in-order/content_271.html": "It's time for the SNP to get the house in order\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 21st Apr 2023\nFirst the good news. Devolution is not under as big a threat as some fear. When David Frost, the arrogant unelected right wing Tory peer who messed up the Brexit deal, used current SNP difficulties to say it should be rolled back, even the Scottish Tories disowned his opportunist intervention.\nDevolution is the settled will of the Scottish people as evidenced by the near 75% support it garnered in the 1997 devolution referendum and the backing in the latest Social Attitudes Survey. Even the exercise of the section 35 power is not in itself a threat to devolution. Rather, it is a fact of devolution. Narrowly drawn, never used before and unlikely to be used frequently, we should await court guidance on the limits of the exercise of section 35 with interest. The courts will be clear that it’s a power which can be exercised in appropriate circumstances. Power devolved is power retained. English notions of parliamentary sovereignty dominate the British constitution, particularly under the now rather more conservative Supreme Court. Even in more expansionist days, under Lady Hale and her predecessors, the UK Supreme Court was happy to write off the Sewell Convention as legally unenforceable and it is noteworthy that despite all the understandable huffing and puffing there has been no legal challenge to the workings of the Internal Market Act from the Scottish Government.\nThose of us who wish to see independence should not waste our time kicking against the inevitable constraints of devolution and picking legal fights we cannot hope to win. Instead, we should devote our time to making the case for independence so when it is next put to a vote it too will be the settled will of the Scottish people and gather the sort of support that will ease the challenges of delivering it successfully.\nNext the bad news. The dream of independence is under threat, at least in the short term, unless my party gets it act together. Whilst it is true that the Yes movement is wider than the SNP and other pro-independence parties exist, the SNP has been and I believe should continue to be the political vanguard of our movement. Unfortunately, eight and a half years on from the independence referendum, despite the SNP being in government in a parliament with a cross party pro-independence majority for all of that time, opinion polling shows support for independence has not moved much beyond the pre indyref 2014 high of 52%. The party has failed to achieve sustained growth in support for independence and failed to take proper advantage of the opportunities afforded by the Brexit vote and the Johnson premiership. And despite numerous election wins and some excellent policies, other policy failures and a scandal over the party’s internal affairs are in danger of damaging the independence cause. The SNP must get our house in order.\nOur new leader has taken some important steps in the right direction. His new programme for government has gone some way to reversing or pausing some bad policy decisions. His plans to reset the relationship with Scottish business, particularly small businesses which are the lifeblood of our economy, are very important.\nHe has also indicated openness to new policy ideas. Kate Forbes, Michelle Thomson and Ivan McKee are to be commended for being first out of the traps with their paper giving substance to the notion of a wellbeing economy by setting out what it is supposed to achieve and how we measure its success. And this is just the first of a number of collaborations they have promised with the left-wing think tank the Common Weal. Left out in the cold by the previous leadership this think tank have been beavering away diligently producing excellent policy papers which I now hope will enter mainstream SNP thinking. Refreshed thinking on policy and what Kate has described as “meaningful action that goes beyond rhetoric” is what is required.\nIt was sobering to see no mention of how we take the cause of independence forward in Humza’s speech. Only a year ago we were being promised a second independence referendum this October and now it seems further away than ever. Here more than anywhere else is where we need meaningful action that goes beyond rhetoric and some detailed answers to difficult questions that go beyond the high-level material published so far. But in fairness to Humza, we need to give his new Minister for Independence time to get to work. Alas, I fear, given what has gone before, he’s at a standing start.\nHumza is also to be commended for refusing to throw party members suspected of wrongdoing under the bus at the first sign of trouble. It has been good to see an enthusiasm for the concept of innocent until proven guilty which was notably missing in previous cases. The refusal to suspend the party memberships of those arrested and released without charge pending a report to the Procurator Fiscal is a big departure from past practice. Presumably it will be applied across the board now where allegations are made so it is not just party bigwigs who are protected by the idea that justice should be allowed to run its course.\nHowever, many years have been spent building up the SNP brand and it now faces considerable damage from the current scandal. It will be remembered that when allegations of sexual misconduct against Alex Salmond entered the public domain in August 2018, he announced that he was resigning from the party and would apply to rejoin once he had the opportunity to clear his name. It seems this has not set a precedent, but some have argued it should. Meantime Colin Beattie has done the right thing in resigning his role as Treasurer.\nWhatever the position on party membership, it is simply not realistic or right for anyone on whose watch the current burach was created to remain in their posts or indeed in any promoted post until there has been a thorough review of what has gone wrong. Here I am not speaking of any criminality, that’s for the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal service to decide, I refer to the mismanagement of the party’s affairs and the lack of transparency and openness. Quite simply no one who was part of covering up problems with the party finances and the auditors’ resignation and no one who has previously stood in the way of reform should be anywhere near the process of putting things right. Neither in post nor on the NEC.\nWhile I agree with Shona Robison that the party needs to get its house in order, I disagree that a culture has somehow developed at HQ and in respect of the party’s governance by accident. This culture did not happen by accident. It was fostered and encouraged by those who ran the party. Disagreement and even the mere asking of legitimate questions was treated as disloyalty. Worse still, those who asked questions or dared to disagree were attacked, smeared, and side-lined. I know this from my own personal experience because I was one of nearly a dozen people elected to the NEC in November 2020 to improve transparency and scrutiny. All or most of this current mess could have been avoided if we had been allowed to do our job. I had to resign because not only was I actively obstructed in trying to do what I was elected to do, but I was attacked, smeared and removed from my front bench position at Westminster for doing so. Others resigned and left the party because of their treatment. I stayed because I don’t give in to bullies.\nHowever, it should be crystal clear that anyone who was part of this disgraceful episode in our party’s history should be nowhere near the attempts to put it right. They should resign from the NEC if they are still on it and none of them should be on the review board. Humza has the moral authority to ensure this happens because he was not in a leadership role, nor an elected official of the party nor on the NEC at the material time. In the absence of such drastic action, as we saw at PMQs this week, the legs will be cut from under excellent performers like Stephen Flynn who will be hampered in taking our party’s cause, the cause of independence, forward.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_group-living-in-fear-is-women/content_263.html": "If ever there was a group living in fear, then it is women\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 12th Mar 2021\nYesterday Westminster held its annual International Women’s Day (IWD) debate. Squeezed into three hours at the end of the parliamentary week, after the budget debates, it felt rather marginalised. Yet in a week which saw the abduction and suspected murder of a young woman on the streets of London the discussion of the unique problems women face in our society could hardly have been more timely.\nEvery year, the Labour MP, Jess Phillips, reads out the names of the women killed by men across the UK since the last IWD debate. This year she read out the name of Sarah Everard.\nThe statistics which Jess uses come from the work of English feminist Karen Ingala Smith and her Counting Dead Women project which records the lives of women murdered by men in the UK. This project has inspired the Femicide Census which is a unique source of information about women who have been killed by men in the UK and the men who have killed them.\nEven though men’s violence against women is a leading cause of the premature death of women globally, research in the UK and Europe is limited and unconnected. The Femicide Census significantly improves upon currently available data by providing detailed comparable data about femicides in the UK since 2009, including demographic and social factors and the methods men used to kill women. It is unique in the UK in that it covers all women killed by men and not only domestic homicide.\nLast November the Femicide Census produced its fifth, and most comprehensive, report to date. The ten-year UK wide report (2009-2018) examined 1,425 cases of women killed by 1,419 men in all forms of violence against women. It found that the number of women killed every year by men has stayed distressingly consistent at between 124 and 168 women killed each year raising serious questions about the State’s response to men’s violence against women in the last decade.\nThe report concluded that the fact that a similar number of women are still being killed annually over a decade is a serious failing and indicates a lack of will to tackle root causes. It was very critical of not just the police but the whole response to violence against women and the criminal justice system. Several systemic problems were identified including lack of funding for, and cuts to, the specialist women’s sector and a failure to collate, store, and make easily accessible, transparent, disaggregated, searchable official data about violence against women.\nAt Holyrood on Wednesday, during the debate on the Hate Crime Bill and Public Order Bill, we heard mention of “communities which live in fear”. If ever there was a community in our society which lives in fear, then it is women. Women live in fear of men’s violence both from men they know and men they don’t know. To acknowledge this is not to say that all men are violent. Of course, they aren’t. But women are uniquely vulnerable to men’s violence because men are so much stronger than us.\nOn Radio Scotland, Jane Dougall, a BBC sports presenter gave a brave and graphic account of being attacked by a man outside her own front door. She said all the advice about fighting back, “kicking him where it hurts” came to nothing as she was terrified by how easily she was over-powered and put to the ground. The fact is that men are much stronger than women. That is down to our different biological make up. Sex does matter.\nAfter the event, the police advised Jane to be careful. But she was being careful. It wasn’t late at night. She was walking to her home at 7.30pm in the evening and she was attacked in her own driveway. When the Metropolitan Police dished out the same advice in response to Sarah Everard’s disappearance earlier this week, they received a well-deserved social media backlash. Now that we know that the man charged is a police officer, their advice seems even more grimly inappropriate.\nWomen are sick to the back teeth of being told we must be careful; that we must take responsibility for the problem of male violence and that we must adjust our behaviour. It doesn’t even work. The one and only time in my life I have been hit by a man happened in broad daylight when I was walking towards my front door with a girlfriend back in the 80s. I can still feel the shock and pain of the blow. I didn’t go to the police because I didn’t think they would have been very sympathetic to a lesbophobic attack in those days. At least that is something that has changed.\nBesides, where exactly are we supposed to go to stay safe? The Femicide Census report identified that 78% of the 1,425 women killed by men in the UK between 2009 and 2018 were killed in the home. As for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, for whom I normally have a great deal of respect, her advice that abductions are “incredibly rare” is scant comfort to the millions of women across the UK afraid to walk home alone in the dark. Moreover, just how does that sit with her fellow officers’ advice to avoid going out alone?\nAs the horror of what had happened to Sarah Everard sunk in, one woman took to Twitter to complain that “Half my timeline is women being told they are responsible for keeping themselves safe from male violence. The other half is women being told they are bigots for insisting on retaining protections against male violence.” Her exasperation echoes that felt by many women. It feels like our society is going backwards. Women who speak up for women’s rights are accused of bad behaviour while men who engage in abusive behaviour are shielded from the consequences of their actions.\nMen are still largely in charge and many of the women who get to the top are too scared once they are there to challenge men who want to silence or control women. So, they invent a new kind of feminism. One that is so inclusive and so kind that it will not name the problems women face. While nobody wants to pit women against men, we need to be able to name the problem of male violence against women. We also need to be able to acknowledge that sex does matter without being labelled a bigot. Sex is a reality we cannot ignore and if we do ignore it, we distort reality in a way that will only make women more vulnerable.\nAs we went to bed on Wednesday evening news broke of the arrest of a policeman for the abduction and murder of Sarah Everard and the discovery of remains suspected to be hers. As one legal commentator put it on Twitter – it was quite the day for the Scottish Parliament to decide that sex is not an aggravating factor in hate crime.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_dominic-cummings-and-the-rule-of-law/content_264.html": "Johnson and co undermine democracy and rule of law\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 29th May 2020\nThis week, like most MPs I have been inundated with emails from constituents complaining about the behaviour of Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson’s failure to sack him. Ian Blackford convened a meeting of opposition leaders on Tuesday night and they were right to identify that the main problem has been the undermining of trust and confidence in public health advice. However serious questions also arise about this UK Government’s respect for the rule of law.\nIt’s a fundamental principle of the rule of law that the law should apply equally to all. In England this principle can be traced back to the Magna Carta, a 13th century charter of rights that occupies much the same position of reverence in England as the Declaration of Arbroath does in Scotland.\nEquality before the law is basically about fairness and this explains why so many people are so angry. They feel that what has happened is not fair because the law has not been applied to Cummings in the same way as to the rest of us.\nThe Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 and their counterparts in the other UK jurisdictions, introduced to give legal effect to the lockdown, severely restrict civil liberties. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member, has described them as “the most significant and blanket interference with individual liberty in modern times.” Yet people have largely been prepared to obey them and stay at home because they thought these draconian regulations were necessary as a joint enterprise to protect the NHS and save lives. They thought this because their Government, backed up by “the science”, repeatedly told them that this was the case.\nRegulation 6 says you cannot leave your home without a reasonable excuse. It contains a non-exhaustive list of reasonable excuses that can be advanced for breaching the prohibition. The accompanying guidance makes it clear that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms should not leave their home for 7 days from when the symptoms started and others in their home should not do so for 14 days. The law is legally binding whereas the guidance is not.\nIt is now pretty clear that when he left his home Cummings was not within any of the non-exhaustive list of reasonable excuses. There are major question marks over whether he had some other reasonable excuse.\nKirsty Brimelow QC, who has assisted people wrongfully convicted under the regulations, has pointed out that unlike all those people prosecuted to date in England, the Cummings household actually did have COVID-19 and the whole point of the regulations is to prevent the spread of infection. Jo Maugham QC tweeted that to say “I believe I behaved reasonably in all the circumstances” is not a defence to a criminal prosecution and it is not a justification for ignoring the guidance.\nYet over the last few days, we have been treated to orchestrated tweets from UK Cabinet Ministers urging us to accept Cummings’ exploits as reasonable. Nothing to see here. Move along plebs. This reached a nadir when the Attorney General, Suella Braverman, England’s most senior law officer, weighed in to give her support. She is responsible for the appropriate enforcement of the criminal law and for the oversight of the prosecution system in England. As the government’s chief legal adviser, she should refrain from doing anything which undermines the independence of her office.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in England hasn’t exactly covered itself in glory during the pandemic. A review of the first 200 cases prosecuted under both the Regulations and the Coronavirus Act found that a significant number of prosecutions were wrongly charged. The policing of regulations in England was zealous in the initial stages employing drones and roadblocks. 16,184 Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNS) were issued by police in England between 27 March and 11 May. Of this total, 62% of FPNs were for breaches of Regulation 6. It would be interesting to know whether any of the people issued with these notices tried to employ the same sort of excuses as Cummings.\nHowever, we will never know. Why? Because there is no right of appeal or review against the FPNs, and most people will probably be unwilling to risk a criminal conviction by refusing to accept an FPN. How many of us think that an ordinary member of the public would have been met with a sympathetic response if they had been stopped by the police during the 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle and tendered the explanation which Cummings expects us to accept? Durham police are now investigating matters. They have interviewed the Barnard Castle eyewitness and are apparently accessing software to track the movements of Cummings’ vehicle.\nThis brings us back to the Attorney General. She is supposed to discharge her functions and advise on the law without fear or favour, free from political considerations or influence. Yet she has prejudged the matter for political reasons and potentially prejudiced the police investigation.\nBoris Johnson doesn’t want to sack Cummings because he cannot manage without him. And why is Cummings so indispensable? Because in the Cabinet Johnson has, with a few honourable exceptions, surrounded himself with numpties. Their antics are making a mockery of Britain at home and abroad. The Attorney General, like her boss, thinks she and her colleagues are above the law. They are seriously undermining democracy and the rule of law.\nThe British State continues to fail, the end of the Brexit transition period is looming without a future relationship agreement in place and Johnson’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis has been a shambles. No wonder the stability and positive change that independence can bring is fast becoming attractive to the majority of Scots.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_referendum-not-only-route-to-independence/content_286.html": "History shows a referendum is not the only route to independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 08th Jan 2021\nOver New Year I have been re-reading one of my favourite novels; Extraordinary Women by Compton Mackenzie. It’s a richly comic satire based on his and his wife’s experiences in lesbian society on the island of Capri where they lived during and after the first world war. Unfortunately, it’s out of print but if you can get hold of a copy, I highly recommend it. Like many of his fellow founders of the SNP, Compton Mackenzie was an intellectual and a free thinker. If he had not been prepared to question conventional beliefs and the status quo in the 1930s he would not have been able to envisage an independent Scotland.\nMembers of the SNP can rightly be proud of those who founded our party. If we look at the biographies of just a handful of Mackenzie’s fellow founders, we see writers and thinkers abound. Robert Cunningham Grahame, writer journalist and adventurer; Florence Marian McNeill, folklorist, writer and suffragist; and Andrew Dewar Gibb QC, Regius Professor of law at the University of Glasgow and Chairman of the Saltire Society. These people were nationalists and internationalists who celebrated their country’s culture but also believed in vigorous debate and analysis.\nTo all those who have come since the goal of independence has often seemed insurmountable given the obstacles we have faced. Now as we enter 2021 our party rides high in the polls and support for independence is at unprecedented levels. We would never have got this far had we and those who went before us not been prepared to be radical and to think outside the box.\nLike others who have been part of the struggle for most of their lives I am acutely aware of the length of time it has taken to get to the brink of realising our dream.\nIn 1980 at the age of 14, together with Ian Blackford and John Swinney, I was a founding member of the Edinburgh Branch of the Young Scottish Nationalists. A few years later, like Ian, I became disillusioned after the expulsion of the left wing radical 79 Group from the SNP and joined the Labour party. At that time this seemed the best way to combat Thatcher’s Britain. During my years as a Labour party member I became involved in the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly then Scotland United in 1992. By that time SNP and Labour party members were making common cause for a multi-option referendum; independence; devolution or the status quo. Labour abandoned that idea when they came to power in 1997 but kept faith with the demand for a devolved Parliament and delivered it, but only with the support of the SNP. That support was not given lightly and secured only after a series of private meetings between Donald Dewar and Alex Salmond in which Alex secured a concession that nothing in the Scotland Act would preclude the people of Scotland from subsequently choosing an independent future.\nThis concession is recorded in Hansard during the second reading of the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Bill in the House of Commons on 21 May 1997, Donald Dewar said: “I should be the last to challenge the sovereignty of the people, or deny them the right to opt for any solution to the constitutional question they wished. For example, if they want to go for independence, I see no reason why they should not do so. In fact, if they want to, they should. I would be the first to accept that.”\nIn the same debate Alex Salmond went on to emphasise that “…the Claim of Right referred to the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine a form of Government best suited to their needs. It did not suggest that sovereignty resides with English Members of Parliament and that's the way it will stay.”\nDonald Dewar articulated the democratic norm which would later be enshrined in the Edinburgh Agreement. His concession laid the foundation for the 2014 referendum in recognising the rights of Scots to choose whether to remain part of our voluntary union with England. I am wholly in agreement with the view that we must find a legal and constitutional way to demonstrate that public opinion in Scotland has changed since the 2014 referendum in order for our independence to be internationally recognised and therefore meaningful. I also agree that the easiest and best way to do that would be to replicate the Edinburgh Agreement entered into by Alex Salmond and David Cameron in 2012 by obtaining a section 30 order so that the Scottish parliament may hold a second independence referendum which will demonstrate irrefutably that the result of the first one has been reversed.\nBut what if Boris Johnson continues to refuse to co-operate?\nLast Sunday Andrew Marr asked Boris Johnson what democratic tools are available to Scottish voters who want Scotland to leave the UK. He put to the PM the case of the Scottish voter who wants another referendum but only has his vote to secure it and asked how he can do that. What, he said, is different from the English wanting to leave the EU and being allowed to have a referendum and Scots who want to leave the UK but not being allowed to have a referendum.\nThis is becoming known as the Marr question. And it’s a question which must also concern the SNP.\nIt is foolish and dangerous to rail against having a plan to do things differently, should it be required. Foolish, because it undermines the carefully achieved gains of our movement such as the concession Alex Salmond secured from Donald Dewar. Dangerous, because it reinforces the power of our adversary and cements in the minds of the international community that the only way Scotland can leave the UK and become independent legally and constitutionally is by replicating the 2014 referendum.\nThis is patently not true. One hundred years ago Irish independence came about not as a result of a referendum but as a result of a treaty negotiated between Irish parliamentarians and the British Government after nationalist MPs had won the majority of Irish seats in the 1918 general election and withdrawn to form a provisional government in Dublin. Whilst no one wants to replicate the violence that preceded those negotiations, the Treaty is in legal and constitutional terms a clear precedent which shows that a constituent part of the UK can leave and become independent by a process of negotiation after a majority of pro-independence MPs win an election in that constituent part.\nPrior to the advent of devolution, it was thought that a simple majority of pro-independence Scottish MPs would be sufficient to open negotiations on independence. Mrs Thatcher appeared to endorse this view in her memoirs. That is why some have suggested using a Scottish election or indeed a further General Election as a plebiscite if a section 30 order continues to be refused.\nIt is short sighted to view the question of how we might lawfully end a consensual union of two sovereign nations which is over three hundred years old only through the prism of devolution which has been with us for barely two decades and is not the last word on the constitutional relationship between Scotland and England.\nOn 24 January a virtual SNP National Assembly will take place to discuss ‘the tactics and strategy on the route from here to Independence Day’. SNP Depute Leader Keith Brown is to be commended for securing this important discussion which is open to all party members and will be conducted in private. A recent opinion poll suggested that two thirds of voters want a fall-back strategy to secure a second independence vote if a section 30 order is refused this time round. That such a strategy is needed because it may be required is in fact a no brainer. In her speech of 31 January 2020, the FM was careful not to rule other routes out of the question. Others would do well to follow her lead.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_our-courts-need-some-hard-and-fast-rules-on-open-justice/content_7.html": "Our courts need some hard and fast rules on open justice\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 22nd Sep 2023\nTHE ninth anniversary of the 2014 independence referendum left me feeling a little sad. I suspect many Yessers felt the same way. However, while it is tempting to look back and dwell on that time of optimism and unity in the Yes movement with nostalgia, what we need to do is look to the future. I intend to do that in my column next week once I have sight of the amendments to the motion on independence strategy put forward by Humza Yousaf and Stephen Flynn for SNP conference and, I hope, confirmation of the nature and extent of the debate which will take place.\nThe bare-faced cynicism of Rishi Sunak’s backtracking speech on net zero this week has simply underlined the need for Scotland to be independent to tackle the most challenging issues of our time. Just as the cost of living crisis is a crisis made at Westminster, so now a government Scots did not vote for is hampering our ability to tackle the climate crisis in Scotland. To take just one example, the Scottish Government’s more ambitious plans on phasing out diesel and petrol vehicles may now fall foul of internal market rules.\nThe other big story in the news this week was the court hearing of the Scottish Government’s petition for judicial review of Alister Jack’s Section 35 order blocking the Gender Recognition Reform Bill (GRRB). I am not going to expend any more column inches on the merits of the policy underlying the fight between the UK and Scottish governments, but I do want to highlight the harsh reality that, in most instances, in a fight with Westminster over the limits of devolution, the Scottish Government is destined to be the loser. That is why I believe we need to stop banging our heads against the brick wall of devolution and focus instead on using such powers as devolution affords to tackle the most important issues of the day while making the case for independence.\nDevolution does what it says on the tin. Power devolved is power retained. Section 35 is the inevitable result of that. All this week’s case is really about is measuring the extent of the power afforded by S35. In truth, it is not a great constitutional battle at all but just a dreary reminder that the parliament in Edinburgh does not embody the sovereignty of the people of Scotland in the same way as it would if it was an independent parliament. The real constitutional battle was the issue of whether Holyrood had the power to hold a referendum on the issue of independence. If only it had been approached with the enthusiasm and commitment we have seen in respect of the GRRB, with confident supportive legal advice, a carefully crafted bill and the weight of the Scottish Parliament behind it, we might be in rather a different position than we are now. However, again, there is no use crying over spilt milk. While we can and must learn from the mistakes of the past, we must also look to the future.\nI would like to highlight one aspect of this week’s proceedings in court that I found troubling. While it was great to see the Scottish courts streaming live on the internet for all with digital access to follow, those following closely would have found it hard to understand some of the arguments advanced by the Lord Advocate, not through any fault of her or the Scottish Government, but because she referred extensively to written arguments from interveners in the case, which, unlike those of the parties, were not published. All the documents lodged with the courts by the Scottish and UK governments were in the public domain in advance of the hearing and could be accessed online. However, written submissions from four groups who had intervened in the case were not published in advance of the hearing, and I cannot understand why that should be the case.\nTwo out of the four have now been published because of pressure from some of the journalists who were trying to follow the hearing in court and online. While you can read the written submissions of Stonewall and the Equality Network online, those of the other two intervenors – Gendered Intelligence and the Institute for Constitutional and Democratic Research – are not yet public.\nThe Scottish courts need to learn from this experience and introduce hard and fast rules that respect the principle of open justice. That justice must not only be done but be seen to be done is a statement of principle from an English court case which took place nearly 100 years ago, but the principle is still revered the world over. The statement was originally made in the context of the need to avoid bias or the appearance of bias, but the principle is of broader application. That is why our courts sit in public.\nIn the past, civil court cases such as this week’s judicial review were based largely on oral argument so that anyone sitting in the public gallery could follow the argument but nowadays, they tend to generate a huge amount of written material and if you can’t read that it is very difficult to follow what are now truncated oral proceedings.\nIn a recent UK Supreme Court case it was said that the default position should be that the public should be allowed access, not only to the parties’ written submissions and arguments but also to the documents that have been placed before the court and referred to in the hearing. Of course, sometimes there may be good reasons for denying access, for example, to protect the interests of children and vulnerable adults, or for reasons of national security. However, open access should be the default position. But, as my colleague and co-founder of Lawyers for Yes, Jonathan Mitchell KC, observed this week, the Scottish courts have been dodging this aspect of the principle of open justice for a while and need to make some hard and fast rules enshrining it.\nIt was reported that the authors of the written submissions, Stonewall and the Equality Network, had initially resisted their publication. The journalists who pressed them on this did so because, they said, “Our job as journalists is to report court proceedings in the public interest accurately, fairly and in accordance with the law, an essential function in a democracy. If we cannot understand points which are being made in open court because we do not have access to relevant documents, that function is impeded, leaving the public to a certain extent in the dark.”\nIt should not have been left to journalists and online commentators to push the intervenors to publish their written submissions. If they are going to be taken into account by the court, then they should be in the public domain, and it is the court’s responsibility to make sure that happens. While the Court of Session is to be applauded for streaming the case online and allowing live tweets from the well-established and respected citizen journalist organisation Tribunal Tweets, across town at the Employment Appeal Tribunal where an important case is being heard on the definition of “worker”, Tribunal Tweets was refused permission to live tweet the case. The reasons for this decision are not yet in the public domain but it feels wrong. Coincidentally, the case concerns a well-known writer, Gillian Philip, who was sacked by her literary agent and publishers for the crime of defending JK Rowling’s views on gender identity theory.\nRobert Burns wrote: “Here’s freedom to them that wad read, Here’s freedom to them that wad write, There’s nane ever fear’d that the truth should be heard, But they whom the truth would indite.” I think he would have wholly approved of the principle of open justice.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_resignation-of-the-advocate-general/content_214.html": "Richard Keen has quit, but who on earth will Boris Johnson get to replace him?\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Sep 2020\nIt came as little surprise when Lord Keen of Elie, the UK Government’s law officer for Scotland, tendered his resignation in the wake of Brandon Lewis’s statement that the UK Internal Market Bill would break international law “in a very specific and limited way.” In fact the only real question is what took the Advocate General so long.\nRichard Keen QC is a former Dean of the Faculty of Advocates and well respected at the Scottish bar as an extremely able lawyer. In 2018 he represented the UK Government in the case about whether Article 50 could be unilaterally revoked and, in 2019, in the prorogation case. The fact that he lost both cases should not be taken as any reflection upon his abilities or his probity.\nIn the prorogation case, for example, until the UK Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling, there was a degree of disagreement about whether the course of action pursued by Boris Johnson had been unlawful. Here there can be no doubt. It is there in black and white in the bill that parts of it will have effect “notwithstanding any relevant international…law with which they may be incompatible or inconsistent”.\nTo argue as Suella Braverman, the English Attorney General, has done that the English doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty means that it is lawful for the UK to override the obligations Boris Johnson signed up to in the Withdrawal Agreement is legally illiterate. As recently as 2017 the UK Supreme Court confirmed that treaties between sovereign states are governed by international law not by the domestic law of any state. If Suella Braverman had applied the most rudimentary legal analysis, she would realise that this means, so far as international law is concerned, the English doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty cannot supersede the UK’s obligations in the Withdrawal Agreement.\nRichard Keen’s departure was hastened by a less than impressive appearance before the Lords EU Withdrawal Committee and, earlier in the Lords, when he tried to slither out of the consequences of Brandon Lewis’s admission by saying Mr Lewis had “essentially answered the wrong question.”\nWell, Lord Keen has now answered the right question - whether any law officer worth their salt can remain a Minister in the Johnson Government – correctly. Notwithstanding some typical Tory skulduggery when in 2015 they changed the wording of the Ministerial Code; England’s Court of Appeal has held that the overarching duty of ministers to comply with the law in that code includes international law. So Richard Keen must have been pretty worried about his duties as a Minister as well as an Officer of the court.\nThe English Law officers should really tender their resignations for the same reason, but I suspect they won’t, because, unlike Keen, they have been selected for their slavish devotion to the Johnson agenda rather than their legal ability.\nOne big question remains. Who will replace Richard Keen? I suspect Johnson will find it hard to find anyone of suitable seniority at the Scottish Bar who is willing to do so.

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_westminster-fails-to-agree-brexit-deadline-looms/content_66.html": "Joanna Cherry: Westminster fails to agree on anything as Brexit deadline looms\nIn this week's Sunday National, I argue a Scottish Citizens' National Assembly could address the hows and whys of independence - because, as we saw in Ireland before their referendum on abortion, getting the process right maximises the chances of getting the right answer.\nThis article originally appeared in the Sunday National on 20th January 2019.\nIt was with a strange sense of unreality and some difficulty that I made my way through the packed No lobby where more than 400 MPs had congregated last Tuesday evening to vote. SNP MPs are used to having a few pro-Remain Tories for company when we vote on Brexit-related matters but this time we were joined by the ERG and the DUP.\nA few minutes later Theresa May suffered a historic defeat when her Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by MPs by a margin of 230 votes.\nIt is almost unprecedented for a Government to survive a defeat on their central economic and security policy but survive she did a day later when the PM resisted a vote of no confidence in her Government.\nAnd, despite initial indications to the contrary in the aftermath of her Commons drubbing, it became clear that the PM was not going to relax her red lines.\nIan Blackford, other party leaders and some leading MPs who took up her invitation to meet for talks left with their views on her intransigence reinforced and EU diplomats were left in disbelief as she failed to make any new demands in calls to EU leaders.\nVery quickly the Brexit Select Committee, of which Peter Grant and I are members, produced a report outlining the options open to Parliament; to hold another vote on the PMs Agreement (unchanged), to leave with no deal, to call on the Government to renegotiate the deal before a further vote or to hold a second referendum.\nOn renegotiation the committee identified three main possibilities; seeking changes in the text of the Withdrawal Agreement regarding the backstop arrangements; seeking a Canada-style trade deal (but this still requires a withdrawal agreement and a backstop); and the Norway plus option (seeking to join the EEA through the EFTA pillar and remaining in a customs union with the EU which might get rid of the need for a backstop).\nTo this I would add the “nuclear” option of the UK Parliament revoking Article 50 thanks to the Scottish case, but I fear many would find that unacceptable without the mandate of a second EU referendum.\nMeanwhile there is a growing sense that inevitably parliament must seek an extension of the Article 50 notice period which would otherwise expire on March 29. Such an extension would require the unanimous agreement of the EU27 whereas revocation can be done unilaterally but should not be used as some sort of hokey cokey device.\nHowever an extension is not a permanent solution. It simply buys more time and the conventional wisdom is that the EU is unlikely to agree to an extension simply for more dithering, but only for a second vote or a General Election.\nThat said, when I was in Paris this weekend meeting with French and British politicians, business people and opinion formers there was a sense that perhaps the EU might be more flexible than previously thought. The problem is that there appears to be no majority at Westminster for any of the options listed above.\nIn such circumstances delay is of course the path of least resistance. It is said that there probably is a majority for ruling out no deal but that of itself is not enough. An alternative to no deal must be found. Put shortly these would be a different deal than the one voted down last week, revocation or, in the short term at least, delay.\nRumours of an imminent General Election have circulated but it is hard to see how it could address the issues outlined above or indeed how either the Tories or Labour could go the country on a united platform.\nThis week in the Commons will be all about process but, as any lawyer will tell you, getting the process right maximises the chances of getting to the right answer – something which the SNP and the independence movement should bear in mind.\nTomorrow the PM will make a statement to the House presenting her plan B.\nThereafter there will be a second meaningful vote on the plan B following upon a debate on Tuesday January 29.\nThe Government will table a business motion governing how that debate is to be conducted tomorrow and thereafter there is likely to be a frenzy of tabling of amendments to the Government business motion with a view to parliament “taking back control” of the process.\nSome Tory and Labour MPs plan to facilitate this by presenting bills as well as tabling amendments to the business motion. Clearly the Speaker has some sympathy with this course of action hence the opprobrium, smears and threats directed his way from the Government benches.\nBetween the tabling of plan B and the debate and vote there are likely be a number of Brexit-related emergency debates, urgent questions from MPs and unexpected procedural votes. MPs will need to be on their toes.\nSo where are the SNP in all of this? When the FM came to Westminster last week she was clear that what the PM must do now is stop the ticking clock by extending Article 50, bring forward legislation for a second EU referendum and take no deal off the table. She also indicated that she will be updating her plans for a second independence referendum in a “matter of weeks”.\nWithin hours of her saying this an exclusive poll for the Herald newspaper revealed a majority of 56% in favour of a second independence referendum if Brexit goes ahead.\nI didn’t find this surprising as it fits with what many members of public and constituents are saying to me given their concerns at the way the Brexit process has unfolded and the lack of leadership at Westminster.\nThe Tories, particularly the Scottish ones would do well to realise that the boorish and insulting behaviour towards SNP MPs does not go unnoticed.\nTogether with the sidelining of Scotland’s Parliament and ignoring of our democratic mandate, it is helping build the cause for independence.\nThe majority of people in Scotland now know that the 2014 indyref was won on the back of lies. This Brexit debacle has exposed the two biggest lies – that Scotland is an equal partner in the UK and that voting to stay in the UK would guarantee Scots’ EU citizenship.\nAs debate was joined on how best to facilitate a second vote on independence, Gordon Brown made another one of his famous “interventions”, with a speech in Edinburgh calling for an Article 50 extension and a series of “public hearings” across the country to establish what the public now wants from Brexit. It also emerged that he supports a second referendum on Brexit but not, of course, on independence.\nLike Willie Rennie, Gordon Brown can see the justification of changed circumstances for a second EU referendum but not a second indyref. This just won’t wash with the people of Scotland.\nI’ve been thinking a lot lately about the lessons to be learned from Ireland. The citizen assembly model being proposed by Gordon Brown was the precursor to last year’s Irish abortion referendum, and the ground work it did is widely believed to have been crucial to the decisive victory for modernisation. This model is not too far from the approach adopted by the SNP at the National Assemblies held last summer/Autumn which were hailed by those who went along as the best exercise in participative policy and strategy shaping the SNP has held in a long time. It seems to me that in moving the debate forward on both the why and the how of independence, a Citizens National Assembly for Scotland would be a good idea. After all, as I said above, getting the process right maximises the chances of getting to the right answer.",

From the sycophantic speeches by Tory backbenchers proposing and seconding the speech to the nauseating hypocrisy of Tory glee at Keir Starmer’s discomfort over beergate, its been hard to sit through. But on Wednesday we hit a nadir when we had to listen to a short lecture from a red wall Tory on why people need food banks. Apparently, it’s because they don’t know how to cook or budget.\nLee Anderson MP, as it turns out, is a former Labour staffer. You’d think as an MP and an MP employee in recent years he might, from his casework, be aware of the benefits and in-work poverty that leads many of our constituents to rely on foodbanks to make ends meet. But no. I was lucky enough to be the next Speaker and so was able to decline his offer to visit the foodbank in his constituency, point out that all MPs have food banks in their constituencies, and that the reason for their existence is the poverty caused by his government’s policies.\nPoverty across the UK is set to rise thanks to the cost-of-living crisis and yet the Tories’ programme for government in this session abjectly fails to make meaningful proposals for addressing a crisis that is already hammering many people. There is nothing about cutting VAT on fuel bills; nothing about taxing big companies—not only energy companies—on excess profits; nothing to increase benefits; and nothing to reinstate the £20 that was cut from universal credit. Instead, we heard that a Cabinet working group met on Tuesday to chuck around ideas to deal with the crisis but came to no conclusions. The lack of urgency and focus is as insulting as it is callous.\nNor does the Queen’s Speech contain any measures to compensate people for the serial incompetence of the Home Office in respect of the handling of immigration and asylum cases, and the issuing of passports, nor the serial incompetence of the Department of Transport for the issuing of driving licences. Everyone will know someone at present who is desperately waiting for their renewed passport to arrive. My inbox is full of frantic constituents many of whom have worked hard for holidays they will now miss out on and, even worse, those who are desperate to attend the funeral of a loved one abroad.\nThe guiding principle of the Queen’s speech should have been to tackle these sort of bread and butter issues. Instead, its guiding principle is to diminish the accountability of the Government to parliament, the courts and voters. We see this in the plans to replace the Human Rights Act (HRA) with a watered-down Bill of Rights. We see it in the further plans to quash public protest in the Public Order Bill. And we see it in the so-called Brexit Freedoms Bill which will expand Government Ministers’ power to amend, appeal or replace EU retained law by way of secondary legislation. More Henry VIII powers.\nThe cornerstone of all of this is limiting Human Rights protections because so long as the HRA remains on the statute book and people can go to court to defend their rights it remains a serious threat to the rest of the Government’s project to diminish its accountability by quashing protest and limiting access to justice.\nThe Queen’s Speech contained a passage assuring us that her “government will ensure the constitution is upheld” It was hard not to laugh out loud as this phrase was read out by the Duke of Rothesay. The PM can’t even uphold the ordinary laws of the land and in 2019 he rode roughshod over the constitution and lied to the Queen when he unlawfully prorogued parliament. Then in 2020 his government introduced legislation designed to go back on their agreement with the EU and to break “international law” in a “limited and specific way”. Now they are at it again with the Northern Ireland protocol.\nMeanwhile the Tories’ cynical attempt to equate Labour’s Tier 2 beer and curry by-election campaign refreshment stop with their serial law breaking is not just cynical it is also sinister. The police had already investigated this event and closed their investigation. The investigation now seems to have been re-opened because of political pressure. I don’t want to live in a state where the government, with the assistance of their little helpers in the right-wing press, are able to influence the police to re-open a closed investigation into their political enemies. It stinks. Most people can see the difference between what seems to be a working meal and the endless parade of parties with suitcases of booze and karaoke that took place at No 10 during lockdown. People aren’t stupid. But the idea that the government of the day should lean on the police or the prosecution services to dispose of their political rivals is very worrying.\nAt least in Scotland we have a way out of all of this. The local elections were an important reminder that this UK Government has no mandate in Scotland and no mandate for any of the policies it is seeking to impose on us in its programme for government. It is no surprise that the Tories lost so many votes and have been reduced to third place in Scotland. On the doorsteps in Edinburgh South West I heard over and over again the contempt in which this UK Government is held. It’s not just the endemic law breaking but it’s the rank lack of respect for the frequently expressed view of the Scottish electorate for a different way of doing things and for a second independence referendum given the broken promises of the first.\nI’m particularly proud that in the Pentland Hills ward of my constituency my colleague and friend Fiona Glasgow displaced a Tory councillor to win yet another seat for the SNP on the City of Edinburgh Council. It’s great to see the SNP so strong in our capital city and it is always good to see women of independent mind elected to public office. However, everyone knows that winning elections is not an end in itself. It’s what you do with the mandate you win that counts. Across Scotland, SNP councillors now have an important job to do delivering on the promise to do everything they can to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Meanwhile at Holyrood the time is fast approaching for announcement of the detail of the plan to deliver the promised second independence referendum and the arguments that will win it.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_uk-echr/content_36.html": "Suella Braverman cannot say why the UK needs to ditch ECHR\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 16th Dec 2022\nAt the start of this week, I led a delegation of the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) to a public meeting with the Legal Affairs and Human Rights Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\nWe met in Paris halfway between their base in Strasbourg and ours in London. Yes, I know, nice work if you can get it, but there was no time for sightseeing as we were only there for 24 hours and had a heavy schedule of meetings both with the committee and with British Government representatives in France. We met the latter to discuss our concern that the human rights of asylum seekers should be at the heart of the joint Franco/British response to channel small boat crossings.\nThe Strasbourg committee wanted to meet with us because they are concerned about the Tory Government’s plans to repeal the Human Rights Act (HRA) and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. They fear that the UK Government wants to water down its commitment to the rights enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and, based on the evidence our committee has heard, they are right to be concerned. Strasbourg are particularly worried that if the UK were to do that it would send out the wrong signal internationally and give encouragement to other states in Eastern Europe such as Hungary and Poland who might do likewise.\nAt our meeting, our international colleagues also raised the importance of all Council of Europe states addressing migration issues in accordance with human rights and international law. There was a degree of consensus on this broken only by an intervention from a British Tory member and from a German parliamentarian from the far-right German party AfD (Alternative fur Deutschland). What he had to say about immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, was dangerously close to what we heard later in the week in the UK parliament from Jonathan Gullis MP and his far-right Tory supporters before an SNP initiative put a stop to his attempt to introduce a bill to openly flout international human rights law.\nIn Paris on Monday, I was able to reassure our European colleagues that the British Government have repeatedly told Council of Europe interlocutors that there are no plans to withdraw from the Convention. Indeed, on 14 July the Justice Secretary Dominic Raab wrote to the JCHR saying that the government’s plan was to remain party to the ECHR.\nImagine my concern then when, just two days later, Dominic Raab, giving evidence in person to my committee, told me that the UK Government have not ruled out withdrawal from the ECHR and that this option is “not off the table.” This was in direct contradiction to the assurances he gave us in the summertime and what has been said by British Ministers in Strasbourg. However, it should not really surprise us.\nLeaving the ECHR has never been far from the mainstream Tory narrative over the last few years. Back in 2015, before the Brexit referendum, when Theresa May was Home Secretary, she said that rather than leaving the European Union the UK should leave the ECHR and the jurisdiction of its court. Just a few months ago the current Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, told a Tory Conference fringe event that it was her position that ‘ultimately” the UK would need to leave the European Convention on Human Rights. And only two weeks ago she wrote the foreword to a pamphlet which argued that the UK membership of the Convention prevents it from adequately enforcing its immigration laws.\nWhen the PM came to parliament on Tuesday with a 5-point plan to tackle what he calls ‘illegal immigration” and “spurious appeals”, I was keen to establish whether the legislation he is planning will comply with the UK’s international law and human rights obligations. I asked him to confirm that it would and if not whether it was his intention to derogate from treaties like the ECHR or simply to flout them. Guess what? He didn’t answer.\nOvernight more migrants tragically drowned in the channel and the Home Secretary made a statement to the House of Commons on Wednesday after PMQs. She did not confine herself to expressions of regret for what had happened and condolences but also reaffirmed what the PM had said the day before about stringent new laws next year. I asked her whether it was still her position that the UK will need to leave the ECHR to deal with these issues in the way she would like. Again, she declined to answer.\nDuring both the PM and the Home Secretary’s statement and at PMQs, multiple Tory backbenchers expressed enthusiasm for leaving the Convention or derogating from some of its provisions. Later that day Jonathan Gullis MP tried to introduce his Asylum Seekers (Removal to Safe Countries) Bill, that would have allowed the UK to disregard international and domestic law to push ahead with their plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. During his speech he argued that the UK should seriously consider its position as a member of the ECHR and quoted the pamphlet endorsed by Suella Braverman.\nI was in the chamber when he spoke, and it was clear he had quite a bit of Tory support. Fortunately, due to the SNP initiative spearheaded by Alison Thewliss, who made a passionate speech in opposition to his bill, a vote was forced and he was refused leave to bring the bill. Labour MPs and at least one Tory (David Davis) voted with the SNP and the Tory payroll abstained. I saw some of the ultra-right Tories trying to persuade Suella to vote but she sat on her hands. For now. Presumably she wants to hang on to her position as Home Secretary until such time as she gets the PM’s full support for her plans to flout international law.\nSo, why should all this matter to the SNP and the wider Yes movement? Well, for a start, the ECHR is a fundamental part of the devolution settlement. But perhaps even more importantly, when Scotland votes for independence we will need to send out the right signal to the international community by incorporating the ECHR in our interim and final constitution as a floor, not a ceiling, for rights protections. We can be a signatory to the ECHR while we are still waiting to rejoin the EU.\nAs we prepare for independence, we need to demonstrate our commitment to human rights to our future international allies. The Scottish Government are working hard at this but what the SNP do at Westminster is also important. Some of the foreign parliamentarians I met in Paris were surprised and impressed that the committee overseeing scrutiny of the UK Government’s Human Rights record is chaired by an SNP MP. It will not have gone unnoticed that opposition to Tory plans to ride roughshod over international refugee and human rights law were led in the Commons this week by SNP MPs.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_cherry-calls-uk-govt-to-support-victims-of-trafficking/content_148.html": "Joanna Cherry calls for UK government to support victims of human trafficking\nThis article first appeared in Edinburgh Reporter on 16th April 2018.\nJoanna Cherry QC MP for Edinburgh South West and SNP Westminster spokesperson on Justice and Home Affairs, called upon the government to take steps to bring UK law on human trafficking into line with Scots law.\nJoanna Cherry QC MP for Edinburgh South West and SNP Westminster spokesperson on Justice and Home Affairs, called upon the government to take steps to bring UK law on human trafficking into line with Scots law.\nShe pointed out during a debate on Modern Slavery earlier today at Westminster, that in Scotland the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Act goes further than current UK law. She explained that the Modern Slavery Act does not impose a duty on the UK Government to provide support and assistance for victims, but that there is such a duty in Scotland.\nThere are some private members’ bills in the House of Lords at present which seek to make the necessary amendments. The Scottish Government provides support for victims of human trafficking for 90 days, which helps victims to have a window of time within which to recover fully and take steps to making them less vulnerable in future.\nMs Cherry said: “This weekend I was pleased to be able to support the fundraising efforts of the Faculty of Advocates Tumbling Lassie committee which commemorates the Scottish Judiciary’s rejection of slavery in the 17th Century and exists to raise awareness and funds for charities fighting against modern slavery and people trafficking and to help survivors in Scotland and beyond.\n“The charities it supports include Community Safety Glasgow’s TARA service which provides advice and support to trafficked women who have been sexually exploited.\n“Today at Home Office questions I called on the UK Government to to amend the Modern Slavery Act so that adult victims of modern slavery in England and Wales have the same statutory rights as they have in Scotland under the Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Act.”\nThe Tumbling Lassie Committee is named in honour of a case decided by the Court of Session here in Edinburgh in 1687, Reid v Scot of Harden and his Lady.\nThe case concerned a young girl gymnast, known to history only by her nickname, “the tumbling lassie”.\nThe Court of Session in Edinburgh heard the case in January 1687. The Court dismissed Reid’s claim (of ownership), impliedly declaring the tumbling lassie free. The case report contains the trenchant observation: “But we have no slaves in Scotland, and mothers cannot sell their bairns…”",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_conversion-therapy-legislation-concerns/content_47.html": "This is why I have real concerns around conversion therapy legislation\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 19th Nov 2021\nToday’s column is very personal. I think by now most people know that I am a lesbian. I didn’t come into politics with the purpose of defending the rights of lesbians. Indeed, I never really wanted to make an issue of my sexuality, but events have meant that I have had no choice. My purpose in entering elected politics was to achieve independence for my country. I honestly thought that would be the fight of my life.\nInstead, while that struggle seems somewhat becalmed at present, I find myself in the fight of my life defending the sex-based rights of women and girls and the rights of me and my lesbian sisters to be who we are and to organise around the protected characteristic of our same-sex orientation.\nI am 55 years old now. I came out as a lesbian when I was 21. It was 1987, the height of the AIDS crisis and during the campaign against Section 28 (Clause 2A in Scotland). I marched across the UK in support of my gay brothers’ right to proper healthcare and against the clause. I was gay bashed for walking up the street with someone who was obviously my girlfriend. I lived in fear of my employers finding out my sexuality and sacking me. I struggled with my Catholic upbringing and the antipathy of my church towards who I was. That’s how it was then. Fortunately, things have changed hugely.\nSo great has been the success of the struggle for equal rights for LGB people in the UK that the focus of many organisations such as Stonewall is now on trans rights. As I have said before, I support equal rights for trans people. I do not, however, support self-identification of sex without any gatekeeping. And I do not believe that the nebulous concept of gender identity should trump the observable biological fact of sex. As JK Rowling has said, without sex there can be no same-sex attraction. That rather matters to people like me.\nThe controversy in which I have become mired this week stems from proposals of the UK Government to ban conversion therapy. Last weekend on Twitter I made it clear that whilst I oppose conversion therapy as conventionally understood, I share the concerns of many that the inclusion of the concept of ‘gender identity’ in the UK Government Bill risks threatening professionals working with children and vulnerable people who are having issues with their gender if they seek to explore the reasons for their distress.\nOver the past few years, there has been a very worrying rise in the number of children, particularly girls, becoming convinced they were ‘born in the wrong body’ and seeking to take puberty-blocking drugs and cross-sex hormones. This is a controversial, experimental medical treatment for a complex problem. We have also seen an increase in the number of young people who have later regretted the irreversible changes made to their bodies and who have sought to ‘detransition’.\nI am concerned that young women, particularly those who may be lesbians, should be offered alternatives to such drastic medical pathways, and that their teachers, parents and therapists should not be threatened with prison and fines for discussing these options with them.\nIn the years leading up to puberty I wanted to be a boy. This happens to a lot of young girls. Some, like me, grow up to be lesbians or bisexual, some are just tomboys and grow up to date men and some are trans and choose to live as the opposite sex. I want these girls to be able to discuss, with professional support if necessary, what it is that is making them wish they had been born a boy and to decide whether they might be gay, straight or trans before they embark on life-changing treatment with puberty blockers which may leave them permanently infertile and undergoing surgery to remove their breasts.\nThe UK Government’s proposed bill will create a new criminal offence of ‘talking conversion therapy’, covering any therapy undertaken with the intention of changing a person’s sexual orientation or changing them from being transgender or to being transgender, if they are under 18 or have been coerced or lack the capacity to consent.\nChildhood transition is a controversial medical issue. Dr Hilary Cass is currently leading a Review on Gender Identity Services for Children and Young People commissioned by the UK Department of Health and I do not believe that legislation concerning the treatment of children presenting with gender dysphoria should be presented to Parliament until her review has reported.\nMany therapists advocate a process of ‘watchful waiting’ for children with gender dysphoria. However, the proposed safeguards protecting legitimate therapists are not strong enough as they rely on the child or other patient declaring that they are ‘questioning” rather than ‘trans’. This means that if a child or vulnerable person declares that they are transgender, then any professional seeking to explore the reasons for this feeling, or alternative pathways other than transition would be at risk of investigation and prosecution for engaging in ‘conversion therapy’. That in a nutshell is the problem I have with the current proposals.\nFor trying to articulate this legitimate concern on social media and for the ‘crime’ of attending debates about similar concerns with my sisters in the LGB Alliance, I have been subjected to a torrent of abuse. What I have said has been grossly misrepresented including by a leading charity funded by the Scottish Government. And, in flagrant breach of the party’s code of conduct, SNP members, including parliamentarians and councillors, have taken to social media calling for me to have the whip withdrawn and even for me to be expelled from the party. Their actions disgrace the SNP and they put me in danger of further abuse and worse. We need a better politics than this and we need to be able to discuss difficult issues without McCarthyite witch hunts. These matters are controversial, there is no question about that. Pretending otherwise or chanting the mantra ‘no debate’ does a disservice to our party and our country.\nTo end on a positive note. I have got through this week not just because of the love of my family and friends but also because of an outpouring of support from ordinary members of the SNP, my constituents and the wider public. People are noticing the hounding of women like me, Professor Kathleen Stock and JK Rowling, and they don’t like it one little bit. The bullies should take heed.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_sex-and-equalites-act-debate/content_239.html": "The benefits of UK clarifying what ‘sex’ means would be widespread\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 16th Jun 2023\n\"The status quo is not working.” The frank and honest beginning of Jess Phillips MP’s speech during the parliamentary debate about the definition of “sex” in the Equality Act hit the nail on the head. The discrimination that women have been subject to through the ages is a result of our biological sex and equality law protections designed to prevent discrimination against women have always been intended to protect us from sex-based discrimination.\nThe Equality Act also allows for single-sex exceptions in routine situations where the general prohibition against sex discrimination based on sex does not apply so that single or separate sex services may be provided. Good examples are women’s toilets, changing rooms and support services for the survivors of male violence.\nJess went on to say: “We all know that men’s violence against women and girls happens to women. Of course, violence happens to men and, frankly, if someone needs services because they are a victim of domestic or sexual violence, I do not care which category they fall into – they are 100% entitled to expect access to those services.\n\"But the Equality Act has to allow for the fact that we need different kinds of services for different people’s needs, understandably.\n“The Equality Act is a carefully balanced piece of legislation that recognises that women and men – let us be honest, it is less men – need protection from sex discrimination.”\nHowever, increasingly across the whole of the UK, services for survivors of domestic abuse or sexual violence are not being provided on a single-sex basis. Many service providers have been cowed by so-called “Stonewall Law” – shorthand for the interpretation of the law put forward by the lobby groups like Stonewall and the Equality Network which replaces sex with gender identity. These lobby groups have influenced the conditions attached to local and central government funding with the result that organisations are forced to accommodate biological men into women’s services or risk losing the funding which they rely on to operate.\nWe know that traumatised women are self-excluding and not using services which they fear having to share with biological males in support groups or refuges. This is why JK Rowling and a group of fantastic women have set up Beira’s Place in Edinburgh to provide a single-sex service. Services for trans people who are affected by domestic abuse and sexual violence must absolutely be commissioned by local authorities. But different people need different services, and the Equality Act provides for that.\nLast week, when the report of the Scottish Government’s independent “Violence Against Women and Girls: Strategic Review of Funding and Commissioning of Services” was published, it recommended that single-sex provision should remain as part of a range of services. As one interlocutor argued, “it is possible to be pro-woman and not anti-anyone else”.\nJess Phillips knows what she is talking about. Prior to entering parliament, she worked for Women’s Aid in England managing refuges for victims of domestic abuse. She now serves as Labour’s shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding. When both she and an expert review set up by the Scottish Government say women across the UK need single-sex services, we should listen.\nThe definition of sex in the Equality Act has in recent times become very unclear. During the parliamentary debate I spoke in support of restoring clarity to the law by specifying that the terms “sex”, “male”, “female”, “man” and “woman” in the Act refer to biological sex, not sex as modified by a gender recognition certificate and certainly not self-identified sex.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says that such clarity would assist not only with the provision of single-sex and separate-sex services but in other areas including sport, data collection, freedom of association for men and women and freedom of association for lesbians and gay men. It also identified that human rights law may require the statutory recognition of biological sex in order to avoid breaches of the right to private and family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as well as the freedom of association provisions in Article 11.\nAs a National Human Rights Association, the EHRC is required to consider the rights of everyone – which is sometimes forgotten by those who have attacked it for advocating for the rights of women and LGB people as well as trans people. The Equality Act attempted to strike reasonable balances between the rights of people, with nine different protected characteristics, including sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment. The protected characteristic of gender reassignment is widely drawn to protect all trans people against discrimination at work and in the provision of goods and services. It is rightly not confined to those who have undergone medical treatment or those who have a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).\nThere is no intention to remove the protection that trans people have under the Equality Act, and I would never support any move to do that. Protecting everyone from sex discrimination does not remove discrimination protections for transgender people. In the last year, two Scottish court cases have disagreed on the correct interpretation of sex in the Act. In the first case which went to appeal it was found that provisions in favour of women “by definition exclude those who are biologically male”.\nHowever, a subsequent judgment at first instance in another case found that “sex” is not limited to biological or birth sex but includes those in possession of a GRC obtained in accordance with the 2004 Act. Both cases were brought by the grassroots campaign group For Women Scotland and the second is now being appealed. But ordinary women should not have to crowdfund to clarify the law when the UK Government could use its power to resolve the issue and protect everyone’s rights.\nThe petition which Jess and I spoke in favour of wants the Government to clarify the Equality Act. The rival petition wants to leave it muddled which is in no one’s interests. Clarifying that sex means biological sex is also important for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals who share the protected characteristic of “sexual orientation”. LGB people all experience same-sex attraction – that is, attraction based upon biological sex, not gender identity.\nGender identity is not relevant to sexual attraction. Yet in recent years, Stonewall has quietly modified their definition of homosexuality to centre around gender identity, and not sex. Since they also explicitly include “cross-dressers” under their definition of transgender, this means that many males now self-define as lesbians. Under this climate, it is impossible for lesbians to meet and gather openly without men wishing to join or simply disrupt our events. Lesbians, in the words of Anne Lister (Gentleman Jack), “Love and only love the fairer sex”. It is unacceptable that we should be forced to include men in our social groups and on lesbian dating apps – indeed it is outright homophobia.\nIn the Equality Act, sexual orientation means attraction to the same sex, opposite sex or both sexes. But if “sex” no longer means male/female, then sexual orientation has been redefined to mean “attraction to a government-issued certificate” – or, if the Gender Reform Recognition Bill became law in Scotland, attraction to self-declared sex. In other words, “sex” would be defined out of existence. This is particularly harmful for same-sex attracted people, who still suffer significantly from homophobia and require a clear definition of sexual orientation if our rights are to mean anything. Clarifying the law would help service providers treat everyone fairly and protect rights to privacy and freedom of association.\nFinally, it is important to recognise women as a group. When public authorities consider the impact of their policies, they should consider the impacts on women (and men). Unless they are able to consider women and transwomen as separate groups, they can never consider that women’s interests matter where there is a conflict. These are the sort of issues that were being debated in parliament on Monday. Trans rights were not up for debate, nor should they be. To suggest otherwise is irresponsible and has consequences as we have seen this week.",

Recess is a great opportunity for me to spend a good long chunk of time in my Edinburgh South West constituency rather than just the Fridays and weekends which I manage while parliament is sitting. Like many of my colleagues, I have been using the time to visit community groups, faith groups, small businesses, and charities to see how they are faring in these post pandemic times.\nAs part of this work, earlier this month, I hosted an online workshop to help local organisations find out about the funding opportunities available from the People’s Postcode Lottery.\nTimes have been very tough for charities over the last few years and are set to be difficult for the foreseeable future. The pandemic has put a very real strain on good causes. Now, with the cost-of-living crisis, securing funding is even more essential than usual. The People’s Postcode Lottery has raised over £900 million for good causes, and they make a real effort to engage with parliamentarians to help ensure organisations in our constituencies knows what this allows them to offer. The significant appetite for funding opportunities was illustrated by very high attendance at the workshop I hosted and quite a few organisations from outside the constituency joined us. At the end I stayed on the zoom call to chat with some of the local groups and those further afield.\nOne of the people I met was Colin Mackie, an SNP activist and Yesser, who runs a charity called Spike Aware. It’s a UK wide charity based in the small village of Elvanfoot in South Lanarkshire and founded by Colin and his wife after tragedy struck their family in 2017 when their 18 year old son, Greg, was found dead in Halls of Residence at Edinburgh College. Greg was studying for a career in Film and TV media. There are good grounds for suspicion that what killed Greg was a noxious substance put in his soft drink by a third party, although the authorities have never been able to secure enough evidence for a conviction.\nAt the time of Greg’s death, Colin and his wife found that there was no one to turn to and no one to answer their questions. They decided that they didn’t want anyone to go through what they were enduring and to set up a charity to highlight the dangers of the growing problem of drink and needle spiking.\nSpike Aware UK became a recognised charity as of the 15th of August 2018. They have raised funds to produce flyers and information about the risk of Spiking, protective bottle lids and glass covers, and information Beer Mats for distribution around Universities, Colleges, Nightclubs and Pubs to raise greater awareness and combat the problem. When I touched base with Colin earlier this week, he and his volunteers were busy distributing information and anti-spiking kits at fresher events in Glasgow. They have also been on the streets with Police Scotland and attended events like the recent YouthBeatz in Dumfries. They do regular presentations for High School and College Students.\nGreg’s death attracted a lot of media attention and many newspapers have covered the story. Colin’s campaign has also been a topic on both BBC and STV, including the Victoria Derbyshire Show, The Nine Show, Kaye Adams and various regional news programmes across the UK. Colin has also been interviewed by an Australian radio station and recently had media interest from Spanish TV.\nAs well as raising awareness and helping people, particularly young people, protect themselves from drink and needle spiking, Colin and his volunteers are also campaigning to make Spiking a stand-alone offence. At present spiking attacks are usually only prosecuted if they are linked to another recognised criminal offence such as sexual assault or theft. Stand-alone convictions would help raise awareness as well as acting as a deterrent. Colin wants people to look upon Spiking in the same way as they do Drink Driving, to realise it’s not just a prank and that it can, and does, cost lives.\nColin also wants people to understand that while most victims of a drink or needle spiking attack are young females in their late teens or early twenties, any one of us can be a victim of drink or needle spiking regardless of our sex or age. Media portrayals of it being a “girls’ problem” can put boys off reporting it. In fact, most attacks go unreported, often because the victims have been drinking alcohol and are fearful of not being believed or stigmatised. In April 2022, a UK Government report into Spiking by the Home Office revealed that 75% of victims did not report the attack, through fear of not being believed.\nThere is also the problem that often the victims cannot recall the detail of what happened to them. Yet, most young people are aware of this issue and live with the fear of an attack when they are out socialising. So, advice and kits to lessen the risk are very welcome.\nMeetings have been held with cross party parliamentarians in both Holyrood and Westminster. SNP politicians have listened, but Colin was disappointed not to succeed in getting a motion about the issue accepted onto the provisional agenda for SNP conference. However, he was delighted when his union USDAW supported a similar motion calling for heightened awareness and a stand-alone offence. A private member’s bill was introduced at Westminster but failed for lack of time. It is understood that the Home Office are reviewing the matter for potential changes to the law in England and Wales.\nIn a week when the behaviour of a very small minority of protestors outside the Tory leadership hustings in Perth has been used as a stick to beat the entire Yes movement, Colin’s story is a good illustration of the sort of community work in which the people who will build momentum to Yes engage. Out of personal tragedy he and his wife have built a campaigning charity which is really making a difference. It is this sort of spirit that will win independence for Scotland, hard work born out of love and compassion, not hate. I have found Colin’s story inspirational, and I hope readers will too.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_why-i-am-standing-for-edinburgh-south-west/content_312.html": "Why I’m standing to be MSP for Edinburgh Central\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 28th Feb 2020\nBrexit has changed the landscape of UK politics for good. The SNP were at the forefront of the battle to save Scotland and the whole of the UK from Brexit. I believe that was the right thing to do and I was proud to play a leading role. But that battle has been lost.\nAlthough the SNP scored an emphatic win in GE2019 we did not succeed in locking Boris out of Downing Street. With a large Tory majority across England, the UK is now set firmly on a hard Tory agenda for the next decade. Scottish interests are ignored or ridiculed at Westminster. The movement for Scotland to be an independent European nation can only be realised from Holyrood.\nIt is against this backdrop that I have confirmed that I will take part in the selection process to be the SNP candidate for the Holyrood seat of Edinburgh Central. I want to offer my services where I think they will be of most use. I am grateful to the branch members in my home branch of Edinburgh Central where I have been a member for over a decade and those in Edinburgh South West who have encouraged me to run and for the supportive messages and encouragement I have had since.\nCompetition for candidacy is a healthy part of our democracy and our party. Just as no one questions that it is good for our democracy to debate ideas, so it is good for the SNP to do so and many party members are keen to have more of the sort of stimulating debates which took place at the National Assemblies. That type of open facilitated discussion and debate are key to how we take our country forward and that is why I championed Citizens Assemblies.\nMeantime fellow Scots who were worried about Scotland leaving the EU in 2014 and who understandably hoped that a future UK Labour government would return the whole of the UK to a fairer path can now see that the UK wasn’t the safe bet that Better Together painted. Hopes of a Labour revival have been extinguished. Stopping Brexit and causing a reverse of Boris Johnson’s right-wing populism at GE2019 was their last hope. I believe that the cross party working I employed to good effect in halting Boris Johnson’s unlawful prorogation can now be employed to build bridges to those now open to be convinced of the case for independence.\nIn my daily work as a constituency MP, I see the unfairness caused by Scotland’s inability to set our own policies over immigration and employment and to tackle the benefits system as a whole. Edinburgh Central overlaps a considerable part of my Westminster seat, including Gorgie, Dalry, Haymarket, Fountainbridge and part of Bruntsfield/Tollcross. Since the SNP lost the Holyrood seat to the Tories in 2016 the workload for me and my team has increased because Ruth Davidson is largely absent from the constituency, does not hold surgeries or provide the kind of help and support that I do.\nMy weekly surgeries and my mailbox are full of people who have concerns which their MSP should be addressing at Holyrood. So over this time, I have built up a knowledge of devolved issues. Access to good quality affordable housing is a major issue we deal with. The spread of AirBnB and its distortions of the rental market are very serious in Edinburgh Central so I was happy to lend my support along with fellow MPs and MSPs lobbying the Scottish Government for more powers to tackle this problem. I am pleased these powers are now being introduced. I will be at the St Bride’s Centre on 19 March to hear more about how the City Council will use them. I would encourage others to go along to their local drop-in, four are planned so far.\nUnlike Ms Davidson, I have proved that it is possible to have a high profile on the national stage while also working hard in the constituency. My victories over the Tories in the 2017 and 2019 General Elections are testament to my reputation as a hard worker who gets things done. My seat was one of the top Tory targets in 2017 yet I held onto the seat through hard work and bucked the national trend with a majority of 1097. At last year’s election I increased that majority to nearly 12,000. These victories would not have been possible without a fantastic ground campaign by activists from across the city. I was proud to join them on the ground and I am known as a candidate who leads from the front and knocks doors along with her team.\nNominations don’t open until 3 April and we won’t have the final list of candidates for Edinburgh Central until 15 May. I am looking forward to positively debating the issues with my fellow candidates and the membership once the contest begins. The SNP members living in Edinburgh Central will choose their candidate based on the ideas put forward, and their work and campaigning record - not on personalities and that’s as it should be.",

Out of power but still in office, Boris Johnson’s resignation yesterday and the announcement of a contest for the leadership of the Conservative party, brings an end to the sorry Johnson saga but does little to tell us about what happens next.\nParadoxically it was a sex scandal involving someone else’s behaviour, rather than his own, which brought Johnson down, but the real reason was his serial dishonesty which made him unfit for office. That was known before he ever became leader, and the Tory party should not be allowed to get away without owning the mess created by their election of him as their leader. Nor can he be tolerated as a caretaker PM while they try to get their act together.\nAll they can talk about is the need to save the Tory party. Only occasionally do they remember to talk about saving the country and, by that, of course they mean England. Not Scotland, not Wales and not Northern Irelandm despite the political turmoil caused there by the ineptitude of Johnson’s so called oven-ready deal.\nIn truth there is a wider story about Johnson’s premiership and that is the damage done to the UK at home and abroad.\nThe UK’s reputation abroad has been trashed by legislative proposals designed to breach international law. While at home what was always a fragile constitutional settlement has been shown to be inadequate to stop Trumpian levels of behaviour. British democracy failed badly when Johnson was able to continue as Prime Minister despite having unlawfully shut down parliament to get his way. Our politics failed when, rather than holding him to account and rallying to avoid the damage of a hard Brexit, opposition politicians voted like lemmings for an election which, in the face of Johnson’s crude populism and lies, could never be won in England. And the remaining countries of the UK got dragged along the same path regardless of the very different politics of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nDevolution has not been enough to save us from this mess and that is a crucial message to take to the unionist camp in the next independence campaign.\nAll power should be subject to checks and balances, but the checks and balances of the British constitution have not been enough to stop the excesses of this Tory Government under Johnson. The changes made to the Scotland Act after the 2014 referendum and the Smith Commission were supposed to give us the most powerful devolved parliament in the world, but that is clearly not the case. Neither power nor sovereignty are shared and, under Johnson, the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty has been subverted to put as much power in the hands of the Westminster executive as possible. This need not be the case, especially if it were to be legally recognised that devolution could and should mean shared power and sovereignty.\nThere was an inkling of a more democratic approach to sovereignty in the UK in the judgment of the UK Supreme Court (UKSC) in the prorogation case. However, since then, rather unfortunately, the court case prompted by the Scottish Government’s attempt to incorporate the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) into Scots law for reserved as well as devolved matters has resulted in a degree of retrenchment by the court with a judgement based on a very old fashioned notion of parliamentary sovereignty and a very narrow reading of the Scotland Act.\nI fear this could happen again when the Supreme Court hears the Lord Advocate’s reference concerning the competency of the Scottish parliament to pass a Bill providing for a second independence referendum. It will be imperative that the argument is made for a more expansive reading of the modern British constitution than we saw in the UNCRC judgment.\nSo, I was more than a little disappointed to read this week that the Lord Advocate “does not have the necessary degree of confidence” that the Bill is competent. That is her legal opinion and I respect it but, in my opinion, there are good arguments to be made for the proposition that Holyrood might competently legislate for #indyref2. I had hoped that these arguments would be advanced before the USKC. Certainly, that is what I had in mind when I first advocated the strategic gambit of testing the Bill in court. I hope they may yet be made in the Lord Advocate's expanded written argument.\nAmid all the turmoil on Wednesday, Johnson still found time to write another section 30 letter with the familiar refrain of ‘Now is not the Time.” The irony of this, landing just as the Tories were themselves demanding a re-run of the vote of no confidence vote they had only three weeks ago, was highlighted by my colleague David Linden MP.\nIf ever there was a dead parrot, then it’s the strategem of repeatedly asking for a permission that’s doomed to be refused. So, it's good that we are moving on from this. I reiterate that, well argued, win or lose, the Supreme Court case will further move things on, but not unless it is accompanied by other initiatives, including a constitutional convention and policy papers answering the economic and trade questions that trouble the soft Nos. I know some important work is going on behind the scenes on policy papers, and I hope for an announcement that the Constitutional Convention promised in January 2020, before the pandemic, will be set up in the autumn.\nThis week I participated in some very productive work on the drafting of a transitional constitution for an independent Scotland. Although the work is being done under SNP President Mike Russell's auspices, it has involved parties other than the SNP and grassroots Yes groups. This is the way to go especially if we are looking at a plebiscite General Election.\nOne last thing. I was very sad to read on Twitter this week statements from a small number of Yes groups that they won’t ‘stand with or platform any person or organisation that demeans or dismisses others’ human rights’. On the face of it this is a statement we could all get behind, except I have no doubt that it is aimed not at human rights deniers but at women and men who don’t accept that gender is more important than sex. This is so not the way to go if we want unity and a diverse campaign for independence.\nIf these tweets were aimed at people like me who wish to preserve the sex-based rights of women set out in the Equality Act, and the rights of same sex attracted people, there are two things the tweeters need to understand. First, human rights are universal and, second, equality is not just a concept of a British Act of parliament, it is also protected under Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Freedom of belief and freedom of speech are likewise protected under Article 9 and Article 10 ECHR. I don’t think I am revealing anything which would be a surprise if I say that the transitional constitution for an independent Scotland will be signed up to the ECHR. Equality is for all and trans people, women, and the same sex attracted, all have equal human rights under the ECHR, including the right to hold gender critical beliefs or indeed, the belief in gender identity or queer theory, and the right not be discriminated against for holding these beliefs or for not holding them. That is the law, and it was reaffirmed in another major court judgement this week. There can be no place for discrimination or selective protection of human rights in an independent Scotland, nor in the campaign that takes us there.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_intolerance-in-independence-debate-will-do-damage/content_52.html": "Intolerance bleeding into independence debate will only do damage\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 13th Nov 2020\nOn Friday 27 November, on the eve of the SNP conference, I have been asked to deliver the Wales Centre for Governance’s annual lecture. The title I have chosen is ‘Stands Scotland where it did? Scotland’s Journey Back to Statehood.’\nPrevious lectures have been delivered by Nicola Sturgeon in 2014 and Tom Devine in 2016. Looking back to what they said then, it has been instructive and inspiring to see how far we have progressed towards our destination in the last few years. The lecture is a great opportunity to tell an engaged and interested UK wide audience about the sea change in support for independence as a result of Brexit and the Covid crisis. It is also a chance to talk about our movement’s vision of what an independent Scotland will look like.\nAs John Major’s intervention this week showed, the momentum towards a second independence referendum feels unstoppable. Senior party members have told us that there is no reason why the 2nd indyref should not be held next year. Accordingly, this conference and the new NEC which it will elect should have a strong focus on our party’s goal of independence. Not just how we win it but what we do with it when we get it.\nCentral to that vision is a desire to create a fairer and more equal society. So, it was disappointing to see one of my colleagues be so critical of two organised democratic groups of SNP activists that exist to promote and further that vision.\nThe SNP Common Weal Group play a leading role within our party in producing detailed research and developing the sort of progressive policies that could transform Scotland. They are pledged to support a Green New Deal, a National Care Service, land reform, public ownership of key utilities and transport services, stronger rights for tenants and local wealth building. These are policies which most SNP members are in tune with and I am proud to support them.\nThe SNP Womens’ pledge is a group of women within the party who wish to uphold the legal rights of women to privacy, dignity, fairness and safety as currently defined in the Equality Act 2010. The pledge states that women have the right to discuss policies which affect them without being abused or silenced; the right to maintain their sex based protections as set out in the Equality Act 2010 including female only spaces such as changing rooms, hospital wards, sanitary and sleeping accommodation, refuges, hostels and prisons; the right to refuse consent to males in single sex spaces or males delivering intimate services to females such as washing, dressing or counselling; the right to single sex sport to ensure fairness and safety at all levels of competition and, the right to organise themselves according to their sex class across a range of cultural, leisure, educational and political activities.\nThere is nothing in this pledge which does not reflect the current law under the Equality Act. Some of the rights asserted conflict with the ambitions of those in our party who wish to legislate for self-identification of sex, but these are matters which ought to be capable of calm measured debate. Instead, many of us who have signed this pledge have been abused and vilified by a small but very vocal group, some of whom are members of our party and who think that on this issue there should be ‘no debate’.\nIt is no accident that there is a close correlation between this group and those who have sought to stifle any debate about a Plan B if the British government will not deign to grant a Section 30 order.\nI believe that their behaviour is symptomatic of an intolerance which is toxic and damaging to our party. Should it be allowed to continue or bleed into the independence debate it could irretrievably damage the cause of independence. Resorting to personal abuse is no substitute for rigorous argument and rebuttal and it is far less effective. Many members are rightly concerned that the ‘no debate’ approach has resulted in an NEC dominated by people who are reluctant to question or scrutinise the party’s governance or its strategic direction and that this is not healthy for internal party democracy.\nThe CWG and the Women’s Pledge have been criticised for drawing up lists of candidates who they recommend for election to the NEC. Interestingly, once more, there is a significant correlation between the two lists, presumably because both groupings espouse open debate.\nIt has been suggested that such lists or ‘slates” are not established practice in the SNP. However, this is patently untrue as those who attended conference last year will remember that a list of candidates who had signed another pledge was circulated. So, what is it about these new lists that is so objectionable? Surely all lists should be accorded equal respect or is it that some lists are more equal than others?\nI am left with the feeling that those who thought they, and those on their list controlled the debate and the party machine and would continue to do so are threatened by other groupings of activists organising democratically within the party. But it makes sense, because in a party whose membership runs to six figures, not everyone knows everyone else. So, when delegates to conference are selecting who to vote onto the new NEC it is surely helpful to have an idea of the candidates’ positions on policy and governance. Especially, given the restricted opportunities for candidates to put themselves forward or explain their positions. Democracy is a pretty flawed affair without transparency or accountability.\nThe party is too big to be compared to a family. Nor will it always be a family affair and we don’t have to listen to Daddy. We are all adults capable of forming our own views on matters and there will inevitably be disagreements. It is how these disagreements are conducted and resolved that matters.\nYes, there has been criticism of the NEC and the Conference committee, but criticism is not abuse. As one of the most abused female politicians in the country I have a pretty good idea of the difference. Members and branches are perfectly entitled to be annoyed that resolutions on which they had worked hard for months have disappeared into an amorphous mass of composites which don’t seem to move the debate forward terribly far.\nOur party and our policies need to be match fit for the endgame in the struggle for our independence. Those who seek to hobble attempts to make sure that happens do not have the party’s best interests at heart. And, those who seek to stifle debate will not be much use to us in the full heat of the unionist onslaught once the second independence campaign starts for real.\nThe Wales Centre for Governance annual lecture is free to attend and open to everyone.

The first lot of hustings were a credit to the party and all three candidates. I am delighted Kate Forbes has remained in the race. Resilience is a quality which our next FM and leader will need, and Kate has certainly shown she has it in spades.\nIt is important never to give into bullies and I am pleased and relieved that Kate has toughed out the sort of pile-on that I hope will cease to be a feature of our party going forward. I support Ash Regan but Kate would also make an excellent FM and in our STV election I expect many members will vote Ash 1, Kate 2. I am to the left of Kate on economic policy, and I do not share her personal religious beliefs, but she’s an impressive politician. Moreover, it is quite clear she has no intention of imposing her personal beliefs on the rest of us via legislation or rolling back the law on same-sex marriage. In this I prefer her approach to those of politicians from all parties at Holyrood who were happy to impose their belief that sex is a feeling as opposed to a material reality on the rest of us, in both the Gender Recognition Reform Bill and the as-yet-not-in-force Hate Crime Act.\nThe Scottish Government and Parliament need to get off identity politics and turn their focus onto bread-and-butter issues. Dealing with the cost of living and the problems in our NHS and education system need to be top of the new FM’s in-tray and, as leader of the SNP, she needs to reset our independence strategy.\nI cannot give Humza Yousaf my support because he is the continuity candidate and the one preferred by those close to the previous leadership. As such I do not think he is able to acknowledge the things that need to be fixed and I cannot subscribe to the “Nothing to see here. Business as usual” approach. This overlooks the fact that many flagship policies have recently hit the buffers, that support for independence is not as high as it should be post-Brexit, Johnson, and Truss, and that our strategy for delivering independence has faltered.\nI am supporting Ash for several reasons. Firstly, I admire the courage and leadership qualities she showed last year when she resigned her ministerial post on a point of principle. Secondly, her background as a Common Weal policy wonk means she will ensure that many of the issues the grassroots membership is passionate about will be discussed during the contest, for example, a Scottish currency. Her background in business is also useful in ensuring the party and government listen to business in a way they have not done in recent years. It is perfectly possible to take a left-of-centre approach to socio-economic policy while still valuing business and enterprise, many political parties elsewhere in Europe do just that. Most importantly, Ash wants to bring the independence movement back together and involve it in developing a strategy that will deliver independence.\nAsh is also prepared to address the question of internal party democracy. Two issues in the past week have highlighted how important that is. First, the unnecessary debacle over access to the party’s hustings. I understand why some members might have preferred privacy to ask some challenging questions about the activities of HQ, the NEC and some members but equally the idea that the process of questioning the people who are vying to be Scotland’s next FM should happen behind closed doors is untenable and an affront to democracy. The 24 hours during which the party tried to maintain this position allowed one journalist to claim we have an “allergy to transparency”. It was not a good look.\nSecondly, questions have been raised about the secondment of employees of the party to the campaign of the establishment candidate and the use of party resources to assist him. Potentially, there has been a breach of the rules on organisational neutrality contained in chapter nine of the rules the NEC have established to govern the leadership race. If any breach is left unaddressed, that could call the validity and indeed the legality of the election into question. I am sure the party’s national secretary will be alive to the risk here but nevertheless, I support the claims for independent monitoring of the election process particularly as the SNP’s next leader will also be Scotland’s next FM. I believe other parties follow this practice.\nLast weekend, I had a wonderful opportunity to take the temperature of the party’s membership when I went on a pre-arranged speaking tour of the north-east hosted by SNP branches in Arbroath and Fraserburgh and Yes Stonehaven. Before I left, I also spoke to Pentlands West, a very well-organised and active branch in my constituency. I owe its members a considerable debt for my three election wins in a row and their door-to-door work even managed to topple a Tory councillor and install another SNP councillor at the last local elections.\nHere is what I took from the four meetings I attended. The good news is that the SNP still have a substantial number of engaged activists. There is a degree of bewilderment at how unexpectedly this leadership race has been thrust upon us and regret that the truncated nature of the contest and other practicalities mean that MPs cannot put themselves forward.\nThere is a lot of concern about the de facto referendum policy and a desire that such things should be properly debated and worked through before they are announced in future. In parallel with that, people want the governance of the party reformed and made more transparent and accountable. Many members are heartily sick of identity politics and shocked by orchestrated social media attacks, particularly on female parliamentarians. They want the party to focus on governing well and delivering independence. Yes, they want an end to the infighting but not at the cost of failing to address some of the problems that have led to our current leader’s resignation. But there was a mood of positivity and indeed that is how I will remember my trip. It was bookended by the launch of Ash Regan’s campaign and my last speaking engagement at Fraserburgh.\nAsh’s launch took place at a hotel overlooking the Forth bridges. It was a gloriously sunny morning and as we looked out over the iconic view including the new Queensferry Crossing, I was reminded that when the SNP govern well they can deliver huge infrastructure projects like this on time and within budget.\nIn Fraserburgh, I met some veterans of the rise and fall of the SNP in the 1970s and they reminded me of how far we have come. The party may have fallen back a bit in the polls slightly but now there are more people in Scotland who support independence than vote SNP, and that, of course, is our raison d’etre. It is also an excellent basis upon which to maximise the SNP vote and to realise our dream.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_gender-reform-bill/content_31.html": "Here's why I couldn't support gender reform bill\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 23rd Dec 2022\nON Wednesday I joined feminists protesting against the Gender Recognition Reform Bill outside Holyrood and addressed the rally. I did so to support SNP MSP colleagues who share my deep reservations about the system of self-identification proposed in the bill. I also wanted to show my support for all the brave women and men who have dared to express their heartfelt, rational and genuine concerns about the unintended consequences of this legislation for the rights of women, girls and LGB people.\nTraditionally, the SNP have allowed parliamentarians a free vote on matters of conscience. I cleared my attendance at the rally with the Westminster SNP group chief whip on that basis. Sadly, my MSP colleagues were not afforded the same leeway. Nevertheless, some of them found the courage to rebel and I applaud them for doing so, particularly given the personal and professional cost to them.\nLike them, I am not a transphobe nor a bigot. I am a lesbian, a feminist and someone who has a long-standing record both as a lawyer and a politician for standing up for equality and human rights. When I was a young woman I openly campaigned against the homophobia of the Section 2a (Section 28) legislation while some of the politicians now desperately virtue signalling over this legislation absented themselves from the fight or sat on the fence.\nHuman rights are universal and at present women, men, LGB and transgender people across the UK enjoy the same human rights, the same equal rights and protection from discrimination thanks to the Human Rights Act and the Equality Act. It has been said repeatedly that the GRR Bill gives no new rights to trans people. That is correct in so far as the bill says nothing about trans people. The word “trans” is not mentioned in the bill and therefore undefined.\nHowever, the bill does give a new right to anyone to change their legal sex with little or no meaningful safeguards. Thus, the bill will allow any man to declare himself a woman and to gain the legal status of woman for all or most purposes after three months of living as a woman. What it means to “live as a woman” is also left undefined. I believe this new right could pose a threat to women’s rights to safety, privacy and dignity. It could also mean that lesbians could be forced to accept men into lesbian clubs, groups and dating websites. In fact, all of this is already happening as a result of de facto acceptance of self-identification.\nThat is why I am opposed to the bill. Contrary to what some may say, I am not a serial rebel. Unlike some of my MP colleagues I have never broken the SNP whip at Westminster. I’m proud that some of the ideas I have championed over the years have become SNP policy and helped my party to win elections. I was a leading voice in the fight against Brexit. I led the court action that stopped Boris Johnson’s unlawful prorogation of the UK Parliament and I championed the need for a plan B including a Holyrood referendum bill if the Tories refused to grant a Section 30 order for a second indyref.\nBut I cannot support this bill. In maintaining that position, I am not breaking party policy. The SNP have never endorsed at our conference a system of self-ID, and it was not what was promised in the manifesto for the 2021 election. What the manifesto promised was to improve and simplify the process by which trans people may obtain legal recognition so that the trauma associated with that process was reduced. It also promised to work with women’s groups and to address any concerns about the reform through informed and respectful discussion. To be frank, I do not think this has happened.\nMany of the concerns which I hold about the lack of safeguards in the bill were endorsed by Reem Alsalem, the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women and Girls when she gave evidence to the Holyrood bill committee on Monday evening. She knows what she is talking about. It was good to hear her rebuke MSPs who speak of culture wars and accuse women with concerns of engaging in hate speech. She reminded them that what is at issue here are fundamental human rights and how we can all co-exist in a dignified way.\nShe also debunked the myth that there is no evidence of the abuse of systems of self-identification in other countries. She pointed out that some of these countries have safeguards in their legislation not present in the Scottish bill and others no longer collect sex disaggregated data leading to confusing results, for example when a male sex offender has changed his legal sex to female but continues to commit sexual crimes while in prison, his crimes are recorded as those of a woman not a man self-identifying as a woman. She also emphasised the lack of impact assessments as well as proper data analysis and that she has received evidence of women self-excluding from what were once women’s spaces because of systems of self-ID in other countries.\nMany proponents of the bill have claimed there is no evidence that sexually abusive men will abuse self-identification systems to gain access to vulnerable women. Google the names Barbie Kardashian and Katie Dolatowski and you will see that these assertions are simply wrong.\nAccording to international human rights law there is no need for Scotland to introduce a system of self-identification. The system of gender recognition which we currently have satisfies what is required by the case law of European Court of Human Rights. Furthermore, the court has recognised that “stringent” procedures aimed at verifying the underlying motivation for a change of legal identity are justified.\nReem Alsalem believes that a recent Scottish court judgment by Lady Haldane means the bill will impact on rights protected by the Equality Act. She was clear that the bill needs to be clarified in that respect and that it needs more inbuilt safeguards.\nSometimes rights conflict. Courts have to deal with this all the time. I sit on the advisory board of a NFP organisation called Sex Matters. We agree that trans rights are human rights, but we have also said this:\n“In some situations, conflicts of rights and interests may be a zero-sum game.\n“If the rules governing single-sex spaces are changed so that some members of the opposite sex are able to enter, those spaces become mixed-sex, and many women will self-exclude.\n“If males who identify as women are housed in women’s prisons, women will feel and be unsafe. If males are allowed to play in women’s sport, then fairness and safety for women are destroyed.\n“In this sense, rights are pie – and compromises that destroy the human rights of one group are unfair. Solutions are needed that respect everyone’s rights ...”\nI don’t believe Holyrood has as yet found a solution to reforming the process of gender recognition that respects everyone’s rights. I believe that women’s rights are being sacrificed, I believe that is wrong and I believe it is my duty to say so.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021/content_19.html": "How justice system can better serve women who have been raped\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 31st Dec 2021\nHere is a quite staggering statistic: sexual offences currently account for 70% of the criminal business dealt with by Scotland’s High Court. And, as we head into a new year, Scotland’s criminal courts are facing a serious backlog of cases, the vast majority of which involve rape and male violence against women. The backlog has built up since the courts had to close at the start of lockdown in 2020, but even before then the system was struggling to cope.\nIt is against this background that the Lord Advocate has told MSPs that “radical action” is needed. The World Health Organisation describes sexual violence against women as a major public health problem and a violation of women’s rights which perpetuates gender inequality. The delay in bringing cases to trial is having a particular impact on women and girls at a time when we face an epidemic of male violence against women.\nThe Lord Advocate is also concerned about the low conviction rate in sexual offence cases. Scottish Government statistics show that just 43% of cases of rape and attempted rape in 2019-2020 resulted in a conviction rate – compared to a rate of 88% for all crimes.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_general-election-spanner-in-indyref2-works/content_65.html": "What if Boris Johnson throws a General Election spanner in the indyref2 works?\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 12th Nov 2021\nAlthough Westminster went into a 3-day recess at close of business on Tuesday, media coverage of recent events there continues to be frenzied. Don’t be fooled by the feeding of Sir Geoffrey Cox to the lions - he’s been Boris Johnson’s scapegoat before, during the prorogation crisis. And I’m sure readers of the National saw the drunk & disorderly smear against two of my SNP colleagues for what it was.\nThe real scandal here is not MPs who have outside interests or second jobs away from parliament but MPs who are being paid by corporate interests to use their influence as MPs to try to change government policy to the benefit of those corporations. It’s called corruption. And it’s rife on the Tory benches.\nReaders of the National will be aware that a number of SNP MPs have remunerated outside interests. I recently resumed my legal practice on a limited basis to defend a feminist against alleged hate crimes with some success. But there is no suggestion that any SNP MP has participated in the sort of corruption that some Tories are engaged in. But Johnson is desperate. Desperate to throw anyone and anything under the bus to distract from the real story which is his continuing willingness to rip up the rule book and ride roughshod over the law when it gets in his way.\nThis time he’s doing it to protect his corrupt cronies and to smear and undermine the thoroughly decent Standards Commissioner Kathryn Stone before she rules on any of his dodgy activities, including the renovation of the Downing Street Flat, and repeated freebie luxury holidays from his mates.\nHe did it with the unlawful prorogation of parliament. He did it with the Internal Market Bill. He’s done it with COVID, both with the Barnard Castle fiasco and, more importantly, with the ongoing scandal of the lucrative contracts handed to companies run by cronies and mates many of whom were totally lacking in the expertise to deliver.\nHis pathetic side kick, Dominic Raab, is planning to rip up the Human Rights Act. And their attacks on the devolved settlement are so frequent now they are almost unremarked. It took the Law Society of Scotland to point out that the UK Government should be seeking the legislative consent of the Scottish Parliament to meddle with judicial review in Scotland. So great is the onslaught it’s like playing whack-a-mole for the Scottish Government and the dispiriting knowledge that the UK Supreme Court will always uphold Westminster’s supremacy in the devolution deal doesn’t help.\nMeanwhile the House of Lords is packed with cronies who have forked out big time for the privilege and a millionaire donor to the Tory party gets a peerage as a prelude to shoehorning him into the Scotland Office as a minister. And still the leader of the opposition cannot bring himself to call for the abolition of the Lords. When Keir Starmer was asked whether abolition of the House of lords is an urgent matter for the Labour party he said Gordon Brown is looking into it. In Scotland we know what that means. Brown will get an unjustifiable and inexplicable amount of air time to talk about his grand plan, he won’t be subject to any in-depth questioning about it and absolutely nothing will happen. Words not deeds.\nModern Labour aren’t serious, they certainly aren’t serious about Scotland and they aren’t serious about making change in the UK or taking the fight to this appalling UK Government. If Keir Starmer was serious, he wouldn’t be farming out policy creation to some future Brown report when this is a live issue right now, he’d be immediately refusing to nominate Labour Peers and threatening to gum up business in the House of Lords and forcing a change in the system.\nAll of this just goes to illustrate how utterly broken Westminster is and why Scotland must have a fully worked out plan to exit this corrupt mess. Westminster has shown that is not capable of reforming itself. Years of bumping gums about the Lords with zero action is but one illustration of that. Yes, there are many good and decent English voters who long for a better politics, but the reality is that, even in the aftermath of the unlawful prorogation, Johnson secured a landslide south of the border. Labour don’t look any more like a government in waiting under Starmer than they did under Corbyn, and they are missing an open goal right now. My fear is that Johnson or indeed a successor such as Sunak will engineer another General Election at a time of his choosing to do the same again and stymie the chances of holding a second indyref in 2023.

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_scottish-labour-to-learn-from-welsh-colleagues/content_78.html": "Scottish Labour could stand to learn from their Welsh colleagues\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Dec 2020\nBravo for the Welsh Labour Government. Yes, you heard me right. After the Parliamentary Labour Party’s shameful capitulation on amendments tackling the Internal Market Bill’s devolved power grab it was surprising to see their comrades in Cardiff come out of the traps so quickly with a legal challenge to the bill. Surprising but exciting and what happens with the Welsh Government’s legal challenge could be very significant for Scotland.\nIt’s pretty desperate that we have had to be dependent on the House of Lords to ameliorate the bill. The sum total of all their efforts is very thin gruel and does not go anywhere even halfway near to addressing the Scottish Government’s concerns.\nEarlier in the week Labour peers sat on their hands when it came to amendments seeking to keep state aid a devolved matter and withdrew support for an amendment challenging the UK Government’s plans to engage in direct spending in devolved areas.\nWhen the amendments trundled back to the Commons the official opposition didn’t field a single backbencher to speak up for devolution. Whilst they only have one MP left in Scotland, they are not usually averse to putting forward MPs from other parts of these islands to opine on Scottish affairs but on this occasion their backbenches were deserted.\nThe power grab is in direct breach of the vow signed by Ed Miliband the Labour leader in 2014. But Labour don’t care. They are happy to wheel out Gordon Brown to talk about federalism when Independence is riding high in the polls but when it comes to defending the existing devolution settlement, they are missing in action. No wonder they are finished in Scotland. Their only real use now is as a salutary reminder of what happens to those who take their powerbase for granted.\nWhen challenged their hapless front bench spokesperson, a new Labourite with a Manchester constituency, was shrill in her outrage that SNP MPs should dare to question her holy writ. Drew Hendry’s actions on Wednesday evening expressed the frustrations of all of us who made the journey to Westminster to speak against the bill. It fell to the SNP to defend devolution. In the chamber, at least, we were doomed to fail but posterity will record that - with the honourable exception of Wendy Chamberlain the Liberal Democrat MP for North East Fife who spoke very powerfully on several occasions - it was only SNP MPs who stood up for devolution. That we were doomed to fail simply reinforces the case for independence.\nBut on Wednesday afternoon even before the Bill had passed in the Commons, the Welsh Labour Government upstaged their Westminster comrades as their Counsel General announced that the Bill was an attack on the rights of the Welsh Senedd to act on behalf of the people it represents and that he intended to take immediate action in Court to protect those rights.\nAs well as being the Welsh Government’s Chief Legal Adviser, Jeremy Miles is also a member of the Senedd and the Welsh Government’s European Transition Minister. He is an impressive politician who has worked closely with Mike Russell on trying to protect the devolved governments’ interests during the Brexit process. It is fair to say that their strenuous joint efforts have failed, and the only course of action open now is through the courts.\nIn his announcement Mr Miles said he had formally notified the UK Government that should the UK Parliament enact the Bill in its present form, he intended “to take immediate action to seek a declaration from the Administrative Court that the ambit of constitutional legislation cannot lawfully be cut down in this way and that the ensuing Act cannot be interpreted so as to have that effect”.\nWhat this means is that he will seek a ruling from the Administrative court (which sits in England and Wales only) that the Internal Market Act should be interpreted very restrictively so as not to limit the powers the Welsh Assembly already has under the Acts of Parliament which established it and gave it those powers.\nThis is very significant because it raises the question of whether the Westminster parliament is really as supreme as its aficionados claim. Can any Act of Parliament be overruled by a subsequent Act or are some Acts of such constitutional significance that subsequent Acts must be read in such a way that they don’t undermine the previous Act?\nThe answer to this question could have considerable significance for the Scottish Parliament in defending Scottish devolution, but it could also have wider significance in relation to the status of the Act of Union and the circumstances in which the British constitution might admit of the dissolution of the union.\nOn behalf of the Scottish Government, Mike Russell welcomed the Welsh Government’s announcement as ‘an important test of the principles and the legality” of the Internal Market Bill. He said that once the UK Government has replied to the legal notification from the Welsh government the Scottish Government ‘will work with Wales to consider next legal and constitutional steps.”\nIf anything, Scotland is in a stronger position than Wales here given our very different constitutional history. Our union with England is based on statute and treaty which long pre-date the very modern devolved settlement and our devolved parliament has been from the outset considerably more powerful than that of Wales. We have a stronger case than Wales, but it is one that will require to be tested in the Scottish courts under Scots law first albeit that we may end up side by side with Wales in the UK Supreme Court.\nIt is an unfortunate state of affairs that the Scottish Government’s Chief Legal Adviser, the Lord Advocate, is currently embroiled in trying to frustrate the well-intentioned Keatings case which seeks to establish whether the Scottish Parliament has the power to hold an independence referendum. As we enter 2021, his energies would be better spent advancing the case of Scottish democracy by defending the devolved settlement and testing whether Holyrood can hold an independence referendum with a carefully crafted Scottish Government bill for the courts to consider. Boris Johnson and his scheming anti-democratic Tory mates have been beaten in the courts before. It is time for us to look seriously at doing that again.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_salmond-inquiry-msps-committee-relevant-evidence-vital/content_269.html": "Alex Salmond inquiry: Why it’s vital MSPs’ committee sees ALL relevant evidence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 26th Feb 2021\nWhen Liam Fox stood up in the House of Commons this week and said that the ongoing controversy around the Holyrood Committee on the Scottish Government’s handling of Harassment complaints was threatening to “bring politics in the UK into international disrepute”, it was hard not to laugh. Liam Fox is a former Minister in a government which unlawfully prorogued parliament and threatened to break international law in order to get its own way. On that basis he and his Tory mates have done a pretty good job of bringing politics in the UK into international disrepute already.\nHaving regard to the farce that played out over Brexit, the litany of political chicanery and the disregard for the Rule of Law under Boris Johnson’s premiership, it would be easy just to say that Scotland will take no lectures from Westminster and leave it at that. But that would not be honest or candid.\nThe events of the last week have not been good for the reputation of Scottish politics or our devolved parliament. At UK level Brexit stress-tested the constitution and the separation of powers, particularly when Boris Johnson tried to do away with parliamentary scrutiny and the courts stepped into tell him that wouldn’t do. Now the Holyrood inquiry is stress testing the devolved settlement and the separation of powers in Scotland as allegations fly that the Executive and the Crown are frustrating the ability of a parliamentary inquiry to get to the truth of what has happened. Whether that is the case remains to be seen but the appearance of obstruction is not good for our democracy.\nThe hokey-cokey that has played out in relation to redactions to Alex Salmond’s written evidence has not only been farcical, it has also raised very real concerns about the separation of powers in our democracy and the ability of our parliament to hold the executive and other organs of the state to account for their actions.\nLet’s be clear about the remit of the inquiry. It is to consider and report on the actions of the First Minister, Scottish Government officials and special advisers in dealing with complaints about Alex Salmond under the Scottish Government’s “Handling of harassment complaints involving current or former ministers” procedure and actions in relation to the Scottish Ministerial Code. It is not a rerun of the complaints against Alex Salmond. In so far as the two original complaints from civil servants are concerned, in the Judicial Review case the court struck down the investigation into those complaints as unlawful and tainted by apparent bias. There has been no fresh investigation. So, there is no finding of culpability against Mr Salmond in respect of these complaints. Of course, that is not fair on the women who made the original complaints, and it is in the interests of those women and, indeed everyone, to find out why the system failed them.\nIn relation to the criminal complaints that were made, Mr Salmond has been acquitted of all the charges. Much as some journalists and some politicians may have been very invested in a guilty verdict, they need to accept the verdict of the jury who heard and saw all the relevant evidence. As the Faculty of Advocates reminded us yesterday, the rule of law and maintaining confidence in the judicial system demands that the verdict of the impartial jury must be respected. It should not be second guessed for political motives.\nYes, in his own words Mr Salmond is no saint; but being no saint and engaging in harassment or non-consensual sexual activity are two very different things. There has been no finding that he did either.\nSo, to return to the events of the last week, after much legal toing and froing, a judgement from Lady Dorrian clarifying the scope of the order preventing the publication of the names and identity of the complainers in the criminal case, and the involvement of Scottish Parliament’s Corporate Body - Mr Salmond lodged two written evidence submissions which the inquiry published on Monday evening. They were widely read and shared on social and mainstream media.\nIn two respects his evidence was explosive. Firstly, he made detailed allegations that the ministerial code has been breached. Secondly, he made very serious allegations that certain named individuals had engaged in a “deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort ….to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned”.\nOn Tuesday, at the behest of the Crown Office, the Corporate Body of the parliament withdrew the first submission (which deals with the ministerial code not the conspiracy allegations) then re-published it with redactions which appeared to relate to the issue of whether the Ministerial Code had been breached. There was an uproar with claims of censorship from some journalists.\nNo one, least of all those of us who have specialised in prosecuting sex crime, would disagree that court orders protecting the anonymity of complainers must be respected. The issue seems to be whether the redactions can legitimately be justified on that basis. It is a matter of record that when the Spectator magazine published the same evidence the Crown asked them only to redact one paragraph. Now, apparently at the insistence of the Crown, there are five redacted paragraphs, but we don’t know why so much more was redacted. When the Lord Advocate came to parliament, he left that question unanswered. Meantime, anyone interested in the case can still easily access the redacted paragraphs elsewhere and see what they say.\nThe position of the Lord Advocate has come under fire. I agree with my colleagues in the Faculty of Advocates that his independent role must be respected, and I am going to put my cards on the table here. I know the present Lord Advocate well. We worked together in Crown office as Advocate Deputes a decade ago. He is a very well-respected lawyer and regarded by his legal peers as good and honourable man. I find it impossible to believe he would give in to political pressure. But the problem is that because of the lack of a colourable explanation as to what has occurred a suspicion has grown up that someone within the Crown Office has done just that.\nThe Lord Advocate is the head of the Crown Office and ultimately answerable for their actions. The fact that he is also a Minister in the Scottish Government is less than ideal. Most countries separate out the roles of head of the prosecution service and Government legal adviser for good reason. This case shows why.\nAdmittedly this is an historic problem not of this Government’s making. Indeed, the Scottish Government’s powers to do anything about this are limited because the role of the Lord Advocate and his position as a minister are reserved under the Scotland Act. I believe it is time that Scotland considered moving to the same system as in England and Wales where a civil servant is employed as Director of Public Prosecutions quite separately from the political appointment of a Government law officer.\nFinally, in relation to the allegations of a ‘conspiracy’, Mr Salmond says that the Crown hold the “most obvious and compelling evidence of such conduct” but they are refusing to release it. We should not assume he has made these allegations lightly. He is prepared to repeat them on oath. Moreover, the chair of the committee, Linda Fabiani, an SNP MSP, has expressed frustration and the Committee is now going to try to use its statutory powers to force the Crown to release this information. They are right to do so. It is in the public interest that the committee should be able to establish whether these very serious allegations are true.\nThe fallout from this unprecedented situation is not just resonating in Westminster. The New York Times has covered the story and, closer to home, the Irish Times. When I had a regular meeting with diplomats from the embassies of other European states earlier this week, they wanted to know what on earth is going on and what will be the likely repercussions.\nAnd it is not just Scotland’s international reputation which is at stake. What of the people closer to home whom we still have to persuade of the benefits of independence? The last thing we need is for confidence in our parliament and institutions to be undermined. The Tories want to diminish devolution and our parliament. We must not let them have fuel.\nYes, independence is riding high in the polls and so is the SNP, but we must not be complacent or hubristic. History teaches us that big opinion poll leads can be lost – just look at how Theresa May came a cropper in the 2017 General Election.\nThe committee must be able to hear all the relevant evidence. If redactions are to be made, they need to be justified properly. Those giving evidence to the committee should treat their oath with the seriousness it deserves. I have no doubt that whilst other witnesses haven’t exactly covered themselves in glory, the current and former First Ministers will be different in this respect.\nSo, let’s make sure the committee sees and hears all the relevant evidence. As a famous US Supreme Court Justice once said – sunlight is the best disinfectant. The “nothing to see here” brigade who are trying to blame all this on ‘bad actors on social media’ need to wise up and think of the reputation of their party, parliament and country.",

The vast majority were opposed to construction of more student accommodation in the area. There was clear support for redevelopment of the scrapyard site and particularly for the creation of direct access to the canal from Dundee Street. Like my constituents, I would welcome those proposals, but any proposed direct access to the canal should be suitable for all pedestrians, including those using wheelchairs or mobility aids.\nSuggestions were also made that this site would be better suited to development of affordable housing or a public park instead. There is already an overabundance of student housing within a half mile radius – including Bainfield, Arran House, Fountainbridge iQ and Westfield Avenue and several more nearby in Dalry and Gorgie.\nI feel that the local community should be protected from experiencing an excessive concentration of student accommodation to an extent that would be detrimental to the maintenance of balanced communities or to the established character and residential amenity of the area. Diversity is important in our local communities. It is also necessary for residents to be able to build an attachment to their local area and find a sense of permanence. If there are a disproportionate number of temporary residents such as students in self-contained accommodation, that diversity is lost and the community suffers from having fewer long-term residents to build and maintain it.\nThere is a balance to be struck between the needs of students and the needs of residents who have made this area their home. In this particular case, it is clear that the local area neither needs nor would benefit from another student housing complex.\nAs MP for the area I have already submitted a formal objection. There is still time to lodge your view on the project. The deadline for commenting on the application is Wednesday 24 August 2022. I know many people have added their views already. If you have not already done so, I would encourage you to do this now. The easiest way to make comments is to use the online Planning Portal planning application 22/03556/FUL here.\nComments can also be submitted to the Chief Planning Officer in writing at: Chief Planning Officer, PLACE, Waverley Court, 4 East Market Street, Edinburgh, EH8 8BG quoting the reference 22/03556/FUL\nIf you are unable to add your comments online and would like some help writing, please drop into my office at 139 Dundee Street and my team can help you.\nHere is my objection in full – please feel free to use its contents if you wish.\nObjection - planning application 22/03556/FUL\nAs Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South West, I object to planning application 22/03556/FUL on behalf of constituents who have contacted me with serious concerns about the proposed development.\nMy constituents tell me that while they do support development of the site for the good of the community, these proposals for Purpose Built Student Housing (PBSA) will have a damaging impact on them and on the local area.\nThere is potential for positive development at this site if the views of local residents are taken into account. I carried out a survey of local residents earlier this year. While the vast majority were opposed to construction of more PBSA in the area, there was clear support for redevelopment of the existing scrapyard site and particularly for the creation of direct access to the canal from Dundee Street. Suggestions were made that this site would be better suited to development of affordable housing or a public park instead of PBSA.\nLike my constituents, I welcome proposals to create direct access to the canal from Dundee Street. However, I am disappointed that this would not be accessible to all if these proposals were accepted in their current form. I am aware of concerns raised by my colleague Cllr David Key about the lack of an accessible or step-free route through the site. I support his view that any proposed direct access to the canal should be suitable for all pedestrians, including those using wheelchairs or mobility aids.\nMy main concern is that this proposal is not in line with Policy Hou 8 Student Accommodation. This is intended to protect communities from experiencing an excessive concentration of student accommodation to an extent that would be detrimental to the maintenance of balanced communities or to the established character and residential amenity of the locality.\nThis proposal contributes to what is quickly becoming an overabundance of student housing in this area. There are already several purpose-built student housing complexes within a half mile radius – including Bainfield, Arran House, Fountainbridge iQ and Westfield Avenue. There are several further PBSA developments very nearby in Dalry and Gorgie.\nIt is important that there is diversity in the social composition of residents to create a strong and sustainable community. It is also necessary for residents to be able to build an attachment to their surroundings and find a sense of permanence. If there are a disproportionate number of transient residents of a particular demographic in self-contained accommodation, this diversity is lost and the community suffers from having fewer long-term residents to build and maintain it.\nThere is a balance to be struck between the needs of students and the needs of residents who have made this area their home. In this particular case, it is clear that the local area neither needs nor would benefit from another student housing complex.\nI trust that the Planning Committee will listen to the views of local residents and ensure that it prioritises the diversity, vibrancy and sustainability of the community in Fountainbridge in its decision-making process.",

This time, we turn our attention to what select committees are doing to ensure that human rights of everyone in the UK are protected.\nThe host for this season is Joanna Cherry KC, the Scottish National Party Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South West, and Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights.\nEpisode 1\nVictims of modern slavery have been found working in homes in the United Kingdom, in our agricultural fields, and in our supply chains. But the UK, once seen as a champion for victims of modern slavery, is now thought to be a bit less of a standard bearer. We’ll hear why.\nTo discuss what the UK is doing to protect those who are at risk of becoming victims of modern slavery we spoke to Professor Dame Sara Thornton. She was the Government's Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner until April last year, when she completed her three-year term of office. Her role is still vacant.\nTo hear how select committees are considering this topic, we spoke to Sarah Champion MP, Chair of the International Development Committee, and Labour MP for Rotherham, as well as Tim Loughton, the Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, who sits on the Home Affairs Committee.\nThe Podcast\nSpecial guests, former Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, Professor Dame Sara Thornton; Chair of the International Development Committee, Sarah Champion MP; and member of the Home Affairs Committee, Tim Loughton MP give their views on the urgent priorities around modern slavery and the UK Government’s response to it.\nThe podcast recognises the scale of the problem within the UK. Sara Thornton warns that “in 2021, 12,600 potential victims were identified, but in fact… the number experts predict is probably around a hundred thousand”. She also highlights the global aspect, adding, “forced labour is pervasive in global supply chains, and the focus really, needs to be on finding it and fixing it, and ensure that those who are affected, those who are exploited, have some sort of reparation or remedy.”\nThe former Anti-Slavery Commissioner welcomed the impact of the 2015 Modern Slavery Act, in particular the “genuinely world-leading” efforts to address “forced labour risks in these very long global opaque supply chains”. However, she warned that, in her view, the UK was now lagging behind international partners and the Government had changed focus, “the emphasis appears now to be on immigration and small boats, rather than… trying to catch up a little bit with the rest of the world on legislation about business and human rights.”\nMeasures in the Nationalities and Borders Act 2022 may make the fight against modern slavery more difficult, Sara Thornton said, “I was particularly concerned about provisions to restrict protections for those with criminal convictions. That would make it very much harder to prosecute offenders. I was also concerned that we were saying that potential victims would have a deadline in which to disclose their exploitation.”\nThe wide-ranging interview with the former Commissioner includes discussion of the definitions of modern slavery; the ‘chill effect’ of the 2022 Nationality and Borders Act on the confidence of potential victims to come forward; the problems of viewing modern slavery through the lens of immigration and debate on small boat crossings across the English Channel.\nTim Loughton raised concerns about the growth in claims from Albania, questioning “why has there been such a big upsurge in the numbers from a particular country now claiming modern day slavery?”. He argued that the UK needed to work closely with the Albanian authorities to understand the drivers of this growth and ensure potential victims of modern slavery were better supported.\nThe MP added, “there's a stronger case for people being looked after back in their own country where they've got family networks and other support networks, and can be properly protected if they are generally victims of modern-day slavery, rather than in a foreign country.” He further warned that wrongful claims of modern slavery risked undermining public confidence in wider the asylum system.\nSarah Champion called for greater awareness of gender-based violence, “we need to be very clear that women are particularly at risk of this. I've met too many young women who thought that they were coming for jobs and have ended up in the sex industry in this country.”\nThe Chair of the International Development Committee also highlighted Home Office failures in providing appropriate care for unaccompanied children who have claimed asylum in the UK. She said, “A number of those children are going missing. And when they are found, they are found to be in the slavery underground”. She called on the Government to do more to recognise these children as victims and ensure an adequate support network was in place to keep them safe.\nProfessor Dame Sara Thornton’s term of office finished in April 2022 and the post of Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner remains vacant. The delay in appointing a new Commissioner is of ‘huge concern’, she says. “We need a fearless, independent voice to scrutinise what the Government’s proposing in its desires to reform modern slavery legislation” she says.\n“But also, more positively, we need somebody who can work with business, with law enforcement, with civil society to improve awareness, and improve the effectiveness of responses to modern slavery.\"\nTranscript\nJoanna Cherry: Hello, and welcome to Committee Corridor. You join us for the first episode of our third series as our attention turns to matters of human rights and justice.\nWe've moved from international issues with the former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Conservative MP, Tom Tugendhat, to the Cost-of-Living Crisis with Labour MP and Chair of the Business Committee, Darren Jones.\nI'm Joanna Cherry, the Scottish National Party member of Parliament for Edinburgh South West, and Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. And I'll be your host for this series of Committee Corridor.\nFirst up is the topic of modern slavery in the UK. It's closer than you think.\nVictims of modern slavery have been found working in homes in the United Kingdom, in our agricultural fields, and in our supply chains. But the UK, once seen as a champion for victims of modern slavery, is now thought to be a bit less of a standard bearer.\nThere have been calls for changes to modern slavery laws to discourage the tide of small boats crossing the channel, but others, including former Prime Minister, Theresa May, have warned that changes mustn't make it harder for victims of modern slavery to make their case.\nAnd they've also argued that conflating immigration, asylum, and human trafficking is hugely problematic. Later, we'll be hearing from two parliamentarians whose committees have been working in this area.\nSarah Champion chairs the International Development Committee, and is the Labour MP for Rotherham. And Tim Loughton is the Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, and he sits on the Home Affairs Committee.\nBut first, I'm going to speak to Professor Dame Sara Thornton, who was the government's independent anti-slavery Commissioner until April last year, when she completed her three-year term of office.\nHer role was created by the 2015 Modern Slavery Act, and it's to give independent advice on modern slavery issues, and how they should be addressed. No successor has been appointed by the government to the role of commissioner, as yet,\nJoanna: Welcome to Committee Corridor, and we're delighted to have with us for this episode, Professor Dame Sara Thornton. Sara, can you tell us what makes an individual a victim of modern slavery.\nSara Thornton: In the UK, we use modern slavery as an umbrella term to describe slavery, human trafficking, domestic servitude, forced labour, and criminal exploitation. And in terms of victims, we've signed international agreements to protect victims of slavery and trafficking. And so, first responders such as police officers, border force officials, local authority workers, have responsibility to refer those who they think might be victims of modern slavery to the home office, so that support can be provided.\nAnd this is known as the national referral mechanism. And support can be accommodation in a safe house, it can be healthcare, counseling, a support worker, or legal advice.\nJoanna: And I mean, at the moment the problems with these small boat crossings are very topical, but can you help us understand the difference between human trafficking, people smuggling, and modern slavery. Am I right in thinking that these terms aren't really interchangeable?\nSara: No, they're not. And as I say, modern slavery is an umbrella term, which would include human trafficking but not people smuggling.\nSo, put simply, people are victims of human trafficking when they're moved for the purposes of exploitation, and they don't have to be moved across borders for that to happen. Whereas people smuggling, that's a crime against the state where people are moved illegally across borders. And it's frustrating when the terms are used interchangeably because they are different. Although in reality, for some victims, this situation is much, much more fluid. For example, they might seek to be smuggled across a border to pursue economic opportunities.\nIn doing so, though, they're putting their lives in the hands of criminals. And so, they might end up being exploited and end up in fact, being trafficked.\nJoanna: The issue of modern slavery is very topical at the moment. Can you tell us what the current picture is and whether it's changed or not over recent years?\nSara: In September last year, the global slavery estimates were published, and they showed that 50 million people were in modern slavery across the globe, about 28 million in forced labour.\nAnd that is in fact, 10 million more than when the estimates were last done five years ago. The issue has been very much exacerbated by COVID, by conflict and instability, poverty and climate change, all of which create vulnerability to exploitation.\nAnd then if we look at the UK situation, in 2021, 12,600 potential victims were identified, but in fact, using estimate methodology, the number experts predict is probably around a hundred thousand. So, it is a substantial issue both in the UK and throughout the world.\nJoanna: Now, the former Prime Minister, Theresa May, was very proud of her work, which led to the 2015 Modern Slavery Act, which brought existing offences into law across the United Kingdom, and created new duties and powers to protect victims and to prosecute offenders.\nCan you give us a feel for how successful that act has been?\nSara: Well, the act brought together all the legislation on slavery and trafficking. Unfortunately, that's not led to a huge leap in the numbers of prosecutions because cases are often very lengthy and complex and do require expertise.\nBut the act also provided for modern slavery risk orders, and modern slavery prevention orders, which have been used increasingly over the years to protect victims from known offenders. The Act also established the role of Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, which was a role which I held until April last year. And so, of course, I think it's a good piece of legislation. Unfortunately, the post is currently vacant.\nBut I think the bit of the legislation, which was genuinely world-leading, was the legislation on supply chains. And that very much was one of the first countries in which there was that emphasis on greater transparency, and really understanding what are the forced labour risks in these very long global opaque supply chains.\nJoanna: So, as I understand that, under the legislation, business and procurement leaders in the United Kingdom have a responsibility to check their supply chains for modern slavery.\nI mean, what does that involve? And is UK business doing enough to fulfil its obligations?\nSara: Businesses that are in scope of the legislation are generally writing modern slavery statements as required. But I would say having read quite a lot of them, there's a tendency for them to be about policy rather than performance. Maybe a bit of a tick box.\nMy argument would be that forced labour is pervasive in global supply chains, and the focus really needs to be on finding it and fixing it, and ensure that those who are affected, those who are exploited, have some sort of reparation or remedy.\nAnd one of the things I currently do is work with investors to help them to use their influence on business to tackle forced labour in supply chains.\nJoanna: I mean, can you give us an example of businesses in the United Kingdom where forced labour exists in the supply chain?\nSara: Well, there've been lots of different examples. One of the cases that I particularly highlighted when I was the commissioner was a case of forced labour in the agricultural sector where organised crime groups were bringing vulnerable people from Poland, hundreds of them we believe, and they were working in fields and in factories.\nThey were having all their money, bar about £20 a week taken from them, and they were living in the most squalid conditions, and they were absolutely restricted in their movements. And they were under great fear and felt for a long time until one of them asked for help, that they really couldn't escape. Those farms were in the tier one of the supply chains for all our major supermarkets.\nJoanna: You spoke there, Sara, about working with investors to try, and address modern slavery in supply chains. Are there any lessons for us in the United Kingdom from practice elsewhere in the world?\nSara: Both the United States and the European Union have been making great progress in this area.\nIn the United States, they use import bans to stop goods made with forced labour entering United States, and they have two pieces of legislation; the Tariff Act, and then the recent Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which came into effect last year.\nAnd there were examples which I've come across such as Top Glove in Malaysia, which made lots of rubber gloves very, very busy during COVID. But huge issues about forced labour.\nThe Americans put an import ban on all their goods entering the American market. But the company really put great energy and effort into fixing the problem, and paying millions of dollars in reparation to the workers that had been affected. So, it can have an impact.\nAnd then in the European Union, there are proposals to introduce both mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence for businesses. And also, more recently in the EU, they announced forced labour import bans. So, both of those areas really kind of making great progress.\nThe UK government, on the other hand, did announce some modest improvements to transparency and supply chains in last year's Queen speech. But to date, no bill has been published.\nAnd unfortunately, the emphasis appears now to be on immigration and small boats, rather than on really just kind of trying to catch up a little bit with the rest of the world on legislation about business and human rights.\nJoanna: Well, just picking up on that current emphasis, of course, the Nationality and Borders Act came into force last year, and part five of it deals with modern slavery. What's been the impact of that on the United Kingdom's policy approach to modern slavery?\nSara: There was a great deal of concern about this act. In terms of implementation. I think it's still too early to say, but for example, I was particularly concerned about provisions to restrict protections for those with criminal convictions. That would make it very much harder to prosecute offenders.\nI was also concerned that we were saying that potential victims would have a deadline in which to disclose their exploitation. I suspect both measures will be hard to implement but those sorts of things cause great concern.\nJoanna: And why would it be so problematic for potential victims of human trafficking to have a deadline to disclose their information?\nSara: Well, can you imagine saying to victims of, say, rape or sexual assault: \"If you don't tell us what's happened to you within a month, we will take the view that that undermines your credibility.\"\nThat's what the law is saying with regard to potential victims of modern slavery — that if you don't disclose within a set period of time, we will view that as undermining your credibility. There are all sorts of reasons why victims are not able to disclose.\nFor a start, they need to trust the person they're speaking to, but also, they might well be severely traumatized, and so their recall is not straightforward. Their memory will come back piecemeal over time. And what we find with victims is often, that as they develop more trusting relationships with support workers, for example, that's when you get full disclosure.\nSo, I just think as a comparison with other victims, it's kind of a shocking idea. But also, it really doesn't in any way take into account everything we know about the way in which victims disclose the awful things that have happened to them.\nJoanna: Yeah, I mean, you previously worked as a police officer, and I previously worked as a sex crimes prosecutor, and those are simply not the same standards that we apply to complainers and sexual offences across the United Kingdom. Are they? It's well-recognised and there's expert evidence which shows that many victims of sexual violence take a long time to disclose what's happened to them, and that that's well-recognised in our domestic courts dealing with domestic victims.\nSo, it does seem a bit surprising that we wouldn't recognise that in relation to victims of modern slavery.\nSara: That's exactly my point.\nJoanna: In terms of the Nationality and Borders Act, responsibility for modern slavery has shifted from the Minister for Safeguarding to the Minister for Immigration, and sits with their responsibilities on illegal migration and asylum.\nDo you think that's an important distinction? I mean, what does it tell us about the government's direction of travel?\nSara: I think it shows that the government are prioritizing immigration control over the protection of the vulnerable.\nIn fact, in December, ministerial responsibilities were updated to show that the safeguarding minister did have responsibility for wider safeguarding policy and modern slavery policy in general, and the Immigration Minister just responsibility for abuse of the system.\nBut of course, I think the problem remains because the Immigration Minister is so much more senior than the Safeguarding Minister.\nJoanna: I mean, is it appropriate, in your opinion, to look at modern slavery through the lens of immigration policy?\nSara: I think it's particularly problematic. When Theresa May was Home Secretary and then Prime Minister, so much was done, I think, to think about this as a crime.\nThe trafficking of human beings, the enslavement of human beings is a crime against vulnerable victims. And to look at it just through an immigration lens is potentially so damaging.\nJoanna: And I mean, what do you think the impact of the new act could be on victims of modern slavery?\nSara: I think the act in general had a chill effect on the fight against modern slavery because the focus was really on the removal of support rather than additional protections. And I think that undermines the confidence of what are very vulnerable people. It undermines their confidence to come forward for help and particularly, if their immigration status is not secure.\nAnd I think that could lead to a change in reported numbers. If you are an adult and a first responder wants to refer you as a potential victim, you have to consent to be referred. And interestingly, in 2021, over 3,000 potential victims decline that support. My concern is that the number of potential victims who will decline support in future will only increase.\nJoanna: The Home Secretary has said that some people are gaming the system. Some people are gaming the system of anti-slavery law and human trafficking law in order to avoid being deported. Do you think there's any evidence for that?\nSara: So, the claim of abuse in the system has been repeatedly made over the last couple of years. And I and other colleagues in the sector and other politicians and those who are interested, have asked for the evidence of that abuse. And I'm afraid it has never been provided.\nThe Home Office positive decision rate for victims of modern slavery is 90%. That, in my view, doesn't suggest that there is abuse of the system. And it's been particularly an issue in terms of the small boats.\nI agree entirely that we need to stop people taking perilous journeys in small boats, and there needs to be a considered and detailed analysis of this problem. But what happens is the small boats this year over the summer was characterized as Albanians falsely claiming modern slavery.\nYou know, most people who are crossing the channel are actually from countries such as Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, and they're rightly granted asylum in this country.\nSo, first of all, to characterize it as an Albanian economic migrant issue, I think is not right in fact. But also, when I've dug into the figures, very few of those making the crossing are actually being referred to as potential victims of modern slavery.\nIn 2021, I estimated it to be about 4% of those making the crossing. And I've only got partial data for 2022, but I think it's a similar level. So, there's a real issue about the rhetoric and the lack of evidence and data to stand up the claims that are being made.\nJoanna: Thank you. Now, you completed your three-year term as the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner in April, 2022. And your predecessor, the first Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner, Kevin Hyland, resigned citing government interference in his role.\nWhen you left, you told the Independent newspaper that the government's asylum overhaul was driven by political calculation rather than by expertise, and that the fight against modern slavery in Britain wasn't what it had been. What did you mean by that?\nSara: I think the points that I've just made about the way in which the evidence is just not there for the sort of rhetoric that's being used particularly around the small boats issue, that was my concern there.\nIn terms of the fight against modern slavery not being what it used to be, we had a Home Secretary, then a Prime Minister who championed the need to tackle modern slavery.\nI'm afraid subsequent governments have really just focused on the alleged abuse of the system. And that is very, very different. And it's something that of course, is noticed in the rest of the world. We did have a very strong reputation for taking a lead in the fight against modern slavery, that is no longer the case.\nJoanna: And of course, Theresa May herself has recently expressed concern about the government's direction of travel, hasn't she?\nSara: She has. She's spoken up in parliament on several occasions. And I think that she is right to do so.\nWhen ministers, when the Prime Minister make these comments about alleged abuse, I think they just undermine the confidence of the most vulnerable people to come forward. As I say, I think it has a chill effect on confidence, and I think we should all be concerned about that.\nJoanna: Now, looking to the future, what would be your hopes or indeed, fears for the next independent commissioner?\nThe government are under a legal duty to appoint one, but it seems to be taking a long time for them to do that. What are the consequences if they don't?\nSara: I mean, I think the delay in appointment is of huge concern. We need a fearless, independent voice to scrutinize what the government's proposing in its desires to reform modern slavery legislation.\nBut also, more positively, we need somebody who can work with business, with law enforcement, with civil society to improve awareness, and improve the effectiveness of responses to modern slavery. And in particular, an Independent Anti-slavery Commissioner can focus on evidence and data and research. And I think when it comes to public policy, those sorts of contributions are really important to both understanding the problem and developing effective responses to it.\nJoanna: So, that's really a plea for evidence-based policymaking, isn't it, Sara?\nSara: It is. And as somebody who spends some of my time in university now, I think the importance of using the insights from research, using the evidence and the data to assess objectively and independently is a really key part of public discourse.\nJoanna: Professor Dame Sara Thornton, that's been a very interesting discussion, and thank you for your time.\nSara: Thank you. It's been my pleasure.\nJoanna: Several select committees are looking into different aspects of modern slavery. We are going to speak to two Members of Parliament now who are involved in that work.\nTim Loughton is the Conservative Member of Parliament for Worthing and Shoreham, and he sits on the Home Affairs Committee. It's been looking into channel crossings and the wider issues of migration and asylum.\nThe International Development Committee has recently begun investigating how the government spends aid on refugees here in the United Kingdom. It's chaired by Sarah Champion MP, the Labour Member of Parliament for Rotherham.\nTim, you're very welcome. Can I ask you: the Home Affairs Committee have been looking at the issues of migration and asylum along with our separate inquiry into the channel crossings. Where does modern slavery fit into that picture?\nTim: Well, hi Joanna, and this is obviously, a really topical subject and it's taken up a lot of time with the Home Affairs Select Committee. We did a big study on the channel crossings before last summer, but obviously, it wasn't an issue which stopped over the summer.\nSo, we've done various hearings since. Including the particular issue about the very large number of Albanians coming across in small boats. And the particularly topical feature that many of those Albanians come across in small boats claiming asylum are also now, claiming they are victims of modern-day slavery.\nJoanna: Sara Thornton says that really, that's only a tiny percentage of asylum seekers, the Albanians. If you look at the overall picture, what evidence have you heard on that?\nTim: Well, if you look at the figures for last year, I think just over 43,000 people came across the channel in small boats in 2022. And of course, they were coming throughout the year. It wasn't just a feature of the, of the summer.\nNow, of those 43,000, just over 13,000 were Albanian nationals, the vast majority of whom were single young men. And yet, nothing has changed in Albania. That figure was just 50 a couple of years ago.\nThere's not a civil war in Albania. They’ve not had a huge issue around human rights abuse. But all of a sudden, we saw this large surge in Albanian nationals coming across the channel that was part of the problem we have with the crowding crisis at Manston, that obviously, was a big problem in the summer. And then with that, there's been a big surge in the numbers of people that claiming that they are also victims of modern-day slavery who happen to be Albanians.\nSo, there's a bit of a trend going on here. And obviously, it's not terribly credible that all of a sudden, a lot of Albanians need to leave Albania, and all of a sudden, a lot of these Albanians are victims of modern-day slavery.\nSo, hence, we had the Albanian Ambassador in front of us a few weeks ago to ask him some questions about why this phenomenon is now happening.\nJoanna: The Home Secretary, Suella Braverman has suggested that some people are using modern slavery laws to game the asylum system. Now, on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, when we put this to expert witnesses who came to speak to us about this issue, they said that there was no evidence, no data to suggest that people are gaming or abusing the system using modern slavery laws.\nNow, you were able to put questions directly to the Home Secretary. Did she produce any evidence or data to support the claim that people are gaming the asylum system?\nTim: From memory, we didn't go into great detail about modern-day slavery when we interviewed the Home Secretary, there was quite a lot else we wanted to tackle on around the boats, and of course, the whole safe and legal routes which was my line of questioning, which seemed to have got quite a lot of attention.\nI just think the figures speak for themselves. And why has there been such a big upsurge in the numbers from a particular country now claiming modern day slavery?\nSo, when we tackled the Albanian Ambassador to say, “Is it safe in Albania?” He said, “Yes”. “Is there any reason for people to be fleeing from Albania and to claim asylum in other European countries?” He said, “No”. And indeed, many other EU countries do not recognise asylum claims from Albania at all.\nBut we also asked him about those people claiming to be the victims of modern-day slavery, and he agreed there may well be some because of criminal gangs operating, which we know, and they're responsible for people coming across the channel and operating some of the boats as well as drug gangs and others.\nBut we also put it to him that, of course, if you are identified as a victim of modern-day slavery, that does not entitle you to residency in this case, the UK. It gives you some safeguards whilst it's being investigated but it doesn't mean that you have then to stay in the UK.\nAnd I would suggest that actually, there's a stronger case for people being looked after back in their own country where they've got family networks and other support networks, and can be properly protected if they are generally victims of modern-day slavery, rather than in a foreign country at the hands of some of these gangs, pimps, whoever they may be away from familiar family, friends, and networks.\nSo, if people are claiming modern-day slavery in the UK, fine, we need to be working very closely with the Albanian authorities to see what Albania is doing to make sure one; that they're looked after in Albania before they do get trafficked if they are being trafficked, or that they can go back to Albania and be properly protected by any criminal gangs who are threatening them.\nJoanna: I suppose ultimately we'll have to wait for these Albanians claims to work their way through the system before it can be judged whether or not they're gaming the system. But I take your point about the increase in Albanians coming across on the small channel crossings.\nTim: And the point also on that journey is, of course, there is this huge backlog. So, we're looking at quite historic data here, and one of the alarming things when we were questioning Home Office officials was that 96% of the cases (this was before Christmas, of those coming across the channel) have not yet been resolved.\nAnd those that have been resolved tend to be the more vulnerable, particularly women and younger people that they're looking at first because they are likely to have a stronger claim for asylum and protection.\nSo, I think we're going to have to wait a while until at long last, the Home Office has caught up on its backlog really to analyse the legitimacy of those people coming across the channel and claims for asylum as well as those then claiming for modern-day slavery being victims of this as well.\nJoanna: In the last Queen's speech in May, 2022, there was an announcement of a new modern slavery bill, mostly to apply to England and Wales with some parts affecting all of the UK.\nAnd the changes aimed to increase transparency and accountability for business and supply chains, but they also proposed to enshrine in law legal obligations to victims of modern slavery.\nBut we just heard from Professor Dame Sara Thornton that there has been no movement there. Do you think the policy emphasis has shifted and is now on the small boats crisis?\nTim: I think it's become more complicated. So, clearly, the legislation which Theresa May pioneered with the Modern-Day Slavery Act back in 2015, was a leading piece of ground-breaking legislation and it’s to the UK government's credit that we have got those protections and recognising that this abhorrent practice is going on in the 21st century.\nI think recent events, particularly with the numbers coming from Albania, now, all of a sudden, presenting as victims of modern-day slavery have led to these suggestions. And you are right, we need more data and as I've just said about the backlog of cases to prove that this is a way of gaming the system for some people. And of course, the biggest victims of all of that are those who are genuinely victims of modern-day slavery who've been grouped in with everybody else who are claiming it fraudulently.\nSo, I think we needed to sort out clarity around the law anyway to make sure that those people who are genuine victims are seen as victims rather than seen as coming here illegally and being part of the illegal migrant problems.\nSo, we need greater protections there but also, we need to make it much clearer what the duties and responsibilities of employers and landlords are in this country as well before they unwittingly take on somebody who turns out to be a victim of modern-day slavery, or a perpetrator of modern-day slavery as well.\nJoanna: I mean, I suppose one of the best ways to monitor how the law is operating within the United Kingdom, and to make sure it's operating fairly and not being abused, would be to have in place an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. It's his or her function to be an independent monitoring body, which falls under the auspices of the Home Office.\nNow, as you know, Tim, the post has been empty since April 2022. Why do you think it's taking so long to appoint a successor to Dame Sara Thornton, and what are the risks of the delay?\nTim: Yes, I think you’re right. It's a really important role and particularly, as it was a new law, you need to make sure that there is some expert monitoring of how it's working and that it's being used as it was intended to be used. And that the Home Office is respecting the law as it was intended to be used as well and there are proper protections being followed by all parties for those genuine victims.\nI don't know why the post hasn't been filled since April ‘22. I think it's really important that a new candidate is put in posters soon as possible, and at least because of this conflagration has now become between modern-day slavery and people being trafficked across the channel.\nWe have of course had several Home Secretaries over that time. And then we've had the Home Secretary has been a Home Secretary twice.\nSo, it's clearly on their to-do list, but I think it needs to be shunted up the priorities rather more, because it's become very topical issue, and it's all part of the log jam that there is in the Home Office and border force in the processing of migration cases.\nAnd I think the Anti-Slavery Commissioner will have an important role to make sure that that can be done without throwing out the baby with the bathwater. And people need protection actually falling foul of the blitz that we need to have on speeding up all these asylum applications and clearing that backlog.\nJoanna: Well, thanks, Tim. It's really interesting to hear your perspective as a member of the Home Affairs Select committee. So, we're really grateful to you for giving up your time today. Thanks.\nTim: It's been a pleasure.\nJoanna: We've heard from Tim about his concerns about the number of people, particularly Albanians, making the dangerous crossing from France to England in small boats.\nBut I'm now going to speak to Sarah Champion, who is the Labour MP for Rotherham, and the Chair of the International Development Committee. And her concerns are very different.\nThe International Development Committee has recently published the government's response to a report that you did on preventing mass atrocities, and you've secured a win.\nI think ministers have accepted that a cross-government approach is necessary. Why is that important to our conversation today on modern slavery?\nSarah Champion: Well, slavery doesn't operate in isolation. It a horrific by-product of when things go horribly wrong in countries around the world.\nSo, when we look at atrocities, they drive people from their homes. I mean, you only need to look in sort of refugees coming from Ukraine. It's not their choice to be fleeing their country, to be leaving behind everything that they have fought for and have had for all of their lives. They're doing it because of the atrocities that are being perpetrated by Russia.\nIf we don't try and prevent atrocities and crimes against humanity, we can do it by spotting the early warning signs. But if we don't then we see other people coming into those spaces seeking to use those tensions to radicalise groups, causing unrest, causing terrorism.\nAnd I just think from a moral point of view, when there are very clear steps that lead to atrocities, that lead to genocide, why on earth wouldn't we as a country try and do more to prevent it, not only for the people that are involved, but also, for global stability.\nAnd so it's quite frustrating that the government haven't gone as far as we recommended and brought a national strategy to prevent enocide. But we are very glad that they now have a central hub that is looking to coordinate our efforts around the world.\nJoanna: And I suppose, I guess, what I'm really keen to understand in relation to what we're discussing today, is how the prevention of mass atrocities might impact on the prevention of modern slavery in the United Kingdom.\nSarah: It's a very small step for someone to begin the process of fleeing their country to being picked up by someone who is looking to traffic and exploit them. We see this happen time and time again.\nOne of the biggest frustrations I've had since being Chair of IDC was when the horror started to unfold in Ukraine, and we saw unaccompanied children on the borders , and I couldn't get anybody, either minister nor journalist to look into the safeguarding of those children.\nEverybody was so positive about people just turning up with cars to take children to sanctuary that no one sought to think well, have those people actually got malintent behind them.\nnfortunately, what we saw, and we see it in our own country, and we've recently had a debate on unaccompanied children going missing in this country. There are people that look to exploit those that are most desperate.\nJoanna: And just on the issue of Ukraine and unaccompanied children, in December, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that 40% of the millions of Ukrainians who fled to European countries are children with unaccompanied children numbering in the tens of thousands.\nNow, I know that your committee's about to look at the following issue, which is that government, the UK government, spending UK aid money on refugees here in the UK, rather than spending it abroad.\nWhat contribution might such money help to making people more resilient to trafficking?\nSarah: Oh, I mean, the biggest frustration is that rather than the Home Office using its own resources, it is taking money from the ODA, the foreign aid budget to fund refugees in this country, rather than support the people that are poorest in the world, who are probably the very same people that if we could provide opportunities and stability in their own countries, they wouldn't be needing to seek refuge in the UK.\nI think the frustration that I have is that the Home Office, particularly, doesn't seem to accept a duty of care towards the children that come over here. In the debate that we had recently, it was said that 4,600 unaccompanied children have been accommodated since July 21 in the UK by the Home Office.\nBut a number of those children are going missing. And when they are found, they are found to be in the slavery underground. So, what we need the government to do is be upfront and acknowledge that many of those unaccompanied children are being deliberately trafficked into the UK.\nWe need to actively be trying to break up the trafficking rings, but also, we need to be doing much more to recognise those children as victims rather than seeing them as somehow complicit with this process.\nAnd if we could immediately see them as victims and put the support in that we give to other victims of crime, I think that would be the most robust way to try and break these networks.\nJoanna: Moving our focus from children to gender-based violence, I understand that the government's international development strategy, which was published last year, references modern slavery in its commitment to drive international action to end all forms of gender-based violence.\nAnd it talks about scaling up proven approaches to prevent violence, including modern slavery. That's the only reference though. Is this really enough?\nSarah: It's nowhere near enough. I'm going to be somewhat controversial here. I'm an abolitionist when it comes to prostituted people, and the majority of women that are trafficked into the UK are brought in to be prostituted.\nWhat we need to see is an acknowledgement that there are different forms of modern slavery, and we need to be very clear that women are particularly at risk of this. I've met too many young women who thought that they were coming for jobs and have ended up in the sex industry in this country.\nAnd until the government is front-footed and recognises that, I just don't see that they're able to tackle the problem properly.\nOne of the things that I've noticed when I've done work on this internationally is where countries do have a zero policy around buying sex. The traffickers don't tend to take women to those countries.\nSo, there's a direct knock-on effect that if we do not address what's going on with sexual exploitation here in this country, all we’re doing is allowing it to flourish.\nSo, I need the government to be a bit grown up about this and actually, deal with the problem rather than worrying too much about how it might be seen and criticised by some people.\nJoanna: I hear you. That's very interesting. Now, just as my final question to you, obviously, you're Chair of the International Development Committee and your focus is on international affairs as opposed to domestic.\nSo, can I ask you this; what would be the impact to the UK if modern slavery wasn't addressed properly at the international level?\nSarah: I mean, what I worry about is when we go into trade deals, we ought to be having zero tolerance for any form of slavery in the supply chains. And it's not enough to say we scrutinise tier one. We need to know all the way down to those little tiny family-run businesses that there isn't slavery within that system.\nBecause as long as we keep on turning a blind eye, whether that's solar panels that are coming out of China from slavery in the Xinjiang province, or whether it's looking at family-run businesses that are using exploitative child labour in Bangladesh, for example — we have the power to, if not end modern slavery, then by the government working in a joined up way, we have the power to actually mitigate, limit, and try and prevent it.\nAnd I just don't understand why every government department hasn't got that one goal, because while there are still people being exploited around the world so that we can get a cheap pair of trainers or green beans in winter, I can't live comfortably with that.\nWe are the sixth wealthiest country in the world. I think we have a duty to people who are the poorest in the world, and the best way that we can act is to try and end modern slavery, which it doesn't alleviate poverty, it keeps people in poverty. And so, we're in this endless loop when we could be trying to break free of that.\nJoanna: So, what you're really saying is if the United Kingdom wants to break modern slavery internationally, then oh, we have to have an integrated policy across departments and there needs to be particular focus on trade and investment policy?\nSarah: You have put that much more eloquently than I have. But also, just as we did with the Modern Slavery Bill, and then Act, we could be leading the world on this. You know, we could be the player that aims to stamp out modern slavery.\nAnd I want that to be our country and I think there will be an awful lot of support across the world if we are able to actually show how that's possible\nJoanna: My thanks to all my guests today. Join me next time and we'll be looking at the Human Rights Act.\nThe Joint Committee on human rights has been digging into this and questions about the British Bill of Rights, and I'm looking forward to sharing that with you.\nBut before I go, what is a Joint Committee? Well, we operate as other select committees do with the added advantage that our members are drawn from across the House of Lords as well as the House of Commons.\nThis brings a mix of backgrounds and experience, which makes our agreed reports even more valuable, or at least I like to think so.\nYou can find out more about the work of the Lords from their monthly podcast available from all the usual podcast providers. And you can also listen there to every back episode of Committee Corridor. Subscribe, and leave us a review.\nI'm Joanna Cherry, MP, and this has been Committee Corridor. Thanks for listening.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_rules-will-be-set-aside-when-it-suits-the-establishment/content_5.html": "Rules will be set aside when it suits the establishment\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 23rd Feb 2024\nMany column inches have been expanded over the last 24 hours on the chaos that unfolded in the House of Commons on Wednesday. National readers should be in no doubt that what we saw was a very clear indication that at Westminster, when it suits the establishment, the rules and precedent will be set aside, whether to save political skins or blushes, even when what is at stake is of the gravest importance. What happened was a very clear example of Britannia waiving the rules.\nNone of us who believe in an independent Scotland will be shocked by this and for most Yessers the whole farce makes Westminster looks even more out of touch than usual. Indeed, as Alex Salmond tweeted it was a very strong illustration that Westminster is not capable of representing Scotland on the international stage. For our friends and neighbours who are not yet fully convinced the Scotland should be an independent country it was another clear example of how their personal views about national and international issues are out of kilter with the prevailing political establishment in England, both Labour and Conservative. A Labour government at Westminster will not change that one iota. If Scots continue to remain part of a political union with England these are the implications soft No/wavering Yes voters must continue to weigh up.\nSome people will argue that we should be pleased the Commons eventually voted for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. That is true. However, the impact of that vote has been lost in the chaos generated by the chicanery that went on behind the scenes and the nonsense that was played out on television screens across the globe. That is not just my view but that of the Palestinian Ambassador as reported in this newspaper yesterday. Furthermore, unless the UK Government act upon the motion, which seems unlikely, Israel will not be dissuaded from continuing its violations of international law and the slaughter of innocent civilians in what is left of Gaza.\nAccusations of playing politics against the SNP are spurious. We've been consistent in our support for a ceasefire and the observance of international law. The Labour Party have not. Instead, they have had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support a ceasefire and are still not prepared to call out the enormity of what Israel has done to innocent civilians in its legitimate quest to wipe out Hamas. It seems its ok for the Labour party in Scotland to call out the collective punishment of people in Gaza as they did in their recent conference motion but beyond the pale for the SNP to have it clearly and unequivocally in a parliamentary motion.\nLabour have had ample opportunity to bring forward a motion for a ceasefire. Since October 7th 2023, the Labour party have had four opposition days with eight opposition motions. On none of these occasions did they seek to debate the situation in Israel or Gaza. Instead, they equivocated and dragged their feet on the question of a ceasefire. Then when they faced being put on the spot by an SNP motion, they nobbled the Speaker and hijacked the debate to have their own heavily watered-down ceasefire motion take precedence. What they did was all about getting Keir Starmer and Labour off the hook rather than focusing on the obvious suffering in Gaza and the appalling breaches of international law.\nAt Westminster as at Holyrood and indeed in most parliaments, government business dominates the agenda. Opposition days exist to give opposition parties the opportunity to hold debates and votes on the issues that matter to them. Labour get these very regularly. The SNP get a handful in every parliamentary session. How these debates are conducted is governed by longstanding convention and under Standing Order 31 of the House of Commons. Normally what happens is that the opposition party move their motion first and if the government have an amendment they move that in reply. Then at the end of the debate the Opposition party’s motion is voted on. If it is not passed then there is a vote on the government amendment. The procedures were introduced in 1979 with the specific purpose of allowing a vote to take place on the motion laid down by the Opposition party on their allocated day.\nOn Wednesday there were three amendments to the SNP motion, a Labour one, a government one and a Lib dem one. What the Speaker allowed to happen was for the first vote to be on Labour’s amendment to the SNP motion with the inevitable result that if it was passed there would be no vote at all on the SNP motion. When the Speaker announced his decision to upend the rules and prevent a clear vote on the SNP motion, he said that there was precedent for approaching matters this way. When he said that I believe he misled the Commons. The Clerk of the House’s letter of advice to him which has been published and which you can read on my twitter feed explains that there have only been two occasions in the last 25 years where an amendment has been moved by an opposition party other than the one to which the day had been allocated, but, crucially, in those circumstances no Government amendment had been tabled. So, if precedent and the rules had been followed, the first vote that occurred should have been on the stronger SNP motion.\nA story is now being spun that Keir Starmer asked the Speaker to upend the rule book because of threats that were being brought to bear on his MPs. However, journalists with very well-placed sources say there were multiple conversations with the speaker which included messages being passed to him by Labour Party MPs that if he didn't do their bidding they would not support him for Speaker on the other side of the general election. If the Speaker gave into such threats then he has fatally compromised his impartiality.\nI fear that the threats narrative is being used to detract from the shabby reality of what occurred on Wednesday and to let Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour party off the hook. However, if it is true that threats of violence influenced the Speaker’s decision then that is also a very serious matter. It should not have been allowed to happen. It is a sad fact of our modern democracy that politicians do sometimes face threats to their personal safety for doing what they believe to be right. I have personal experience of this because of my support for women's and LGB rights. I have even faced criminal threats from within my own party and at times my professional life has been made close to intolerable, but I have never let it stop me speaking out for what I believed to be right or from doing my job. Nor have I sought to bend the rules or to nobble those who are supposed to be impartial in order to get off the hook of following my conscience.\nI am in no doubt that the Speaker of the House of Commons should resign or be removed from office over what he did on Wednesday. However, it is not only his integrity that is in issue. Keir Starmer looks like being the future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. If this is an indication of how he and his party intend to handle matters, then we should be very concerned. I know that many of my constituents who might otherwise think about voting Labour are already concerned about Labour's equivocation on a ceasefire. I suspect they will be equally concerned about the dirty dealing that went on behind the scenes on Wednesday. It certainly strengthens my offer to them and that of any other SNP MP who is prepared to follow their conscience and do the right thing rather than indulge in party political stitch ups.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_agenda-suggests-a-welcome-return-to-grassroots-democracy-in-snp/content_194.html": "Agenda suggests a welcome return to grassroots democracy in SNP\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 25th Aug 2023\nLet's deal with the good news first. Several grassroots resolutions concerning the party’s independence strategy have made it on to the SNP’s provisional conference agenda which was published on Tuesday. Lessons have clearly been learned. Under the new leadership, members who put forward ideas about how we win our party’s main goal will no longer be booed off the stage.\nIn a foreword, Humza Yousaf has promised that independence will be front and centre in the General Election campaign and that he will be framing his own resolution for debate at conference after he has listened to what members have to say at the Regional Assemblies. There will be an extended process for considering that resolution, and lodging amendments, before it appears on the final agenda. I hope that extended time for consideration of the motion will also be afforded.\nNow the bad news. A Survation poll published on Wednesday put the SNP and Labour neck and neck in Westminster voting intentions and predicts that we could lose up to half our seats at the General Election. There’s no room for complacency here. I attended an event held by the Diffley partnership on Wednesday which indicated a similar result and there is a definite trend in the polls. However, there is hope in that these polls also show solid support for independence which remains close to 50%. That is considerably higher than current SNP support.\nIf the SNP want to be the party of independence, then we need to work hard for pro-independence votes. The party’s strategy for the election must take this new factor into account. If we frame our independence stance properly, we can work to win back the support of Yessers who have lost faith in our party. If we can’t, the country’s main pro-independence party will lose the election in Scotland. The scene has been set for us to win back that trust at our October conference. Under new leadership, the party have accepted what some of us have been arguing for years – that only through proper debate involving our grassroots membership can we forge a winning strategy on independence.\nHowever, it’s vital that sufficient time is allocated to this debate. There are 58 resolutions on the provisional agenda. The final agenda after delegates get to vote on their choices will be considerably slimmed down but the resolutions on independence must be given centre stage and a considerably bigger chunk of time for debate than the other resolutions on the final agenda.\nTurning to those other resolutions, I was struck by their variety as well as their number. I hope that in choosing which to debate, delegates will bear in mind the issues that both polling and focus groups show matter most to the public. These are the cost of living crises, the energy crisis, healthcare and the NHS, the economy, poverty and inequality and the environment and climate change. Our conference needs to focus on getting our offering on these issues right.\nReaders who listen to the Holyrood Sources podcast will have heard Geoff Aberdein – formerly chief of staff to Alex Salmond when was First Minister – say that we must approach the General Election with policies on the side of public opinion. He argues that one of the reasons for the SNP’s slide in the polls is that on a number of our current policies, we are not carrying public opinion with us and, often, where the party has taken a position, we have not done enough to persuade the public of its merits.\nIn my opinion, he is right about this, and the same could be said of our coalition with the Greens. Yes, I know it is there to give us a working majority at Holyrood, but as Geoff and his fellow pundits have identified, the public don’t care about that. They need to be persuaded that it’s a good deal delivering policies to tackle the issues that matter most to them. Again, the polls don’t show that. Instead, they show that 40% of voters oppose the co-operation agreement and others don’t think it is working for them.\nThis is an issue that needs to be addressed not by ripping up the agreement with the Scottish Green Party but rather by revisiting it. The Scottish public don’t need to be convinced that we need to tackle climate change. They know we do and – Patrick Harvie, take note – this includes the older generation of voters, many of whom in my experience care passionately about the condition in which they will leave our planet for future generations. What people need is a practical plan for tackling climate change and reaching our net-zero targets which doesn’t put the cost of so doing on those who can least afford it. So far, the Scottish Greens are not bringing this to the table and, when they are not lashing out at those who disagree with their identity politics, they seem more focused on lumping the costs on individual households rather than creating joined-up collective solutions.\nThe SNP don’t need the Scottish Green Party to deliver on climate change – what we do need is a creditable long-term plan of the kind Common Weal has set out in its Green New Deal. If we can take the Scottish Greens with us on that, well and good, but the tail cannot continue to be seen wagging the dog.\nTalking of Common Weal, Robin McAlpine was interviewed by Lesley Riddoch and Pat Joyce on their podcast for subscribers this week. I heartily recommend subscribing and giving this – as well as the Holyrood Sources podcast – a listen. Intriguingly, he revealed that he is currently working on a new paper about independence strategy which he plans to publish in early September. I am looking forward to reading it and delighted to hear it will be out in time to inform the SNP debate at conference in October.\nMeanwhile, for all those who want a taster of the debate on these important issues, there is still time to book a place at the SNP Trade Union Group’s event in Glasgow tomorrow. It’s open to all SNP members and you can register via Eventbrite – search the site for “SNP Independence Strategy and Party Governance”. I am delighted to be sponsoring this event but sad to be missing it as it clashes with a last-minute holiday booked before Parliament returns. However, I am very much looking forward to hearing about how it goes. Grassroots participative democracy is making a much welcome return to the SNP and that can only be a good thing.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_sort-our-snp-independence/content_259.html": "This is how we sort out the SNP and win independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 12th May 2023\nLast Saturday, together with a significant cohort of SNP parliamentarians, I joined independence supporters at the All Under One Banner March in Glasgow. I had been offered the chance to put my name in the ballot for a seat at the Coronation, but it was clear to me that there was no contest as to where I should be.\nThat said I had no problem with the First Minister attending the coronation, he represents all of Scotland, and it was right for him to be there just as it was right for Stephen Flynn to be there as the leader of the SNP at Westminster. Much as I would like to see an independent Scottish Republic, for the time being the King is Head of State in our constitutional democracy and a direct descendent of Scotland’s Stuart line and it was right that Scotland’s government and biggest party be represented at his coronation.\nBesides for me the priority is Scottish Independence, once we have that we can decide whether we wish Scotland to be a constitutional monarchy or a republic. I have little doubt Scots will opt for the latter. But we won’t get that choice until we achieve independence. To that we need a strong united independence movement, so it was good to see people from all pro-independence parties and none represented at the sizeable march.\nIt was a pity that the Scottish Greens felt unable to send official representation. Attendance at the March was largely from working class independence supporters. There’s a lesson from history south of the border as to what happens when self-styled left-wing intellectuals disdain the working class. Even more so when they do so to concentrate on identity politics to the exclusion of bread-and-butter issues. The contrast between indy marchers who united behind a banner which read “Make Poverty History” and those on Calton Hill lecturing women and minority groups about the conditions for their liberation could not have been starker. Still, I was glad that Scottish Green politicians and others found someone to offer them a platform for their minority pursuits, albeit it turned out to be rather a small platform.\nMany people on the AOUB March also took the opportunity to make their opposition to the monarchy plain. Both the Edinburgh and Glasgow protest went off without incident. However, in London protestors from the group Republic who had gone to considerable lengths to clear the nature and location of their protest with the police in advance, were detained, searched, arrested and held in the cells for over 16 hours. They have now been told there was no basis for their arrest and that there will be no charges. Police appear to have acted under political pressure using the broadly drawn and badly drafted provisions of the new Public Order Act rushed into force in England and Wales last week. It was a disgraceful infringement of the right to protest. I secured an urgent question and debate about what had happened when the House of Commons returned to work last Tuesday. I called for an inquiry and the Home Affairs Select Committee have invited me to take part in their evidence session which will hear from police, protesters and human rights lawyers next week. Coronation day was a particularly good day to remind the British establishment that in Scotland it is the people not the parliament or the King who are sovereign.\nThat sovereignty, our sovereignty, means that we as Scots have the right to self-determination. Like all other human rights, the right to self-determination is a universal right. It is most definitely not one from which the Scots are uniquely excluded whatever the UK Supreme Court might have said in a court case that I believe was misconceived and misguided. The union between England and Scotland is one of consent and so it is a union that can be ended by the will of the people of Scotland.\nNo 25-year-old devolution Act, no British government and no court can ever deny that democratic reality. The union is over 300 years old. It is constitutionally illiterate to say that only a referendum backed by a section 30 order from an Act of Parliament that is barely 25 years old can end it. We need to move away from going cap in hand to ask for a section 30 order and focus on our sovereignty.\nOur movement for self-determination has come a long way in the past decade. Yes, the SNP has hit a bump in the road and yes, we face big challenges. But however big those challenges, we are a party with a noble history and some great people and so we will sort out our problems and remain at the vanguard of the independence movement. But the movement for indy is bigger than the SNP and it now exists independently of it. I am an SNP MP and I intend to remain one, but for me it is always country before party and my loyalty is to my country and the people who live in it and the independence movement. As Alex Salmond has said, ten years ago the SNP enjoyed support in the high 40s while support for independence languished at around 30%. Despite the SNP suffering a dip in the polls independence now enjoys sustained support in the high 40s.\nI remember very well attending the launch of the Yes campaign in 2012 in the cinema park at Fountainbridge in Edinburgh opposite what is now my Edinburgh South West constituency office on Dundee Street. At the time support for independence was 28% and despite the excitement and the hype I was gloomy because I thought we faced an impossible task. I was wrong. We nearly won in 2014 and even though we didn’t make it we delivered an independence movement which has remained strong and solid support for independence which has not faltered.\nThe challenge now is to build that support. To bring with us the people I meet day to day in my constituency work. They are still disgusted by Brexit, the fuel poverty in our energy rich country and the ethical vacuum at the heart of the Conservative and Unionist party. They know Scotland can and should do better than this, but they are not yet convinced of the case for independence because they have questions on the economy, cross border trade and Europe that have yet to be answered.\nThere is hard work to be done answering those questions and I will continue to strive to make sure the SNP and the Scottish Government use the power invested in us by the Scottish people to do it. I also intend to use such influence as I have within the SNP to make sure we sort out our internal problems and devise a strategy that will deliver an independence vote.\nOn this as on many issues during the SNP leadership campaign Ash Regan was right. Now that the route to another independence referendum is closed off, we must make sure that at every election the SNP and other pro-independence parties put the issue of independence front and centre in our manifestos. Every election must be an independence election until we have won a mandate to negotiate with the British Government.\nI am pleased that even some colleagues who were once implacably opposed to this plan are now on board with it. This should give us all cause for optimism.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_europe-knows-scotland-wants-no-part-in-ditching-echr/content_226.html": "Europe knows Scotland wants no part in ditching ECHR\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 17th Jun 2022\nNotwithstanding the rejuvenation of the independence campaign by the Scottish Government, for me the highlight of the week was the success of the court action to stop the flight to Rwanda deporting asylum seekers. The interim action taken to stop the flight on Tuesday evening was ultimately successful at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg which, it seems, attached greater weight to the concerns of the UN High Commission on Refugees than the English courts. That is not to say that the legal action in England did not meet with some degree of success. Clearly the threat of such action made the Home Office take some people off the flight and the arguments have yet to be heard in full at judicial review.\nBy pure chance I was in Strasbourg visiting the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe when the decision was announced. I was there leading a delegation from Westminster’s Joint Committee on Human Rights, a committee of 6 MPs and 6 Peers with the responsibility of scrutinising the protection of human rights in the UK. We could not have been there at a more important time. The British Government’s plans to “update” the Human Rights Act and distance themselves from the ECHR are already causing consternation in Strasbourg and the Tory threats to withdraw from the Convention altogether which inevitably followed the adverse court decision have increased the level of concern.\nWe were able to provide some level of reassurance that the UK Government’s antipathy towards the ECHR is not widely shared at Westminster or in the other parts of the UK. Our committee is a cross-party one which includes Conservative MPs and peers. Despite that, we have produced two unanimous reports concluding that the incorporation of the rights contained in the ECHR into domestic law through the Human Rights Act (HRA) is working well and does not need to be changed. In my discussions with parliamentarians at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and officials in the Council of Europe it was clear that there is a high level of awareness of the different direction of travel in Scotland. The Scottish Government and parliament’s commitment to extending, rather than rolling back, human rights protections is applauded. The First Minister’s announcement of a second independence referendum was also mentioned. One very senior parliamentarian said to me that if the UK leaves the ECHR that will strengthen the case for Scottish independence.\nThe Convention was agreed, following the great conflicts of the mid-20th century, to protect Europe from a resurgence of dangerous populism. At that time, it was clear that the only way to avert future upheaval was to strengthen national parliaments and constitutions as vital checks on executive power, and to take steps to safeguard fundamental freedoms and entrench the rule of law.\nNow, once again, we see the rise of populism in Europe. This means the convention is more important than ever. The UK was a founding member of the Convention and is still held in high esteem in Strasbourg. The primary concern of all those we spoke to in Strasbourg is that if the UK were to leave the ECHR or even just to disengage from it, it would send the wrong message to countries in Eastern Europe who wish to water down their human rights protections. Russia, now expelled from the Council of Europe because of the invasion of Ukraine, has, in the past, founded on the UK Government’s antipathy to the convention to justify their own attempts to ignore the human rights protections to which they once signed up.\nWe also heard that in recent months British Government Ministers have given repeated assurances to Council of Europe interlocutors that they would not withdraw from the ECHR. If they break their word on this significant damage will be done to the UK’s reputation internationally. It would also be a breach of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement with the EU - Boris Johnson’s oven-ready deal – in which the UK promised to adhere to the ECHR to guarantee future law enforcement and security co-operation with the EU. However, given the willingness to breach their international treaty obligations in relation to the Northern Irish Protocol and Boris Johnson’s track record there is every chance that they could depart the ECHR notwithstanding these promises.\nDemocracy, Human Rights, and the Rule of Law are integral to the Council of Europe and the ECHR. Boris Johnson has repeatedly shown that he has not much time for human rights or the rule of law if either gets in the way of what he wants. When it comes to Scottish independence, in respect of his refusal to acknowledge multiple mandates for a second independence referendum, he has also shown that he does not much care for democracy either.\nSo, it was good to hear the Scottish Government reiterate this week that holding an independence referendum should not be dependent on his permission. That said, it is vital that we should proceed in a lawful and constitutional fashion to secure international recognition of the outcome. I was delighted that, when Mike Russell’s 11-point plan was announced in January 2021, the SNP adopted my suggestion of testing the waters with a Holyrood bill for indyref2. There is, of course, a well-respected body of legal opinion that the Scottish parliament may have the competence to hold an independence referendum although ultimately this is likely to be challenged in the courts.\nI was disappointed not to be consulted on the detail of the delivery of this course of action given my success in the Article 50 and prorogation cases, but the Scottish Government has their own lawyers and I look forward to seeing the fruits of their labours on this front. Angus Robertson told us on the radio this week that the referendum will be in October 2023. On Tuesday the FM told the press that she would be giving parliament a significant update “very soon” and that that meant “at some point before Parliament goes into recess”.\nOn the assumption that Boris Johnson won’t grant permission, the timetable for getting a bill through Holyrood and resisting a court challenge in sufficient time to hold a referendum in October next year is tight, so I am not surprised the FM has promised this update before the Scottish parliament’s recess starts at the end of June.\nI suspect that no amount of fine words about democracy will change Boris Johnson’s mind on indyref2. It’s pretty clear that this can only be done by actions that force his hand. As I have said before, it is never a good idea to engage your enemy on just one front so I hope the FM’s announcement of the Holyrood bill and indyref2 timetable will be accompanied with other initiatives including the Constitutional Convention promised in January 2020.\nIt is possible that the timetable for an independence referendum could be knocked off course by an early General Election. Boris Johnson does not have to go the country until 2024 but he, or a successor, could choose, or be forced by events, to go earlier. If that happens, depending on the progress of any court challenge, we may find ourselves using a General Election as plebiscite on independence. It would indeed be a rich irony if both my plan B and that of Angus Brendan McNeill and Chris McEleny both became SNP policy. I hope the fact that mine already has, and that theirs might, will give pause for thought to the minority of activists who behaved so badly when it was sought to debate and discuss these alternative plans. If nothing else, it is a reminder of the importance of respectful debate as we go forward.\nAs I left Strasbourg on Wednesday preparations were underway at the Headquarters of the Council of Europe for a celebration of Bloom’s Day, an annual commemoration and celebration of the life of Irish writer James Joyce. Ireland currently holds the Presidency of the Council and their tricolour flies proudly outside the Palais with the other members’ flags. I look forward to the day when the Saltire joins it. A different future for Scotland is indeed possible but it will take hard work and a clever strategy and campaign.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_snp-need-radical-rethink-on-independence/content_262.html": "SNP need a radical rethink on independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 05th Jun 2020\nThe word 'unprecedented' should really be banned from all utterances for the rest of 2020. But where the SNP is now as a party really is without much precedent. A party in its third term of government, riding high in the polls, with a leader whose approval ratings eclipse the other UK party leaders, never mind the Scottish ones who frankly don’t even rank.\nHowever, the SNP cannot afford to be complacent. The question for us now is what to do with this dominance? Especially in the lead up to the 2021 Scottish elections, less than 12 months away.\nUnlike other political parties in the UK the SNP exists not just to win elections and form governments but to achieve major structural change. The structures we seek to change are socio-economic as well as constitutional. We want to win independence for Scotland, not just as an end in itself but to make sure that the vital decisions about how we run our economy and our society are taken closer to home so that we can do things differently and better.\nAs a result of the Coronavirus the FM has had to put campaigning for an independence referendum on hold. The policy papers and the Constitutional Convention promised on January 31 have inevitably been delayed. Unquestionably the public health crisis must be the focus of the Scottish Government but the SNP as a party must continue to develop policy and I am happy that the National Secretary of the party has responded favourably to my suggestion that the policy formulation that would have happened at the cancelled National Assemblies and Conference is instead facilitated using digital platforms.\nLast week an Ipsos MORI poll suggested that (excluding don’t knows), 55% of Scots want an independence referendum within 5 years. This compares to 47% in a You Gov /Times poll conducted around this time last year.\nSo it seems that the desire for a second independence referendum is increasing despite the current crisis. It may increase further. It is noteworthy that the Ipsos MORI polling took place before the Cummings fiasco made a mockery of the British Government. One can only imagine that the reprehensible way in which the whole affair has been handled will increase the desire for Scotland to go its own way.\nThe challenge for the SNP is how we approach reframing the case for independence in the wake of the current crisis and in a world where everything has changed. How do we “Build Back Better’ with a plan for the future of our economy and our society that will take us through the Holyrood elections and towards independence?\nWithin the party there is a widespread recognition that the economics of the Sustainable Growth Commission report require to be revisited. That this is so is a view shared by both its enthusiastic proponents and those of us who had our reservations from the start.\nThe setting up of the Social Justice and Fairness commission was announced at the 2019 Spring Conference in order to address the concerns of many party activists about the conclusions of the Growth Commission. The First Minister said that the new Commission would show how the proceeds of economic growth could be shared more fairly and how to end poverty and deliver full employment.\nThe new Commission recently announced it is looking at the idea of a Universal Basic Income. This is an idea which has been long been advocated within the party by activists such as Ronnie Cowan, and is now attracting mainstream attention from think tanks like Reform Scotland. My own discussions with the business community suggest an appetite to explore this option. However, a UBI cannot be looked at divorced from the overall economy. It means looking at the taxation system as well as welfare provision.\nThe questions being addressed by the Social Justice and Fairness Commission will therefore require to be looked at on a wider canvas.\nThose of us advocating for a more radical approach would like to see the Common Weal think tank’s blueprint for building a more resilient economy, the first part of which was published on Tuesday, play a large part in the deliberations needed to produce a strong new economic case for independence.\nThe Common Weal’s plans incorporate imaginative ideas about stimulating domestic industries and looking at creative ways of using our raw materials like timber and our abundant energy resources to drive up domestic production and consumption. Realising local government reform, advancing land reform further and faster and implementing rent control as a deliverable policy are among other proposals from this think tank that are close to the heart of many SNP activists.\nThe Common Weal’s plans for the economy look to the long term but also incorporate steps that can be taken now using devolved powers. This is the approach I believe is needed to frame the manifesto for the 2021 Holyrood elections.\nOne area of agreement between the architects of the Growth commission and the Common Weal is that Scotland should be given more borrowing powers to pay for resilience measures under devolution. Andrew Wilsons’s recent proposals in this respect were favourably received across the board and are supported by our impressive and dynamic new Finance Secretary, Kate Forbes.\nThe sort of discussions that the SNP should now have are taking place across the UK, Europe and the world. The need to rebuild our economy and society in the wake of the pandemic provides a moment for us to rethink our priorities. If we don’t take radical steps now, there will be no change and we will go back to where we were and that was not a sustainable place.\nThe good news is that there seems to be widespread acceptance that this is a moment for huge social and economic change. With that acceptance independence becomes a less daunting prospect for many voters, but the SNP still need clear answers to the questions voters have about our economic future.\nTo say that the SNP should now revisit its economic plan for independence is therefore in keeping with the times we are in. My call for a radical rethink is not a challenge for the leadership, nor is it a challenge to the leadership. This new situation is a challenge for all of us and a challenge for our party as a whole.\nA longer version of this article first appeared in sceptical.scot",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_scottish-independence-democracy-renewal-paper-missed-one-important-point/content_206.html": "Scottish independence: Democracy renewal paper missed one important point\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 22nd Jul 2022\nLast week saw the publication of the second of the Scottish Government’s papers on Building a new Scotland, entitled “Renewing Democracy through Independence.” It received a mixed reception with the usual brickbats from unionist commentators. Whilst their criticisms are to be expected and can be safely ignored, some trenchant criticism from other sources is worthy of our respect and consideration, even though we might not agree with some, or even all, of it.\nJames Mitchell is Professor of Public Policy at the University of Edinburgh. He has written extensively on Scottish and UK politics and public policy. He is in no sense an enemy of the independence movement but more of a critical friend. He described the paper as a “rehash of nationalist arguments that attempts to equate independence with democracy.” The broad thrust of his critique was that we don’t need independence to improve democracy in Scotland, that there is much that could be done with our existing powers, particularly in areas crying out for reform, such as local government. He also argues that improvements regarding democratic accountability under our existing systems are badly needed.\nThe main point of the Scottish Government’s paper was to describe the democratic deficit that Scotland suffers within the union, and the threat to devolution posed by the agenda of the current Tory government. I don’t think Prof. Mitchell would disagree that either of these are major problems. His point was that we should also identify and address improvements that could be made to our existing form of self-government.\nI agree with him in so far as I think we should look to improve what we already have, while always acknowledging that gains under devolution are fragile, and only independence can guarantee the democracy we want where decisions taken by, or on behalf of the sovereign people of Scotland, are not at the mercy of Westminster’s antiquated doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. However, I repeat that fear of Westminster rolling back our gains or reforms should not prevent us from looking at the inadequacies of our current democratic set-up. In fact, I believe it is incumbent upon us to do so, if we really believe in the sovereignty of the people as opposed to parliament, or an all-powerful executive branch – i.e. the government, as parliamentary sovereignty so often ends up meaning.\nBack in 2007, when the SNP first came to power at Holyrood, the late great Alasdair Gray told us to “Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation.” In that spirit I think what we should look at is a transitional programme of democratic renewal that would start under devolution and be continued through the interim period after an independence vote and on to the birth of a new state.\nAround the same time as the publication of the Scottish Government's report, the European Union published its third annual Rule of Law Report. The report comes in the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has particularly underlined the importance of upholding democratic values, human rights and the rule of law. The report examines developments and makes recommendations in four key areas for the rule of law, including institutional issues linked to the importance of proper checks and balances on executive power, and, also, the independence of the judiciary and prosecution systems. Both are subjects close to my heart as a lawyer with a particular interest in constitutional matters.\nI can think of at least two significant improvements that could be made to our current system in relation to these matters. As regards checks and balances on executive power, in the absence of a second chamber at Holyrood, the independence and power of the parliamentary standing committees could be strengthened by having the chairs elected by backbenchers as has been the practice at Westminster for the last decade. Beyond government, the independence of our justice institutions could be improved by addressing the anomaly whereby the Lord Advocate is both government legal advisor and head of the prosecution service. Because of the way the Scotland Act is phrased this might require a section 30 order, but it is hard to believe one would not be forthcoming, as in this respect we would be emulating the English system which, unusually, is more in tune with the requirements of the EU regarding the strengthening of the autonomy of prosecution services.\nBeyond that, what about a Bill of Rights for Scotland making clear that, in so far as devolved matters are concerned, Scotland adheres to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)? In this way Scotland could try to ameliorate Dominic Raab’s plans to repeal the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights and to distance the UK from the ECHR and weaken access to its protections. During the Tory leadership race Suella Braverman, the Attorney General, argued the UK should leave the ECHR altogether and Liz Truss conceded that this might have to be considered. She could be our PM by the end of the summer, so we need to be vigilant.\nFinally, to give just one further example on the vexed question of local government reform and financing we could get the promised Citizens Assembly on this up and running. While the UK Government shows contempt for the international rules-based order, it’s the perfect opportunity for Scotland to signal how different we really are and to prepare ourselves to press our case for admission to international bodies like the EU and Council of Europe.\nYes, a renewal of Scottish democracy is needed. While it is much easier to see this happening with Independence there are areas we could get started on now.",

In the prorogation case the decision of Scotland’s Supreme Court, the Inner House of Court of Session, paved the way for a historic victory in the UK Supreme Court and it was the Scottish constitutional tradition that neither government nor monarch are above the law which won the day.\nBoris Johnson’s response to the slap down he received from both courts’ unanimous decisions is to threaten to curb the right to judicial review of the actions of public authorities. His approach echoes the sort of populism we see at play in Hungary and Poland where the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law are also under attack. The fundamental purpose of the supervisory jurisdiction of Scotland’s Court of Session is to ensure that all acts of government are carried out within the rule of law. If Johnson attempts to curb that jurisdiction, he could find himself with quite a fight on his hands and facing some formidable adversaries. Interference with Scotland’s separate and independent legal system could bring arguments about the Treaty of Union into play quite apart from the importance of preserving the devolved settlement.\nOf course, Johnson also suffered another resounding Scottish defeat in the General Election when the SNP won the second biggest landslide in our Westminster election history. However, the sad reality is that because Boris Johnson won big in England and has an 80-seat majority, the SNP group at Westminster have less power in this parliament with 48 seats than we had with 35 seats in the previous hung parliament. The opportunities for the sort of cross party working that delivered numerous defeats of the UK Government under both Theresa May and Johnson are gone. Just as the days of endless Brexit skirmishes are over because the direct result of Boris Johnson’s General Election victory was that Brexit has finally been delivered.\nBritain exited the EU on 31 January this year. For now, we are cushioned from the effects of that exit by the transition period during which we continue to enjoy the benefits and obligations of membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union. But that too will end on 31 December this year. The chance of an extension being sought to that period is negligible and even if it was it would only be postponing the inevitable.\nAccordingly, it is important that we don’t expend energy fighting last year’s battles. Trying to “Stop Brexit” was the right thing for the SNP to do. It reflected the views of the majority of Scottish voters. It was in the interests of our economy and society to keep Scotland and the UK in the EU. But we lost the battle and Brexit is now an irreversible reality. We must avoid falling into the trap of being like the Japanese soldier who remained in the jungle on a pacific island for 30 years refusing to accept the war was over.\nThe SNP will not win future elections merely by fielding candidates who are anti-Brexit. Brexit is a done deal. and the question now is what are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about the democratic deficit that has seen Scotland taken out of the EU against our will and will now see the powers of our parliament, and possibly our courts, attacked and curtailed? Politicians with the answer to those questions are what is required.\nThe polling expert Mark Diffley has pointed out that the increase in support for independence seen across a range of polls started last year, not just since the pandemic as some people think, and was primarily driven by Brexit. His view chimes with my experiences campaigning in Edinburgh South West last November/December when people from the city centre tenements to leafy Balerno praised SNP parliamentarians for leading the battle against Brexit in parliament and in the courts. I have no doubt that this was the key factor which saw my own majority over the Tories increase from just over 1,000 to nearly 12,000 votes.\nSo, we know that the legacy of our opposition to Brexit has been increased support for the SNP and for independence. What the SNP must do now is to nurture that goodwill to deliver an independent Scotland.\nIn order to do that we need to advance a fresh positive case for an independent Scotland which would be able to take its rightful place, just like any other European nation, at the top table in the EU. This means providing answers to the questions that in the full glare of an independence campaign will come into focus, particularly given the changed circumstances since 2014.\nFrom my experience talking to voters, these questions revolve around three issues; the economy and concern about what currency an independent Scotland will use including whether we could be forced to join the Euro; how the process of accession to the EU would actually work and how to maintain cross-border trade with England.\nThese are all legitimate questions. The good news is that strong answers exist, but they need to be packaged and articulated to voters. A wealth of useful material is available thanks to the work of think tanks like the Common Weal, Business for Scotland and the Scottish Centre for European Relations. Further useful work was carried out for the Scottish Government’s paper ‘Scotland’s Place In Europe’ and the Growth Commission but, particularly as regards the economic case, this work requires to be revisited and updated. Then we must package our case for presentation to voters in a clear and easily digestible fashion.\nThe SNP needs fresh arguments for a new independence campaign. There is no point in unthinkingly repeating past mantras or fighting past battles. We need to address the changed situation in which we find ourselves post Brexit. Internal debate and discussion should be encouraged. When the next independence campaign starts in earnest the honed arguments which such internal debate will produce will be vital to ensuring victory.",

And as we move out of the Covid crisis I predict this will continue. The time has now come for a relentless light to be shone on the Tories project of minimising scrutiny of their actions by parliament and the courts and their undermining of the powers of our devolved parliament. Likewise in Scotland we can already see a more searching analysis of the case for independence. The row over who will pay your pension after independence and the issues raised in a raft of new policy publications on Scotland and Europe emphasise how important it is that the Scottish Government gets its ducks in a row for the referendum which has been promised next year.\nThese issues will remain central no matter who is Prime Minister so it’s important not to get too fixated on Boris Johnson. The question now is not whether he goes but when. My information is that the Tories will hold onto him until after the May elections to make sure he takes the rap for any seat losses as well as other current problems such as the frightening rise in the cost of living. So we should expect another Tory leadership election campaign over the summer.\nThe consequences of Johnson’s Savile smear on Keir Starmer this week rightly received widespread condemnation. However, the PM is not the only leading politician who needs to learn that when you put a target on the back of those who dare to challenge you, you risk giving a green light to thugs. Actions have consequences.\nIn recent years many women have faced the same sort of harassment on our streets as that faced by the labour leader when we have tried to attend conferences organised by groups who wish to defend women’s rights, or the rights of same sex attracted people. Twice last year when attending conferences organised by Women’s Place UK and LGB Alliance I had to run the gauntlet of angry and in some cases abusive men’s and trans rights activists, on one occasion accompanied by one of my fellow MPs, seeking to prevent those with whom they disagree from organising. This is the ugly face of the new misogyny and homophobia in our society, but it is also symptomatic of an intolerance of reasoned debate which is poisoning our politics.\nWe need to remember that human rights are universal. When the Equalities and Human Rights Commission came under attack last week from some trans rights groups for daring to meet with women’s and LGB campaign groups and to take cognisance of their concerns, they rightly reminded their detractors that Human Rights legislation exists to protect and promote the rights of everyone.\nI was further reminded of that this week when chairing the latest session of the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) inquiry into the UK Government’s plans to “reform” the Human Rights Act (HRA). Lately the focus of my parliamentary work has been this committee because I have had to step up from Deputy Chair to Chair in the in the absence of our permanent chair, Harriet Harman QC MP, who is currently on bereavement leave after the sudden death of her much loved and respected husband the eminent trade unionist Jack Dromey MP.\nThe current Tory Government don’t like human rights very much unless they can stipulate who should and should not enjoy them. That’s why I find it particularly concerning when people who purport to be on the left of our politics or progressive try to create a hierarchy of rights in which, surprisingly enough, women and LGB people often find themselves at the bottom. Everyone who lives in our country or under our law should enjoy the same rights. Some of the Tories dislike this idea so much that they want to take us out of the European Convention on Human Rights even though lawyers from Britain and indeed Scotland were instrumental in drafting it and the UK has been a signatory since the 1950s.\nWhen former PM Theresa May embraced leaving the ECHR she gave a ludicrous conference speech in which she alleged that an illegal immigrant avoided deportation because of his pet cat. In actual fact the man won his case because the Home Office had ignored its own immigration rules on unmarried couples. Then Priti Patel claimed that “activist lawyers” were frustrating the removal of migrants from this country. Days later, an immigration solicitor was the subject of a violent racist attack at a London law firm, and the Law Society of England and Wales wrote to the Home Secretary, warning her that inflammatory rhetoric has consequences. But of course Boris Johnson doubled down saying there was a problem with ‘lefty lawyers’ or ‘activist lawyers’ ‘hamstringing’ the justice system.\nThe reality is that the HRA, as Labour promised in 1998, has ‘brought rights home’ giving all sorts of people a means to claim justice they would not otherwise have had. Before the HRA the rights protected by the ECHR could not be accessed in our domestic courts and people faced long and expensive fights to get their case heard in Strasbourg. Without the HRA the Hillsborough Inquests would not have been reopened and the full scale of the sex crimes of taxi rapist John Worboys would not have been investigated by police.\nLong before the Equality Act, legislation on tenancy and inheritance rights was interpreted by the courts using the HRA to recognise same sex couples as next of kin thus delivering fundamental rights to LGB people who until then had been marginalised from the enjoyment of the same rights as heterosexual people.\nThe terms of the UK’s departure from the EU mean that if the UK leaves the ECHR, the EU will withdraw co-operation on data protection, crime and security matters. This is a problem for Tory plans to diminish the power of parliament and the courts to hold the executive to account. It’s also a problem for a lot of the bills they are currently taking through parliament which seek to curtail the rights of immigrants, refugees, voters and those who wish to take to our streets to protest. If the HRA remains on the statute book in its current form, there will be a raft of challenges to this legislation. So the Tories need to find a way of staying in the ECHR but making it more difficult for people living in the UK to access the rights it protects. They plan to do this by rendering the HRA ‘toothless and useless’.\nThese are not my words but the words of Francesca Klug, OBE and visiting professor of human rights at the LSE who was one of the architects of the HRA. Earlier this month she gave a brilliant lecture on the HRA.\nLast year the Government commissioned an Independent Review of the HRA (IRHRA). A huge amount of work went into it, and it reported at length concluding that little change to the HRA was required or merited. However, instead of responding to that report as one might have expected, the Government have now produced a further consultation document with their own radical proposals to amend the act, most of which lack an evidence base and were rejected by the IRHRA.\nI cannot predict what the JCHR will say in our report once we complete our inquiry but I can tell you that the majority of our witnesses so far have been highly critical of what the government are up to and in our last report on the HRA we concluded it was working well.\nThere are also substantial concerns that any so-called reform should not be pushed through without adequate consultation with the devolved governments.\nAs was reported in the National yesterday, earlier this week Mike Russell visited Westminster to brief SNP MPs on the work of his independence unit. I understand that a transitional constitution for Scotland has now been prepared. If I were to be consulted on its contents, I would stress the importance of ensuring universal human rights continue to be protected by means of incorporating the ECHR in a Scottish Bill of Rights. I would also stress that any transitional constitution must be just that and a clear timetable and perhaps more importantly a process must be established for its replacement. The contents of the constitution of an independent Scotland and the extent of its rights protections must be a discussion for all the people of Scotland not just a select few.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_no-devo-max-on-indyref2-ballot/content_302.html": "There's no place for devo-max on the indyref2 ballot\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 07th Jan 2022\nAs a new year begins there have been several interesting interventions in the debate about Scotland’s constitutional future.\nSome have been arrogant and ill-informed such as Adam Boulton’s comment that Scots should not criticise Blair’s knighthood because he “gave Scotland back its Parliament”. As a former political correspondent, he really ought to know that Blair did so with reluctance and only because of the irresistible groundswell of support that had built up in Scotland over 18 years of Tory rule.\nThen the “heir to Blair”, and another knight of the realm, Keir Starmer, stood beside two very big Union Jacks, to tell us about how we are “better together” in our wonderful “union of nations” while at the same time eulogising “our country” (which country?) and Britain as a “Nation”. Language is important when you are lecturing people about respect. But more importantly he needs to realise that putting Gordon Brown in charge of a “Commission on the Future of the UK” does not begin to address the facts that polling consistently shows around 50% support for independence and that, after the broken promises of 2014, Gordon Brown is a busted flush.\nComment pieces from the pro-independence side of the debate have been no less controversial. Chris Hanlon’s think piece in this newspaper about including devo max as an option in a second indyref was met with an almost universally adverse reaction including some very unparliamentary language from parliamentarians.\nA slightly less controversial contribution came from Kevin Pringle in his Sunday column in another newspaper. Alex Salmond’s former spin doctor argued that the SNP should support Alba’s policy of holding a constitutional convention, which was originally proposed by the First Minister in her Brexit day speech on 31 Jan 2020 and presumably delayed only by the pandemic.\nI’d like to say a word in defence of Chris Hanlon. The idea that he is floating a kite for the SNP leadership is I am sure wrong. First, he is no longer the policy convenor of the party. Second, he lost that position to someone who I understand was the leadership’s preferred candidate. And third, when he was elected to the NEC in 2020 it was on a reform ticket as part of the SNP Common Weal Group so he can hardly be described as a leadership stooge. That said he has previously been the author of some very good policy ideas such as holding Citizens Assemblies, which the leadership subsequently adopted. However, I think he’s on his own with this one.\nPeople should be able to write think pieces and float ideas without being shot down in flames. We need people to think outside the box even if it means they come up with ideas with which we don’t necessarily agree. At present there is not enough thinking and debating of ideas about the path to independence going on in the SNP and if this is not happening at the level of NEC or conference, then it will happen elsewhere. Nature abhors a vacuum.\nThat said I do not believe there are any circumstances in which the SNP should push for devo-max as an option in the next independence referendum. In 2012 Alex Salmond put forward the idea of a multi-option referendum as a negotiating tool. His tactic was to present the Tories with a less palatable option so that they would capitulate and give him the section 30 order he wanted. It worked. A decade later, from the point of those of us who still seek independence, there are numerous practical objections to including devo-max as an option. These have been addressed elsewhere including by David Pratt in his column yesterday. They include confusing the public and splitting the vote with an uncertain as opposed to a decisive result. Polling conducted in 2019 showed that the vast majority, 70%, wanted the same question to be asked in a second indyref. I think they are right.\nBesides, things have changed since 2012 in several very significant respects. Whereas then devo-max was probably the preferred option of the Scottish electorate polling now shows support for independence consistently around 50%.\nSecondly, for better or worse, so far as any negotiations go, the SNP’s cards are now firmly on the table. You would need to have come from Mars not to know that the FM wants a Section 30 order to hold a second referendum. Indeed, that position has been reiterated so many times that it is now cemented in the minds of most people at home and abroad that a second independence referendum is the only legitimate route to Scottish independence. As I have argued elsewhere, by reference to constitutional precedent, it isn’t, but we are where we are.\nThirdly, and perhaps most importantly, devolution has been discredited since 2014. This started with the breaking of the vow and the promises of Gordon Brown and continued with the failure to take on board any SNP amendments to the post indyref Scotland Bill even though we had 56 out of the 59 Scottish MPs and half the vote. It reached its apex with the reality of Brexit and the fact that despite being enshrined in statute the Sewel Convention has been shown to be not worth the paper it’s written on. The adage that power devolved is power retained has been shown to be wholly accurate.\nA further problem has been the practical difficulties of delivering further devolved powers due to the breakdown in trust and communication between the Scottish and UK Governments. This does not bode well for further paring and shaving of powers. Perhaps most importantly, Tony Blair’s knighthood is a timely reminder that the conduct of foreign affairs and defence policy is central to what we want to do differently with independence. Devo-max would leave these powers firmly in the hands of Westminster. Re-joining the EU or indeed EFTA and through it the EEA would be impossible. As would getting rid of Trident.\nThat is not to say that there should be no discussion of Devo-max. If a constitutional convention is to be a reality it will need to be on the table to secure the participation of members of the Labour Party and liberal democrats. The SNP parted company with the pre-devolution Constitutional Convention because the option of independence was not on the table. Lessons from history need to be learned. This does not mean that the SNP would need to support devo-max. We would need to have the courage of our convictions and stick to our raison d’etre. If Labour wants to bring devo-max to the table let them but they must own it and explain how it would work, despite all the failings of devolution since 2014.\nWhat might a Constitutional Convention look like? I think it would need to involve all of Scotland’s elected parliamentarians. It would certainly provide a useful focus for SNP MPs, away from Westminster. However, it must also involve civic society and not just the usual suspects, by which I mean particularly government funded lobby groups, it would be vital for it to involve grass roots organisations. And the dialogue must be respectful. Scottish political twitter has not been edifying over Xmas and New Year. Elected politicians, self-styled activists and commentators need to learn to disagree with each other respectfully. Apart from anything else, if they don’t, when they get out on the doorsteps for the local election campaign, should they speak to ordinary voters with the bile or condescension some employ on Twitter they will lose, not gain, votes for their parties.\nAs we enter 2022, we need to focus on how we secure independence, and we badly need some fresh thinking. If there is to be an indyref next year, there is a lot of work to be done. Fortunately, we have a dedicated Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution with junior ministers and civil servants, who are now working on independence again and I am sure we are all looking forward to seeing the fruits of their labours.\nWhatever they come up with will be debated by the Yes movement and all the pro-independence parties and I hope the SNP will be true to our constitution in making sure their proposals are debated at our conference. But what matters most of all is taking the not yet convinced with us. We need to build up the sort of overwhelming support that made the 1997 devolution referendum and its outcome inevitable, even when the UK was led by a PM with a big majority who didn’t really believe in home rule for Scotland. Kevin Pringle is right that reviving the idea of a Constitutional Convention is one way of doing this.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_shocking-week-at-westminster/content_54.html": "It has been a shocking week at Westminster in more ways than one\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 10th Dec 2021\nIt has certainly been one of the most shocking weeks we have had at Westminster for a while. As the revelations of illegal parties at Number 10 last Christmas came hard and fast, the callous Nationality and Borders Bill was voted through to the delight of Priti Patel. There were also a number of twists and turns in the ongoing quest to find out just what the Tories have planned for the Human Rights Act (HRA) and whether the UK will continue as a member of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). As I explained in my column last week, Westminster’s Joint Committee on Human Rights has concluded that the Nationality and Borders Bill which passed the Commons this week breaches the UK’s obligations under the ECHR as well as International Refugee and Maritime Conventions to which the UK is also signed up.\nThe government deny this but some of their more rabid backbenchers were determined that in relation to asylum seeker removals from the UK it should be clear that the HRA and the ECHR do not apply, nor indeed any EU law retained after Brexit, nor the international convention relating to the status of refugees. The amendment they had designed to do this did not pass but when the Immigration Minister was summing up at the end of the debate, he was keen to give them reassurances.\nHe told them that the Home Secretary fully agreed with the sentiment expressed in their amendment about the “challenges that frustrate the will of the British people in terms of our ability to remove people with no right to be in the UK”. And he went on to say that the “Government have imminent plans to consult on substantial reform of the Human Rights Act, which will be announced imminently in Parliament.” Then he went further and said that the Home Secretary recognised their concerns about “aspects of the ECHR and other international agreements” and that the Government were “committed to reviewing and resolving these issues with the urgency that the situation warrants.”\nAs you can imagine these comments caused excitement on the Tory backbenches and consternation on the opposition benches. Until recently the Government has been keen to reassure us that it has no plans to change its renewed commitment to ongoing membership of ECHR, but this sounded like that they were planning to revisit that commitment, at least in part.\nI intervened to ask the Minister whether he was now announcing something a bit more radical than perhaps we had anticipated in relation to the Human Rights Act and to confirm that the Government are still committed to remaining a full signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. But he refused to do so, saying he would not pre-empt a forthcoming Government announcement about their intentions.\nThe next day, the new Lord Chancellor and the anti-hero of the Kabul airlift, Dominic Raab, appeared before the JCHR. He is the lead Government minister on the HRA. In a surprisingly polished performance, particularly after his farcical comments last weekend to the effect that police don’t investigate past crimes, he sought to reassure us that there is no intention to withdraw from the ECHR.\nHe does, however, have fairly radical plans for reform of the HRA which may limit the extent to which people in the UK can rely on their ECHR rights in our domestic courts, at least in so far as reserved matters are concerned. Where devolution is concerned, the ECHR is written into the Scotland Act and so unless that Act were to be amended, people in Scotland could still rely on their ECHR rights in our courts in respect of devolved matters, potentially leading to a two tier system with different levels of protection for human rights for reserved and devolved issues. I questioned Raab closely about his plans for Scotland. The JCHR report concluded that the UK Government should not pursue reform of the HRA without the consent of the devolved legislatures. I asked him if he would undertake not to do so. He said that he wasn’t prepared to give that undertaking until the text of the legislation he plans is in the public domain, but that he was “very mindful of the different traditions of the UK particularly in Scotland.” I then asked him what steps he will take to engage with the devolved governments in respect of any planned human rights reforms and he said he will set out how he proposes to do that when he announces a UK wide consultation. He said he was keen to avoid a two-tier system and that he wants to work with all the devolved governments and MPs to get it right.\nI pointed out that the problem with this is that when they said they were going to do that during Brexit, they failed to keep their promise and treated the Scottish and Welsh governments with contempt. I asked him to give me an undertaking that there would be a more respectful approach this time around and he gave that commitment. We shall see…\nPerhaps the highlight of the committee was Harriet Harman’s put down of Dominic Raab, reported in the National yesterday, in relation to his past comments that feminists were “obnoxious bigots”. She successfully got him to eat his words but when he sniped back that she might have raised the matter earlier as he said it back in 2011, she replied that if she had to police all the misogyny of Government Ministers, all the time, she would not have time to do anything else. It was a laugh out loud moment and a fitting parting shot from the Mother of the House who has just announced her retirement at the next election, after 40 years in parliament fighting for women’s rights.\nSome National Readers question why SNP MPs bother with Westminster. The answer is simple – that is what we were elected to do. We did not stand on an abstentionist platform and the majority of our constituents want us to be there doing our job of standing up for them, scrutinising the UK government and putting forward an alternative to their obnoxious agenda. Sure, being in opposition to a government with a huge majority is difficult, sometimes soul destroying, but that is our job.\nWhen a second independence referendum is announced with a prospectus we can get behind, we will be spending more time in Scotland campaigning, but as regards the independence long game there is preparatory work to be done at Westminster as well.\nWe are making alliances at home and abroad. Getting to know the people with whom, one day when independence is secured, we will have to negotiate a deal. Politics isn’t all about fine words it is also about pragmatism and forging relationships.",

Redford barracks has stood in Edinburgh for over 100 years, yet it is to be closed by a short sighted UK government with little or no thought over the impact on service personnel, or the economic impact on the local community. The UK government’s desperation to make a fast buck is utterly reckless.\n“Lately, the Defence Secretary seems to be spending more time threatening to take down the Prime Minister than concentrating on the wellbeing of armed forces personnel, their families and the local communities who support them.\n“Ahead of Armed Forces Day this weekend, the Prime Minister must intervene to protect Scotland’s defence footprint.\n“UK government defence ministers wrote to me at the beginning of March outlining that the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson, would shortly provide an update on the Better Defence Estate plan. I have written on behalf of local residents who are anxious to find out what is happening – over a hundred days have passed and yet we have shamefully heard nothing.\n“The UK government has pledged to spend billions of pounds renewing weapons of mass destruction – which are immoral and obsolete – at a time when our conventional forces are being run down.”",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_boris-johnson-again-shut-down-mp-scrutiny-of-his-govt/content_244.html": "How Boris Johnson has once again shut down MP scrutiny of his government\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 15th Jan 2021\nYesterday marked the last meeting of the Brexit select committee. Set up in the aftermath of the EU referendum to scrutinise the negotiations leading to the Withdrawal agreement, the Committee later moved on to scrutinise the negotiations on the future relationship with the EU. Our last piece of work will be a report on why we think the Future Relationship agreement continues to require detailed parliamentary scrutiny. The deal reached is only a starting position and there is a lot of work to be done to fill in the gaps and to address the problems it has created. The committee’s unanimous plea to be allowed to continue its work fell on deaf ears and Jacob Rees Mogg has insisted that we cease to exist. I suspect many readers of this column will wonder why they should shed a tear for any Westminster committee. So, let me try to explain.\nFor so long as there are still Scottish MPs at Westminster, scrutinising the UK Government is a big part of our job. It is what our constituents expect and often what we uncover can advance the cause of independence by highlighting the British government’s incompetence and chicanery. Select committees before which hapless ministers can be brought and cross examined are one of the best ways of doing this.\nHighlights of the committee’s evidence sessions have included some memorable grillings of David Davis, Steve Barclay and Michael Gove; a magisterial performance by Mike Russell which put backbench Brexiteers in their place at a time when they were still dreaming of taking control on the bridge of the Titanic; and the revelation that granting a ferry contract to Seaborne Freight, the company with no ferries, broke the law on competitive tendering. The committee has produced numerous forensic reports analysing some of the most important issues thrown up by Brexit including the implications for peace in Ireland and the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU after Brexit.\nMembership of the committee over the last four years has afforded SNP MPs including myself, Peter Grant and Philippa Whitford top level access to politicians and diplomats from across the EU and a chance to put Scotland’s case internationally. Our contacts books will come in handy over the next few years as an independent Scotland negotiates our future relationship with the EU.\nThe committee has been scrapped just as we were about to take evidence from Gove and Frost, the very people who negotiated the agreement which is throwing up such horrendous problems for Scotland’s seafood industry and causing chaos on the UK’s border with the EU and the new sea border between Northern Ireland and Britain. Jacob Rees Mogg wants to stop the committee from continuing its scrutiny of the agreement because he knows the more we look at it, the more problems we will uncover. For example, last week, an expert legal witness confirmed that, contrary to claims by Priti Patel, the UK will not be a safer place under the law enforcement and judicial co-operation parts of the agreement. Instead, as senior police officers and security experts have warned for years, our access to vital databases in the fight against crime has been lost or significantly restricted.\nI think we can all agree that hamstringing or disbanding committees which might uncover a government’s misdemeanours is not a good look. But this is just another example of parliamentary scrutiny being stymied by Boris Johnson. Why should we be surprised that someone who was prepared to suspend parliament is prepared to scrap a troublesome committee?\nIt is vital that SNP MPs find other ways to get to grips with the detail in the Future Relationship Agreement because understanding and monitoring the development of the new relationship between the UK and the EU will be important from the point of view of developing SNP policy on Scotland’s future relationship with the EU. When the next independence campaign proper starts there will a close focus both on how Scotland might re-join the EU and how we will manage our trade relationship with England and Wales thereafter.\nEarlier this week I attended a seminar organised by the European Movement in Scotland, the Scottish Centre for European Relations and the Faculty of Advocates to discuss the Issues and Challenges for an Independent Scotland in the EU. The speakers were all experts on EU enlargement and accession, or EU constitutional law. The whole event can be viewed here https://youtu.be/uxz-yCh1zws\nThere were several very important takeaways from this meeting for SNP policy making. In order to be eligible to re-join the EU Scotland will need to fulfil legal, political and economic criteria. These are known as the Copenhagen Criteria. As has been widely reported, Dr Lippert took the view that judged against these criteria Scotland would go to the top of the list in terms of eligibility. However, it is important to understand that by that she did not mean there is a queue for membership as such. Prof Ker Lindsay explained that’s not how EU enlargement works – if a state is ready and there is the political will then the state joins. Accession for Scotland could be fast and there is no question of Westminster having any say in that because the EU is very clear that third countries don’t get to choose so they will ignore any threatening voices from London.\nWe were told that Brexit has been a real game changer because inside the EU it is now much better understood why Scotland wants to be independent. However, we still need to establish a strong narrative about what we can offer to the EU project when we re-join. Dr Kirsty Hughes emphasised that Scotland needs to move quickly because the longer we are out of the EU and the more the UK diverges from EU law the more areas will require to be revisited during Scotland’s accession negotiations. This view was echoed by others. So was the view of Prof Locke that a key consideration will be what will happen to the Anglo Scottish border in terms of trade and persons crossing. The knowledge gleaned by SNP MPs on the Brexit select committee about borders and how they operate to facilitate trade across Europe between EU and Non-EU countries and between EU and EEA countries will be invaluable here.\nFinally, while the clear consensus was that for Scotland to be welcomed back into the EU we will need to secure our independence by a legal and constitutional process, significantly, it was also said whilst any discussion of a Plan B should bear this in mind, it does not necessarily mean that we must replicate the way in which things were done in 2014. I look forward to expanding on this aspect of the discussion at the SNP National Assembly on 24 January.\nI also look forward to taking forward detailed work on SNP policy on Scotland’s future relationship with the EU, having already had some fruitful discussion about how this should be done with our new SNP Policy Convenor, Chris Hanlon.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_cherry-appeal-to-scottish-govt-on-gender-self-id/content_289.html": "My appeal to the Scottish Government to press pause on gender self-ID\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 25th Feb 2022\nLast week I wrote about what the constitution of an independent Scotland might look like and reminded readers that, back in 2014, it was the intention of the Scottish Government to enshrine the protected characteristics of the Equality Act into our fundamental law. If that had happened then current efforts to redefine what it is to be a woman may well have been unconstitutional, while at the same time the rights of trans people as defined by the protected characteristic of “gender reassignment” would have continued to enjoy equal protection.\nInstead, it took Scotland’s Supreme Court, the Inner House of the Court of Session, chaired by Lady Dorrian, Scotland’s second most senior judge and the first woman ever to hold the role, to remind us that at least under the Equality Act, a piece of legislation largely reserved to Westminster, a woman is a female of any age and provisions in favour of women, by definition, exclude those who are biologically male.\nThis ruling would not have been secured had it not been for the fundraising efforts of For Women Scot. This grassroots feminist organisation run by volunteers and financed by small donations took on both the Scottish Government and organisations largely funded by the government, to successfully challenge the expansion of the definition of woman for the purpose of the Gender Representation on Public Boards (Scotland) Act 2018.\nThe essence of this decision is that the Scottish parliament cannot redefine what a woman is under the Equality Act because that is a reserved matter. It could well have significant implications for the draft Gender Recognition Bill which it is understood the Scottish Government had intended to introduce to parliament yesterday. Yesterday came and went with no Bill and now we understand that there will be a Ministerial statement next Thursday. If the current draft of the Bill introduces a system of self-identification of sex, there would be clear implications for provision of single sex services to women under the Equality Act. The Lord Advocate needs to sign off the Bill as within the competence of the parliament before it can proceed. This decision may well have given her pause for thought. The statement next week could in part be to buy time to consider the effect of recent case law, as the Equality and Human Rights Commission have urged.\nI hope that whoever makes the statement will be mindful of the commitment in 2014 to enshrine the protected characteristics of the Equality Act in the constitution of an independent Scotland and not turn this issue into one of constitutional politics.\nIt is also important to understand that self-identification is not a policy ever endorsed by SNP conference nor is it one to which our manifesto committed the Government. Last year the SNP manifesto for the Scottish elections said:\n“In the next parliament we will work with trans people, women, equality groups, legal and human rights experts to identify the best and most effective way to improve and simplify the process by which a trans person can obtain legal recognition, so that the trauma associated with that process is reduced. We remain committed to making necessary changes to the Gender Recognition Act that arise from this work at the earliest opportunity… We will ensure that these changes do not affect the rights or protections that women currently have under the Equality Act.'\nHaving regard to the court’s decision there is more of the promised work to be done with women, equality groups, legal and human rights experts to ensure that reforms of GRA does not affect the rights or protections that women currently have under the Equality Act.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission, the independent UK Human Rights and Equality Watchdog, have validated the concerns that I and many other women and same sex attracted people hold about the conflation of sex and gender and have asked the Scottish Government to pause and reconsider their plans for reform. These concerns centre on the potential consequences for individuals and society of extending the ability to change legal sex from a small defined group, who have demonstrated their commitment and ability to live in their acquired gender, to a wider group who identify as the opposite gender at a given point. The potential consequences include those relating to the collection and use of data, participation and drug testing in competitive sport, measures to address barriers facing women, and practices within the criminal justice system.\nThe fact that I, and others, hold these concerns does not mean that we are opposed to reform of the GRA. It just means that we oppose reform to allow anyone to get a Gender Recognition Certificate without any gate-keeping as to who may self-identify as the opposite sex from their birth sex.\nAnother decision by the Inner House yesterday has muddied the waters a bit by ruling that, for the purposes of the census, transgender people can register as male or female regardless of their legal status. However, that ruling turned on the construction of the 1920 Census Act where, in contrast to the Equality Act, sex is not defined. Furthermore, unlike the Equality Act, the Census Act does not confer individual rights.\nAcross civil society we see many other organisations both governmental and non-governmental pausing to reconsider the consequences of the wholesale unquestioning adoption of gender identity theory and self-identification. Many are withdrawing from Stonewall’s Diversity Champions scheme which stands accused of misrepresenting equality law to the detriment of women and same sex attracted people. Just this week another school pulled its plans for unisex toilets under pressure from parents determined that girls, particularly those entering puberty, should enjoy the safety and privacy of single sex toilets. And Police Scotland announced a review of their policy allowing alleged rapists to self-identify as women. So, I make this plea to those who lead my party and the Scottish Government. Press pause on self-identification. Reconsider. Fulfil our manifesto commitment as it was stated.\nSelf-funded groups working studiously and intelligently have shown the Government’s position to be wrong. This has come after years of abuse of women online, in their workplaces, and in the public sphere. Nobody who seeks to speak up for the rights of women and same sex attracted people should have to put up with this. It is wrong. It is not the Scotland I want to live in. It is not the Scotland envisaged by the Yes movement born in the summer of 2014 with all its joy and positivity. My party and our government need to restore the normal rules of civil democratic debate and ensure proper scrutiny of policy making in relation to this matter before the bile and messy thinking bleeds into other areas of our public debate and poisons the case for independence. The Ministerial statement promised next Thursday is an opportunity to stop the rot.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_uk-gov-eu-papers-ignore-scotland-distinct-legal-system/content_179.html": "UK Government’s EU Partnership Papers ignore Scotland’s distinct legal system\nThis Article first appeared in the Glasgow Herald\nIn recent weeks the UK government has published a number of papers setting out key issues for the “new, deep and special partnership” which it seeks with the EU after Brexit.\nThe paper on ‘Enforcement and dispute resolution’ and Monday’s paper on ‘Security, law enforcement and justice’ have significant implications for areas of law which are devolved to the Scottish Parliament and for the Scottish legal system. Yet there was no prior consultation with the Scottish Government or its Law Officers regarding these papers.\nBoth were published when the UK parliament was in recess so there has been little opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny at Westminster.\nFortunately, the Scottish Parliament is well ahead of the game. On 14 September, as part of its inquiry into the Article 50 negotiations, the Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Relations Committee, chaired by Joan McAlpine MSP, heard evidence from Professor Sir David Edward, former judge of Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”), Laura Dunlop QC and Peter Seller from the Faculty of Advocates and Michael Clancy from the Law Society of Scotland.\nIt was a lively session during which Sir David described the paper on enforcement and dispute resolution as “an undergraduate essay which would have failed”. He said that those writing these papers are not aware of the problems posed by the existence of a separate Scottish legal system and do not want to hear from experts who have offered to help.\nSir David’s evidence highlighted the fact that the UK Government has overlooked the significance of the separate Scottish legal system, the Scottish judicial system and the Scottish prosecution system in relation to Justice and Home Affairs issues such as Europol, the European Arrest Warrant, cross-border information systems and the conventions and regulations about recognition and enforcement of judgments. I know this to be the case, because when I received a courtesy call from a Junior Home Office Minister to advise of the publication of the second paper he seemed surprised when I took him to task for the lack of consultation with my Scottish Government colleagues and unaware that law enforcement and justice are devolved.\nThis matters because EU agencies such as Europol play a major part in day to day policing in Scotland, enabling the police to continue to work with our partners across Europe to target foreign criminals in Scotland and Scottish criminals on the European continent. For example, last year Europol supported Police Scotland and Romanian Police to dismantle a Romanian organised crime network involved in the trafficking of Romanian victims for sexual exploitation in Scotland.\nIt is not just in relation to Scotland that these papers are lacking. Sir David’s gripe with the paper on Dispute Resolution is that it completely misses the point that EU law is not so much about resolving disputes between member states and the EU but rather about protecting the rights of individual citizens. Significantly the EU Withdrawal Bill removes the right of individuals to challenge the UK government for breach of the general principles of retained EU law including rights relating to children and the free standing right to non discrimination which have no equivalent protection in domestic UK law.\nThe UK Government claims that one of its key aims in designing a future UK/EU partnership is to maximise certainty for individuals and businesses. However these vague and open ended papers create uncertainty and, by side-lining one of the main purposes of EU law and overlooking the significance of the devolved competences and the separate Scottish legal system, they do not inspire confidence.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_rishi-sunak-should-read-common-weals-eco-plan/content_27.html": "Rishi Sunak should read Common Weal's eco plan\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 17th Nov 2023\nIt's been another crazy week in British politics. Just as Suella Braverman was sent packing, David Cameron, the disgraced former prime minister who brought you Brexit and the Greensill lobbying scandal was elevated to the Lords and appointed Foreign Secretary.\nAt PMQs, Labour MP Kevin Brennan asked Rishi Sunak to name Cameron's finest policy achievement.\nThe Prime Minister's blushes as he attempted to answer were spared by the loud laughter that broke out on both sides of the House. Then just as the political agenda was rightly dominated by the major foreign policy issue of whether to support a ceasefire in Gaza, Westminster was rocked by the UK Government's comprehensive defeat in the UK Supreme Court over its Rwanda policy.\nI'm looking forward to writing about that on another day but today I want to make the point that it's a shame that this week's news agenda has prevented a greater focus on the shocking absence of any policies or legislation in the King's Speech to tackle the two biggest challenges the Government currently faces at home - climate change and the cost of living crisis. As the debate on the King's Speech continued in Parliament this week, a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation revealed that two million people across the UK have turned off their fridges and freezers as a response to the energy crisis.\nWhere's our green new deal, Rishi? It is a disgrace that so many cannot afford to pay their energy bills particularly in Scotland, an energy-rich country with so much potential. With vision and a green new deal, the UK Government could tackle both the climate crisis and the cost of living crisis and transform the way our economy works so that it benefits everyone.\nThe phrase -green new deal- was first coined in the USA and advanced by politicians on the left of the Democratic party as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also tackling social problems like poverty and inequality. The Biden administration has gone some way to putting it into action with an industrial strategy involving the world's most generous package of climate incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act. There is nothing similar in the UK and no sign of a plan for the much talked about \"just transition\".\nInstead, the UK Government has a newfound enthusiasm for drilling the oil and gas in the North Sea.\nHowever, oil from the Rosebank oil field will not increase energy security for the UK, nor will it lower our energy bills - it will be sold on the international market, and we'll have to buy it at the same price as everyone else. It will make the oil companies Equinor and Ithaca a lot of money, but UK taxpayers will pay for it. The Tories would rather give tax breaks to oil companies than lower energy bills. The 4 billion that UK taxpayers will fork out to the developers of the oil field, would have been much better spent insulating homes as a start to lowering energy bills.\nThe Tories didn't even bother to attach net-zero carbon conditions on the new field licence. There is no sign of them planning to do so for the future licences promised in the King's Speech. Of course, it is important that we protect the jobs created by the fossil fuel industry, but this should be done through a comprehensive and pragmatic just transition which values these workers' transferable skills and expertise.\nTheir talent will be a huge part of our renewable success going forward. Retaining that talent and addressing skills opportunities could make our domestic green energy sector a true global leader.\nRemember when our oil was going to run out?\nWhat the UK Government's newfound enthusiasm for drilling the oil and gas in the North Sea does make very clear is the extent to which Unionists were prepared to lie to win the 2014 indyref when they claimed that the oil and gas in the North Sea was running out. But we knew that anyway.\nIn Scotland the Common Weal policy think tank have produced some excellent work on what a green new deal would look like. During the pandemic they produced a comprehensive plan called Our Common Home - A Green New Deal for Scotland. Their blueprint would involve a comprehensive process of public works, delivered by public bodies and paid for out of the public purse. It would cover energy, agriculture and housing and it could bring huge benefits of employment, prosperity, and skills. The crucial thing to understand is that it is a plan not just for our environment, but for the whole of our economy and society.\nOne example of how it might work is in tackling the problem of the cold draughty homes in which almost all of us live. We need to insulate. Insulating new buildings is easy. The real challenge is retrofitting existing buildings. Common Weal argues that doing this could supercharge our construction industry. And that it could be combined with a programme of transformative land reform to allow for reforesting to produce the wood needed for this construction work. Reforestation done properly would also assist carbon capture and expand biodiversity.\nOnce the buildings were insulated, Common Weal wants them to be heated by district heating systems providing heating by a combination of solar, thermal and geothermal systems. Inter-seasonal heat storage could be used to store heat from the summer for use in winter. All of this would cost less and could feed into the grid much quicker than new nuclear power. It would also be a more communitarian solution than the individualistic focus on expensive heat pumps put forward by the Scottish Greens. It would be a huge engineering feat, but other countries have done it successfully as Lesley Riddoch's new film Denmark - The State of Happiness will show when it's released. Like others, the Danes are now reaping the benefits. The journey to get there would create well-paid jobs and the results would be long lasting.\nTory MP Chris Skidmore's report on net zero identified that \"going green\" is good for the economy as well as the planet but this sort of thinking was wholly absent from Sunak's programme for government. Of course, we should not be at all surprised that the Tory government has turned its back on the green agenda for perceived electoral advantage after one freak by-election result caused by Sadiq Khan's expansion of the Ulez scheme to greater London. Nor should we be surprised by the Tory government's lack of care for those struggling because of the cost of living crisis.\nThe UK Covid-19 Inquiry has heard evidence about how during the pandemic privileged government figures could not comprehend the lives of the people for whom they were making decisions. The Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor are all very rich men. They will never need to make decisions like turning off their fridges or freezers to save money during an energy crisis.\nOnly an independent Scottish Government could deliver a new green deal for Scotland. Meantime, we should be working on more communitarian solutions to the challenges we face. The Common Weal have some really well thought through ideas. I am hopeful that the SNP government under Humza's leadership will be more willing to listen to them than his predecessor. So far as I can see they have a much more comprehensive solution to the climate crisis than anything put forward by the Scottish Greens.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_i-visited-rwanda-this-is-what-i-learned-about-uk-immigration-policy/content_16.html": "I visited Rwanda. This is what I learned about UK immigration policy\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 19th Apr 2024\nLike most of my SNP colleagues, I believe that our political representatives should be accountable to the electorate and so I do not approve of the way in which the House of Lords is selected rather than elected. However, I have been surprised and impressed by the dogged insistence of their lordships on their amendments to the Rwanda bill this week. The fight is not over yet and while cynics say the PM is happy to let the ping pong between Commons and Lords go on for a little longer while he gets his ducks in a row for the first deportation flight to Rwanda, I say credit where credit is due.\nThe lords started out with nearly a dozen amendments now there are only two. But they are important because one underlines the moral bankruptcy of this policy and the other its total disregard for evidence based policy making. The first amendment is designed to prevent Afghan veterans who assisted British armed forces in Afghanistan from being deported. One might think this would be a moral imperative but when I put that to the PM at the Liaison Committee before Easter, he lost his cool completely. A sign of a guilty conscience I reckon.\nThe second drafted by Lord Hope, formerly Scotland’s most senior judge and the Deputy President of the UK Supreme Court, is designed to put a halt to the scheme should new evidence suggesting Rwanda is not a safe country comes to light. Pretty tame and reasonable stuff particularly when there is already plenty of evidence to suggest that Rwanda is not currently a safe country for those seek asylum in the UK.\nThat’s what the United Kingdom Supreme Court found at the end of last year. Their decision was based on evidence about the general human rights situation in Rwanda, the adequacy of Rwanda’s current asylum system and Rwanda’s failure to meet their obligations in a similar agreement regarding asylum seekers with Israel in 2013.\nThe UK government’s response was to enter into a new agreement with the Rwandan Government providing for a new approach to the processing of asylum seekers in Rwanda which they say addresses the issue of safety. That agreement provides for a new asylum law in Rwanda, major reforms in their court system and the training of immigration officials, lawyers and judges in the new law and systems. And now the UK Government are desperately trying to pass the bill which declares that Rwanda is a safe country for asylum seekers and trying to put that issue beyond judicial scrutiny.\nThe trouble is that none of the new measures to which Rwanda and the UK have agreed are properly in place yet. Accordingly, the UK Government’s insistence that Rwanda is now a safe country for asylum seekers is a legal fiction. The relevant legislation is still going through the Rwandan parliament, the legal reforms and the new systems are yet to be put in place and although training has commenced it is still in its infancy.\nSince I last wrote about the Rwanda policy, I have visited the country for myself in my role as Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR). The committee will report on our visit in due course, so these are just my personal reflections and conclusions on the visit. The Supreme Court found that the Rwandans were acting in good faith but that “intentions and aspirations do not necessarily correspond to reality”. Having met with Rwandan government ministers and officials, health care workers, lawyers, those who will deliver the legal training and NGOs, I agree. During the visit, we viewed accommodation being prepared for arrivals from the UK. The hostel we were shown was of a considerably higher quality than that which the UK Government provides for asylum seekers – a long way from the Bibby Stockholm barge. Whether the rest of the accommodation being prepared is of similar high quality I cannot say.\nOwing to their recent history 80% of Rwandans have themselves been refugees. On their borders they accommodate well over one hundred thousand refugees and displaced persons from neighbouring countries, particular Burundi, and the Congo. The Rwandans I met were at pains to emphasise that they see refugees as their friends, their brothers, and sisters. I was struck by how their attitude contrasts with the UK government’s hostility towards asylum seekers and their desire to off load their moral and legal responsibilities toward their asylum onto others.\nWhen the JCHR considered the UK Government’s original agreement with Rwanda and the Illegal Migration Bill, we expressed concern that the policy could be seen as outsourcing the UK's obligations under the Refugee Convention to another country. We also said that removing asylum seekers to a state where they face a real risk of serious human rights abuses, or of being sent on to a dangerous third country because of an inadequate asylum system, is inconsistent with the UK's human rights obligations.\nWhilst those I met in Rwanda were keen to emphasise that their written constitution contains good human rights protections, few were able to point to any case-law showing people in Rwanda taking advantage of those protections. In 2016 the Rwandan Government withdrew the right of individual petition to the African Court of Human Rights because they were unhappy with the way in which it handled claims brought by Rwandan dissidents. I could not help but see in this an echo of the UK Government’s attitude towards the European Court of Human Rights.\nA 137-page Country Information Note on Human Rights in Rwanda prepared by the UK Government’s Home Office and updated in January this year collates sources including the US State Department and Human Rights Watch setting out serious shortcomings in the protection of human rights in Rwanda. These organisations and others like Amnesty International have collected evidence of unlawful or arbitrary killings, disappearances, and torture. It is extraordinary that the UK Government think this can just be ignored.\nOne area of particular concern for asylum seekers sent from the UK is the protection of the rights of same sex attracted and transgender people. The UK Foreign Office travel advice for Rwanda warns “individuals can experience discrimination and abuse, including from local authorities. There are no specific anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT individuals.” When I put this to government officials and others with whom we met I was reassured that the Rwandan constitution contains a general protection against discrimination, but no one was able to show me any evidence that any LGBT person has ever availed themselves of this protection. On LGBT rights I think Rwanda is where Britain was 50 years ago. Yes, unlike many other African countries, homosexuality is not criminalised but there are no statutory rights for same-sex attracted or trans people and no specific antidiscrimination laws. According to NGOs we met on the ground LGBT people face stigmatisation and discrimination in what is quite a conservative society.\nRwanda has a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) with whom we met but it struck me as far too close to government. Until recently its current chair led on the Migration and Economic Development Partnership in her capacity as the Head of International Justice and Judicial Co-operation in the Ministry of Justice. It seems the NHRC never criticises the government in its annual reports, preferring to resolve issues “collaboratively”. This contrasts with our own domestic human rights commissions who are quite prepared to criticise government where necessary.\nMany who come to the UK seeking asylum have left their own countries because they were under threat as dissidents or human rights defenders. LGBT asylum seekers want to come to the UK because here they would enjoy some of the best rights protections in the world. Such asylum seekers are confident they would fare better in the UK than at home, the evidence does not suggest to me that they could have the same confidence in Rwanda.\nBased on the evidence and information I gathered on my trip to Rwanda I remain of the view that it is still not a safe country for asylum seekers. As the United Nations High Commission for Refugees told me, systemic and structural change needs to happen and then it needs to cascade down through the system. That will take time. A greater commitment to meaningful human rights protections is also required. Viewed against these conclusions the Lords’ amendments are small beer. That they should be resisted by the UK Government so strenuously is disgraceful.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_optimism-ahead-of-snps-conference/content_118.html": "It's time for optimism ahead of the SNP's conference\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 07th Oct 2022\nThere can be no doubt that this weekend’s SNP Conference takes place at an auspicious time both for the party and the cause of independence.\nThis is the first time the party conference has met in person since October 2019. The first conference since our December 2019 General Election win, our third in a row, and the first time since the Holyrood election win in May 2021, which was our fourth win in a row.\nThe conference also takes place on the eve of the Lord Advocate’s Supreme Court reference which could lead to a decision paving the way to a second independence referendum next October.\nThe Tories are on their knees across the UK. Polls published this week predict that in the event of a snap General Election they would face an electoral wipe out in Scotland with the SNP taking all their seats. One poll shows that if a Holyrood election was held tomorrow the SNP would win an outright majority and puts support for independence up 5 points.\nThis is not an outlier. Last month the British Social Attitudes Survey, showed 52% support for independence in Scotland, the highest figure it has ever recorded. What is so significant about these polls and the survey is that they show the difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK. While the Tories implosion has led to Labour riding high in England and Wales, in Scotland it is the SNP who benefit. Labour are taking votes from the Tories and Liberal democrats in Scotland but they are not taking them from the SNP. Scotland and England continue to travel on very different political trajectories.\nThere is much to be positive about, but we must avoid the temptation for complacency at all costs. The Tories fall from grace since their spectacular victory in England at the end of 2019 demonstrates how unexpected events can turn the tide. As ever it is important for us to have all our ducks in a row for the forthcoming independence campaign and to continue to strive to get support up to 60% and beyond.\nI was pleased by the response from activists to my column last week. Many people have been in touch to express support for my argument that, particularly as Sterling tanks after years of losing value, it is time to bite the bullet of addressing a world that has changed hugely since the publication of the Growth Commission. I enjoyed a lively lunch with Business for Scotland supporters last Friday where this approach also received a lot of support. It is time to reboot the vision for independence and flesh it out. I am hopeful that some topical conference motions framed in the light of the fallout from the Tories disastrous mini-budget might focus matters. It helps that we are back to in person conferences. Nothing beats the opportunities afforded for party members and activists from across the country to meet and chat. I am really looking forward to doing that again so please if you are there come up and say hello.\nEarlier this week I attended the funeral of a dedicated independence campaigner who supported my election campaigns come rain or shine. A true internationalist, Ann Jamieson lived and travelled all over the world. One of the songs she chose for her funeral was Sheena Wellington singing ‘A Man’s a Man”. I am moved to tears by this rendition at the best of times and Ann’s funeral was all the more moving for it. It was a very sad day made sadder when at the afters we heard the news of the death of Ian Hamilton KC.\nThe celebrant at Ann’s funeral read out as her epitaph some words Ann had written recently;-\n“I do not see myself as ‘lucky’. Rather I see myself as a product of the fantastic Scottish education system and culture, which gave me not only a Fife County Council house in Glencraig to grow in, Lochgelly Equitable Cooperative Society, Edinburgh University, Stirling University, Europe and Africa but also a decent income and the capacity to let my own kids flourish. My passion, to reach for the inevitable cliché, is to see all of Scotland flourish forever.”\nI don’t see those last few words as a cliché at all. It should be the passion of all independence supporters to see all of Scotland flourish forever. But here’s the thing. I suspect that it is also the passion of many unionists. And people on both sides will have different views of what a flourishing Scotland might look like.\nBurn’s poem, sung so poignantly by Sheena at the reconvening of the Scottish parliament in 1999, extols the virtues of honesty, integrity, and independence of mind. My late friend Ann and the late Ian Hamilton had these virtues in spades.\nIf we want to be an independent nation, then we need to be independent of mind. This means listening to those with whom we disagree and reaching decisions on policy direction after considering matters carefully, having listened to all stakeholders, rather than on the basis of soundbites or what is perceived to be fashionable.\nWhen Professor John Curtice won the lifetime achievement award at the recent Holyrood Magazine Political Awards, he posed this question to the watching politicos and lobbyists – How do you propose to heal the wounds after the resolution of the constitutional question? I believe that work on paving the way to doing so can start now if we take steps to ensure that the debate about independence is always measured and respectful.\nTo achieve this goal, we must always be tolerant and listen to the concerns of those who disagree with our vision for Scotland. Attempts to control and police the debate and who can participate in it should be resisted. Sometimes when words of caution are sounded about a particular policy which are at first unwelcome the passage of time and events can prove them to be vindicated. We don’t have to look too far to see examples of this recently. If our passion is, like my friend Ann’s, for all of Scotland to flourish, then all voices must be heard not just those who are fashionable or acceptable to certain factions.",

It is convention to say that it is a pleasure to follow the previous speaker, but I find it hard to say that because I do not agree with anything that the right hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Sir John Hayes) said. It is an extraordinary proposition to say that, to use his words, it is virtuous and just for the United Kingdom to pass legislation that is in breach of our international obligations. These are not obligations that have been imposed on us from above. They are obligations to which we freely signed up. If the Government and Conservative Members do not like the obligations to which they freely signed up, they should have the courage of their convictions and join their chums in Russia and Belarus as non-signatories to the European convention on human rights. [Interruption.] They do not like it, but it is true: those are the other two countries in Europe that cannot live with the obligations in the European convention on human rights.\nI want to make another preliminary point before I go any further. The right hon. Gentleman does not speak for my constituents—he does not speak for the people of Edinburgh South West. The contents of my mailbox and my conversations with constituents show that he does not speak for them. He does not speak for other voters in Scotland, either. We are proud of our international obligations, and we would like to remain a signatory to the European convention on human rights.\nThere is widespread concern about this Bill, and not just from lefty lawyers, to whom the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Lia Nici) referred earlier.\nLia Nici\nWill the hon. and learned Lady give way?\nNo, I will not at this stage; I want to develop my point. I have been a lawyer for many years, and it pains me to say this—because I am a lefty lawyer Toggle showing location ofColumn 735—but if the hon. Lady knew much about the legal profession she would know that most lawyers are actually not lefties. However, what most lawyers do have, in contrast to the Conservative Members who have spoken so far today, is respect for the rule of law and for legal obligations freely entered into. Nobody took the hand of the United Kingdom and forced it to sign the convention. We did so freely, of our own volition. I repeat that, if Conservative Members do not like the obligations any longer, because they occasionally throw up results they do not like, they should have the courage of their convictions and leave the convention.\nLia Nici\nWill the hon. and learned Lady give way?\nI want to develop my point. I will take interventions in a moment. I do not want to take up too much time.\nI rise to speak mainly to amendment 122, which is in my name, and to support the amendments tabled on behalf of the Scottish National party by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss). I also add my support to the excellent and forensic points made, as always, by my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Stuart C. McDonald). It is a great pity that the Minister chose to take no notes while my hon. Friend was speaking, because he made some very good points and it would be really nice to hear why the Government disagree with them. At the end of six hours of debate, it is going to be difficult for the Minister to answer those points, given that he paid no attention to them and did not make any notes.\nI tabled amendment 122 in my capacity as Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and I am very grateful to those hon. Members who have lent their support to it. I am not going to press it, because the Committee has only just commenced its legal scrutiny of this Bill. That is not because we are dragging our feet, but because the Bill has been bounced on us at such short notice. We have very little time to undertake that scrutiny, but we hope to report before the Bill has finished its passage through the Lords. At that point, I hope we will be able to recommend some detailed amendments.\nAmendment 122 is a probing amendment that gives me the opportunity to explain to the Government the legal basis of our obligations to obey the interim measures of the European Court of Human Rights, because an awful lot of what we in Scotland call mince—which is a technical legal term—has been spoken about that so far.\nAs a preliminary point, I also want to stress the widespread opposition to this Bill. Our own Equalities and Human Rights Commission, the Scottish Human Rights Commission and the Council of Europe all have severe concerns about this Bill’s impact on our international legal obligations. The UNHCR also has severe concerns about it, as have the Law Society of England and Wales, the Law Society of Scotland, many other very respectable civil society organisations and many of our constituents.\nOver the weekend, I received a number of letters from primary 7 pupils at Oxgangs Primary School in my constituency of Edinburgh South West. The gist of their letters was that we are a wealthy nation—the hon. Member for Devizes (Danny Kruger), who is no longer in his place, referred to the United Kingdom as a wealthy Toggle showing location ofColumn 736country; it is not a country but a union of nations—and we need to do more to help refugees. As other hon. Members have said, the majority of displaced people in this world just go to the country next door. It is only a very tiny fraction who come to the United Kingdom, looking for our help. I think that what those young people were trying to say is that we have a moral obligation to them. I think they were also making the point that human rights are universal. The Government need to remember that. This Bill seeks to carve out certain categories of people to whom human rights will not be applicable in the same way as they are to me and my constituents. That is simply wrong.\nThe purpose of amendment 122, which relates to clause 49, is to ensure that we recognise that the United Kingdom is bound to comply with interim measures issued by the European Court of Human Rights, and that any regulations made under clause 49 do not undermine that principle. The amendment is consistent with the unanimous recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights when we reported on a similar provision in the Bill of Rights Bill.\nIt is important to set out the legal basis on which the United Kingdom is bound to comply with those interim measures, and I will take a couple of minutes to do so. Under rule 39 of the rules of the European Court of Human Rights, the Court may indicate interim measures to any state party—not just the United Kingdom—that has freely signed up to the convention. They are usually sought in connection with immigration removal or extradition cases, and they amount to a requirement that the removal or extradition be suspended—not stopped—until the case has been fully examined. Case law from the Court has established that requests for interim measures are granted only exceptionally, when applicants would otherwise face a real risk of serious and irreversible harm. They are granted from time to time against the United Kingdom, but in fact that is very rarely the case. In 2021, the European Court of Human Rights received 1,020 requests from across the Council of Europe for interim measures and granted 625 of them. However, between 2019 and 2021, the interim measures under rule 39 were applied for in 880 cases against the UK, but granted in just seven of them.\nThis rides a coach and horses through our freely entered into international legal obligations in respect of interim measures—it really is taking a hammer to crack a nut. Interim measures appear in the rules of the Court rather than in the convention itself, which has led some commentators—including some Conservative Members —to argue that the UK is not bound to comply with them. This is particularly the case because article 46 of the convention, which concerns the “Binding force and execution of judgments”, only commits the UK to abide by final judgments of the Court, and does not mention interim measures.\nHowever, the Grand Chamber of the Court has held that a failure to comply with interim measures amounts to a violation of article 34 of the convention under which the high contracting parties undertake “not to hinder in any way the effective exercise” of the right of applicants to bring their claims before the Court.\nThe Court itself has said that a failure to comply with interim measures is a breach of article 34 of the convention. We all know that the reason why the Government are so exercised about this issue is that interim measures were indicated by the European Court in relation to the Government’s attempts to remove asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite the domestic courts not granting an injunction. Clearly, that has caused severe concern in the Government, because the interim measures were issued without the United Kingdom having made submissions—without having a chance to be heard—and without a reasoned judgment.\nIf there are good faith and meaningful negotiations going on between the United Kingdom and the Council at the moment, I hope that it will be discussed whether, in future, there might be an opportunity for the UK to be heard before an interim measure is granted. Lawyers in the Chamber will know that, frequently, Governments and other big bodies that are often sued lodge with the courts in the English, Welsh and Scottish systems what is called a caveat, so that if anybody applies for an interim order against them, they get the right to be heard. I think that that would be a reasonable reform of the Strasbourg system. However, the mere absence of that provision at the moment would not justify our ignoring either the obligations or the convention that we have signed up to, as interpreted by the Court. Anyone in the Chamber who is used to dealing with litigation will know that interim measures—both interim injunctions in England and interim interdicts in Scotland—are frequently granted without the other party being heard, because they are interim measures to preserve the status quo while a lasting decision is made.\nIf a person faces being removed from this country to Rwanda, having come here seeking sanctuary, an interim measure pending the full determination of the impact that it might have on them is actually rather important. For example, LGBT people were mentioned earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East. There are no anti-discrimination laws in Rwanda protecting same-sex attracted people or transgender people. They can be discriminated against, refused accommodation and refused a job on the basis of their sexuality or their gender identity. I think that we are all agreed that that is not acceptable. As my hon. Friend said, imagine the position of somebody fleeing the regime in Uganda, where even to state their sexuality or gender identity is now unlawful, coming here to seek sanctuary and then facing being deported to Rwanda. They might be very grateful for interim measures being granted while their human rights were fully explored.\nI will not press amendment 122, but it is important that we conduct ourselves in this Parliament on the basis of a proper understanding of the legal position, rather than populist slogans.\nI wish to say something about sovereignty. The hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)—I am tempted to call him my hon. Friend—is an expert on the sovereignty of this Parliament. When he talks about sovereignty, he talks about a very distinctively English concept. The notion that Parliament has unlimited sovereignty is a distinctively English principle that really has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law.\nSir William Cash rose—\nI will give way in a moment. I just want to develop my point and then I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, because I know that we have been arguing about this for years. This is an important point to make.\nIt is sometimes assumed that this Parliament just took on the character of the English constitution when it unified with the Scottish Parliament. Perhaps it is worth considering that there are other notions of sovereignty. In my country, the people are sovereign, not the Parliament, and they can choose to share their sovereignty with, for example, the Edinburgh Parliament, this Parliament and other international institutions. The endless obsessing about the sovereignty of Parliament is not particularly helpful. Where I really disagree with the hon. Gentleman is in this: I think that the Human Rights Act was an elegant solution to fulfilling our rights under the convention, while also respecting the sovereignty of this Parliament.\nSir William Cash\nI wish to reply to the hon. and learned Lady by saying that the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament rests with the United Kingdom Parliament. I know that she would quite like to leave it, but, on the other hand, she is bound by it, and the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 specifies quite clearly that the sovereignty is guaranteed.\nThe Union between Scotland and England was freely entered into. I know that some people are under the misapprehension that now it is some sort of “Hotel California” situation, where we can check out but cannot leave, but that is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the Union. The views that I am expounding about sovereignty are not just my eccentric views, but the views that have been expounded by many well-respected Scottish jurists, as the hon. Gentleman knows. It is worthwhile sometimes to take a step back. With all due respect to some of my English friends, they get a bit hysterical about parliamentary sovereignty. Sovereignty can be shared and, ultimately, I believe that sovereignty lies with the people. I will just leave it at that.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_threat-to-the-human-rights-act/content_236.html": "SNP need independence 'contingency' plans as Tories rip up the rule book\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 17th Jul 2020\nThis week most eyes have been rightly fixed on the devolution power grab planned by the Tories to secure their post Brexit internal market. However, at the same time, SNP MPs have been working hard to find out what the Tories have in store for human rights protections in their new Brexitopia. The Tory manifesto which was so roundly rejected by voters in Scotland contained a promise to “update the Human Rights Act and administrative law to ensure that there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government.”\nBe in no doubt that these seemingly innocuous words are the signal that Boris Johnson plans to take revenge for the pasting he got from the UK Supreme court in the prorogation case.\nThis wrecking ball to what remains of the British Constitution will commence with a rather innocuously named Constitution, Democracy and Rights Commission announced earlier this year. The Lord Chancellor (the Tories’ Justice Secretary) told us in June that he was also working on an Independent Review into the operation of the Human Rights Act (HRA) but seemed reluctant to give further details.\nEarlier this week one of his junior ministers was on duty at the monthly parliamentary question time on justice matters and we got a little more detail. He acknowledged that the Scottish Government would need to be consulted about any changes to the HRA and that the implications for Scotland’s separate legal jurisdiction would require to be taken into account. However, I fear given his Government’s track record he may have to eat his words.\nThe Human Rights Act was passed in 1998 the same year as the Scotland Act which established the Scottish Parliament. The combined effect of these two Acts was to incorporate the ECHR into Scots law and Scottish governance. Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament must act compatibly with the ECHR or the courts can strike down their laws and decisions.\nThe HRA applies across the UK and means that people living in the UK can use the domestic courts to give effect to the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the ECHR. Judges must read and give effect to laws passed by Westminster in a way which is compatible with Convention rights and it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with the ECHR.\nThe EU are certainly sufficiently concerned about the Tories plans to ‘update’ the HRA that they have made it a condition of future co-operation on law enforcement and judicial co-operation in criminal matters that the UK continues to adhere to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and to give effect to it in its domestic law. The EU understands that without the HRA to guarantee domestic legal access to the rights afforded by the ECHR human rights in the UK will be diminished.\nThe ability to realise these rights in the domestic courts have brought real and tangible results for British citizens who have been ill-served by the state.\nTo take just two examples; the police were held to account for breaching women’s rights under Article 3 of the ECHR (the prohibition on torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) for failing to properly investigate reports of rape in the case of John Worboys, the taxicab rapist. And legal action to protect the right to life under Article 2 delivered the new inquests into the deaths at Hillsborough which found that football fans had been unlawfully killed and that the Liverpool fans were not to blame.\nThe antipathy to the HRA exhibited by the current Tory party is part of their hostility to international rules-based codes and typifies the British exceptionalism of a government that thinks everything British (but presumably not Scottish) is world leading.\nThe direction of travel of the Scottish Government in respect of human rights protections is very different.\nIn December 2018 the First Minister’s Advisory Group on Human Rights reported with recommendations for a new human rights framework to improve peoples’ lives in Scotland. Their recommendations are designed to make sure that Scotland does not regress from the rights which were previously guaranteed by our membership of the EU and that we continue to keep pace with future rights developments within the EU and demonstrate leadership in human rights. The Advisory Group recommended that the Scottish Parliament should pass a new human rights act incorporating economic, social, cultural and environmental rights in the devolved areas.\nIn the event of independence, the Group recommended that there should be a written constitution and a Bill of Rights for Scotland. In October last year, a National Taskforce for Human Rights Leadership was set up to take forward these recommendations at least in so far as devolved powers are concerned.\nHowever, we are fast learning that the problem with devolution is that the powers and competences of the Scottish parliament exist only at Westminster’s pleasure. The power grab prompted by the Tories desire to create an internal market seems likely to be followed by attempts to restrict the human rights protections enjoyed by people living in Scotland.\nThis Tory Government has a significant majority. Most of its MPs are 100 per cent signed up to project Little Britain. In order to realise their dreams, they are quite prepared to undermine the devolved settlement that has been the settled will of the Scottish people for more than two decades. The question for the Independence movement and for the SNP is whether, with this level of disrespect for Scottish democracy, we can be sure that a second independence referendum will be guaranteed simply by the SNP winning yet another election.\nThis Westminster Tory Government is ripping up the rule book. It is time for some serious contingency planning.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_scotland-not-better-off-if-boris-johnson-goes/content_301.html": "As part of the UK, Scotland will not be any better off if Boris Johnson goes\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 14th Jan 2022\nThis week, as we reached the high-water mark of Tory sleaze, corruption and contempt for ordinary citizens, what was perhaps most instructive to voters in Scotland was the contempt displayed towards the Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross by senior figures in his own party. Jacob Rees Mogg said “he’s not a big figure in the Conservative party” – well, that much we knew. But worse was to come from fellow Scot Michael Gove whose withering put-down for the proles who haven’t managed to escape the far north for betterment in London was very revealing - “my instant response is he's in Elgin and the national Tory leader is in London”. With that the pompous and insecure Scot in London, desperately trying to ape his acquired social set, amplified and reflected back the derision for Scotland and the Scots which abounds at the heart of the British establishment.\nYes, Boris and his mates despise the plebs, but even more so if they are in Scotland.\nAs that contempt has become impossible to deny and even Keir Starmer calls for Johnson’s resignation, some ask whether it’s wise for the SNP to force the resignation of such a lame dog Prime Minister? Much as some still ponder whether it was wise for the SNP to force the General Election that so strengthened an already damaged Boris Johnson’s hand in December 2019. Henry Kissinger famously said, “America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests”. So, in the midst of this ever-growing scandal, what is in the interests of Scotland and what will further the cause of independence?\nScotland’s impotence in the UK has led to us being forced out of the EU against our will despite all the assurances that this would not be allowed to happen. Yet the evidence that the EU is a much more attractive option than the union with England, continues to mount.\nAnd the truth is that even if we get rid of Johnson, he will be replaced by another Tory leader who thinks Brexit is the settled will of the British people and who will be saddled with the deal Johnson negotiated. Indeed, even if Labour’s poll lead holds up and they win the next UK General Election, before independence is secured, there is no reason to believe they would reverse Brexit and Starmer has set his face against independence and any deal with the SNP.\nWhile the party-gate scandal raged this week Labour held an opposition day debate to highlight the burdens currently faced by British business and to suggest some solutions. Astonishingly the motion and the speech of their lead Spokesperson made no mention of Brexit. Yet, Brexit is forecast to do twice as much damage to the economy as Covid 19. In October the Office for Budget Responsibility’s Economic and fiscal outlook forecast that in the long-term Brexit will cause a 4% hit to GDP as opposed to a 2% hit from Covid.\nOn the first anniversary of Brexit Boris Johnson boasted of striking more than 70 new trade deals but he did not bother to mention that all but 2 of them were merely extending existing EU deals or that the promised trade deal with US has failed to materialise. He claimed to have taken back control of Britain’s borders without mentioning the refugee crisis in the English Channel, which absent international cooperation is proving hard to solve. Nor did he mention the labour shortages which are particularly acute in our agriculture and hospitality sectors as a result of the loss of freedom of movement.\nAnd, as of 1st January, there is a whole maze of new customs bureaucracy for those who wish to import goods from the EU to the UK. Goods imported from the EU now need immediate import declarations not 6 months down the line as before. Food and plant products need to be notified in advance and you only get the tariff-free trade the PM promised if importers and exporters can prove that the goods were made substantially in the UK or the EU.\nBritish exporters to the EU had to face all this last year – it has drastically damaged the seafood industry in Scotland – but the UK govt delayed the import controls in the UK until 1st January this year. There are many more rules involving costly and time-consuming inspections on imports from the EU due to be introduced as 2022 progresses.\nIt is understandable that the PM and the Tories don’t want to mention these problems, but why are the official opposition so reluctant to mention them? I imagine they don’t want to antagonise the working-class pro-Brexit voters who broke down the red wall to elect so many Tory MPs for the first time two years ago. But that was then, and this is now. Opinion polls show that some of those new Tory MPs coats are on very shoogly pegs. Importantly they also show that the public aren’t happy with how Brexit is going. Last week a YouGov survey showed that across the UK only 15% think Brexit is going fairly or very well whereas 52% think it’s going fairly or very badly.\nWhile Johnson’s stock plummets we should not forget that it was Tory MPs like Douglas Ross, now rushing to condemn him, who voted him in as leader and who put him in a position to impose a particularly messy Brexit on all 4 constituent parts of the UK. They need to be made to own the consequences of their actions.\nBut, as regards Scotland’s future, it does not matter much who the Tory leader is and a Labour PM won’t make that much difference either. Ultimately, realignment with the EU and re-entrance into the Single Market and Customs Union is necessary to undo the worst impacts of Brexit. However, rather than seek solutions, the UK under the Tories is agitating for further disruption by threatening to invoke article 16 in Northern Ireland, and frustrating Brexit negotiations on Northern Ireland. Yet Labour won’t talk about it and Labour don’t have a plan for what to do about it.\nMeanwhile, as my colleague Richard Thomson, the SNP’s Spokesperson on Northern Ireland revealed last week, the performance of the Irish economy, North and South shows the benefits of membership of the single market. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that the Northern Irish economy has largely recovered from the pandemic with the best performance across all nations and regions of the UK. This suggests that the access to the single market afforded by the protocol is beneficial. In contrast, the Scottish economy has suffered a 6% hit since the final full quarter before the pandemic hit.\nSouth of what remains of the border imposed on Ireland 100 years ago, the Republic of Ireland has become economically stronger than the UK as the proportion of its export trade in goods with the UK became a smaller proportion of its overall trade. Export figures from the Irish Central Statistics Office show that in 1973 – when the UK and Ireland joined the European Community – Ireland exported nearly 55% of its goods to the UK. Now, with a more diverse economy, 90% of the country’s exports are to non-UK destinations. OECD data shows that its GDP per person has gone from only being 66% of the UK’s in 1973 to over 200% in 2020, the latest year available.\nThese figures shows the benefits of membership of the biggest single market in the world, around seven times the size of the UK’s internal market. They also give the lie to the unionist argument that Scotland must forever be predominantly reliant on its trade with England to thrive.\nBut for now, Scotland is cut off from the world’s largest single market in a UK that has the lowest GDP per head, worst economic productivity, highest poverty rates, and greatest inequality amongst its neighbours. This tale of two nations surely shows that no matter which PM replaces Johnson, as now seems inevitable, Scotland’s interests lie in going our own way and joining another union in which we can enjoy the benefits of relationship of equals.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-scots-will-vote-for/content_253.html": "I am convinced it’s the SNP that Scots will vote for\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 26th May 2023\nPOLLS brought mixed news for Yessers this week. While support for independence was riding high at 53% in the Ipsos Scottish Political Monitor poll reported by this newspaper, support for the Scottish National Party in voting intentions at Westminster has dropped to 41% and the SNP face the threat of losing seats to the Labour Party. However, when the pollsters put six questions to voters on which party they trusted most, the SNP came out on top each time, including on the questions of which party is most trusted to stand up for Scotland’s interests, to grow the economy and to tackle the cost of living crisis.\nThis last point is very important as it could determine who wins the next election in Scotland. It is quite clear to me that for my constituents this is the most pressing issue they face. Almost everyone is affected from mortgage payers to people on low wages or benefits who are struggling to eat and folk who are in work but are struggling to pay their bills and rent despite having a job. The party which prioritises this issue and has a good record to point to in tackling it is the party which stands to win Scottish voters’ trust. And there is no doubt that that party is the SNP. We can point to concrete examples such as the Scottish Government’s game-changing child poverty payment and our MPs’ campaign against the Universal Credit cut.\nThe way in which an SNP government has dealt with NHS staff pay claims is also radically different from the Tories’ confrontational approach. On the housing crisis, we also have a good story to tell. On Tuesday, I summed up for the SNP in a Westminster Hall debate on short-term lets and planning law. The debate was prompted by the Tories’ recently opened consultation on a registration scheme for short-term rental properties in England. I was able to point to legislation already implemented in Scotland and a scheme which is now up and running, together with other steps including a rent freeze put in place by the Scottish Government to tackle the housing crisis. I was able to tell the Tory MPs who had demanded the debate that in Scotland the SNP have already taken the vital measures needed to ensure short-term lets are not replacing affordable, long-term accommodation for local residents in tourist hotspots. Edinburgh became the first let control area in July last year and a smaller control area is planned in the Highlands.\nThese powers will take some time to bed in but they are now in use, with Airbnb hosts having until October 1 to register their properties. The City of Edinburgh Council’s policy means the majority of short-term let applications for homes in tenements or any property with a shared main door will be refused, so there will likely be a significant number of properties brought back into use for long-term private rent or available to buy. It was refreshing to hear Tory MPs agree that in this area at least the UK Government should be looking to the Scottish Government for guidance.\nThis past week at Westminster has provided ample evidence that it is the SNP rather than Labour who are making the running in challenging the Tory government on the policies which have caused the cost of living crisis and proposing a different way of doing things. Labour are otherwise engaged, intent on dancing to the Tories’ tune on immigration and seemingly content with the Tory plan to let that issue dominate the election at UK level. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Keir Starmer went with topics designed to show that Labour would be even tougher on immigration than the Tories. It was left to SNP group leader Stephen Flynn to raise the impact of the cost of living crisis on families across Scotland and the UK.\nWhile the overall inflation rate fell from 10.1% to 8.7% this week, food inflation is near to a 45-year high, with the basics on which we all rely worst affected. Pasta is up 27%. A loaf of bread is up 18%. Milk, cheese and eggs are up 29%. And overall, food costs are 19.1% higher than they were a year ago. It is little wonder that Radio Scotland reported this week that many of the most important workers in our society, our carers, are reliant on food banks to make ends meet.\nAfter PMQs, my fellow SNP MP Carol Monaghan secured an urgent question on the Tories’ new visa rules for international postgraduate students, which are likely to discourage many from coming to the UK. When Labour’s spokesperson got to his feet, he confirmed they supported the changes. Even though I have got used to Labour’s capitulations, I can tell you that my mouth literally fell open – particularly as he went on to use his allotted time to attack the Tories for not doing more to reduce net immigration, trotting out Gordon Brown’s tired old rhetoric about British jobs for British workers. When he sat down, the Tory minister hailed his “Damascene conversion”. It was more than depressing.\nAn English Labour friend remarked to me later that “the SNP are the only decent party on immigration now”. That she was right was confirmed when Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper was on her feet in the Commons lambasting the Tories for having “no plan and no grip on immigration” and bemoaning the increase in work visas issued by the Tories. Labour’s position on migration is insane. To take just student migration as an example, data produced by Universities UK shows that in the year 2020/21 international students contributed £42 billion to the UK economy. In my Edinburgh South West constituency, where international students flock to attend Edinburgh Napier, and Heriot-Watt universities, the figure was £170.8 million.\nHigher education is an important Scottish export. Universities Scotland, the umbrella body representing Scotland’s 19 universities, estimates that university exports of education, research and commercialisation add £1.9bn to the Scottish economy annually. This is just one example of how inward migration benefits the Scottish economy. Yet Labour will ignore that reality to pander to anti-immigration English voters. Likewise, Starmer has now completely thrown in the towel on Brexit, refusing to contemplate reversing it notwithstanding the growing evidence that leaving the EU has failed to deliver what was promised and is actively damaging our economy and contributing to the cost of living crisis.\nIn Scotland, voters understand that soaring food prices and staff shortages, particularly in the hospitality industry and NHS, are down to Brexit. Another recent poll showed that 70% of Scots agree Brexit has been a failure. In Scotland voters get this – but Starmer’s Labour Party cannot even acknowledge it and only the SNP offer a route back into the European Union. So, despite the undoubted challenges the SNP currently face, our party, our parliamentarians at Westminster and our government at Holyrood are in tune with the number one concern of Scottish voters and have a good story to tell on facing up to and tackling the issue. While the polls are giving us a bumpier ride than we have had for a while, these self-evident strengths will stand us in good stead as we enter the long campaign towards next year’s General Election.\nThe SNP have the message Scottish voters want to hear. Yes, the aspiration of independence must be front and centre in our manifesto, but while so many voters in Scotland are scared by and struggling to meet day-to-day costs, it is on that issue that most votes will ultimately be decided.",

When people know that they can get away with breaking the law it emboldens them. They knew everyone would see the timing as a deliberate tactic designed to divert attention from the fallout of the Sue Gray report, but they simply did not care.\nMake no mistake about it, the Sue Gray report and the Metropolitan police investigation into partygate amount to one colossal cover up of shameless law breaking by the British Prime Minister at a time when the citizens he is supposed to serve were suffering greatly, not just because of the pandemic but because of the very laws he so brazenly ignored. Perhaps the most iconic representation of this is the photograph of Her Majesty the Queen sitting alone at a funeral as she bid farewell to her husband of 73 years the day after Number 10 staff partied into the night to say goodbye to a colleague. Whether you are a Republican or a Royalist this should make you as sick as the overindulging party-goers. The fool made of the Queen is emblematic of the fools made of all of us by a Tory leader who imposed strict rules and then flouted them himself. When such disrespect and lack of empathy can be displayed towards the monarch then why should we be surprised at the contempt in which he and his mates hold the rest of us. It was hard not to think of this as Johnson made his unctuous humble address to the Queen in parliament yesterday to mark her jubilee, but, of course, we are not permitted to refer to this aspect of his hypocrisy as there is a convention that the monarch is not usually mentioned in the chamber.\nFor me, the two things that most stand out about Sue Gray’s report are as follows. Firstly, the multiple examples of disrespect shown by the entitled partygoers to the security and cleaning staff at 10 Downing Street. These low paid workers were forced to continue to come to work during the pandemic and had to mop up the wine and the vomit. Such behaviours come from a tone set at the top.\nSecondl,y and most astonishingly, Sue Gray’s failure to investigate the party which took place in the PM’s flat on the night of 13 November 2020 in celebration of the fact that Dominic Cummings had got his jotters. This party has become known as the Abba party because allegedly the PM’s wife played Abba’s hit the “Winner takes it all” repeatedly and very loudly. According to page 18 of Sue Gray’s report this “gathering” was attended by five special advisers and the PM. Food and alcohol were available, and it went on late into the night. She does not mention the PM’s wife at all but it has been widely reported that she was also there and chose the musical accompaniment as an expression of her longstanding antipathy to Dominic Cummings.\nSue Gray goes on to say that “the information collected on this gathering is limited as the process of obtaining evidence had only just been commenced when the Metropolitan Police announced their own investigations which included the events on 13 November 2020. At this point I stopped my investigation, given the need to avoid prejudice to the police investigation.” So far, so reasonable, but then, extraordinarily, she goes on to say that following the Metropolitan police announcement on 19 May 2022 (that no further proceedings would be taken in relation to the partygate investigation after 126 fines had been handed out), she “considered whether or not to conduct any further investigation into this event but concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate to do so’. She does not say why.\nOn any view, it is highly suspicious that this particular party involving the PM and his wife in their own personal flat should not be investigated by Sue Gray. What do we know of the police investigation into it, if there was one? Well, the answer is nothing. We know the PM and his wife weren't fined for it. We don’t know whether any of the other attendees were. But we do know that in respect of a number of events where the PM was in attendance junior people have been fined while he has not. We also know that in respect of some events while junior members of staff were sent questionnaires by the police, the PM was not. It stinks.\nIt was noticeable that during his statement in the Chamber on Wednesday the PM repeatedly and, I think, quite deliberately, referred to Sue Gray as “Sue” as though she was an old friend. What, I wonder was he trying to convey? I very much fear that he was thumbing his nose at those of us who were alarmed by his private meeting with her and rubbing our nose in the fact he has got away with it.\nSo, here’s the bottom line. I fear the Metropolitan police may have been nobbled. I also fear the Durham police who re-opened a closed investigation into Keir Starmer on the flimsiest of pretexts after extensive lobbying by Tory MPs and the right-wing press, may have been nobbled. And that is scary.\nI am sure National Readers will agree with me when I say I don’t want to live in a state where the Government of the day can influence the police in the exercise of their duty to investigate without fear or favour. We need to know whether that has happened here but only an independent investigation can establish that. I won't hold my breath for one.\nMeanwhile the only real question which remains is whether Boris Johnson will get away with lying to parliament as he undoubtedly did when he repeatedly insisted that that there were no parties, and all the rules were followed. If they find he lied, then he will have no choice but to resign....or will he? Who knows? The rule of law is on the skids at Westminster and it is really frightening.",

I am not going to write about the subject matter of these inquiries. Instead, I want to look at the implications of what has happened for our constitutional settlement.\nA lot of criticism has come the way of the committee and the parliament. The Presiding Officer Ken MacIntosh said, “If you look at the process and the way it has been carried out, I think you see a powerful parliament in action.” Other politicians were very critical of the committee and suggested that the way in which it had conducted itself undermined its findings. The criticisms spanned the political spectrum from nationalist politicians who dismissed it as partisan, to a Tory politician, David Davis, who claimed the committee didn’t have the powers it needed to get to the truth of the matter because MSPs don’t have the same ‘powers and privileges’ that MPs have. He claimed to be motivated by a desire to improve parliamentary democracy at Holyrood, but I think it’s fair to take that with a pinch of salt as most Tory and unionist commentators are motivated by quite the opposite desire. We only need to look at Alastair Jack’s cynical attack on Holyrood’s ground-breaking legislation on Child Rights to be reminded of that.\nIt also needs to be said that it’s a bit much for any Westminster Tory to criticise Holyrood for being a parliament where it is difficult to hold the executive to account. Boris Johnson unlawfully suspended the Westminster parliament to try to avoid being held to account and his government have continued to undermine and prevent scrutiny of their actions. This has included shutting down the select committee charged with scrutinising the UK’s Future Relationship with the EU and attempting to limit the extent to which the courts can scrutinise executive action by curtailing the right to judicial review and ‘reforming’ the Human Rights Act.\nHowever, the fact that the union parliament is deeply flawed should not prevent us from looking to see how we can improve the devolved Parliament even as we strive to turn it into an independent parliament. Whilst it is ridiculous to describe Scotland as a ‘Banana Republic’ we should be big enough to acknowledge that recent events may have revealed some shortcomings in our current constitutional set up. Independence is the goal, but as we move towards the process that will bring independence about and prepare for the transition to statehood, there is no reason why we should not try to improve our current institutions. What we learn from recent events can also inform our decision about what the institutions of an independent Scotland should look like.\nTwo aspects which emerge from the committee’s experience are instructive in that respect.\nFirstly, the majority findings of the committee raise the need to address the long-standing tension in the Lord Advocate’s dual roles as legal adviser to the Scottish Government and head of the Crown Office. It is not necessary to criticise the current Lord Advocate to see that there is at least potentially a problem. As we approach independence with all the major constitutional upheaval that will involve, it might be useful to separate out these two roles and have a Director of Public Prosecutions at the Crown Office thus freeing up the Lord Advocate to concentrate on his or her role as government legal adviser. To do this we would need Westminster’s co-operation to amend the Scotland Act but given that they have gone along with criticism of the perceived tension in the dual role they are now nicely boxed into a corner where they will find it hard not to agree should the Scottish parliament demand this change.\nThe second issue also arises from the committee’s majority findings and relates to the parliamentary committee system. The majority concluded that the experience of the committee suggested parliament may have insufficient powers to hold the executive to account and recommended the establishment of a commission to review the relationship. When Holyrood was set up it was decided there was no need for a second chamber because the committee system would be sufficient to ensure that legislation was properly scrutinised, and the government held to account. Whilst the issue of a second chamber can wait for independence, the experience of the last few months suggests that the powers of the devolved parliament’s committees to insist upon documents being produced and witnesses giving evidence need to be strengthened.\nIt would further strengthen the committees if their chairs were elected by MSPs rather than appointed by the government as they are at present. The independence this gives the chairs is widely considered the reason for the power of the Westminster select committees. Former SNP MSP and Presiding Officer, Tricia Marwick, has suggested that we should do the same at Holyrood. It might also be useful to look at whether the functions of scrutinising bills and holding the government to account should be separated out and given to different committees.\nIn looking at how we improve our current constitutional set up and frame the shape of an independent Scotland’s constitution, it is instructive to look at the recent report of the Citizen’s Assembly of Scotland – Doing Politics Differently.\nThe section of their report entitled “Vision” says that Scotland “should lead with integrity, honesty, humility and transparency” and that Scotland’s “Authorities have a duty to publish information that is valid, accurate, reliable, verifiable and accessible to all. Scotland should be a country where the people and government communicate with each other honestly and respectfully…based on openness and accountability.” Their recommendations include the appointment of a “non-political independent review body to… deliver a more accountable parliament.’ They also want to see Government held accountable and consequences where policy goals are not met. This is clearly a plea for more transparent decision making and greater scrutiny of Government.\nFinally, several politicians and journalists have said that the atmosphere around Holyrood is as toxic as they can remember it. In a radio interview the former First Minister Henry McLeish said that the level of hatred which surrounds much that we do is not healthy for the parliament, the government or the public. I know from bitter recent experience that this corrosive and toxic atmosphere is not confined to the Scottish Parliament.\nOf late, many fine words have been uttered about the importance of taking the abuse of women seriously. For this to ring true it needs to be extended to all women not just those winning favour with the current establishment. For some time I have warned that that if we did not tackle the intolerance and the foul abuse that has been allowed to fester around identity politics, and the debate about reforming the Gender Recognition act it could infect other areas of our public debate. That is why I put forward suggestions for a citizens’ assembly to look at these issues. However, I fear the toxic spread has happened already. It is not too late to tackle these problems, but it requires action from the leaders of all our political parties. The election campaign which started yesterday provides the perfect moment to reset the tone of our public debate.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_pro-independence-groups-beware-tory-spy-bill/content_277.html": "Even pro-independence groups should beware of the Tory spy bill\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 29th Jan 2021\nWe need to talk about Spy cops. Undercover police officers who infiltrated climate change and other protest groups and formed relationships with women activists. Some of these relationships lasted for years, children were born, and plans made for the future. And then one day the women woke up to find their partners had vanished without trace and without explanation, never to be seen again. Only years later they found out who these people really were, undercover spies working for the state to disrupt and undermine legitimate protest.\nThis scandal is currently being investigated by a public inquiry. You would think that the British Government would want to address the scandal and be waiting for the outcome of the inquiry to do so. But no. You would be wrong. Instead they are railroading through legislation to ensure this activity can continue, on a statutory basis. with little or no oversight.\nUndercover activity by Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHIS) has gone on for years. In order to protect the public it can be necessary to infiltrate terrorist groups and organised crime groups engaged in paedophilia, human trafficking and drug smuggling. But it has to be done on a proper statutory basis within reasonable limits and with judicial oversight and human rights safeguards. A recent court case challenged the lack of a legal basis for it, so the UK Government have used that as an excuse to put it on a statutory basis with knobs on.\nLast week a number of Yes groups led by the Forth Valley Independence Network wrote to me with their concerns that this new law could be used to stifle peaceful protest and dissent and that it might even be used to combat the independence campaign. Their concerns are not misplaced or fanciful.\nWhen this bill becomes law, public authorities including the police, the intelligence services, and…. wait for it…the environment agency and even the food standards agency (!) will be able to authorise undercover sources to commit crimes with impunity. There's no limit to the crimes they can commit, including murder, torture or sexual violence and these crimes can be committed to ‘prevent disorder’ or maintain ‘economic well-being’. No prior judicial authorisations is required to commit a crime. No wonder women’s groups, trade unions and independence campaigners are worried.\nTory ministers have tried to argue that anyone adversely affected could take action against the state under the Human Rights Act (HRA). But this is a downright lie. In another recent court case the UK Government’s lawyers argued that the HRA does not apply to crimes committed by CHIS, because, “the state, in tasking the CHIS… is not the instigator of that activity and cannot be treated as somehow responsible for it… it would be unreal to hold the state responsible.”\nBesides, the Tories are planning on reducing the ability of individuals to challenge human rights violations by the state under the HRA. Their hypocrisy is nauseating. Women Against Rape have signed a statement objecting to the bill with the support of over 50 organisations, including the Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers, Black Lives Matter groups, disability, women’s and environmental justice campaigners. Trade unions have also taken a stand against the bill with Chris Stephens MP championing their cause in the Commons.\nThe SNP backed a number of amendments to the bill to try and ameliorate its effects. They were all voted down by the Tories. The House of Lords made some relatively restrained amendments to the bill to place explicit limits on the conduct that can be authorised under the Bill and to introduce some retrospective judicial oversight but on Wednesday this week they were voted down in the Commons despite SNP support. The passage of this bill through the commons has been typical of the reality the SNP now face as a result of Boris Johnson’s huge majority.\nNo matter how hard we work cross-party to build support for amendments designed to protect Scotland from the Tories nasty right-wing agenda we cannot win at Westminster. This has led me to argue that the SNP Westminster Group needs to change its strategy at Westminster. I know many colleagues and party members agree with me and I will continue to argue that this must happen.\nWith this bill and the Overseas Operations Bill the British Government are creating special classes of defendant who are above the law. Spy cops will be able to break the law with impunity safe in the knowledge that the state, while pursuing others, will leave them alone. This is a stark example of the state interfering with the independence of the prosecutorial authorities and controlling their decisions about who should and should not be prosecuted. This is what happens in totalitarian states where the quashing of dissent is central to state control.\nIt is not something that should be tolerated in a democracy such as Scotland and I have worked closely with the Scottish Government’s Justice Secretary, Humza Yousaf MSP, to make sure that the SNP at Westminster and Holyrood have spoken with one voice firmly against this bill. That’s why SNP MPs voted against the bill at third reading and last week in the Scottish Parliament Humza recommended the refusal of a legislative consent motion to the elements of the bill that relate to devolved competences. All parties at Holyrood, apart from the Tories, (naturally), agreed with him.\nRecognising that there is a need for legitimate covert surveillance of paedophiles, drug dealers and human traffickers the Scottish parliament will pass its own human rights compliant legislation to regulate what happens in relation to devolved matters.\nEquality before the law, freedom of expression, the right to protest and the right even just to disagree with those in power are the cornerstones of a democracy. Those who wish to shut down dissent are the enemies of democracy and the Rule of Law. As Scotland approaches the resumption of our statehood it is vital that we keep the protection of everyone’s human rights front and central.\nLater today I am meeting with Professor Alan Miller, the Independent Co-Chair of Scotland’s National Task Force for Human Rights Leadership. This group was set up by the Scottish Government to help prepare a bill to introduce a new statutory human rights framework for Scotland. The Advisory Group has recommended that specific attention be given to the rights of children, women, persons with disabilities, older people and BAME and LGBTI communities and it is about to engage in a public participatory process as part of the preparation for a bill. I am delighted to be asked to engage with the process. It speaks volumes that as the UK Government is working to diminish our human rights protections, a body set up by the Scottish Government is working to increase them and I intend to continue to do all can to make sure we live in a human rights compliant country.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_the-test-trace-and-isolate-app/content_287.html": "Digital coronavirus fight must not hit human rights\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 17th Apr 2020\nIn order to beat the coronavirus crisis our lives and our civil liberties have been curtailed in a manner almost unimaginable even a couple of months ago. Last weekend millions of people across Scotland and the UK endured a sunny Easter holiday in lockdown. For many people this meant foregoing traditional family gatherings and celebrations, trips to the DIY store and holidays away. It is only natural that, as we approach our fourth week in lockdown, more and more people are starting to talk about an exit strategy.\nAt the UK Government press conference on Easter Sunday, a glimmer of hope appeared when Matt Hancock announced that the NHS was working on an app that will warn users if they have recently been in close proximity to someone suspected to be infected with the coronavirus. At the Scottish Government’s daily press conference the following day, the First Minister confirmed that her government was involved in discussions about the app but she emphasised that, whilst technology has a part to play in an exit strategy, people would need to be reassured about privacy and other matters.\nExperts like Prof Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh have argued that the best exit strategy would involve an aggressive test, trace and isolate approach. The app would assist us to slowly ease the lockdown restrictions while this took place.\nThe app works by using Bluetooth signals to detect when phone users are near one another. This means that when diagnosable cases are identified, initially by self-diagnosis and then by testing, the people with whom they have had contact can then be traced, warned and quarantined.\nSimilar warning and contract tracing apps have been deployed in South Korea, Singapore, Israel and Iceland. The Germans are currently looking at implementing the systems used in Singapore with tweaks to take account of the higher standards of privacy and civil liberty protections expected by citizens of the European Union. It is understood that the EU is also working on a Directive to provide safeguards in respect of corona related surveillance.\nSocial scientists and ethicists at Oxford University’s Nuffield Department of Population Health, Big Data Institute have noted that while there is wide agreement that digital surveillance is an efficient way to save lives when exiting national lockdowns, there is a risk that temporary restrictions on privacy could lead to a more permanent suspension of rights and liberties.\nEarlier this month, civil liberties groups from across the world, including Amnesty International, Liberty and Human Rights Watch, issued a Joint Civil Society Statement demanding that States’ use of digital surveillance technologies to fight pandemic must respect human rights. Crucially, they did not rule out the use of the increased digital surveillance, provided certain conditions are met.\nThe overarching principle is that surveillance measures must be lawful, necessary and proportionate, and justified by legitimate public health objectives. Legislation will be required to ensure that this is so in order to reassure the public.\nA group of enterprising lawyers led by Lilian Edwards, Professor of Law, Innovation and Society at Newcastle Law School have already drafted a Coronavirus (Safeguards) Bill listing proposed protections for digital interventions.\nThere seems to be general agreement that the app should be voluntary. However, uptake will be crucial to its success, with experts advising 60% uptake is necessary. The bill drafters emphasise that uptake will be improved if people feel confident their data will not be misused, repurposed or shared - for example to the private sector for marketing, insurance or employment purposes - without their knowledge or consent, and that the data held will be accurate.\nData quality will be much higher if people use the app with confidence and do not provide false information or withhold information fearing misuse or discrimination or, for example, an impact on their immigration status or debt collection. Steps must also be taken to ensure that the portion of the population which is already digitally excluded is reassured that the app will not further entrench their exclusion.\nIt is also vital that the app’s use is time limited and continues only for as long as necessary to address the current pandemic. The data must only be used for the purposes of responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and there should be guaranteed destruction of data with meaningful penalties for failure to do so. Transparency, oversight and accountability could be achieved by appointing an independent Commission to monitor and review the provisions of the legislation, and a related tribunal to uphold individual complaints in relation to these rights. It is essential that individuals who have been subjected to surveillance have access to effective remedies.\nEvidence from experts and the experiences of other countries suggest that testing, tracing and isolating using this app may be the way to ease our way out of lockdown but it is not an easy solution. Normally the risks to privacy and civil liberties that come with increased digital surveillance are such that I would be loath to contemplate it. However, lockdown means that our civil liberties are already severely restricted, so we need to balance that with the compromises necessary to end lockdown, safeguard lives and rebuild our economy and society. It is comforting that big data ethicists, civil liberties groups and Human Rights lawyers think the app can work without undue threat to our privacy and civil liberties provided it is underpinned by robust legislation and oversight.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_indyref-supreme-court-win-win/content_218.html": "Indyref2 Supreme Court battle is a win-win for Scottish Government\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 01st Jul 2022\nWatching matters unfold since the FM’s announcement on Tuesday has been hugely satisfying for most independence supporters. I hope I can be forgiven for finding it particularly sweet. Two reasons. First, it’s gratifying as well as a relief that the strategy for which I have long advocated is now part of the Scottish Government’s plan. Not because litigation is any sort of magic bullet but because, done properly, testing the case for a Holyrood backed indyref can only move the envelope forward. Played properly whether or not the UK Supreme Court (UKSC) rules in favour of the Scottish Government this is a win/win strategy or at least it should be.\nBy that I mean if the UKSC rules in our favour then we have a legal referendum which the unionists will find hard to boycott and the result of which the UK Government and the international community will recognise. Indeed, I would hope that respect for the court’s verdict might even bring the British Government to the negotiating table to agree a successor to the Edinburgh Agreement, i.e., that both sides would respect and enact the result of the referendum.\nIf we lose then the continued impasse can only increase support for Yes. When Newsnight reported from Inverness earlier this week there was clear evidence for this among No voters who told Lewis Goodall that they would change their mind if Westminster consistently denied Holyrood the right to determine its own destiny.\nSo, losing the case could actually increase support for a second independence referendum as well as independence itself. The series of policy papers due to be published in the coming weeks should also assist. I would also expect to see the Constitutional Convention which the FM promised back in January 2020 to be convened, perhaps this Autumn, to add to the momentum.\nMeantime Boris Johnson’s government’s law-breaking and ineptitude in the face of the cost-of-living crisis should continue to push people towards yes. This brings me to the second reason why I found the announcement particularly sweet - it puts the kibosh on the nonsense that I or indeed any senior members of the SNP have ever advocated for an “illegal referendum” and in this respect it is a masterful wrongfooting of the unionists.\nThe FM was right to contrast our strategy, which seeks to establish at the outset a legal route to a referendum, with the repeated law breaking of the Johnson government both in the personal and public sphere. The charge sheet started with the unlawful prorogation and stretches through the Internal Market Bill as originally published, partygate, the Bill of Rights which threatens to breach the ECHR and to the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill which breaches the EU Withdrawal Agreement. As regards the latter the legal position published by the UK Government wouldn’t get a pass as an undergraduate public international law essay. I don’t fancy Suella Braverman, the English Attorney General chances much if she ever goes head-to-head with our Lord Advocate, Dorothy Bain QC.\nThat could well happen. The UK Government has two weeks to decide whether to be heard on the Lord Advocate’s reference and its likely they will. I understand the parties will then have 28 days to adjust their written legal cases. There could preliminary issues including argument as to whether or not the court should wait until it sees the finished product of the bill passed by Holyrood before giving its opinion. If they agree to go ahead the hearing is likely to be in the Autumn with a decision before Christmas. Third parties could seek permission to intervene and have their legal arguments heard if they can show this in the public interest. For example, someone might want to do that to run the arguments that were advanced in the Keatings case last year, but which failed as premature, hypothetical and academic in the absence of a bill. Exciting times lie ahead and not just for legal geeks like me.\nMeantime I agree with the call for unity and an end to the infighting between SNP activists, including some parliamentarians and councillors, and Alba activists. However, unity can only be achieved if people behave respectfully towards one and other and continue to do so in the face of differences of opinion about strategy or policy. I must confess to experiencing a degree of schadenfreude as the FM made her announcement on Tuesday. I wondered how the small but noisy group of activists who so shamefully booed the colleagues advocating for the General Election fallback strategy at our Oct 2019 conference must feel now, not to mention the small but nasty band who have dedicated themselves to making my life difficult since I first suggested the litigation aspects of the strategy and dared to demur from the leadership on other issues. This is perhaps a lesson for them that sometimes unfashionable or unpopular views will triumph over time.\nThat said, the biggest learning should be that there is really no place for this sort of childish bullying in Yes parties or the movement. The campaign we are about to mount must be a respectful one. Not only because that’s the right way to run a campaign but because it’s the only way to win over those not yet persuaded of the merits of independence. There can be absolutely no room for abusive or bullying behaviour in person or online. Full Stop.\nIf the legal bid fails and we must rely on the FM’s fallback position, then it is imperative we maximise the vote in favour of independence at the next General Election. My Tory sources tell me this is unlikely now to be until 2024 although of course we must always be prepared for it to be sooner. Some are already arguing for a YES alliance to stand candidates rather than the SNP alone as some will argue it must be absolutely clear that each vote cast is a vote for Scotland to become an independent country. This idea merits consideration. It could be a unifying move bringing together the SNP, Greens, disaffected former SNP activists including those who went to ALBA or the other small pro-indy parties and the all-important wider YES movement which includes such outstanding advocates as Lesley Riddoch and Andy Wightman. I am not suggesting that they should be candidates, although some might like to be, but definitely spokespersons. There should also be a place in the wider campaign for Alex Salmond, his strategic knowhow is too good to be ignored. Above all we should always remember that the cause is bigger than any one individual or ego. We need the best voices, voices of all ages and diverse voices.\nRegardless of whether the SNP forms a Yes alliance or not it will be essential that the public face and approach of the Westminster SNP Group undergoes a revamp. The issues have been plain for all to see, and they need to be addressed. The group needs to be united, free from distractions and fighting fit if it is to play the central role in the lead up to a General Election which leads to Independence. There’s all to play for and a lot to do let’s go forward together.",

I am in a very significant measure of agreement with him, particularly about the need for evidence-based policy making.\nI rise to speak as Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I remind Members that it is a Joint Committee of both the Commons and the Lords, which takes half its members from each House. It is, of course, a cross-party Committee. As the Committee responsible for scrutinising the Government’s human rights record, we have conducted two inquiries considering plans to reform the Human Rights Act. During our inquiries, we heard evidence from experts with a diverse range of views and from people who have benefited from using the Human Rights Act. Having considered all that evidence, we remain of the view, which we have expressed in a number of previous reports, that the Human Rights Act is functioning as intended and enables human rights to be enforced effectively in the United Kingdom, with little need for recourse to the European Court of Human Rights. For that reason, based on the evidence we have heard and the information we have considered, we believe that the Government have failed to make the case for repealing and replacing the Human Rights Act with a Bill of Rights.\nWe were pleased to have confirmation from the current Lord Chancellor that the Government were looking again at the Bill of Rights Bill and that its progress would be paused while they conducted a thorough review of the Bill. We were pleased to hear that, unlike before, he intends to look at the evidence base, including the independent Human Rights Act review. We were concerned by the Government’s lack of engagement with experts, Parliament and the public over the Bill of Rights Bill. It followed the independent Human Rights Act review, as we have heard, significant parliamentary engagement and inquiries, and a public consultation exercise, which elicited over 12,000 responses. That is the sort of extensive engagement we should be having before we embark on reform, but engagement has to be genuine and have meaning and purpose, and those who engage should be listened to.\nThe Bill of Rights simply does not reflect what the Government heard from Parliament’s Committees, their own commissioned independent review or their consultation exercise. The Government’s own consultation analysis shows that many responders were in favour of maintaining the status quo and the Human Rights Act, and believed that the changes proposed were unnecessary. Despite that lack of support, the Government decided to pursue a reform, in which they went to the length of repealing and replacing the Act altogether.\nThe Government’s consultation analysis provided scant to no reasoning to explain why they decided to disregard the views of a significant number of consultees. In the Joint Committee’s opinion, that calls into question the integrity of the whole consultation process preceding the Bill of Rights. We concluded that, given the overwhelming lack of support for these radical reforms, repealing the Human Rights Act and replacing it with a Bill of Rights was neither democratic nor necessary. We were particularly worried about the international implications of repealing the Human Rights Act. Our primary worry was that removing the Act would weaken protections for people living in the United Kingdom, but we were also worried about how it would be perceived internationally.\nWhen we visited the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg earlier this year, we highlighted our concerns. It was emphasised to us that the Human Rights Act is viewed internationally as the gold standard and a model example of how human rights can be effectively embodied into domestic law and practice. It was impressed on us by our interlocuters that any weakening of the mechanisms in the Act could damage the United Kingdom’s reputation internationally and weaken the UK Government’s position when seeking to ensure that other states uphold their human rights obligations. Importantly, we were left in no doubt by those we spoke to that the United Kingdom’s status as a leading member of the Council of Europe and one of the founders of the ECHR means that any reforms to the Act that suggest that we are wavering in our commitment to the convention’s protections could be a green light for other less committed nations to weaken their own human rights protections.\nOther hon. Members have spoken about the incredibly positive impact that the Human Rights Act has had on human rights in the United Kingdom, and the Joint Committee has highlighted that in a number of its reports. It has highlighted that it has made it far easier for individuals to enforce their rights, because they can do so in their domestic court, and that is much cheaper and easier. Before the passing of the Human Rights Act, an individual had to take their case directly to the Court in Strasbourg. That process was subject to long delays, by which I mean many years, and on average cost applicants £30,000. As the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst indicated, another benefit of the Human Rights Act is that it has led to a significant decrease in the number of cases brought against the UK before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, because we resolve our own human rights problems at home, in the domestic courts of our jurisdiction. The hon. Member gave some statistics about that.\nContrary to what people sometimes think, having a Human Rights Act, and incorporating the ECHR into the domestic law of the United Kingdom, has also enabled courts—in my jurisdiction of Scotland and in those of England and Wales, and of Northern Ireland—to influence the development of European Court of Human Rights case law. We heard that there is a strong dialogue between the UK Supreme Court and the Court in Strasbourg; they both influence each other’s jurisprudence, and that often works to the benefit of the United Kingdom.\nAnother important thing that the Human Rights Act has done is embed a human rights culture in public authorities. We heard from a number of witnesses—including an NHS trust, the National Police Chiefs’ Council and the British Association of Social Workers—that the Human Rights Act has placed human rights at the centre of decision making in public authorities, and that the legal framework assisted them in making complex decisions.\nWe also heard that the Human Rights Act has been central to the devolution of justice and policing in Northern Ireland, and of course we know that it is embedded in the Good Friday agreement. It also plays a very important role in the constitutional underpinning of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Senedd. As other hon. Members indicated, in my own jurisdiction of Scotland, the Scottish Parliament has gone beyond the Human Rights Act to embed, for example, the UN convention on the rights of the child. The Joint Committee was very clear that we do not believe that the Human Rights Act should be reformed without the consent of the devolved legislatures, because it is so important to them.\nI want to be clear: the Joint Committee on Human Rights is not saying that there should not be any amendments to the Human Rights Act, but we would like human rights protections to be strengthened rather than weakened. For example, we want the right to protest—a very important aspect of the right to freedom of expression—to be given greater protection in the Bill of Rights Bill, and we want the right to an effective remedy, as protected by article 13 of the ECHR, embedded. We also want the Government seriously to consider incorporating other international human rights treaties, such as the UN convention that I just mentioned and the refugee convention. That should include the right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution, in terms similar to those of article 14 of the universal declaration of human rights.\nWe are pleased that the current Lord Chancellor has paused the process. We had a very positive letter from him last week. We are looking forward to engaging with him, and we are delighted that the Government will go back and look at the independent review in a way that they did not before. The Committee will continue to engage with the Government, but we emphasise that we believe in evidence-based policy making. It is our view that so far we have seen no evidence to justify the argument that significant changes to the Human Rights Act are either necessary or desirable.",

Just like previous years, she and her team have used the month of December to promote these on Twitter, under the hashtag office advent. Joanna said “Every organisation my team and myself have visited has reminded us of the fantastic and diverse people that make up Edinburgh South West. From their enthusiasm and passion to the visible difference they are making in the lives of those they help, we are extremely grateful.”\nBecause of the continuing pandemic, 2021, like 2020, has been a particularly difficult year for individuals missing their usual groups, clubs and outings, and for community groups and businesses who have lost out on business, support and contacts.

Joanna made a donation to Crisis-at-christmas to help homeless people at Christmas and also publicised an exhibition of art and craft items made by the staff and residents of Tiphereth Community.\nDespite the pandemic, there were still many community projects that Joanna could support. Bookbug sessions in local libraries share stories and songs for babies, toddlers and pre-school children, the Scottish Book Trust promote access to books for all children. Joanna visited Saughton Park on 9th December to see a concert by Forget Me Notes Choir, who work with music to combat the socially isolated and build communities. They are dementia friendly and open to all.\nOn 5th December, Joanna and her team visited Wester Hailes Bridge Hub, a social enterprise organisation and urban outdoor activity centre next to Edinburgh Union Canal. They enjoyed the Covid-safe Nordic Twilight Experience at the outdoor Paddle Cafe.\nThe Space Broomhouse initiative offer food for the local community as well as a range of other services: young person counselling, carer support, youth befriending, a dementia friendly day care service, and many more.\nJoanna promoted the Currie and Balerno News - a free local newspaper widely available in that area for whom she writes a monthly column. And on 14th December some members of Joanna’s team donated blood.\nFinally, Joanna and her team enjoyed a virtual Christmas Party on 17th December before they closed the office for the Christmas break after a very busy year.",

Humza Yousaf won, and he has decided to fashion a government of his supporters, vanquishing the losers and their supporters to the backbenches, notwithstanding the loss from government of some of the SNP’s best talents in Holyrood. Of course, that is his right, and it may well turn out to be the best thing for him to have done. Time will tell. However, there is a lesson from recent history that when, after a divisive campaign, you are on the winning side with a win as narrow as 52%/48%, the best thing to do is to reach out and take some at least of the losing side with you.\nThat was the situation in which Theresa May found herself after the Brexit vote in 2016. She could have compromised, reached out to the 48% which included our own nation and Northern Ireland. But she didn’t. Instead she drew red lines and retreated behind them. And we all remember how that went. Within less than a year she had lost her parliamentary majority and, within three years, her premiership.\nKate Forbes said that continuity won’t cut it. Ash Regan wanted a major reset of the party’s strategy. Together they won 48% of the membership vote despite having the forces of the party machine and establishment lined up against them. It is crass to see this as having been a battle between right and left, progressive and conservative. Kate and Ash share Humza’s desire to redistribute wealth, it's just that Kate is a bit more interested in how we create it. Ash has always been on the left of the party she just doesn't think that allowing any man to self-identify as a woman is terribly wise never mind progressive, and events have proved her right. Rapists in women’s prisons does not a progressive society make. The procedures around changing legal sex require safeguards.\nHumza was seen as the continuity candidate, but he repositioned himself for change as a result of the success of Kate and Ash’s campaigns. Yet what now really will change? As Lampedusa wrote in ‘The Leopard’ – “Sometimes everything must change so that everything can remain the same.” Is that what we are seeing here? For the sake of our country, my party and the Independence movement I hope not.\nScotland’s new Cabinet and ministerial team all seem to have been supporters of the new FM. Sadly, this makes pledges during the campaign for a bigger tent approach to government and party ring hollow. The talent and experience on the SNP backbenches are certainly now equal to that of front bench. And as for a new generation of the SNP in power, the reality is that the new government consists of the remnants of the older generation together with the natural heirs and successors of those who have retired. It really would be a mistake for them to get rid of all dissenters, pretend that the events of the last few weeks never happened and pick up where the last government left off.\nConcerns about party membership numbers which were dismissed and ridiculed have turned out to be true. Concerns about the management of the party’s finances are the subject of a police investigation. If there are other problems, we would do well to get them into the open now and start working to fix any underlying issues. There is a window of opportunity to tackle any problems which might exist head on and make sure things are put right. But at the moment I don’t have a great deal of faith that will happen. For the sake of my party, I hope it will.\nThe SNP is the vehicle for independence but as I’ve said previously under Peter Murrell it’s been a bit like driving in 2nd gear and with the handbrake on. We’ve not got very far and there’s a bad smell. The Party has an opportunity to refresh itself and get on a proper campaign footing. The job of Chief Executive should be advertised, and applicants sought from outside our current staff pool.\nCampaigning for a likely general election in early May 2024 will start to gear up at the start of next year. The Labour Party is limbering up they are well underway with their candidate vetting and selection. They think they can take anywhere between 12 and 20 seats off the SNP. This must not be allowed to happen because of poor planning. The SNP vetting and selection process has in the past been dogged by delays and very late selection of candidates. Even in seats where we know a sitting MP is standing down, we don’t have candidates picked and working the local area, being trained and refining their skills ready for a bruising general election campaign. At annual conference activists had to put forward an internal motion to force the party executive to work on updating and modernising our key campaign tool Activate. Our corporate structures, governance and campaign tools all badly need an overall. We have talent in the party desperate to help. We should be accepting these offers of help not rebuffing them.\nThe party's independence strategy clearly needs the sort of reset Ash called for. Whether or not you like her suggestion or the former FM’s preference for a de facto referendum, either way the party needs to have a proper discussion about what to do and a vote on the way forward. Regional assemblies are all very well but in the past their product has been chewed up and spat out by the party machine. It is not so easy to do that with the constitutional policy making processes of our conference.\nIn the meantime, the very best thing that the new FM can do to advance the cause of independence is to restore the SNP’s reputation for governing well. It’s a little tarnished at present, there are some big policy challenges in the fields of NHS, education and transport, to name just a few. We need radical action not more virtue signalling legislation which dominates parliament and committee time then ends up not in force because of flaws which were warned of in advance.\nFinally, our new FM would do well to tackle the impression that in the SNP, unless you are Nicola Sturgeon, it does not do your career well to be a strong, smart woman of independent mind. That, for sure, is not in the least progressive.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_the-sewel-convention-and-the-internal-market-bill/content_204.html": "Why taking Westminster to court over Brexit bill may be a win-win\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 09th Oct 2020\nIts 20 years this week since Donald Dewar, Scotland’s first ever First Minister, died unexpectedly whilst still in office. As we mark the anniversary of his untimely death, is his devolution project fatally damaged? If so what, if anything, can be done about it?\nDewar’s masterly scheme, that every power which was not specifically reserved to Westminster would be devolved to the Scottish Parliament, was reflected in the Scotland Act 1998, after a ringing endorsement from Scottish voters who voted by 3 to 1 to support reconvening Scotland’s parliament.\nWith such architecture underpinning it there was great confidence that this was meaningful home rule rather than the pathetic sop Scots had been offered in 1979. Donald Dewar’s magnificent patriotic speech at the official opening of the new parliament reflected this confidence and the considerable historical significance of the occasion as did Winnie Ewing’s magisterial declaration that “the Scottish Parliament adjourned on the 25th day of March, in the year 1707, is hereby reconvened\".\nIt is, therefore, particularly poignant that 20 years after Donald Dewar’s death, as the UK Internal Market Bill makes its way to the statute book, we are witnessing the destruction of his plan.\nWhilst under the Scotland Act, Westminster always retained the power to make laws for Scotland, it was understood that it would not normally do so in relation to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish parliament. Until Brexit came along this was a convention that was honoured and even put on a statutory footing in the aftermath of the Independence Referendum.\nWhat is so outrageous about the Internal Market Bill is its introduction of broad cross cutting powers which will allow UK Ministers to enforce internal market provisions across devolved areas. In addition, the bill reserves state aid to Westminster despite the devolved administrations’ insistence that it had been devolved and UK ministers are also getting wide ranging powers to spend in important devolved areas. To date it was understood they would spend only in respect of reserved powers and, normally, for devolved powers, financial transfers to the devolved administrations would go through the block allocation governed by the Barnett Formula. This, in short, is why the bill constitutes a power grab rather than a power surge.\nOn Wednesday night I took part in a webinar on the implications of the Internal Market Bill for the rule of law. Although hastily organised by the International Bar Association Human Rights Institute it was hugely oversubscribed with 1000 watching online and another 1000 unable to get on the call. It is now available to watch at ibanet.org.\nI was asked to speak about the impact of the bill on devolution. I argued that what we are seeing is a rebalancing of the constitutional settlement in the United Kingdom with the clear delineation between reserved and devolved powers swept away. Not only does this fly in the face of the promises made to secure a No vote in the Independence referendum but it also flies in the face of the steps taken by Westminster to secure those promises in the Scotland Act 2016 which enshrined the Sewel Convention and entrenched the Scottish parliament as a “permanent part of the UK’s constitutional arrangements” by providing it could not be abolished save by a decision of the people of Scotland voting in a referendum.\nSo, the bill has implications not just for devolution but for the union between Scotland and England. It is important that we don’t just look at that constitutional relationship through the prism of devolution. It has wider underpinnings including the Treaty of Union. As I was speaking MSPs were voting overwhelmingly to withhold legislative consent to the bill. However, as we know from the bitter experience of the last few years, that won’t stop Westminster proceeding with it. In fact the only hope now of changing the bill is in the House of Lords and I don’t think I’m going out on a limb here if I say the focus of their attention will not be devolution, but rather the rule of law implications of the bill.\nRather like the UK Supreme Court, to date, the House of Lords have seemed relatively disinterested in defending the devolution settlement. When the Scottish Government intervened in Gina Miller’s first case about the circumstances in which Article 50 could be triggered, the Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish parliament did not need to be consulted and that, despite its statutory enshrinement, the Sewel Convention does not give rise to legally enforceable obligations.\nThis has proved to be an important setback as throughout the Brexit process the UK Government have ignored the Convention with impunity. The independent thinktank the Institute for Government have said “The Sewel Convention has been broken by Brexit.”\nSo now it seems has devolution. what can be done about it? At the IBA seminar many felt that the only way the Internal Market Bill can be stopped is by court action, but they were worried that this would simply feed the Tories anti lawyer and judge rhetoric. Already in Northern Ireland citizens concerned about the impact the bill will have on the fragile peace process secured by the Good Friday agreement have instructed solicitors.\nI was asked if I would be crowd funding to take proceedings in Scotland and replied that any legal action to defend the devolved settlement would be for the Scottish Government. Mike Russell has said that legal action has not been ruled out and there might be a range of legal actions open to the Scottish Government. The Supreme Court’s dismissive ruling on Sewel poses a problem but the Supreme Court can overrule itself and distinguished commentators have argued that their previous decision was wrong. These include Aileen McHarg, Professor of Public Law at the University of Durham and Aidan O’Neill the QC who successfully argued the prorogation case and is currently appearing for Martin Keatings in the case before the Court of Session seeking to establish whether the Scottish parliament has the competence to pass a bill to hold an independence referendum.\nAs the Scottish Government decide whether to litigate over the bill, such action should not be seen as a distraction from the goal of independence. Victory could be useful in preserving the ability of the Scottish parliament to protect standards, for example in the field of agriculture and the environment, and alignment with the EU as we move towards independence. Should the case be lost it would simply be another demonstration that it is only with independence that Scottish voters can get the policies for which they vote.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_nationality-and-borders-bill-will-break-law/content_230.html": "Nationality and Borders Bill will break the law – and not just in ‘specific and limited’ way\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 23rd Jul 2021\nIt may be hard to believe a word that Dominic Cummings says, but his interview with Laura Kuenssberg certainly reinforced the impression of arrogance, corruption and incompetence oozing from Boris Johnson’s government. Their handling of the Covid crisis and their ‘one rule for us, another for the rest of you’ typifies their approach. Yet even as the pandemic rages on, unlike others, the Tories have been very busy with the rest of their agenda.\nThis week the second reading of the Nationality and Borders Bill proceeded with some particularly intemperate speeches about refugees and asylum seekers from Tory MPs and a bonfire of international conventions and treaties to which previous British governments have committed us. Priti Patel and co want us to believe that the UK is ‘overrun by migrants’ but there’s no evidence that this is so. Yes, the dangerous channel crossings undertaken by what one Tory MP described as ‘innocent and vulnerable’ people are a problem but the answer to that problem cannot be to criminalise the innocent and vulnerable.\nThe eminent English judge, Lord Bingham, wrote a book about the Rule of Law as the foundation of the modern democratic state. He identified 8 core principles of the Rule of Law. Principle 5 states; “The law must afford adequate protection of human rights.” and Principle 8 stipulates; “The State must comply with its obligations in international law as in national law.” These principles are widely revered and have gained international respect, yet barely a week goes by without this British Government introducing a Bill that threatens to breach one or both.\nIf the Nationality and Borders Bill becomes law, we risk breaching the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, the 1961 UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at sea, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. We also risk breaching multiple articles of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). When England’s Lord Chancellor gave evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights last week, he was most anxious to assure us that the Government are still committed to the ECHR. But there is not much point in being committed to it in name, if they bring legislation to the House that threatens to breach its terms. The Nationality and Borders Bill does this with the introduction of a two-tier system for refugees which flies in the face of the right to be free from discrimination in the enjoyment of one’s human rights.\nThe changes proposed by the Bill also undermine the right to life for those at sea with outrageous measures which could criminalise those who seek to rescue asylum seekers who get into difficulty on the water. Changes to the application and appeals process for asylum seekers and provisions regarding credibility, and the weight to be given to evidence, risk breaching the right to a fair trial. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has already raised concerns that decision making by the Home Office in immigration matters is not sufficiently independent or rigorous to ensure that human rights are respected, and the Bill will make that worse.\nWhy would Scotland want to be part of a Union where decisions like this affecting our international standing are forced through by a government with such scant regard for human rights and the Rule of Law?\nThis bill is the latest in a succession of Bills which threaten to breach our international treaty obligations and the ECHR including the Overseas Operations Bill and the Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill. In the case of the Internal Market Bill, the Government were quite brazen about it. The Northern Ireland Minister stood up in the House and said that “this does break international law” but only “in a very specific and limited way.” He was at it again on Wednesday this week proposing to rip up the Northern Ireland protocol that his government agreed to less than two years ago. The Nationality and Borders Bill will break international law, not in a specific and limited way, but in numerous ways. It is immoral, inhumane and irresponsible. There are millions of displaced people across the world and millions of refugees. The United Kingdom cannot wash our hands of responsibility for them, particularly when at least some of the reasons for their displacement can be laid at our door and at the door of our foreign policy and our colonial past.\nThe real mischief that the Bill should seek to tackle, but does not, is that there are insufficient lawful routes for claiming asylum in the United Kingdom. Yes, resettlement programmes are laudable, but they are not a solution for those claiming asylum, because resettlement programmes deal with refugees in the immediate vicinity of the homes they have fled and who are already recognised as having a protection need. Those not already identified as in need of international protection and who reach the shores of the United Kingdom on their own steam should not be criminalised. It is time that the Home Secretary stopped playing to the gallery and did the hard work necessary to fulfil the United Kingdom’s moral and legal obligations to refugees and asylum seekers. As Stuart McDonald MP argued very eloquently, there is no point in Conservative MPs waxing lyrical about the rights of persecuted Christians and the rights of the Uyghurs to be free from Chinese atrocities if they threaten to criminalise those sorts of people when they make it to our shores.\nI fear that the chances of this Government amending the Bill in any meaningful way are absolutely zero, but I know that it matters very much to my constituents, and people and organisations across Scotland (the Trades Union Congress in Edinburgh passed a motion condemning this Bill just in the last few days)—that the Scottish National Party stands against the Bill. It is important to have voices setting out with clarity and detail what is wrong with the bill and Stuart McDonald, the SNP Spokesperson, was by far the best speaker in the Commons debate.\nBut, as is usually the case, our efforts at Westminster are doomed to fail and we can only look forward to a future where an independent Scotland will be able to set a better example on refugee policy. It is all very well to say Scotland welcomes refugees but at present we don’t have control over the areas of policy that would enable us to take a different approach from the UK Government when refugees seek asylum. Until we take the steps to ensure that we do have control over that aspect of policy, we are stuck with trying to take the British Government to task on their policies.\nNaming what is wrong is one thing. The real challenge is to bring Scotland closer to being able to frame its own approach on these policies and others.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_sunak-budget-women-left-behind/content_265.html": "Many were left behind by Rishi Sunak’s Budget ... especially women\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 05th Mar 2021\nThe budget turned out to be a bit of a damp squib because so much of it had been trailed already. The Secretary of State for Business, Kwasi Kwarteng, managed to put his foot in it with the PM by admitting that Indyref2 should be up to the Scots, then, not content with that he also blew the gaffe on the furlough extension. Much of the rest of Dishi Rishi’s plans including the “revolutionary” rise in corporation tax were carefully and deliberately leaked.\nThe Chancellor should be judged by his deeds not his words or his hype. Some of his deeds may yet come back to haunt him. When the post-pandemic public inquiry takes place one key area of focus will be why the UK Government decided not to go for a circuit breaker last Autumn. I understand that Sunak was highly influential in persuading Johnson not to do so.\nFor all the fanfare what is singularly missing from this budget is the sort of economic boost that President Biden is going for in the states in order to generate an investment led recovery.\nBut by far the worst aspect of this budget is that it does little to address the inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic. This is particularly true where women are concerned. The respected think tank, the Women’s’ Budget Group have said that “Far from putting us in a better position to deal with Covid-19, as the Chancellor claimed, the austerity policies of the last ten years have made us less able to cope. Years of cuts and underspending on health, education, local government and public services left our social infrastructure weakened and made us more vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic. The Budget did little to address this.”\nThey are right. Although what they say needs to be caveated for Scotland where the SNP Scottish Government have used its limited powers to blunt the impact of austerity policies on health and other public services and to take steps such as the ‘game-changing’ Scottish Child Payment to boost household incomes and tackle poverty.\nHowever, there are many aspects of the economy which are reserved and therefore firmly within the control of the Westminster Government. Regrettably, none of the SNP keys asks in these areas were answered in the budget. We wanted the UK Government to U-turn on the public sector pay freeze; to make the £20 uplift to Universal Credit and Working Tax Credit permanent and to extend it to legacy benefits; to introduce a Real Living Wage (RLW); to raise statutory sick pay to a least the level of the RLW and to ensure that everyone is eligible. We also challenged the UK Government to match the Scottish Child Payment.\nAll these policies have the potential to transform lives and women’s lives in particular. Instead, we got warm words but no action.\nBack in January Sunak was upbraided for patronising women when he talked about the debt owed to “mums’ during the pandemic. Women took to Twitter to challenge his patronising sexism. Channel 4 news anchor, Cathy Freeman, pointed out that it sounded like he was ‘perpetuating the lazy assumption that women do the dishes and the childcare – while also contributing a few scrappy pennies to the family finances – leaving the guys free to focus on more lucrative, manly things like mastering the universe instead.” She added that such a paradigm not only entrenches inequality but is unfair to the men who are also performing juggling acts at home during the pandemic.\nIt seems that, despite his contrition at the time, Rishi really wasn’t listening as his budget does little to address the inequalities suffered by women in our economy and society and which the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated.\nWomen are more likely to work in industries which have been shut down by the pandemic, such as hospitality, retail, leisure, tourism, and the arts. From the start of lockdown, women were more likely to be furloughed than men, taking a 20% pay cut. Women were the majority of furloughed workers in every UK region except the West Midlands.\nAs in every recession, workers’ rights are under threat with the trade unions noting the need for a strengthening of maternity rights but recent legislation designed to give maternity rights to the Attorney General (and quite right too) did not take the opportunity to strengthen the rights of ordinary women.\nGender pay gap reporting - which has only been in place for a couple of years for companies with more than 250 employees - was completely cancelled in 2020, and has been delayed again in 2021, with the Equality and Human Rights Commission announcing it will not start enforcement action against companies until October. Women are more likely to be self-employed than men and many self-employed workers are still excluded from support. Meanwhile, at home, the closure of schools and nurseries has seen a huge increase in the amount of unpaid work women need to do, meaning they have less time for paid work. Many women work in sectors such as the care sector thus putting them in the front line and increasing the stress on them when there are children at home to be looked after, entertained and home-schooled. Yet, despite his warm words for mums, the UK Chancellor has done nothing to address any of these concerns.\nThe reality is that for so long as we are still tied to Westminster Scotland will wait in vain for the rebuilding of the social safety net, upon which women depend. To take just one important example, statutory sick pay and minimum wage rates cannot be fixed in Scotland until employment law is devolved. But the Tories aren’t interested in devolution any longer and when the devolution of employment law was under discussion, Labour said no.\nThis budget makes it quite clear that the UK Government lacks the long-term vision which our country so badly needs as we face an uncertain future post-Covid and post-Brexit. Whether you favour a Biden style boost or the sort of Green New Deal and an economy based on resilience for which the Common Weal advocate, there is nothing of this sort in Rishi’s budget. The bottom line is that the UK Government’s direction of travel is far removed from what people living in Scotland want.\nOnly with independence can we rebuild our economy and create the sort of egalitarian society that will benefit both women and men.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_uk-supreme-court-indyref2-ruling/content_26.html": "UK Supreme Court indyref2 ruling is a legal one - not political\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Nov 2022\nAnd so, the UK Supreme Court has settled the disputed issue of whether our devolved parliament has the competence to hold an independence referendum, without the agreement of Westminster. In doing so they have answered a legal question not a political one. The political question remains – if Scottish voters continue to elect a majority of MSPs and MPs who support a second independence referendum, what is the democratic route to realising that mandate?\nThis is as much a question for the UK Government and unionist politicians as it is for the Scottish Government, the SNP and other pro-independence parties. That’s not just my view but that of political commentators from David Allen Green in the Financial Times to Kenny Farqharson in the Times. It has been good over the last 48 hours to hear Tory and Labour politicians grilled on this issue by journalists who get it. Like Rishi Sunak and Alister Jack in the Commons on Wednesday, they evade the question. But the answer is obvious. If a second referendum continues to be blocked the only way independence can happen is if pro-independence parties win an election in Scotland outright and the British government respect that democratic mandate and come to the negotiating table.\nThe independence question remains at the top of the political agenda. There was huge international interest in the consequences of the court’s verdict across the world. The last thing I did before I went home after a long day on Wednesday was an interview on Australian radio’s equivalent of the Today programme and there were plenty of other bids from international news outlets throughout the day.\nThanks to the initiative of Lesley Riddoch and others, rallies took place across Scotland and indeed Europe providing evidence that the Yes movement is alive and kicking and that ordinary punters care about this issue not just political talking heads.\nSo where do we go from here? Rubbishing the SNP’s plan B looks foolish in the light of the Channel 4’s news opinion poll showing that 51% would vote SNP at the next General Election if their vote would be used as a mandate to negotiate independence with the UK. If that is the position now just think what the vote could look like after a strong campaign.\nOf course, there are details to be worked out and I am pleased that this will happen at the special conference of the SNP to be convened early in the new year. Along with others I have argued that conference should debate the details of what is now the official plan B for more than three years. Taking this position has come at some personal cost because of the vitriol of a small but noisy and, until recently, influential minority of activists who inexplicably did not want this issue discussed. The folly of not doing so has been illustrated by the difficulty some party spokespersons have got themselves into by disagreeing publicly with each other over the details of a plan not yet fully worked out.\nFortunately, we now have the time and the space to do that. It looks unlikely that there will be a British general election until 2024 and the next Holyrood election is not due until 2026. In my opinion the option of which election to use needs careful consideration. Utilising a Holyrood election is an option, as one of my colleagues remarked this week, nothing says I mean business like collapsing your own parliament and going for a back me or sack me strategy. The wisdom of such a course of action and all the various options needs careful thought. A Holyrood election would give us the advantage of more control over the timing and a franchise which includes younger voters, EU citizens and refugees. I don’t say that for political advantage. Scotland’s parliament has extended who can vote to include young voters and new Scots. It was the first bill in the Scottish parliament to require a super-majority. It reflects who we are as a country and what we want for people who make Scotland their home.\nIn terms of the numbers of seats won, the SNP have won the last three Westminster General Elections outright. In terms of outright wins at Holyrood, the threshold which some Tories including John Lamont have suggested as the only basis for another indyref, we have only managed that feat once in 2011 and the system is designed to prevent it from happening. In terms of outright percentage wins that is very difficult for any one party in any British election, but the Channel 4 news poll suggests it is achievable.\nBut we cannot go forward without ensuring proper input from the wider Yes movement. In response to a question from Ross Greer at Holyrood on Wednesday, Angus Robertson agreed that every vote cast for pro-independence candidates at the 2024 General Election would count towards the mandate for Scotland’s independence. If this is to be our plan then it will mean respectful dialogue and co-operation between the activists of the SNP, Green and Alba parties. The petty bile needs to stop. It also means that the question of a Yes coalition first mooted for the 2015 General Election will have to be revisited. That would certainly be one way of making it easier to guarantee a mandate of more than 50%.\nThat’s all well and good on the political strategy but what of the all-important issue of how we reach out to and convince the half of Scottish voters who don’t as yet support independence?\nIn that respect, although devolution has been found wanting there are important lessons to be learned from the movement which led to the 1997 devolution referendum. By the time that referendum took place the result was a foregone conclusion. Almost 75% of those who then voted supported the devolution project. How wonderful it would be to have that sort of level of support behind independence. Not only would it guarantee a win, but it would also guarantee bringing the British government to the negotiating table.\nThe level of support that was garnered for devolution came about as a result of 18 years of unwanted Tory governments in Scotland, but it also happened notwithstanding the 1997 Labour General election victory. Scottish voters understood that even though Labour had finally managed to win a General Election, they needed devolution to protect them from the follies of future unwanted UK governments. Although devolution has made a difference, it has not proved to be entirely up to that task.\nThe devolution referendum and its resounding success also came about because of the constitutional convention which preceded it. As Stephen Noon reminded us earlier this week that was a cross-party, civic process which identified the settled will of the Scottish people. The process it facilitated was a very different conversation than that, such as it is, currently taking place between the entrenched independence and unionist movements. Stephen Noon contributed a great deal to the campaign which helped take support for independence in Scotland from 28% to 45%. He is also a thoroughly decent man, and he is always worth listening to. He thinks we need another Constitutional Convention. So does Alex Salmond. And so did the First Minister when she announced her way forward on Brexit day in January 2020. So, let’s get one off the ground.\nRegardless of what the Supreme Court may have said about the right to self-determination in international law, history tell us that the political reality is that movements for self-determination can be delayed but not, ultimately, denied.

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_stand/content_92.html": "The Stand Comedy Club\nJoanna Cherry KC MP has released the following statement in relation to the recent cancellation of the Stand “In Conversation with Joanna Cherry” event previously scheduled for 10th August.\nJoanna Cherry said:\n“In January, I accepted an invitation from The Stand to speak at an event in The Fringe this coming August. To my disappointment, and after initially backing the event, the Board of The Stand cancelled the event, citing concerns expressed by staff who were unwilling to work at it. The event has been running for four years and has a wide and diverse range of speakers, including from various political backgrounds.\nI immediately required to defend my reputation. I said last week on BBC Radio Scotland:\n\"I'm being cancelled and no-platformed because I'm a lesbian, who holds gender-critical views that somebody's sex is immutable.\n\"I've made those views clear over a number of years. I have never said that trans people should not have equal rights.\n“Because a small number of people don't like my feminist and lesbian activism, I'm being prevented from talking about these things and others in my home city where I'm an elected politician.\n\"I think it says something's gone very wrong in Scotland's civic space.\n\"Small groups of activists are now dictating who can speak and what can be discussed.\"\nIn the last few days, I have been greatly heartened by the support I have received. Many well-informed people have made it clear that they consider the decision of The Stand to be both unacceptable and discriminatory. Despite those views, and my stated desire that the Stand ‘see sense’, there has been no reversal of the decision.\nAccordingly, I decided to seek legal advice on the issue and on my options.\nI have received the opinion of the eminent and leading human rights advocate, Aidan O’Neill KC who considers that The Stand have acted unlawfully. My solicitor David McKie of Levy & McRae agrees with that view and has today written to The Stand on my behalf. Given the very public statements which have been made about me by The Stand and in the press and on social media, some of which have been threatening and/or abusive, I have decided to release both my solicitor’s letter and the opinion of senior counsel.\nThe actions of the Stand and all that has followed thereon are symptomatic of a wider problem in our society. I am very concerned that those who hold perfectly legitimate views on a variety of issues, including women like me are regularly being misrepresented, de-platformed and, in some cases, facing damage to or the loss of our livelihoods. This is often accompanied by online abuse and threats. The debate on gender self-identification is a very important one which must be allowed to take place, but I am a woman of many parts who was engaged to talk about my political life in general and I see the cancelling of my one-hour event as the thin end of the wedge.\nI am prepared to take whatever legal action is necessary to vindicate my right not to be misrepresented and not to be discriminated against. This is not about money. My primary goal is to have the actions of the Stand acknowledged as unlawful and to ensure the event proceeds. I have asked The Stand to apologise to me too. If they don’t agree with my reasonable requests, I intend to ask the court to decide on the issue. I hope that my actions in defending myself will give courage to everyone particularly women who wish to express views on legitimate issues of public interest. That, after all, is the very job of a politician and one of the reasons I entered politics in the first place.”",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_covid-saved-raab-from-grilling-on-human-rights-act/content_42.html": "Covid saved Dominic Raab from a grilling on the Human Rights Act\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 17th Dec 2021\nAs Omicron gallops across the UK I have had to sit out events in Westminster, having tested positive last week. It’s been a strange dislocating experience, being ill alone in central London. Particularly so, as I missed my girlfriend’s birthday celebrations and it’s a reminder of how much the company of our loved ones matters, especially at this time of year. Whilst I don’t count Dominic Raab among their number, I was particularly frustrated to miss the chance to question him when he finally announced the consultation on his plans to “reform’ the Human Rights Act (HRA) in the House of Commons on Tuesday.\nPublished on the same day as the Independent Review of the HRA, predictably, as with their plans for Judicial Review, the Tories are proposing to go considerably further than the independent review recommends. The foreword makes it that clear the UK will remain a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Instead, it is to be undermined by stealth, making it much harder for people in the UK to enforce their ECHR rights before the domestic courts. The HRA will be replaced with a modern Bill of Rights which will include the rights that are in the ECHR, plus a few “UK rights”.\nThe underlying agenda is to find a way to pick and choose which rights can be enforced effectively and to avoid ministers being thwarted by awkward court decisions. It seems certain categories of individuals, i.e. foreigners, may not be able to access the same rights as UK citizens. There is to be a ‘permission stage” for human rights claims, whereby the claimant must prove he or she has suffered a “significant disadvantage” before they get their day in court (a higher bar than the European Court of Human Rights demands). And it is to be made more difficult to bring human rights cases against public authorities.\nIt was a rich irony that on the same day that Tory backbenchers railed against the latest Covid-induced encroachment on civil liberties, most of them cheered Raab’s announcement to the rafters. Don’t get me wrong. I rather admire the Tories determination to scrutinise the need for the extraordinary curtailment of our rights which the Covid restrictions have involved. While protecting life and public health must be our foremost consideration in these times of crisis, parliaments should not be supine in the face of such measures and should instead be anxious to ensure they are necessary, proportionate and time limited. But if scrutiny is a good thing for Covid regulations then it’s a good thing for government across the board. However, Raab’s new measures are all about freeing the UK government from the yoke of scrutiny.\nThe hypocrisy is staggering in more ways than one. When Grant Shapps was wheeled out on the Today programme earlier this week to defend Boris Johnson in the face of an unprecedented rebellion, he asked the rhetorical question – who wants to curb freedoms? The answer, Grant, is your own government. Look at the bills that have been whizzed through the commons this year on Voter ID, Borders, Policing and public order. Each of these have undermined fundamental freedoms.\nRaab’s consultation spends a lot of time harking back to a mythical UK tradition that frankly I don’t recognise. Predictably Magna Carta gets a lot of mentions. Equally predictably, despite its international influence including on the American Declaration of Independence, the Declaration of Arbroath doesn’t merit a mention. And I think we can safely say that the right to self- determination is unlikely to feature in Raab’s bill of rights.\nIn fairness, there’s a nod to the Claim of Right and the seminal Tumbling Lassie case of 1687 in which the Court of Session declared “We have no slaves in Scotland, and mothers cannot sell their bairns”. But without a proper analysis of the different traditions that make up the nations of the union these references are at best tokenistic. The right to freedom of speech and the right to trial by jury are described as “quintessentially UK rights”. This is not only wrong, (there is no right to a jury trial per se in Scots law), it is also disingenuous when one thinks of the inroads made on freedom of expression in the Policing Bill.\nI must confess to being a little cynical about why Raab waxes quite so lyrical about the right to a jury trial, which doesn’t feature in the ECHR but which he describes it as an “ancient right applied variably around the UK.” Maybe he is trying to set up a fight with the Scottish government about plans to restrict jury trials in Scotland. Like many I have grave reservations about these plans, they will require very careful consideration and consultation with all interested parties, not just those who champion reform. However ultimately the decision about what to do should be for the Scottish parliament, not for the Justice Minister of another jurisdiction.\nWhile the significance of devolution is noted there is surprisingly little acknowledgement of Scotland’s separate and distinct legal and constitutional traditions. This is not really surprising as the justification for most of these reforms is the need to bolster the supremacy of parliament, a purely English doctrine. Acknowledging the Scottish notion of the sovereignty of the people wouldn’t fit with the project and could encourage the natives to think that their desire for a further vote on self-determination might be granted.\nRaab is trying to invent a UK tradition that simply doesn’t exist. Moreover, if the UK tradition is so integral to the project one might have expected some mention of the founding document of the UK, the Treaty of Union and, in particular, its protections for the preservation of Scotland’s unique legal system, but it is not mentioned. Nor is there any acknowledgement of the significance of Scotland’s very different direction of travel under a devolved government which has promised to expand rights protections to incorporate international treaties beyond the ECHR, including economic, social and environmental rights.\nIt would be unwise to be complacent that there could never be a threat to human rights in contemporary Scotland. At least one piece of legislation recently passed by the Scottish parliament may, once brought into force, be subject to a human rights challenge for breaching the protections in Article 9 and 10 of the ECHR for freedom of belief and freedom of speech. The Hate Crime Bill contains no explicit defences to the stirring up offences for the expression of gender critical views. For saying that it should I was vilified, sacked from my front bench position, and threatened with rape. Yet anyone who has considered recent English case-law and the case law of the Strasbourg court as well as the trajectory of recent abandoned Scottish prosecutions should see that these protections are required. Indeed just last week the English Law Commission said that “[A] blanket restriction on the expression of gender-critical views would likely be in breach of Articles 9 and 10, because it would be an unnecessary and disproportionate interference with the rights to hold and express those protected beliefs. Moreover, where – as with discussions on reform of the Gender Recognition Act 2004 – the expression was a contribution on a matter of political debate – the scope for interference with the right would be limited.” That is a correct reflection of the ECHR law. Sadly, Scotland’s Hate Crime legislation is not.\nSo how will Raab’s plans play out? Well, there will be a consultation period which will include consultation with the Scottish Government but ultimately, we know that no matter what the consequences for Scotland, the UK Government with its big majority will do what it wants. As with the bigger picture the only way to stop this project is with independence. With every new Tory initiative it becomes increasingly clear that we cannot peril our strategy to secure that independence on the permission of a Government that holds such scant regard for the separate legal and constitutional traditions of our nation.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_facilitating-snp-policy-debate-online/content_272.html": "SNP activists must not be allowed to stifle open debate\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 15th May 2020\nRecently, I received a letter from a fellow party member enclosing my Dad’s SNP membership card from the 1970s. He asked if I was the wee girl who used to answer the door when he came to collect my Dad’s subscription and wondered if me or my Dad had ever envisaged that I would grow up to become an SNP MP. It set me thinking about how far the SNP have come since the highs and lows of the 1970s and the lessons that might be learned for the present day.\nAlthough I was brought up in an SNP supporting household, when the party moved to the right in the aftermath of the 1979 General Election rout, like a lot of other young people I felt alienated. In 1980 along with John Swinney and Ian Blackford I had been one of the founding members of the Edinburgh branch of the Young Scottish Nationalists (YSN), but after the ‘79 Group were expelled and the party moved to the right, the SNP seemed an inhospitable environment for those of us who thought that left wing progressive policies were required to combat Thatcherism. I wasn’t the only member of the Edinburgh YSN to leave and join the Labour party.\nIn the Labour party, we continued to argue for home rule and many of us were active in the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly. However, in my experience, with a few honourable exceptions, such as Denis Canavan, most Labour parliamentarians only paid lip service to the notion of devolution. In fairness, the party ultimately came good on their promises when elected to power in 1997 although notably, it was a cross-party campaign in which the SNP played a leading role which delivered such a resounding vote for devolution in the referendum.\nSince then the SNP has gone from strength to strength and replaced the Labour party as the most effective electoral machine in Scotland.\nWe can always learn lessons from the past. The suppression of debate about policy and strategy that happened when the ‘79 Group were expelled certainly did not work to the SNP’s electoral advantage. It was only when members of that group returned to the fold, argued for and introduced the sort of progressive policies that are now the hallmark of the SNP, that the party recovered and achieved electoral success.\nThose who would seek to suppress debate about policy and strategy should remember we achieve far more as a party and as a movement when we exchange ideas openly and work to develop the sort of radical policies Scotland needs.\nMany party members were appalled at last year’s October conference when a small group of activists tried to shout down and intimidate speakers who wanted to debate a Plan B on how we might achieve a second independence referendum. Whatever you might have thought of the wisdom of the plan being put forward, or indeed as to whether it should be debated at all, this sort of behaviour is anti-democratic, unhealthy and has no place in the SNP.\nEqually, we must be alert to the risk that if the online abuse and misogyny I and other female SNP members have endured of late is allowed to continue, women will be deterred from entering political life. It is incumbent upon all those who are serious about democracy to defend the right to free speech and the right to disagree in a civilised and measured manner. If we do not our democracy will be damaged.\nMost of us in the SNP and the Yes movement have worked hard to ensure a civilised debate on the question of Independence. These efforts will be undermined if the bile generated by a minority of activists in our party against women with legitimate concerns is allowed to continue unchallenged.\nDebating policy and strategy within our party is a good thing. And we should never let those who suggest otherwise bully or cow us into submissive silence.\nI know the current leadership of the party, most of whom lived through the fallow years, understand this. They also understand that whilst the SNP Government must maintain its entire focus on the COVID crisis there is nothing to stop the party machine facilitating debate on policy and strategy, except perhaps that meetings, assemblies and conference are not safe at present.\nThe National Assemblies which took place in 2018 were a model of the sort of civilised informed debate about policy and strategy that the SNP needs.\nBefore the current crisis hit the plan was to hold more National Assemblies across the country as well as our Spring and October conferences. I have written to the National Secretary of the SNP suggesting that the party take these debates online with the necessary formalities to ensure that we facilitate democratic deliberative assemblies which achieve tangible policy proposals rather than just mere talking shops.\nAn indication of how this might be done can be seen in the successful project to take the Climate Assembly UK online during the pandemic crisis which anyone interested can read about on the website of the Constitution Unit of University College London. https://constitution-unit.com/2020/05/08/how-we-moved-climate-assembly-uk-online/\nFinally, the anonymous “Senior SNP sources” who brief against those of us who advocate wider democratic debate within the party should be aware that their underhand behaviour does not endear them to the activists whose hard work has put them in the senior positions they hold. I am working towards one goal alone and that is the goal of independence which most of our movement shares. Surely, we should all be working towards it together, by taking the practical steps needed to plan how we achieve our aim and what we do with the prize of an independent Scotland when it is achieved. Only through respectful, open discussion and collaboration will we achieve our goal. Everything else is just noise.",

Call me old fashioned but if someone was questioning whether I had broken my oath of office I would turn up in person to defend myself. However, he didn’t and sent a junior Minister along instead who singularly failed to tackle any of the issues I raised.\nThe lawyers left standing in the UK Government, such as they are, are cosily cocooned in denial. But, as the length of time it took to replace the Tories Scottish law officer shows, lawyers in Scotland, even those with Tory sympathies, were very reluctant to take the Queen’s shilling to defend this UK Governments’ track record.\nConcern in the legal profession about the Government’s attitude towards the rule of law is widespread. Last week I spoke at a webinar about the implications of the Internal Market Bill for the rule of law. The event was organised by the International Bar Associations’ Human Rights Institute and was attended by 1000 lawyers from across these islands. Other Speakers expressing concern about the bill included such well known “lefty lawyers” as Michael Howard QC, the former Tory leader. Lord Neuberger, the last but one President of the UK Supreme Court also spoke. He said that the UK Government’s Brexit strategy was driving the UK down a “very slippery slope” towards “dictatorship” or “tyranny”.\nHe’s right.\nThe Lord Chancellor is required to take an oath to respect the rule of law that no other member of the Cabinet is required to take. Yet since assuming office in July 2019, Robert Buckland QC has presided over a year as yet unsurpassed for challenges to the rule of law from his cabinet colleagues; from the defeat in the Supreme Courts of both Scotland and the UK over the unlawful prorogation of parliament to the international disgrace occasioned by the plans to break international law in the Internal Market Bill its been a remarkable year.\nThe fallout from the prorogation case and the UK Government’s repeated defeats in the courts in asylum cases has led to high level attacks on the legal profession, the judiciary and now proposals to restrict the right to judicial review of government actions.\nYet while the UK Government’s Scottish law officer, the Advocate General, has resigned with a letter informing the PM that he found it increasingly difficult to reconcile his obligations as a Law Officer with the Government’s policy intentions, the Lord Chancellor has remained in office.\nIn addition to the Internal Market Bill we currently have before parliament two other bills which are unprecedented in legal terms – the Overseas Operations Bill and the Covert Human Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) Bill – both of which seek to create exemptions in the criminal law for the military, and law enforcement agencies and their informants to prevent them from being prosecuted for crimes in the same way as the rest of us. Meanwhile, pending reassessments of the scope of judicial review and the Human Rights Act threaten to limit the ability of British citizens to challenge unlawful actions of the Government in court.\nAt the same time the Law Societies and Bars of Scotland and England and Wales have expressed trenchant concerns about the rhetoric employed by Home Secretary and PM towards the legal profession.\nOn 3 September Priti Patel tweeted that activist lawyers were frustrating the removal of asylum seekers from the UK.\nDays later an immigration solicitor was the subject of a violent racist attack in a London law firm and the Law Society of England and Wales wrote to the Home Secretary warning her that inflammatory rhetoric has consequences. Undaunted, she doubled down on her rhetoric at the Tory party conference with the PM as her cheerleader in chief. In her conference speech on October 4 she criticised asylum seekers making “endless legal claims to remain” and moaned about those who “lecture us on their grand theories about human rights\", as well as “do-gooders” and “lefty lawyers”. The next day, in his Conference speech, the PM, applauded her sentiments saying that the Government were changing the law and “stopping the whole criminal justice system from being hamstrung by what the home secretary would doubtless – and rightly – call the lefty human rights lawyers, and other do-gooders.”\nThe leader of the Faculty of Advocates in Scotland, Roddy Dunlop QC, was so concerned about these comments that he wrote to the PM pointing out that:\n“Whether the topic is immigration, or crime, or the constitution, lawyers that act against the State are not being “lefty”, nor “activist”: they are doing their professional duty [...] In this country (and the same cannot be said of all countries), instances of violence against lawyers are, fortunately, rare. However, in a climate of increasing populism, this sort of rhetoric is not only facile and offensive: it is potentially harmful. With great power comes great responsibility, and I have to say – with great respect – that I simply cannot fathom why it is thought in any way appropriate to attempt to vilify, in public, those that are simply doing their job, in accordance with the rule of law. I would accordingly, and again with great respect, ask each of you to eschew such unhelpful language, and to recognise that challenges to the executive are a necessary part of our democracy. Anything less would be a confession that we no longer live in a democracy.”\nNow, whilst I am happy to be called a lefty lawyer, the Dean of the Faculty of Advocates would, I am sure, wish to remain politically neutral. Therein lies the power of his unprecedented letter. It will be interesting to see what kind of reply he gets from the PM but for now I would wholly endorse the Dean’s view that the problem with dog whistle politics is that the dogs sometimes react.\nThe Ipsos Mori poll showing support for Scottish Independence at 58% shows the extent to which Boris Johnson’s government is held in contempt in Scotland. It is also a massive vindication of all those in the SNP and the wider Yes movement who have worked to persuade more of our fellow Scots, new and old, to our cause. To persuade yet more to join us we must be vigilant to reassure them that in an independent Scotland the rule of law will be respected and that, whilst no one will be above the law, we will always recognise the need for due process, fair trials as opposed to trial by media and the quality of mercy.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_free-speech-issues-at-universities/content_251.html": "Tory motives are unclear but free speech issues exist at universities\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 28th May 2021\nOne of the most irritating things about the Tories at Westminster is their utter hypocrisy. While trumpeting the importance of human rights at home and abroad, their approach to protecting them is very selective. Often, they do the opposite of what they say. One distinguished professor of law has called it ‘constitutional gaslighting’.\nTo take just one example, last week the Joint Committee on Human Rights heard alarming evidence from police, lawyers and the Gypsy, Roma, Traveller community about the likely impact of the Tories plans to criminalise unauthorised encampments and seize traveller’s property including their caravans. While purporting to defend the property rights of landowners the Tories are prepared to throw the travelling community’s way of life under the bus and have a very cavalier attitude to the travellers’ right to peaceful enjoyment of their property. These proposals are just one more objectional aspect of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which fortunately will not apply in Scotland where, witnesses told us, the attitude towards the travelling community is considerably more benign (Douglas Ross excepted).\nWhen it comes to protecting the right to freedom of expression, the Tories approach is equally inconsistent. In the Queen’s Speech, they proudly announced a bill to protect freedom of speech in universities. However, they also promised to continue with the Police etc. Bill Part 3 of which will fundamentally undermine the right to protest in England. What the Tories forget or seem to be happy to ignore is that the right of freedom of expression is universal. It matters as much for an itinerant Extinction Rebellion protestor as it does for those privileged enough to be university educated.\nArticles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act (HRA) impose a positive obligation on governments to facilitate the right to freedom of expression including freedom of speech, peaceful assembly and protest. These rights can only be qualified where it is necessary and proportionate to do so and any legal restrictions must be “accessible” and their consequences “foreseeable”. This means that any lack of clarity in the law or in Government policy, which leads an individual to be unsure about the legality of their actions, could be an unjustified interference with Article 10 and 11 rights. It is important, therefore, that our laws are clear, so they don’t have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech and lawful protest. This was a concern which cropped up repeatedly during the debate in the Scottish Parliament on the Hate Crime and Public Order Bill which is now an Act of parliament but not yet in force.\nWhile I am deeply sceptical of the Tories’ commitment to freedom of expression, several recent cases have highlighted that there is an issue with freedom of speech in universities which needs to be addressed, and it is not confined to English Universities. Many of these cases involve academics or students who hold gender critical views, which means they believe that sex is immutable and that whilst gender identity should be respected, self- identification of sex should not be enshrined in law.\nThe case of Lisa Keogh, a working-class mature law student at Abertay has received widespread publicity. Her final exams have been blighted by a disciplinary investigation instigated by students who objected to her gender critical views.\nAt Edinburgh University, Dr Neil Thin, a well-respected senior lecturer was accused of holding “offensive views” (including gender critical views) and had to stand down pending an investigation. Some of his accusers had used hateful and abusive language towards him but they are not facing disciplinary proceedings even though their behaviour appears to have been in breach of the university’s code of conduct which prohibits harassment and bullying.\nIn England the University of Essex recently published a major independent report by a barrister and expert in employment and discrimination law, Akua Reindorf. She was tasked with investigating the no-platforming of two respected feminist academics who were wrongly accused of being transphobes who had engaged in hate speech. They themselves had faced “violent and profane’ threats from students in respect of which no action was taken. Both women have now received a full apology from the university. Akua Reindorf’s report concluded the university had failed to apply existing law correctly because of flawed “no debate” policies and guidance promoted by Stonewall which had misrepresented equalities law and were not compatible with academic freedom.\nShe reviewed the relevant law and emphasised that, as public authorities, Universities are bound under the Human Rights Act (HRA) to uphold the right to free speech and freedom of assembly and association and the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion under Article 9 of the ECHR. Article 9 protects non-religious beliefs such as veganism and belief in man-made climate change as well as religious beliefs. So does the Equality Act and lawyers and feminists are currently awaiting the outcome of an Employment Appeal Tribunal where the appellant, Maya Forstater, a woman who lost her job for her gender critical beliefs, is arguing that such beliefs amount to a ‘belief’ for the purposes of the legislation. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) intervened in the appeal to support her argument.\nThe EHRC are the independent statutory body responsible for encouraging equality and diversity, eliminating unlawful discrimination, and protecting and promoting human rights across England, Scotland and Wales. Their support is very significant.\nThe Equality Act prohibits discrimination, harassment or victimisation related to a protected characteristic. There are ten protected characteristics: age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief and sex. The EHRC have also emphasised that there is no hierarchy of protected characteristics.\nAs public authorities Universities are bound by the Equality Act’s Public Sector Equality Duty to foster good relations between groups with different protected characteristics. Akua Reindorf’s report explains that preventing gender critical women from speaking at a university is a potential violation of that duty. Furthermore, the no platforming of gender critical women may amount to indirect sex discrimination against women at the University on the basis that more women than men tend to hold gender critical views.\nWhen the Joint House of Lords and Commons Committee on Human Rights reported on freedom of speech in universities in 2018 we recognised that there was a problem, albeit we did not find the wholesale censorship of debate which some media coverage had suggested. We made various recommendations short of legislation, including closer co-operation with the EHRC. Now, more than ever, a full appreciation of equalities law is what is required. Rather than taking up parliamentary time with more legislation, universities need a refresher course in the existing law particularly the duties which are incumbent on them under the Equality Act.",

Except he didn’t. He was probably too busy celebrating the news that the Metropolitan Police aren't taking any further action against him for his law breaking covid parties. Instead, he sent future leadership contender and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to tell us that the wholly foreseeable issues caused by the Northern Ireland protocol would justify the UK unilaterally rewriting it. Perhaps he thinks he will get off as lightly with this as he has with his covid law breaking. I doubt it. All the signs are that the international community will be less forgiving than the Met.\nIt's been reported that the Attorney General, Suella Braverman, has provided legal advice justifying the proposed course of action. I have no doubt that it will be based on the views on parliamentary sovereignty and the supremacy of domestic law, which she favoured us with the last time the Tories were planning on breaking international law. The Tory MP and anti-EU veteran Sir William Cash invited us to ignore “siren voices” who might disagree with Suella’s ladybird guide to international law. But the difficulty for the Foreign Secretary, the Attorney General and the honorable Member for Stone is that the siren voices to the contrary include the United Kingdom Supreme Court.\nDuring the Brexit litigation, in the case which Gina Miller brought to ensure the UK Government would not trigger Article 50 without an Act of Parliament, the Supreme Court made it quite clear that international treaties signed by the UK Government are binding on the UK in terms of international law and that our obligations under them cannot be unilaterally rewritten by domestic law. This is a pretty fundamental tenet of international law. When I put this to Liz Truss she did not engage and simply repeated her mantra that the UK government “fully respect(s) the rule of law, and we are very clear that this Bill is in line with international law.” This was greeted with shouts of laughter.\nShe has promised that the Government will “very shortly’ publish a legal statement on their plans. I cannot wait to see what mince she comes up with. My information is that her Tory lawyer colleagues are less enthusiastic in their anticipation.\nConcerns about further UK Government law breaking this week were not confined to their plans for a bill on the protocol. On Tuesday the UK Government published The Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill. This bill will see immunity from prosecution granted to those who co-operate with a new body which will investigate atrocities from the Troubles era. British veterans have welcomed it, but victims' groups have not, which pretty much tells all you need to know. Victims advocate Raymond McCord, a protestant, whose son was murdered by loyalist gunmen, says he is reconciled with the nationalist community, he doesn’t need reconciliation but justice. Some people have compared what is proposed with the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission but that was a court-like restorative justice process that took place straight after apartheid ended and in public, not in private 25 years after the peace was brokered. This looks more like a cover up.\nShortly after the bill’s publication, in my capacity as deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, I met with the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to discuss their current concerns. They are on record as having noted that any legacy-related legislation which halts existing inquests and civil actions risks breaching the obligation to hold effective investigations pursuant to Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nVictims' groups will likely mount a legal challenge. They believe that Criminal Justice processes should be allowed to take their course. They have not failed, it's just that they have not been allowed to progress properly. We need proper legal processes to get to the truth. Otherwise, people are afraid to come forward.\nThe bill will also have implications for Scotland. The legislative consent motion process will be triggered by provisions relating to the limitation of civil proceedings, criminal proceedings and inquests; the release of prisoners; the establishment of an Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery and its reviewing and reporting functions in Scotland. So, the bill could make significant inroads into the administration of justice in Scotland as well as breaching our human rights law.\nThe bill will also require the legislative consent of the Stormont Assembly which won't be possible for so long as the unionists frustrate its ability to get up and running.\nIn Northern Ireland, the DUP, who lost the recent election and who won fewer than a third of the seats at Stormont, are holding hostage the majority who want a functioning assembly and who never voted for Brexit. Time and events may soon overtake them.\nThis week SNP MPs met with Sinn Fein parliamentarians as well as high profile Fianna Gael TD Neale Richmond to discuss all these issues. Some of us went on to attend an event about Ireland’s Future which included contributions from the very impressive Sinn Fein MP John Finucane (his father was a victim of a troubles atrocity which we have yet to get to the bottom of), Mr Richmond and representatives of the SDLP and the Alliance parties. Ian Blackford also spoke.\nThe Ireland’s Future event made it clear that Brexit has proved to be a huge catalyst for constitutional change in Ireland. There is a shared consensus that a referendum on Irish reunification is coming.\nSinn Fein say the preparation for a united Ireland should start now and they want the Irish Government to publish a discussion paper as a prelude to a Citizens Assembly which will examine the issue of constitutional change on the island of Ireland and map a way forward by identifying the public policy priorities and political frameworks to enable the transition towards a new Irish national democracy. Neale Richmond would prefer that the Dublin Government set up a committee on Irish unity to look at the challenges and opportunities that might emerge from reunification. He said it would need to address such issues as integrated education and healthcare free at the point of delivery.\nIn so far as these politicians share a goal, it is to have the arguments needed to bring people along ready before a border poll is called. They reminded us that Brexit has shown us that preparation and planning for the aftermath of a major vote for constitutional change is vital. While one must always be cautious in drawing parallels between the very different situations of Ireland and Scotland, this is a lesson which I think we can all agree equally applies in Scotland.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_bring-westminster-for-talks-on-independence/content_193.html": "We have to bring Westminster to the table for talks on independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 08th Oct 2021\nLike Andy Wightman I was disappointed, but not surprised, by the UK Supreme Court (UKSC) judgement on the Scottish Parliament’s bills incorporating the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the European Charter of Local Self Government (ECLSG). For those of us who followed the legal argument when the case was heard the writing was on the wall and the scathing comments from Lord Reed and his colleagues about aspects of the drafting of the UNCRC bill were not unexpected.\nTo understand the implications for the likely fate of a Scottish Parliament bill designed to hold a second Independence referendum it is important to understand what the court did and did not say. This involves setting to one side some of the political spin about the judgment although, for some light relief, we should permit ourselves a good laugh at the sanctimonious hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories who voted for both bills unanimously.\nBut please let’s not descend into unpleasant ill-advised ethnic condemnation of the court’s judgment. The UKSC is not an “English court”. It’s a UK court, the creature of UK statute. The current President and Deputy President are both Scottish judges and well respected. The court’s job was to interpret the devolved settlement. That’s what it did, albeit rather conservatively. Getting too hung up on that is a pitfall of seeing the strategic route to independence purely through the prism of devolution. We must strive to undo the impression that has been given at home and abroad that a referendum sanctioned by section 30 is the only legitimate route to independence. Section 30 is a creature of modern statute barely 20 years old and the union between Scotland and England is over 300 years old.\nIndeed, the lesson of this whole debacle is to lift our eyes above and beyond the shackles of the devolved settlement when looking to Scotland’s constitutional future. It is also a useful reminder that there’s no purely legal route to independence. The route must be a political one in which litigation should be but one strand of a multi-faceted strategy.\nBut back to the judgment. Whether Holyrood has the power to incorporate the UNCRC and the ECLSG was never in issue. It does. What was at issue was the extent to which the Scottish Parliament could make the courts interpret UK legislation in devolved areas in line with these international treaties. The UKSC has decided that while Holyrood can repeal or amend UK legislation in devolved areas, it cannot put conditions upon the way in which UK legislation is interpreted or applied by the courts, even for devolved areas. We already knew from the death of the Sewell convention that UK Parliamentary legislation will always trump Holyrood even in the devolved sphere. However, this expansion of the curbs on Holyrood is the result not just of UK parliamentary sovereignty, a doctrine of the British Constitution that was always out of step with Scotland’s constitutional tradition, but a reading of section 28(7) of the Scotland Act which is even more limiting on the Scottish parliament’s powers than parliamentary sovereignty.\nMany legal commentators are very critical of the judgment and I agree with their criticisms. Prof Mark Elliot, Professor of Public Law at the University of Cambridge, says it’s a narrow reading of the devolution settlement employing unconvincing reasoning. As to what this means for a second indyref bill, Professor Aileen McHarg, Professor of Public Law and Human Rights at the University of Durham, says that while technically the legality of an indyref bill raises different issues from those discussed in this judgment, the highly restrictive approach of the court to the Scotland Act and devolved competences does not bode well for such a bill surviving a legal challenge. I fear she’s right. An uncharitable commentator might argue that the strategy pursued in respect of these bills has been a bit of an own goal securing short term political gain at the expense of long term pain for the independence strategy. I think that would be rather harsh. One could equally argue it was sensible to test the waters with these bills. Either way the judgement is a bit of a wake-up call.\nSo too were Alister Jack’s ludicrous comments earlier this week that Scots must wait 25 years for another indyref and achieve 60% support for both independence and a referendum over a 12-month period. Brain of Britain Jack also said that the UKSC ruling gave “vital legal clarity” that Holyrood “cannot legislate outwith its areas of competence”. But we all knew that already. For his 60% rule he prayed in aid “the situation in Northern Ireland”. However, as Carol Monaghan and others pointed out there is no 60% rule in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement clearly stipulates that 50% plus ONE person must vote for reunification, i.e. a simple majority. Moreover, the Northern Ireland Act allows for a repeat reunification referendum after 7 years have elapsed.\nEarlier this year I was derided by the usual suspects when I pointed out that there is constitutional precedent for one part of the UK leaving by consent via the mechanism of a Treaty after a pro-independence vote in a General Election (Ireland in 1921). I felt vindicated when Ciaran Martin, the highly respected Professor and former civil servant who helped negotiate the Edinburgh Agreement, also pointed to this important historical and constitutional fact when he made his well-received intervention in the debate. He argued that a continued refusal by the British government to co-operate in the holding of a second independence referendum changes the union between England and Scotland from one based on consent to one based on force of law. That, he said, is one of the most profound transformations in the internal governance of the UK since most of Ireland left almost a century ago.\nHe’s right and we will need statecraft to get round it. We need to find a way to bring Westminster to the negotiating table on the issue of Scottish Independence. Collecting mandates for a second indyref isn’t working. If Westminster won’t play ball as result of that strategy, we need to reset to a strategy that makes them play ball. Getting support for independence to the 60% mark and keeping it there would help but this won’t happen until we have in place the crucial arguments we need on the economy, borders and EU accession. The restart of the work on the “detailed prospectus” that will ensure the next independence campaign is ‘fully informed’, announced by the FM last month is very important.\nIn an interview with the Financial Times this week the FM also said that she expects to be able to take ‘concrete decisions’ on the timing of a rerun of the independence referendum next spring. I imagine this will still include introducing the promised bill to parliament, but it should be just one strand of a broader strategy in which having the right arguments ready will be crucial. A sustained increase in support won’t come without these arguments but we also need to build and demonstrate a wide base of support for independence in the way that was done for devolution in the years leading up to Labour’s victory in 1997 and which meant the result of the referendum that followed was a foregone conclusion. So, let’s get the constitutional convention promised in January 2020 off the ground. It must involve grass roots as well as civic Scotland, but it should also involve our MPs, currently languishing in a Tory dominated Westminster with time on our hands.\nBluntly, if we cannot hold a referendum sanctioned by section 30 and a Holyrood bill is struck down by the UKSC then we will need to focus our energies on the electoral process. Ultimately Scottish independence will come about when the people who live in this country get the opportunity to express majority support for it at the ballot box. If there’s no way to hold a referendum legally then we will need to use a UK or Scottish general election to demonstrate that support. We could face a UK General Election as soon as 2023 so we need to get our ducks in a row, soon.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_independence-referendum-and-tories/content_212.html": "Scotland’s future as an independent nation is not just down to Boris Johnson\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Sep 2020\nHappy Indyref Anniversary.\nThis day, 6 years ago, Jim Sillars famously said that absolute sovereign power lay in the hands of the Scottish people and that we had to decide whether to keep it, or to give it away to where our minority status would make us permanently powerless and vulnerable.\nUnfortunately, as events have shown, not holding onto our sovereignty then was a dangerous decision. The promise of the consolation prize of the most powerful devolved Parliament in the world did not materialise and now we see the powers our Parliament was given in 1998 threatened by the Internal Market Bill.\nDuring the Indyref campaign Better Together campaigners scoffed at the idea that the UK might leave the European Union, contemplate leaving the European Convention on Human Rights and end up with Boris Johnson as Prime Minister. Yet all these things have come to pass and 6 years later the UK has become a pariah state denounced from Brussels to Washington for its attack on the international legal order and cavalier attitude towards the Good Friday Agreement.\nYet it is not all bad news. By demonstrating so clearly our weakness to affect UK wide decisions and their contempt for devolution the English Tories have pushed support for independence from strength to strength. Support for independence is now reported to be around the 55% mark in a series of opinion polls.\nOpinion in the EU and internationally is far more well disposed towards Scotland’s aspirations for self-determination in the light of Brexit and as the enormity of what this Government is proposing to do in the Internal Market Bill causes shock waves across the international community.\nScottish independence now seems inevitable particularly when one sees the breakdown of voting intentions and the overwhelming support for it from younger people. The only real question is how and when will the dream of independence be realised.\nIt would of course be the best and easiest course of action if we could have a repeat of the Edinburgh Agreement and the Independence Referendum of 2014 but many are afraid that Boris Johnson will never agree to this given the likelihood that this time we would win. There is also a legitimate concern about whether he would respect the terms of any agreement never mind the result of the referendum. Anyone who watched his slippery performance when Angus Brendan McNeill MP questioned him about these matters at the Liaison Committee on Wednesday would be justifiably nervous. It is hard to negotiate with any confidence with someone who has a track record of breaking agreements. And concerning that the future of our nation should depend upon Boris Johnson doing the right thing.\nIt is important that we do not, as Jim Sillars warned, remain permanently powerless and vulnerable.\nThis means we should not peril all on persuading Boris Johnson to grant a section 30 order. Other options should be explored if not in public then behind the scenes and, although I have not been consulted on these matters, I would be very surprised if this was not happening under the auspices of the leadership of the SNP and the Scottish Government.\nThe First Minister has promised that a draft independence bill will be published ahead of the Holyrood elections setting out timing, terms and question. It is to be hoped that it might render the question of whether the Scottish Parliament has the power to hold a referendum, currently being litigated in the Keatings case, a good deal less hypothetical thus aiding a definitive decision from the court as to the extent of Holyrood’s powers.\nWhilst litigation is not a short cut to independence, which can only be delivered as a result of a democratic vote, it could thus provide a legitimate basis for a referendum in the absence of a section 30 order. It may also be required to defend us from attacks on Scottish institutions such as the attack on the independence of our legal system threatened by the UK Government’s plans to lessen opportunities for judicial review of their activities.\nIn the prorogation case last year the United Kingdom Supreme Court made it clear that in a constitutional democracy bound by the rule of law, all power is limited and it’s the job of the courts to explain what those limits are and to decide when those powers are being abused. So Boris Johnson does not have absolute power.\nIn my speech on the Internal Market Bill this week I emphasised that the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty is a creature of English law and that treaties are governed by international law not domestic law. I also said that as well as breaching the Withdrawal Agreement, in so far as clause 45 seeks to oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of Session in respect of any regulations made under Clauses 42 and 43, the Internal Market Bill also breaches Article 19 of the Treaty of Union. This excited quite a bit of interest.\nWhat I was getting at is that there is a respectable legal argument that there are some articles of the Treaty of Union that are so fundamental the UK Parliament cannot repeal or alter them. For example, the protection of Scotland’s independent legal system in Article 19. Even Dicey, the great exponent of the English doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, admitted that it is not a doctrine enshrined in the Treaty or the Acts of Union. And in a Scottish case argued in the 1950s, MacCormick v Lord Advocate, there was some interesting discussion of the possibility that the UK Parliament is bound by certain unalterable laws in the Treaty of Union and what the consequences might be of it breaking those laws. Unfortunately, the case did not provide an answer to these questions and there is no definitive legal decision on the matter.\nIt looks like the UK government are backtracking on their plans to get rid of judicial review, at least in the current bill, but I am sure that my colleagues in the Scottish Government will have asked their legal advisors to consider the status of the Treaty of Union and whether a ruling from a court in appropriate circumstances might be of assistance in Scotland’s fight for self-determination.\nIt is important to remember that the union of England and Scotland predates the very modern creature that is devolution. That the Union is not indissoluble is widely accepted and is evidenced by the dissolution of the 1800 Union between Great Britain and Ireland by a new British Irish Treaty despite the fact that both unions were described in their founding documents as being “forever after’.\nTherefore the question of how the union between Scotland and England is dissolved and how Scotland expresses its intention to leave that union should not be solely determined by what powers were or were not devolved to the Scottish Parliament when it was reconvened by Winnie Ewing on 12 May 1999 having been adjourned on 25 March 1707. There are wider constitutional questions at stake.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_westminster-chaos/content_34.html": "Lessons for SNP and Yes movement from Westminster chaos plain to see\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 21st Oct 2022\nWriting a column with the current government in charge feels a bit like those times on ‘Have I Got News For You’ where the panellists speak directly to the TV audience and tell them that by the time the programme goes out the politician who is the butt of their jokes will have resigned.\nOn Wednesday it was a case of another one gone, another one gone and another bites the dust. Not the UK Prime Minister yet, just one of her more dreadful ministers, Suella Braverman, and then the Tory Chief Whip and her deputy. But then apparently, they hadn’t resigned at all. Yes, it’s very hard to keep up!\nBy Wednesday evening mass hysteria was sweeping the commons with reports of Tory Whips blocking the entrance to the No Lobby, Jacob Rees-Mogg shouting at his fellow Tory MPs, them swearing back and wannabe Tory rebels being dragged and pushed into voting with the Government. In the Tory party there aren’t many who feel they are better together these days. We can point and laugh of course, and scoff at what a bourach they are making of it all. But is this mess any bigger or all that different from Boris Johnson or Theresa May’s time in Government? The Tories have been sliding towards oblivion since they helped deliver Brexit on the back of a pack of lies and now, we are truly in the end game.\nThe chaotic scenes on Wednesday were the symptoms of a party which has lost its way and ended up with a leader who has had to perform the most incredible series of u-turns on her promised policy platform and seems wholly unsuited for high office.\nI didn’t witness any of the manhandling or swearing in which Tories engaged but I felt the atmosphere which was one of total confusion and chaos. A friend compared it to the last days of Ancient Rome.\nAnyone who tells you that bullying doesn’t take place within parliamentary political parties is wrong. I know. I have seen it at first hand. It tends to take place when leaders are unsure of themselves and cannot command confidence in their leadership. There will always be willing henchman to do the dirty work. We all remember that from our schooldays. Thanks to the Labour MP, Chris Bryant, self-appointed guardian of the Westminster parliament’s good name, the Speaker will investigate what happened on Wednesday evening, but I don’t think many of us hold out much hope of a resolution from that quarter.\nI was reminded of those great lines from W.B .Yeats poem, The Second Coming;\n“Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world……\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst\nAre full of passionate intensity.”\nMPs in tears and scenes reminiscent of the parliaments of banana republics are hardly reassuring to our constituents who, because of the cost-of-living crisis, are suffering in a way which would have seemed unimaginable a year ago. And what must international observers think now of the mother of all parliaments? There really could not be a better time for Scotland to be planning her departure from this union.\nOn Monday the Scottish Government published the third paper in the Building a New Scotland series – ‘A stronger economy with independence’. The paper sets out how new powers, combined with existing strengths, would give Scotland the opportunity to build a better future for everyone who lives here. It describes how proposals for an independent Scotland would improve access to flexible working and strengthen workplace rights, how we could use our extraordinary energy resources to build an economy based on low-cost, renewable energy and how we could invest in infrastructure through the Building a New Scotland Fund. The paper also includes information for the people of Scotland on currency, borders and re-joining the EU.\nIn this last respect it is the start of answering the three questions which I believe are key to winning the next independence vote. However, and this is important, the paper is quite nonprescriptive. It is designed to open rather than close down conversation on the policy matters it discusses. Indeed, in the foreword, the FM says; “This publication is far from the last word on the matter... And we welcome all contributions to the debate on how we can build a better country for everyone who lives here.”\nInevitably, contributions to the debate followed aplenty. The paper’s views on borders and the EU were favourably received by some expert commentators but, predictably, the most controversial commentary focused on the issue of the currency. The indy supporting economist Richard Murphy set out his concerns in detail in a column in this newspaper yesterday. He said he considered it his duty to do so. So, let’s see the authors of the paper address them.\nThe challenge for the SNP is to live up to the FM’s words by welcoming and utilising contributions to the debate. Yes, some unionist commentators will never be happy, but we cannot ignore the concerns of No voters because we need to win some of them over to win our independence and the more we win over the better start our new state will have. So, we need to address some of the unionist arguments, but we also need to address the arguments from people on our own side. Yes, some of them were rather trenchantly expressed but, as Lesley Riddoch explained in her column yesterday, this is because some of these people feel they have been ignored and cut out of pro-independence policy development for years, despite their expertise.\nWe need to get these people back inside the tent and to have an open dialogue in early course. Fortunately, we have the ideal forum in which to do so. A new series of National Assemblies will be announced soon. I am sure one will be held to discuss this paper. the timing of which meant it could not be discussed at our conference. We should invite Richard Murphy, Tim Rideout and Robin McAlpine along to debate their concerns about the currency with the authors of the paper and representatives of the SNP leadership. You only get to introduce a new currency once. We need to get it right. Caution is wise but we also need to give the arguments for moving more quicky the careful attention they deserve.\nThe lessons for the SNP and the wider Yes movement from the mess at Westminster are plain to see. In the words of WB Yeats, we need conviction, but we should avoid passionate intensity. We need to keep a calm sooch, and focus on what is needed to win our prize. Conviction comes from being sure of the ground on which you stand. As we have seen played out in gory detail at Westminster over the last few weeks, the ground on which a political party stands is its policy programme. If it is not strong ground, then you are done for. Policy is best developed collaboratively with everyone who wishes to contribute inside the tent. So, let’s start by bringing the critics of the SNP’s currency plans who share our vision of independence to the table to thrash out their concerns. It can only help not hinder our progress.",

It doesn't matter when we work as one\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 23rd Oct 2020\nThe news that the Tories are war gaming a strategy to delay and then avoid a second independence referendum shouldn’t surprise anyone. However, Alberto Nardelli of Bloomberg is to be commended for another great scoop. The memo which fell into his hands is a document from a political consultancy firm that works closely with the Tory party (NB not the Tory government) to look at tactics.\nThey have identified that, if the SNP win a majority in next May’s elections, continuing to dismiss calls for another independence vote outright could be “counterproductive,”. Therefore, what they need to do is to look at ways to delay or avoid a second independence referendum.\nWell, honestly, who knew? Nevertheless, it’s an important reminder that, whilst the SNP must secure a second vote for independence in circumstances which will meet with international approval and therefore the all-important international recognition, the strategy for doing so should not be one-dimensional.\nIt also gives an indication of how we might want to approach framing such a strategy. Whilst I commend those who have fought against inexplicable resistance to have a Plan B debated at the SNP conference, I also agree with those who caution against putting all one’s cards on the table, particularly when dealing with the current Tory Government at Westminster. We should not cede power to these people. They are devious and unprincipled. This does not mean we should ape their behaviour but nor should we predicate our entire strategy on the assumption that they will do the right thing when their past behaviour suggests quite the opposite.\nAs Pete Wishart found out this week Michael Gove can be a dirty tackler. Ask the EU Brexit negotiation team if they think the British Government will play by the Queensberry rules in any negotiation with the Scottish Government? The answer is obvious.\nWe can’t run a campaign on a series of indignant remarks. The campaign to secure a second independence vote should of course seek to achieve the gold standard of a second referendum based on a section 30 order as that would be by far the easiest route. However, we need a strategy to fall back on when sleekit tactics of delay and avoidance are employed. Time is not on our side. Brexit has happened. The transition period will be a distant memory by the time the election comes. Our parliament is going to be hamstrung when the Internal Market Bill becomes an Act of Parliament and the longer we stay tethered to Brexit Britain the more we diverge from the EU’s standards and laws.\nI am looking forward to what I hope will be a lively and stimulating debate at conference about the various options which might constitute a plan B. However, I would suggest that the best outcome of this debate might be for the membership to mandate the newly elected NEC to set up a group to work on gaming a copper-bottomed strategy the precise details of which need not be advertised to the enemy.\nSuch a group would have to involve a wide cross section of the party from centre to left and not just comprise of the usual suspects. If, as I suspect they will, conference delegates seize the chance to improve the governance of our party by electing an NEC which reflects the views of the membership and their desire for scrutiny and transparency, for which Roger Mullin has so ably argued, then it will be the perfect opportunity to make sure all the talents in our party are utilised.\nContrary to a column in another newspaper earlier this week there is more than one brain behind the Yes movement and the SNP also has quite a few brains to offer. Whilst some might say that the article in question was designed to provoke and therefore best ignored, the reaction to it has exposed that a centrist, ‘steady as she goes’ approach to policy and strategy is not shared across the board in the movement or the party. This is important not just for the policy vision for an independent Scotland, but also for strategic planning.\nSome of the brains in the SNP who are not employed full time dealing with the Covid crisis would like nothing more than to contribute to the development of strategy but feel left out in the cold without an obvious avenue for such contributions to be meaningful. Wouldn’t it be great if these brains could be brought together to devise a strategy to be employed to deal with the inevitable Tory dirty tricks when yet another mandate is secured?\nWe need to move beyond the rather childish assumption that anyone who questions what is understood to be the leadership orthodoxy is disloyal or wants to replace the leader. Let’s also challenge the narrative which seeks to label us all as either Salmondites or Sturgeonites. Most of us actually have minds of our own and what we all have in common is the desire for independence. We are on the verge of realising our dream and we need to work together to ensure that we do.\nEqually, we must not let those who howl “no debate’ on social media prevent us from getting our house in order for the struggle that lies ahead. A small but vocal group, many of whom are not even members of the SNP, seem to have got the impression that they have carte blanche to abuse and demonise anyone who disagrees with their views on gender self ID or Plan B. But guess what? It turns out most members of the SNP don’t like that approach and would prefer to have a civilised debate as we have done in the past over such controversial topics as NATO membership. At the Edinburgh Central SNP candidate hustings earlier this week Marco Biagi argued that “The party is at its best when it is at its boldest.” It is a sentiment with which I wholly agree.\nNor need we worry about scaring the horses. Today’s bold gesture is tomorrow’s mundane reality. For example, when Alex Salmond renamed the Scottish Executive the Scottish Government, after the first SNP election victory in 2007, some commentators reacted as though he was storming the barricades. Now no one, apart from some Tories, questions that nomenclature.\nI have one final caveat. A lot of work has gone into organising online hustings for the selection of SNP candidates for next year’s election. However, I am not the only member who has been disappointed by the lack of opportunity for members to interact with the candidates or debate their answers. It’s a far cry from the lively hustings I went through to be selected as a candidate in 2015 and lessons must be learned for the conference format if we are to have a debate which will encourage fresh thinking to flourish.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_snp-conference-air-our-concerns/content_208.html": "Let’s not waste time on a devolution battle we cannot win\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 02nd Oct 2020\nA week is a long time in politics.\nLast week in my column I expressed concern that no dates had been announced for the SNP conference. Further concern was expressed in the National earlier this week when unnamed insiders (yes, I know we are all a bit sick of them) were quoted in a news article suggesting that there might not be a conference at all.\nOf course, that was nonsense because the terms of the party’s constitution require an annual conference with elections to the NEC. The constitution also mandates that conference is the supreme governing and policy making body of the party and holds the party’s office bearers to account. It would be out of the question for it not to happen particularly when all the other main parties have managed to arrange online conferences. Delegates who attend conference normally vote online in the NEC elections so there should be no difficulty there.\nIt will have come as a great relief to SNP members when, on Wednesday, in what seems to have been an exclusive for Holyrood magazine, it was confirmed that the conference will take place in November at a date yet to be announced. An SNP Spokesperson described plans for a “large scale virtual event” and said details are to be announced “in the coming days”. I am sure members and branches will be notified soon, together with a general press release.\nThis conference comes at what may prove to have been the most important moment in our party’s history. It is a moment of opportunity – but also a moment of considerable danger for Scottish democracy.\nIt has not proved possible to stop Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will and now devolution, the little bit of home rule that we had, is being dismantled. I believe we should be careful not to waste too much time in a battle we cannot win. No one can now doubt that power devolved is power retained. The Sewel Convention is about as much use defending devolution as a chocolate teapot and the UK Supreme Court have not seemed terribly interested in upholding the devolved settlement. I don’t have much faith in legal action based solely on the Scotland Act and, I fear, we are banging our heads off a brick wall if we think this Tory government will devolve any more power to Edinburgh let alone borrowing powers in any way other than one that would be a damaging trap. Independence is the only way forward. As a party, we must find a way to deliver both the democratic vote in favour of independence that I believe is inevitable and also the policies that will make independence a success.\nI and many of my colleagues at Westminster are working hard on policy and work is going on elsewhere in the party, but it is time for conference to see the results of these labours and also to debate some of the exciting ideas coming from groups like Common Weal and Skotia. We must have our policies in order, our finances in order and our party must be match fit for the fight that lies ahead. The decks need cleared.\nAlthough what occurred as a result of my attempt to be selected as the SNP candidate for Edinburgh Central has not been a pleasant experience for me, some good has come of it. Concerns which I and others have had about the way in which some members of the NEC operate have now been brought to the attention of the wider membership of the SNP and, as it has transpired, Edinburgh Central members will still have a choice of candidates.\nThis is not personal. It is about the good of the party. Many people assume that the animosity towards me from some members of the NEC is because of my views on the importance of protecting women’s sex-based rights under the Equality Act. But there was rather more to it than that.\nAt the October Conference in 2018, I was elected to the NEC. I saw it as part of my role to raise concerns about the party’s complaints procedures and vetting process that had been brought to my attention by a number of members and branches whose correspondence on these matters with SNP HQ was not being dealt with to their satisfaction. My attempts to do so were not appreciated by some. Subsequently, my private correspondence on these matters was shared with everyone on the NEC without my permission and then selectively leaked to the press to smear me.\nOur HQ must exist to support branches, party members and the wider aims of the party.\nTo those who say we should not wash the party’s dirty linen in public I say: Yes. I agree. We should not do that. But given the amount of misleading information that has been briefed into the public domain by anonymous sources, I have had no choice but to set the record straight. No one in this party should have to endure lies and smears being peddled about them by anonymous sources within the party, without being able to defend themselves, particularly not when they are on the front line on behalf of the party defending our country’s democracy and right to self-determination.\nWe cannot go on like this. The NEC exists to deal with party governance. Members elected to it must be able to raise the concerns of other members without being vilified. Scrutiny, as we have heard so many times in politics this week, is important. So is transparency. So let’s have democratic transparency and scrutiny at the SNP conference in November and let’s have it as we go forward with the new SNP NEC which will be elected at that conference.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_snp-must-distance-themselves-from-the-past-to-avoid-doorstep-troubles/content_25.html": "SNP must distance themselves from the past to avoid doorstep troubles\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 09th Feb 2024\nNext week, it will be a year since Nicola Sturgeon’s surprise resignation as First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP. Let me be crystal clear. I don’t believe in kicking people when they are down, and I thought Alistair Jack’s nasty comments at the Covid Inquiry were mean, petty and beneath the dignity of a government minister. So, much as it is well known that Nicola and I had our differences and did not get on, this column is not really about her.\nIt’s about the future. The past is the past. We need to look at what the SNP needs to do now for the good of the party and the independence movement. And in so far as we look back at all it should be to learn from our mistakes. On Monday the National carried an insightful piece from my colleague Douglas Chapman MP drawing a comparison between the problems faced by the self-determination movements in Scotland and Catalonia. His article referenced a talk by Clara Ponsati on the failings of the Catalan nationalist leadership who, she said, in the aftermath of the 2017 referendum lacked strategy and conviction. When I heard her deliver this talk in parliament, I was blown away by the parallels with the strategic failures of the SNP leadership in the aftermath of the 2014 referendum, and the failure to capitalise on the opportunities which arose after the Brexit vote shook the UK political landscape.\nOne of the main reasons for those strategic failures was the refusal to listen to advice from anyone outwith a very tight circle or to allow proper debate and discussion about the options available to the party. Some of that same insularity, and decision making by a very small group has been highlighted during the COVID inquiry. The result of this is that the history of the SNP since the Brexit referendum has been a history of missed opportunities and a failure in focus. If half the energy that has been put into identity politics and silencing dissent had been put into our independence strategy, then Scotland would probably be an independent country by now.\nAnyone who doesn’t think we need some sober reflection is in denial. If the failure to make progress towards independence does not worry you, if the SNP slide in the polls does not worry you, then surely the fact that the party is at the centre of three criminal investigations should do. For there to be just one would be bad enough, that there are three is extraordinary. Then there is the independent review into WhatsApp messages retention policy and the investigation by the information commissioner into information retention policy.\nAnd only yesterday Fergus Ewing raised the issue of the crucial redactions to the Hamilton report on whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code by failing to properly record meetings and phone calls with Alex Salmond. While she was cleared by this report large portions of it were redacted in a way that its independent author found unacceptable. Three of Scotland’s most senior judges recently ruled that Ministers had tried to construct a “technical barrier” to \"defeat the objective of open and transparent government.\" And yet the public still don’t know what is underneath the acres of black marker applied to the report and whose activities are being protected from ever reaching cleansing sunlight.\nIn my opinion it would be in the interests of the party and the independence movement, for the current leadership of the SNP to put a bit of clear blue water between themselves and the previous leadership. You will note that I have used the plural. This problem clearly goes beyond Nicola Sturgeon and relates to a style of governing that held power tightly in a small clique in which unelected and unaccountable advisors were more influential than elected politicians.\nWhen I heard the evidence about Kate Forbes being shut out of “Gold Command”, I was reminded of the way that Ian Blackford ran the Westminster group, relying on a “boys club” (which ultimately turned on him) and cutting people like myself and Philippa Whitford out of any discussions about strategy during the Brexit crisis despite our proven track records of expertise in this area, our membership of the relevant parliamentary committees and our valuable cross party contacts.\nWhen I heard about Humza being chewed out at Cabinet for daring to show initiative, I was reminded of the treatment meted out to members elected to NEC on a manifesto to improve the governance and transparency of the party, when all they were doing was asking the very questions they were elected to ask. I was also reminded of how Ian Blackford would turn on anyone in the Westminster group who dared to challenge his slavish adherence to the party line from Edinburgh and to suggest we needed to do more than simply repeating the mantra that “Scotland will not be taken out of the EU against our will.”\nThis style of leadership needs to be a thing of the past. We need a more collegiate approach. We need to be open to ideas. And we need to make sure that unelected advisors with no hinterland beyond politics are never again allowed to rule the roost.\nThere is hope. The polls are holding up. Voters may be disillusioned with the SNP, but there is very little enthusiasm for Labour. People know that having SNP MPs at Westminster means Scotland’s voice will be heard in a way that doesn’t happen with Labour MPs. They also know that it takes SNP MPs to give voice to issues that matter to the people of Scotland, like for example, the need for a ceasefire in Gaza. However, our candidates and activists face being hobbled on the doorsteps unless the party’s new leadership draws a line between the problems created on Nicola’s watch and the programme and vision of our party for the future.\nKate Forbes may have lost the leadership election, just, but no one now can seriously think that she was wrong when she said that “continuity won’t cut it.”",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_its-clear-who-must-pay-for-scotlands-green-transition/content_209.html": "It's clear who must pay for Scotland's green transition\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 28th Jul 2023\nIt's a week since the Tories were trounced in two out of three by-elections in previous strongholds. But extraordinarily they managed to hold on to Boris Johnson’s former seat of Uxbridge by the skin of their teeth. The received wisdom is that they did so because of working class voters’ fury about Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan’s extension of the ULEZ scheme. ULEZ is the Ultra-Low Emissions Zone which is to extend beyond central London to areas including Uxbridge by the end of August.\nIt’s a policy designed to reduce air pollution by charging high polluting motor vehicles to drive on roads in the zone. Drivers whose cars don’t meet emissions standards are charged £12.50 per day. Those with diesel cars more than six years old are in trouble. A separate LEZ or Low Emission Zone scheme has been in force in Greater London for several years. Glasgow introduced a similar scheme on June 1 this year meaning that vehicles entering the city centre must pay a penalty charge of £60 if they don’t meet the less-polluting emission standards. A similar scheme will come into force in Edinburgh city centre on June 1 next year. Those with diesel cars pre-dating 2015 will be caught unless they get a new car or get rid of their car altogether. I feel their pain as this includes me. While these schemes are public health measures primarily aimed at tackling air pollution, they also address climate change by encouraging the uptake of low emission vehicles and less reliance on private car use. It’s fair to say there’s a good deal of annoyance about the Scottish schemes as well as the London schemes. Across Scotland and the UK there are many workers who still rely on their cars to do their job. Think of white van man and woman and care workers to name just two groups.\nThe price of new and second-hand cars which meet the new standards is eye watering even for someone on an MP’s salary so it is easy to see how many will struggle to afford to replace ageing diesel vehicles without state support. There is a parallel with the drive to penalise owners of fossil fuel boilers and to encourage their replacement with climate friendly heating systems. According to Patrick Harvie for most people that will mean energy efficient heat pumps or electric heating. His interview in The Herald last weekend suggesting penalising those with the wrong sort of heating by preventing them from selling their homes caused howls of outrage. Many people pointed to the very high cost of installing heat pumps and their impracticality for the tenement properties so common in urban Scotland. In response FM Humza Yousaf acknowledged that measures taken to tackle climate change must be introduced in a way that is cognisant of the pressures people are under from the cost of living crisis. He was absolutely right to do so.\nThe fires across Europe are a stark reminder of the need to take action to tackle climate change. We must not allow the Tories or climate deniers to weaponise what happened in Uxbridge in order to delay action. But that means the left must have answers to the very real question of who should bear the cost of expensive changes to meet climate change targets. It is wrong for the burden to fall most heavily on those who can least afford it. As Robin McAlpine argues in his blog we need collectivist solutions to the problem of climate change, not punitive individualistic ones. So, what would this look like? Well, it is not rocket science.\nNorway has led the way incentivising change with agreement from all major political parties that it should always be economically beneficial to choose zero and low emission cars over high emission cars. It has the most lucrative electric vehicle incentives in the world. There is legislation establishing charging rights for electric vehicle owners living in apartment buildings. No other country has more heat pumps per capita with their use encouraged by government subsidies, high fossil fuel taxes and low electricity rates as well as restrictions on oil boilers.\nDistrict heating systems also abound making use of surplus renewable energy from local sources such as biofuels, waste and industry heat waste. My colleague Douglas Chapman MP, who is doing good work in this area, would argue that Norway’s successful green transition is the result of a pragmatic and joined-up approach to climate action, one which Scotland and the UK would do well to emulate in terms of bringing citizens on board as we switch to carbon free travel.\nWhen it comes to tackling carbon emissions from our built environment, Douglas would argue for us to look to Denmark, where the Danes are regarded as global leaders in district heating systems, with co-operative and not for profit ownership models that benefit citizens and the climate one of the main factors in their success and take-up. Government funding to encourage the use of heat pumps in Norway started back in the 1970s. The UK has a long way to go to catch up.\nOne way to do it is to make sure those who have made the most profit out of damaging our planet should pay to address that damage. Yesterday as the fires around the Mediterranean continued to rage, oil and gas giants Shell and Centrica announced massive profits. Further such announcements are expected from more energy firms over the next few days. The Climate and Energy Policy Manager at WWF Scotland, Fabrice Leveque, hit the nail on the head when he said that the profits announced yesterday could easily have paid to insulate over a million homes in Scotland, cutting energy bills and carbon emissions.\nThese are windfall profits caused by rising demand following the end of Covid restrictions and the soaring energy prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They need to be taxed in a meaningful way and the revenues ploughed into subsidising and incentivising the move to decarbonised cars and heating. Doing that could also fund the development of the sort of collectivist approach Robin talks about, with co-ordinated working carried out at scale. That way we could challenge vested interests while protecting individual citizens already struggling with a cost of living crisis from bearing the brunt of the cost of changing how we live. Collective action is also a more efficient way to approach this problem than leaving it to individual drivers or householders. Tory windfall taxes rules contained significant loopholes which allowed energy companies to evade them via tax breaks for investment in new projects. A firmer approach is needed. We are all responsible for the actions that have provoked the climate crisis and therefore we must all take action to tackle it but those who have made the most profit out of causing the crisis should pay to subsidise what needs to be done.",

In the middle of the covid-19 crisis and with all it entails for the poorest countries in the world, the UK’s highly regarded Department for International Development (DfID) is to be amalgamated into the Foreign Office. This, it seems, is the final nail in the coffin of Britain’s brief foray into what Robin Cook once described as an ethical foreign policy.\nWhat are we to understand by this move? Aid it seems is now to be a vehicle of ‘British interests’, not just as an end in itself but rather in the PM’s words, to be provided with reference ‘to the diplomatic, political and commercial priorities of the Government of the UK’. In other words, for a quid pro quo, as wider leverage to get what we want. This raises very real concern for future trade and economic development deals with developing countries.\nTake for example Fairtrade which has the power to lift millions out of poverty and ensure sustainable development. During Fair Trade week 2020 the UK was visited by ambassadors from the “She Deserves a Living Income” campaign who are calling for living incomes for female cocoa farmers in West Africa. They attended a reception at Westminster where they listened to fine words of support from Government ministers. What are we to make of that now?\nBoris Johnson’s commons speech seemed to envisage taking aid away from African countries like Zambia and Tanzania and focusing it instead on Ukraine and the Western Balkan states as part of the Government’s security policy. However, the reality is that over half of Zambians live in extreme poverty whereas no one in the Ukraine does.\nContrast the position of Ireland’s President Michael Higgins who recently delivered a keynote address on Europe and Africa identifying the Coronavirus as a global problem which requires a global response and represents an opportunity for the global community to forge a new approach to its relationship with Africa.\nIt’s a sad indictment of Boris Johnson that the President of Ireland has a better understanding of Europe’s responsibilities towards Africa than the PM of Great Britain. Boris Johnson needs to remember that Britain’s imperial history and the rich benefits derived from the slave trade and exploiting natural resources brings with it certain moral responsibilities.\nAnd what about the lip service paid by the Tories to the Black Lives Matter movement?\nWe were starkly reminded of the inequalities at home when at the weekend the 3rd anniversary of the Grenfell fire passed with still no justice for the victims, and Channel 4 News revealed that the UK Government had suppressed aspects of the report about the true extent of the disproportionate impact of Covid19 on Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities.\nLike George Floyd, the last words of many of those who died in the Grenfell Tower were “I can’t breathe”. I have met many of the survivors, a large proportion of the victims were from BAME communities. Theresa May promised that no stone would be left unturned in finding out how such a terrible tragedy could occur in one of the richest boroughs of London, but she went on to make sure that the effects of discrimination on the grounds of class and race were excluded from the inquiry’s terms of reference.\nThree years later Coronavirus has underlined racial disparities as it has been revealed that people from BAME backgrounds in England have up to a 50 per cent higher risk of dying from Covid-19 than white British people. Undaunted, Boris Johnson emerged from beneath the cover of his favourite safety blanket, the Daily Telegraph, to announce yet another review into race inequality.\nThe SNP joined forces with Labour to question why another review is needed. David Lammy spoke eloquently of the numerous reviews that have been carried out over recent years and are still gathering dust with many of their recommendations unimplemented. His own review into the treatment of and outcomes for BAME individuals in the English criminal justice system made 35 specific time-limited recommendations – yet to be implemented. Elish Angiolini, Scotland’s former Lord Advocate carried out a report into deaths in police custody in England which disproportionately involve BAME men. She made 110 recommendations. The Tories are sitting on these too.\nThere is already plenty of evidence of discrimination against BAME people in British society so what the British Government needs to do is act on that evidence, not kick it further into the long grass with yet another review.\nIn Scotland, we like to think we have a better tale to tell but there should be no room for complacency. It is five years since the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody in circumstances which gave rise to suspicion that the colour of his skin played a part in the treatment he received. Fortunately, there will now be an inquiry into his death which will specifically consider the role race played but a date has yet to be fixed and the length of time it has taken to get to his stage is simply not acceptable.\nOn overseas aid, Scotland has a proud tradition of work with Malawi and the 48 SNP MPs elected last year were elected on a manifesto to support a stand-alone foreign aid department. With Boris Johnson at the helm of what Patrick Grady has so accurately described as Little Britain, (as opposed to Global Britain), it seems that without independence emulating Ireland’s internationalism is for now only a dream.",

Many of us have in our minds some concept of the horrendous situation faced by Syrian Refugees from the images on our TV screens during the long civil war which started in 2011. But it is hard for us to truly imagine the horror of the personal suffering and the day-to-day loss of everything which makes a life worthwhile and not simply a daily struggle for survival. The now closed Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (SVPRS) was launched in 2014. The UK Government worked with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to identify those most at risk and to bring them to the UK, including people requiring urgent medical treatment, survivors of violence and torture, and women and children at risk.\nSyrian refugees have been resettled across the globe, but the numbers are tiny in comparison to the vast number of people in need. Those people who have been lucky enough to be resettled leave behind cherished family and friends. Those left behind have their circle of support diminished. I had a heart-breaking case brought to me in 2018 by a young family resettled to Edinburgh. The woman’s sister and her sister’s three young girls were left behind in a camp in Iraq. The two families had lived together in UN provided accommodation but the accommodation was in the name of the family who were re-settled to Edinburgh so those left behind lost their place to live. This poor woman and her three young children were left without accommodation or support. They ended up living a peripatetic life sharing with other people and trying not to overstay their welcome. They eventually managed to move in with another family with ten people sharing cramped conditions. The young girls were not in school and there was a serious risk of sexual violence on the streets. I took their case up directly with the head of the UN in London and we have been working ever since to help the family be reunited in Edinburgh. We have been so close but with Covid and other problems their reunion has been constantly delayed. This month there were tears all round in my office when we heard the news that they had finally arrived in Edinburgh. In fact, we had two good news stories come along in quick succession when a young father who we have been helping, after he was separated from his daughter was finally reunited with her this month when she and her grandparents were able to come to Edinburgh.\nThese are the good news stories, but they have only come about after years of painstaking work by the UN, my team and the City of Edinburgh Council (CEC) who really have done an outstanding job for these families and other Syrian refugees who have come to our capital city.\nBut what of those who still languish in camps in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt? Since the start of the civil war over 5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, 2.5 million of them are children. Their living conditions in camps, informal settlements and urban settings are often dire. UNICEF reports that the children are vulnerable to the risk of psychosocial stress, child labour and domestic and sexual violence. Economic hardship has led some women and girls to resort to negative coping mechanisms such as child and forced marriage. Access to education and healthcare is severely compromised. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated their plight.\nMost of these refugees live below the poverty line and rely on humanitarian aid to meet their basic needs. Yet it is not wealthy countries who are taking responsibility for hosting these people. Instead that responsibility is falling directly on poorer countries in the immediate vicinity of Syria.\nNo one in the SNP Westminster Group and few MPs from other parties have done more to advance the cause of these refugees than my colleague Stuart McDonald MP. Earlier this week he secured a debate in the House of Commons about the plight of Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon. The situation for them is deteriorating yet the British Government are choosing to cut their international aid contribution. Stuart tried to get the UK Government to clarify what will replace the SVPRS and to address the problems that arise from gaps in the family reunion rules and the so-called new plan for immigration. Depriving refugees of safe legal routes to the UK drives them into the hands of people smugglers and the UK Government are focused on pushing the smugglers boats back across the channel rather than tackling the root causes of this evil exploitative trade.\nA new global resettlement scheme has been launched but we know little about its ambition and how many of these refugees it will take. As Stuart argued, if there is no target there is no way of budgeting for the scheme and it is difficult for local authorities such as CEC which have played such a pivotal role to date to plan. As you might expect there were many fine words from the Minister in response to Stuart’s asks but not much by way of clarity. He made much of the fact that in February this year the UK Government reached its target of resettling 20,000 refugees fleeing the Syrian conflict, but he made no promises regarding future targets. Viewed against the figure of over 5.6 million people in exile, 20,000 is a drop in the ocean.\nNearly one fifth of the Syrian refugees who came to the UK under the SVPRS have settled in Scotland. I have met with many who have a positive tale to tell. They have been helped by the Scottish Government’s New Scots Refugee Integration Strategy which “aims to ensure that refugees live in safe and welcoming communities that enable them to rebuild their lives from the day they arrive in Scotland.” The strategy has been endorsed and commended by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.\nBut we must not lose our focus on those left behind. Until independence, the power to afford more of them safe legal routes to the UK and to ensure that they are adequately supported where they are, lies with the British Government. I am sure all SNP MPs will join Stuart in keeping the pressure on. In the past the UK had a proud tradition of welcoming refugees, as this current UK Government seeks to destroy that tradition, it’s incumbent on Scotland to lead the fight back.",

Her sentence together with a fine was court imposed. When she went to receive her punishment, she refused to wear the hijab and was threatened with 74 more lashes. She still refused. As she was lashed, she whispered 'in the name of woman, in the name of life'.\nRoya endured her punishment with the sort of dignity few of us could muster in such circumstances and when she left, she threw off her scarf again. I am shocked her story and incredible bravery has not received wider publicity in the UK.\nWe have all heard the story of another Kurdish Iranian women, Mahsa Amini who died in hospital while in custody in September 2022 having been arrested by the religious morality police for not wearing the hijab. Eyewitnesses reported that she had been severely beaten.\nHer death inspired the Women, Life, Freedom movement the origins of which can be traced back to the Kurdish freedom movement and which now amplifies the voices of Iranian women protesting their oppression. Sadly, there have been many other cases like Mahsa's.\nIn Afghanistan the situation is even worse. Since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, they have issued more than 50 edicts constituting an institutionalised scheme of repression against women. In his March 2023 report, Richard Bennett, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Afghanistan, set out the continuing deterioration in the situation of Afghan women.\nIn mid-November 2022, the authorities banned access of women and girls to parks, gyms and public baths and, on December 21, they announced the immediate suspension of women from universities. Three days later, on December 24, women were barred from working for domestic and international NGOs, with a consequent severe negative impact on the life-saving humanitarian services they provide and which are critical for humanitarian protection and other human rights and development activities. Measures have been taken to erase women from all public spaces.\nBennett concluded that 'the cumulative effect of the Taliban's systematic discrimination against women raises concerns about the commission of international crimes'. And that 'the cumulative effect of the restrictions on women and girls ... was tantamount to gender apartheid'.\nIn his October 2023 report the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran, Professor Javad Rehman, stated that Iranian women and girls are also facing gender apartheid as well as systemic discrimination.\nGender apartheid is not currently recognised as crime in international law. Many think it should be. I am currently part of a cross-party panel at Westminster, supported by the International Bar Association Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI), carrying out an inquiry into the condition of women and girls in Iran and Afghanistan and whether it constitutes gender apartheid.\nThis week we held our first evidence session and a roundtable discussion chaired by Baroness Helena Kennedy KC who is a Labour peer and IBAHRI. Further sessions will be held over the next few weeks with a view to producing a report in the spring.\nAccording to IBAHRI, under international law apartheid is presently defined around the issue of racial oppression as 'inhumane acts - committed in the context of an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime'.\nWhile gender is not covered within this definition, international law covers the crime of gender persecution as a crime against humanity with 'persecution' meaning 'the intentional and severe deprivation of fundamental rights contrary to international law by reason of the identity of the group or collectivity' and 'gender' meaning 'the two sexes, male and female, within the context of society'.\nThe key element in defining gender apartheid, and which sets it apart from gender persecution, is the existence of an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination of one group over another, which the perpetrators seek to maintain by their actions. That is what existed in South Africa where the term apartheid originated.\nIBAHRI set up a forum with South African women and feminists and they indicated that they recognised the same conditions of oppression that were applied to black South Africans are now being applied to women and girls in Iran and Afghanistan. Merely describing what is happening to women in these countries as 'gender persecution' fails to recognise the systemic and societal nature of the discrimination in the same way as describing what occurred in South Africa as racial persecution would have failed to capture the reality of Apartheid.\nKarima Bennoune, the Lewis M Simes Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, defines gender apartheid as 'a system of governance, based on laws and/or policies, which imposes systematic segregation of women and men and may also systematically exclude women from public spaces and spheres'. She argues: 'gender apartheid is anathema to [the] foundational norms of international law, every bit as much as racial apartheid was to the analogous principles prohibiting race discrimination. Ultimately, as racial apartheid was for Black South Africans, gender apartheid is an erasure of the humanity of women. Every aspect of female existence is controlled and scrutinised.'\nBennoune concludes that 'there is no escape from gender apartheid. The solution cannot be the departure of half the population of the country.' In March 2023, a group of Iranian and Afghan legal experts, activists, and women leaders from across the world launched an international campaign 'End Gender Apartheid'. They want to raise awareness about the experiences of women in Iran and Afghanistan living under gender apartheid and to move governments to act, including by expanding the legal definition of apartheid under international and national laws to include gender apartheid.\nIBAHRI argue that as the situation of women and girls is deteriorating in Afghanistan and Iran, and any political 'dialogue' with those in power has not delivered any palpable change, it is crucial to use any means available to fight for these women and girls, their present and their future. They believe the UK should play a lead role in shining light on the experiences of women in Afghanistan and Iran and recognise them as gender apartheid.\nI agree that the UK should be taking a lead here. Our imperial past and the recent shameful letting down of the people of Afghanistan, particularly women and girls, means it is a moral responsibility. It is also important that with all the other horrors occurring internationally, particularly in the Middle East, that we don't forget about the terrible conditions in which the women and girls of Iran and Afghanistan are living.\nBravery like that of Roya Heshmati deserves acknowledgement and support.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_crucial-politicians-respect-rule-of-law/content_268.html": "Boris Johnson shows why it’s crucial our politicians respect rule of law\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 15th Apr 2022\nIt’s been another week of Tories thumbing their nose at the rule of law and getting away with it. Of course, the big news was the fines imposed on the PM and the Chancellor of the Exchequer for breaking their own lockdown laws. The right thing to do would be for them to resign. Particularly as the PM misled parliament with repeated assurances that no rules had been broken. If this was deliberate - and how could it not be – then the ministerial code of conduct states he must resign. But, of course, he won’t.\nInstead, the UK Government has chucked a great big dead cat on the table to try and distract us with the appalling proposal to forcibly fly asylum seekers arriving via the channel 4,000 miles across the world to Rwanda on a one-way ticket. The Home Secretary describes these people as “illegal immigrants’ even though her own figures show that two thirds go on to be granted refugee status by the home office.\nRwanda does not have a good human rights record. Only last year at the UN the UK itself demanded investigations about alleged killings, disappearances, and torture in Rwanda. Is this really an appropriate environment into which we should send vulnerable asylum seekers? It seems that male asylum seekers will be sent to Rwanda regardless of where they have come from so the UK could be deporting traumatised Afghans, Ukrainians, and Uighurs. Is this really what we have come to? What kind of conditions will they be kept in? What happens to them if the Rwandan authorities decide not to accept them after processing?\nMeanwhile all this is going on while parliament is in recess so there can be no proper scrutiny.\nA Tory junior minister was left spluttering on the Today programme yesterday when he was asked why people should stick to legal migration routes when the PM himself has acted outside the law. Why shouldn’t the UK allow refugees who arrive by so-called illegal routes (a concept which doesn’t exist in international law) to say sorry and move on like the PM and his cronies? It’s a good question.\nThe attitude that laws are for the little people is one which is deeply embedded in the Tory party. Earlier in the week Crispin Blunt MP, erstwhile Chair of Westminster’s All Party Parliamentary Group on Global LGBT+ rights, took it upon himself to question the verdict of a jury who had convicted his Tory MP colleague, Imran Ahmad Khan, of sexually assaulting a child. It turned out that Blunt had sat in only on the defence evidence and the summing up, yet he thought he was better placed to reach a verdict than the jury who heard all the evidence. This may sound familiar to viewers in Scotland. It also happened recently in England when Tory MPs questioned the verdict of the jury in the trial of the Colston four who were acquitted of criminal damage by toppling the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston. In what is clearly a politically motivated move the directions given to the jury have now been made the subject of a rare referral to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General, Suella Braverman.\nDid Blunt think it was ok for a middle-aged man to sexually assault a 15-year-old boy? He tried to imply that the conviction was motivated by homophobia. The outcry was immediate and came largely from his colleagues in the LGBT+ rights group. What I and other members of the group found particularly disgusting was that he should somehow invoke LGBT+ rights to trump child safeguarding. He has a history of weaponizing LGBT+ rights in his secret campaigning against women’s rights, but it is even worse to do it to defend someone found guilty of child sex offences.\nWorse still, he seemed to imply that his status as a former justice minister somehow gave him a unique locus to question the verdict. He resigned as Chair of the APPG and he was right to do so. But his position as an MP should also be in question. It is completely inappropriate for members of parliament to attack and undermine the criminal justice process by questioning jury verdicts in this way.\nSadly, Scotland is not without its politicians whose attitude towards the rule of law is also rather casual. Many of my friends in the legal profession were shocked at the high-level political questioning of the jury’s verdicts of acquittal in the Salmond case. But it doesn’t end there. In the past week both Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie have displayed an extraordinary insouciance towards human rights and equality law by seeking to brand women (and yes it was women they were after as usual) who question legislative proposals based on gender identity theory as “transphobic” and akin to “racists” “anti-semites”. Ms Slater wants us banned from the airwaves. Mr Harvie wants us disciplined by our parties.\nBoth of these politicians need to acquaint themselves with Articles 9 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights which protect freedom of belief and freedom of speech in this country. They could also do with reading and understanding the Equality Act and the decision of the Employment Appeal Tribunal in case of Maya Forstater v CGD Europe which established that discrimination, harassment, and victimisation against persons of gender critical belief is unlawful under the Equality Act. While this was an employment law case the prohibition of this sort of discrimination applies to membership organisations, including political parties, in respect of their members. The Green Party of England and Wales is currently being sued by a former leadership candidate for such discrimination. No doubt this is why sensible political parties in Scotland are not pursuing complaints against women merely for holding and expressing such views in the way that Mr Harvie indicated he would like done during a GMS interview yesterday. He and Ms Slater would also do well to take a look at the Public Sector Equality Duty which obliges those in government to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations between different protected characteristics. There is no hierarchy of protected characteristics in this country.\nBut back to Boris, as we must. It seems likely that this week’s fine could be the first of several for the PM because it is clear that there was repeated rule breaking at Downing Street throughout the pandemic. This fine is modest because it is simply for attending an event but if the PM is found to have organised events, for example in his private flat, the fines could be much heftier – up to £10,000. Could he really survive a fine of that level? His own junior justice minister, Lord Wolfson of Tredegar QC, clearly thinks he shouldn’t. His resignation letter got to the heart of the matter and explained why it is so wrong to use the war in Ukraine as an excuse for Johnson staying on. He said:\n“The rule of law is a constitutional principle which, at its root, means that everyone in a state, and indeed the state itself, is subject to the law. …we can only undertake… legal reforms at home – and also credibly defend democratic norms abroad, especially at a time of war in Europe – if we are, and are seen to be, resolutely committed both to the observance of the law and also to the rule of law.”\nHe’s right. The Tories may be the worst offenders but politicians across the UK would do well to remember this. Johnson needs to go. If he doesn’t then the unwritten checks and balances of the British constitution will have failed, irredeemably.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_lineker-attacks-tories/content_303.html": "Gary Lineker wasn't far off the mark with his attacks on the Tories\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 10th Mar 2023\nUniversal Human Rights are under attack in the UK like never before. The Illegal Migration Bill introduced by Suella Braverman in the Commons this week breaches the UK’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). There can be no question about that. Indeed, it is designed to do so. That’s the whole point.\nWhile Suella has slithered and equivocated in parliament and during media interviews about whether the bill is compatible with the ECHR and other international treaties to which the UK is signed up, the bill itself is quite clear. Under s.19 of the Human Rights Act (HRA) the Minister who introduces a bill must make a statement to the effect that its provisions are compatible with ECHR rights or, that he or she is unable to do so but wishes nevertheless to proceed. Suella has chosen the latter option and that is written on the first page of the bill.\nThe UK Government accepts that the bill may breach the right to life, the right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, the right to be free from slavery and human trafficking, the right to liberty, the right to a fair trial, the right to a family and private life, the right not to be discriminated against and the right to a remedy. The United Nations High Commission on Refugees has also said that the bill clearly breaches the Refugee Convention to which the UK is also a party. Clause 1(5) of the bill states that courts in the UK are not required to interpret the bill in a way that is compatible with the ECHR rights. This potentially itself is a breach of the Convention and a big departure from the terms of the HRA. Further provisions of the bill echo legislation passed by Russia in 2015 limiting the availability and applicability of ECHR rights. Shamefully it was widely thought at the time that they had been encouraged to do so by toxic anti-Strasbourg rhetoric emanating from the UK.\nSo, what's going on here? Well in my view and many others it's quite simple really and astonishingly cynical. It is widely believed that the Tories plan to clash with the European Court of Human Rights and then to fight the next election on the platform of withdrawing from the ECHR. They will tell voters that the problems posed by tens of thousands of asylum seekers entering the UK cannot be solved without doing this. It’s a desperate last throw of the dice to stave off a General Election defeat by Labour by weaponising the fears that both parties have stoked over “illegal” migration and ‘invasions”.\nHaving equivocated for years and failed to put clear blue water between themselves and the Tories, Labour will find it hard to stave off this attack. Hell mend them. How we treat those seeking sanctuary is the measure of who we are as a nation. Once we start to create classes of people to whom human rights don’t apply, we are on a slippery slope to becoming the sort of state that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ECHR were designed to protect against in the aftermath of the Second World War. The much-maligned Gary Lineker wasn’t far off the mark in what he said this week and the attacks on his right to do so, as a sporting pundit, are rank hypocrisy especially as they come from right wingers who so often claim to be guardians of free speech.\nIn Scotland the position is very different. While there have been some rather silly attempts to suggest otherwise it is quite clear from the statements of all three candidates for the SNP leadership at the hustings that they support universal Human Rights. No one is suggesting that any rights be rolled back. No one is suggesting the repeal or radical amendment of the Human Rights Act or the Equality Act. Humza has promised to enshrine LGBT rights in the constitution of an independent Scotland. Quite right too. Indeed, it is what the party promised in 2014 when Nicola Sturgeon’s proposals for the transitional constitution of an independent Scotland enshrined all the protected characteristics of the Equality Act; sex, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, disability, age, race, religion or belief, marriage and civil partnership and pregnancy and maternity. Nicola was also clear that the transitional constitution for an independent Scotland would incorporate the ECHR. I know Ash, Kate and Humza will support the full delivery of these promises.\nMost Scots are fully behind the ECHR. It was written into the Scotland Act embodying the devolved settlement which 75% of voters signed up to back in 1997. And this week, Humza has reiterated the Scottish Government’s existing plans to create a Human Rights Bill that will incorporate four United Nations Human Rights treaties into Scots Law, at least in so far as the devolved competences are concerned. The four United Nations Human Rights treaties concerned are the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Work is still ongoing to incorporate the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child into Scots law.\nHowever, we must not be complacent. If the UK leaves the ECHR before Scotland regains her independence, then we will be out of it as well and the devolved parliament would not have the competence to incorporate the ECHR back into Scots law nor any other international treaty the UK looks like leaving. The UK is the state party to these treaties. Without statehood Scotland cannot sign up. International relations are a reserved matter and so if the UK withdraws from a treaty such as the ECHR, our devolved parliament does not have the power to re-incorporate it even just for devolved matters.\nDuring the Brexit debacle some people spent a lot of time promising Scotland would not be taken out of the EU against our will. But it happened because the devolved parliament did not have the power to stop it and nor did Scotland’s MPs as we are always outvoted by English interests. The same could well happen with the ECHR. This does not mean that the Scottish Government and MPs must not fight this as best we can. The position which the SNP and the Scottish Government take will be noted abroad amongst the countries whose recognition we seek once we have regained our independence. However, it will be vital not to lose sight of the fact that the only way we can guarantee the continued availability of ECHR rights and those of other important international conventions to everyone in Scotland is by becoming an independent nation. That is the main goal of the SNP and this latest attack on human rights is one very important reason why we must be certain our next leader has a plan to advance that goal.",

The past fortnight feels like an eternity.\nTwo weeks ago, the SNP leadership produced an 11-point plan conceding the need for a plan B if the British Government continue to refuse a section 30 order and embracing the legal route for which I have long advocated. I cannot pretend I’m completely satisfied with the detail of the plan but it’s a step in the right direction.\nOne week ago, the Justice Secretary introduced an amendment to the Hate Crime Bill to address concerns raised by a wide range of civic society bodies, MSPs and others. The amendment was designed to ensure that women who wish to discuss women’s sex-based rights would be protected from charges of transphobic hate crime. This seemed reasonable in a democracy bound by the duty to protect free speech under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nBut this week the Justice Secretary withdrew his amendment after (unsubstantiated) allegations of transphobia, and I found myself summarily dismissed from the position of SNP Spokesperson on Justice and Home Affairs. I got 30 minutes notice of the announcement, no proper explanation of why I was being sacked and no acknowledgment of, or any thanks at all for, the work I have done in that role over the last five and a half years. Indeed, the press release announcing the reshuffle was a masterly piece of Stalinist revisionism in which I was not even mentioned. Air brushed from history. A non-person. Sounds familiar?\nIt is not sensible to take people for fools and of course what happened was not swept under the carpet as some had hoped. Whilst I am alarmed by the reports of mass resignations from the party as a result of my treatment, I have also been overwhelmed by messages of support from party members, constituents, members of the public and cross-party colleagues. I could have done without the tsunami of abuse on social media and the threats of rape etc, but when a target has been painted on the back of a female politician this is to be expected and the police have been very helpful.\nI want to thank all those who have sent kind messages and expressions of concern for my wellbeing and to reassure them that I have developed a pretty thick skin and I have a loving partner, family and friends and great staff which really helps. This is not the first time I have required help from the police or indeed faced going to court to give evidence against men who have threatened me in the course of my employment as an MP. However, it’s pretty upsetting when the threats and abuse come from within your own party and those in authority refuse to condemn them. That said, I am comforted by the fact a man has been arrested and charged. I am constrained in what I can say about the case for now but suffice to say that when the full story becomes public it will make very uncomfortable reading for some.\nAs to the internal politics of the SNP what is now in the public domain is the tip of the iceberg of behaviour which I and others have had to put up with for years. I really do understand why people say – ‘sort this out in private, it’s harming the cause’, but please be aware there is no internal way to properly discuss policy or strategy and there is no functioning link between MPs and the leadership. I know people were shocked that I first saw the 11-point plan on a Saturday morning in the National like everyone else, but that is how things are. And at least we now have a pretty good idea of what you can and cannot do under the current SNP leadership and keep your position.\nIt’s fine to publicly call women, including survivors of sex abuse and your constituents, “Jeremy Hunts” when they write to you with concerns about self-identification of gender. In fact, you will be lauded and retweeted by the party’s official social media account.\nIf you are part of the party’s old guard and male, it’s fine to publicly rubbish the party’s conference backed policy on Brexit and a second EU poll and to defy the whip repeatedly. You won’t be disciplined in fact you will be promoted.\nIt’s fine for staff employed by the party and the Westminster Group to conduct a vendetta against a sitting MP to the extent of disrupting a National Assembly event.\nIt’s fine for a parliamentarian to repeatedly tweet and retweet unfounded allegations about a colleague leading to a tsunami of abuse culminating in threats of sexual violence. If you complain you are the problem.\nAnd it’s fine to refuse to give evidence to a committee of the Scottish parliament and to remain in post whilst members of that inquiry call for you to be investigated for perjury.\nAll that is fine. Behaviour without consequences. Behaviour which if not actually encouraged is given tacit approval.\nBut it is not fine to advocate for a policy which the party leadership then adopts and to congratulate a Cabinet Secretary on the government’s own amendment to a controversial bill. And it is not fine to get yourself elected to the NEC with a mandate of more votes than all the other candidates put together. As one Glasgow Councillor informed her twitter followers – people have been elected to the NEC who shouldn’t have been. And I don’t think she was trying to be funny.\nThere is a lesson to be learned from the backlash to my sacking - when you don’t speak to anyone and try to suppress discussion people will find public forums to ventilate ideas. And attempts to intimidate or smear those who want to debate policy don’t make the party stronger. The party is left weaker, when other opinions are not sought, and ideas are not tested.\nNotwithstanding what has occurred I shall continue to do my job as a constituency MP and as an elected member of the SNP NEC. I love the former. I can’t say I enjoy the latter much at the moment, but it’s made a little easier by the presence of such morally upright people as Roger Mullin and some fantastic feminist sisters.\nAnd it's not all been bad news for me this week. I hope soon to be able to make some exciting announcements about how I will use the time freed up by the removal of my front bench duties. On the NEC I will continue to work with fellow elected members to try to ensure that the party adheres to its constitution and does the necessary policy and strategic work to prepare us for independence.\nWe cannot ‘wheesht for Indy’ much as we might want to. As a party and a movement we must address policy issues and do the heavy lifting needed to counter the arguments against independence and to prepare for the transition to a new state. No debate is not an option, if we cannot test ideas together in a civilised fashion we cannot possibly hope to persuade others.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_boris-devolution-and-indy-plan-for-scotland/content_57.html": "Ignore bumbling Boris Johnson, we need a concrete indy plan NOW\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 20th Nov 2020\nNever interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake. It’s a good maxim. Boris Johnson and his hapless Scottish Tory chums have spent the week digging themselves into a big hole over devolution. Even the Speaker had had enough when he finally corrected Boris Johnson this week for his sly and recurrent misrepresentation of the SNP party name.\nMeanwhile Gordon Brown made another one of his increasingly tedious and irrelevant interventions about federalism. Most realists know there is not a hope in hell of this ever being delivered and it is quite understandable that many question whether these contributions are at all genuine given the lack of effort put into delivering what he promised so vigorously in 2014.\nTwo good things have come out of Boris Johnson’s outburst. First it is now crystal clear (if it wasn’t already) that expecting any more powers for Holyrood from his government is pie in the sky and not something that focus should be wasted on by any political party in Scotland. Secondly, while the Tories tie themselves in knots trying to get out of the consequences of what their leader has said, the SNP have time to reflect on what we do with the impressive poll leads which Mr Johnson is helping us achieve.\nThe wider independence movement, like my colleagues in the Westminster group, are brimming with ideas. This was clear from the readout of the AUOB event last weekend at which it was good to hear Ian Blackford embrace the need for the SNP to work with the wider movement.\nHow we do this needs work and we need to see concrete moves by the party now to put this commitment into practice. No political party is perfect, but the SNP is the best vehicle to deliver independence. We are a formidable campaigning machine with a very well-respected leader and, according to the polls, the confidence of around half the electorate in the country. This is almost unprecedented across Europe, particularly after 13 years in Government.\nThe SNP is the political wing of the Yes movement. You don’t need to like or agree with all our policies to support us although I would encourage people to join the party, become active and help us move those policies forward to the sort of radical agenda the wider Independence movement wants. I can assure you that many of us within the party share your views.\nThe SNP has a leadership role to play and with that leadership role comes great responsibility particularly for the policies and the strategy that will win our independence. On policy, it is time to expedite publication of the “New Scotland’ policy papers promised by the FM on 31 January. These will provide the information and answers people want on how Scotland can make the transition from a Yes vote to becoming an independent country.\nI absolutely understand why work on these was paused to allow focus on the Covid crisis but if we are to have an independence referendum soon, they are needed.\nOn strategy, I was disappointed by the decision to refuse the conference motion amendment based on my suggestion that the party set up a working group under the auspices of the NEC to consider all democratic and legitimate routes to a second independence vote. The decision seems particularly bizarre in the light of the polling published this week suggesting that two thirds of voters want a fall-back strategy for indyref2 if a section 30 order is refused.\nBut all is not lost. I know my suggestion has the support of senior figures in the party and it is to be hoped it can be progressed by the new NEC that will be elected at conference. The discussion which I and others wanted to take place at conference will instead happen at a national assembly in January. How we take forward the product of that assembly will be vital, and this is what the working group set up under the democratic auspices of the new NEC could do.\nI hope those elected to NEC and other roles at conference will in future be more careful guardians of the party’s constitution and its guarantee of ordinary members close involvement in framing the resolutions for conference. There is no point in me and others banging on about the importance of the rule of law if the party itself does not abide by its own constitution in relation to its internal workings.\nLikewise if it is right to call for transparency and accountability in government then it is right to call for it in the governance of our party as so many of the candidates for NEC and other roles in the party are now doing. In this connection it is surely time to lance the boil of the botched investigation into harassment allegations made against our former leader. It is very important for the confidence of future complainers that we get to the bottom of what went wrong here. As elsewhere in public life there must be a proper process for those who wish to make complaints, a process which supports them to do so but which is also procedurally fair and without bias.\nWe also need to know what led to so much public money being wasted on defending a fatally flawed system. Having worked in the courts for years I have found the attitude of some of the inquiry’s witnesses towards their oath or affirmation to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth curious to say the least. Things would be very different at a judge led inquiry.\nIf indeed there has been no cover up or conspiracy let’s get what happened out in the open and move on. If there are consequences for individuals in the civil service or indeed elsewhere, then so be it. Matters need to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion or Scotland’s reputation for probity in public life and our party’s cause of independence could be damaged.\nSo while our enemies seem doomed to repeat the same mistakes, let the SNP use our time wisely so that we can play, to the very best of our ability, the leadership role in the Independence movement which has been earned for our party by years of hard work.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_party-democracy-in-snp-is-at-stake-when-we-meet-for-conference/content_201.html": "Party democracy in SNP is at stake when we meet for conference\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Aug 2023\nRecently I sat down to write a short speech about why I support Scottish independence. It struck me that it was some time since I had last done this. It was the sort of thing I did day in, day out this time nine years ago at the height of the indyref campaign. However, in recent years, the focus has been rather more on the how than the why of independence.\nMy speech was for the opening night of The Ayes Have It at the Edinburgh Fringe which went on to debate independence again on several evenings, offering the opportunity for local school students as well as politicians to go through their paces on the issue that still dominates our political debate. It was hugely enjoyable but also a timely reminder that it is possible to debate contentious issues rigorously while maintaining good humour and respect. But what I found most useful was being forced to sit down afresh and apply my mind to the essentials of the issue that brought me into politics.\nScotland is a nation with incredible potential yet when you compare Scotland’s performance within the UK to that of other comparable independent European countries, we are lagging far behind. Why? Because all these countries have significantly more economic policy autonomy than Scotland and a much greater ability to tailor policies to their own specific circumstances. In all the great policy challenges we face today – climate change, the cost of living and the energy crisis – Westminster is not up to the challenge. The Tories are, well, the Tories, and Labour are so afraid of their own shadow they are incapable of offering meaningful change.\nScotland needs independence to be able to tackle these crucial challenges in a way that benefits all our citizens. Independence must be linked to the issues which are foremost in the public’s minds if we are to advance our cause. We need a vision of a different Scotland. But such a vision must be fleshed out and backed up with a coherent and cohesive policy programme. I would like to see the SNP adopt a Green New Deal and go into the next Holyrood election with a package of measures to be delivered over a period of years as we make the transition from devolution to independence. The Common Weal think and do tank has done a power of work in this area and you can access materials about what a Green New Deal would mean for Scotland on its website.\nAt the Ayes Have It debate, the focus was on the why rather than the how of independence. But the how is something that still requires to be ironed out and the place for the SNP to do this is at our conference in October. The provisional agenda for 2023 Annual Conference is due to be published on Tuesday.August 22. I am aware of and have lent my support to resolutions submitted with the support of branches and parliamentarians that would provide a vehicle to debate our independence strategy. But here’s the thing – we cannot treat the issue of independence delivery as just one more resolution on the agenda with only 30 minutes or so for debate.\nWe were supposed to have a whole day of debate devoted to this at the cancelled special conference in March. The Dundee event in June was no substitute for this as there was no structure to such debate as occurred, no resolutions and no voting.\nAccordingly, with a General Election next year, this conference agenda should set aside a considerable chunk of time to have the debate we did not have in March and to finalise our policy position. Conference is the supreme policy-making body of our party and it is the right place to finalise our strategy.\nThere is also the issue of the SNP Governance and Transparency Review. When it was established, earlier this year, it had a clear endpoint – the 2023 Annual Conference in October. Members assumed that they would be able to then move on with some concrete proposals to vote on in order to achieve the much-promised improved governance and transparency. However, I now understand that there will be no votes as such at the October conference on any reforms to be recommended by the review and that the governance regime of the previous leadership is to drag on to an as yet undetermined date in 2024. I have been speaking to SNP branches and members over the summer and I know many are not at all happy about this.\nThe SNP Trade Union Group is by far the largest affiliated organisation of the SNP, and I am proud to be one of 10 MPs and MSPs sponsoring an event to be hosted by it which was initially prompted by concerns about the rather tight schedule for the submission of conference resolutions. The event will take place in a week’s time on Saturday, August 26, in the Renfield St Stephens Centre in Glasgow. It will discuss what has been tabled at annual conference in relation to the Governance and Transparency Review and whatever motions appear on the conference order paper relating to future independence strategy. The event is open to all SNP members and registration is free although a donation of at least £5 would be appreciated. It will afford members the opportunity to further amend whatever proposals are to be considered at National Conference and will be an exemplar of the sort of standard party-political participatory democracy to which I would like to see the SNP as a whole return.\nThe aftermath of Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation has underlined what some of us have argued for some time. The SNP need to review our independence strategy, our governance, internal party democracy and our policy programme. The membership through the democratic structures of conference must have the last word on all these matters. The restoration of party democracy must happen at the October conference. If you are a member, what are your branch going to do about it?\nIt’s up to all of us to make sure that this can is not kicked any further down the road.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_negotiations-progress-with-eu/content_282.html": "Brexit on despite coronavirus ... still we're ignored\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 01st May 2020\nIt is not surprising that during the Covid crisis Brexit and the progress of the UK negotiations with the EU have gone off the radar for most people. Fortunately, now that the Westminster parliament is sitting again, it is becoming more difficult for the UK Government and their Chief Negotiator, David Frost, to evade scrutiny.\nOn Monday the Select Committee on the Future Relationship with the European Union (formerly the Brexit select committee) sat remotely to take evidence from Michael Gove to try to make sense of the Government’s position. It would seem that information is still thin on the ground, with the Scottish Government, in particular, being left in the dark.\nIt seems an age since the UK finally exited the EU on 31st January, and we are now well into the transition period which ends on 31st December this year. During this period the UK remains part of the single market and customs union but as a third country, rather than a member state with voting rights, while the Future Trade relationship between the UK and the EU is negotiated.\nNormally, Free Trade agreements (FTAs) between the EU and third countries take years to negotiate. The UK has given itself only a few months. Some argue the negotiations should be easy as we are starting from a point of alignment, however, whereas FTAs are normally about creating convergence, the British Government have made it clear that they wish to diverge as much as possible.\nSince then, crisis negotiations have proceeded by video conferencing in compliance with social distancing measures. Progress has unfortunately been slow. According to Michel Barnier, the UK does not want to commit seriously on a number of fundamental points.\nIt is hard to see how an agreement can be reached by the deadline. However, the UK Government have been adamant that they won’t request an extension and that they are prepared to leave the single market and customs union without any agreement.\nIt would seem that as far as the UK Government are concerned, it's full steam ahead to the iceberg regardless of the Corona Crisis, except of course when it comes to keeping the devolved governments in the loop. This is unacceptable for many reasons, not least because some of the most problematic areas which are currently under discussion, for example, fisheries and the so-called “level playing field”, are of huge importance to the Scottish economy and yet we are afforded no consultation or involvement.\nThe Joint Ministerial Committee for EU Negotiations is supposed to be a forum which brings together Ministers from the UK and devolved governments, but it has not met since 28 January, despite the best efforts of Mike Russell and his Welsh Government counterpart. Michael Gove was at his most slippery when questioned over this deliberate obstruction, arguing that he has spoken with Scottish Government ministers regularly during the Covid crisis. However, the point is that he has not spoken to them about progress on negotiations with the EU. When pinned down on this matter, he said there will be a formal meeting with the next two weeks. We shall see.\nAll of this holds crucial lessons for the SNP and the Independence movement.\nThroughout Monday’s evidence, Gove complained that the EU seems unable to understand that the UK is now “an independent sovereign nation” and must be treated as such. When Scotland finally votes to take back control it will be useful to remind him or whoever we are negotiating with how important it is that Scotland’s sovereignty is respected.\nThere are other more immediate lessons.\nDespite the Coronavirus crisis the UK Government aren’t holding back from progressing their Brexit agenda for which they constantly remind us they have the mandate of the British people. It doesn’t matter to them that that doesn’t include the Scots and it won’t ever matter to them unless we make it matter by asserting the mandate which we hold.\nNext time the Scottish Tories say that continuing to talk about independence is irresponsible during the current crisis they should be forcefully reminded that their London bosses haven’t let the current crisis stop them from pursuing the constitutional agenda for which they have a mandate. What’s sauce for the goose…\nThe SNP and the Independence movement must not be bullied or indeed flattered into stopping talking about independence.\nRobin McAlpine has argued with some passion that there are many things about the current crisis that make it all the more important that we keep discussing and working towards the very different Scotland that the YES movement holds dear to its heart. He makes the point that smaller nations or decentralised ones like Germany have handled the current crisis much better than larger nations. To that, I would add those who listened to the World Health Organisation mantra of test, trace, isolate rather than insisting on their own exceptionalism.\nIn this newspaper earlier this week, George Kerevan wrote that the imminent likelihood of Scotland exiting the single market under disastrous World Trade Organisation rules should, if anything, be a clarion call to reboot the independence referendum campaign. He is right.\nThe aftermath of the current crisis will be a time not just for fine words but for translating our aspirations for a greener and fairer economy into reality. Who really thinks that is likely to happen while we are still tethered to the UK?",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_uk-government-drowning-refugees/content_17.html": "The UK Government must not pass the buck on drowning refugees\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Nov 2022\nI make no apology for writing about asylum seekers for the third week in a row. They really are amongst the most marginalised and disadvantaged groups in our society, and, if Suella Braverman has her way, their situation will only get worse. But this week brought to light some truly horrifying information about the circumstances surrounding multiple deaths by drowning in the English Channel almost a year ago and I am shocked, but not, I am afraid, surprised, that it has not had more coverage.\nOn the night of 23rd/24th November last year 34 migrants set off from near Dunkirk to cross the channel on a small dinghy provided by people smugglers. The group included women and children. Many of them were Kurdish. People leave Kurdistan in Iraq to start a new life in the UK for many reasons including economic as well as security and political issues. I have called these people migrants. Some of them may have been refugees. Some of them, including one of the two survivors, a Somalian, were certainly asylum seekers. But whatever they were they were human beings, and it is important to understand that just because migrants may not have fled persecution, that does not mean that aren’t entitled to have their human rights protected like the rest of us. That includes the right to life. By the afternoon of the following day 27 of the group had drowned. Five are still missing. Only two survived.\nUp until now the position of the UK Government has been that the tragedy happened in French waters. A documentary shown on ITV on Monday night, called ‘The Crossing’ suggests that is not the case and reveals disturbing information about what happened in the hours between the boat first getting into difficulty and one of the two survivors, Issa Mohammed, being picked out of the water at around 2pm on 24th November. The documentary is based on his testimony, that of relatives of the deceased, the logs of the French coastguard and a report from a marine expert who has reconstructed what occurred using information about the currents, tides, the wind, and phone records.\nIssa recalls that once the boat got into difficulty at least 8 different passengers made emergency calls from their phones. The records of the French coastguard show the French rescue services asking for a position then transmitting the information to a UK rescue team. The French police told the passengers they were in UK waters. Thereafter it appears the French and British argued amongst themselves about who should rescue the dinghy. The expert report estimates that the dinghy was about half a mile from the UK border when it got into initial difficulty and that by 4am it was well inside British waters. At 4:16am there is a call to say people are in the water and drowning. According to the expert this should have triggered a large-scale response immediately. The channel is one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world and that night there were many boats in the vicinity who could have got to the dinghy if a Mayday call had been sent out. That did not happen although it appears a UK rescue boat and helicopter were sent out but could not find the dinghy.\nIssa remember the moment the dinghy capsized. It was overcrowded and had been letting in water for some time. The water was very cold. People were drowning and screaming “like children.” When day broke eight people were still alive. Over the next nine hours he watched them die one by one. He swam and was picked up by a fishing boat at about 2pm. Twelve hours after the first distress call the French coastguard posted a Mayday.\nOne is left with the uncomfortable feeling that had it been another type of boat with another type of passenger the response would have been very different. Subsequent events reinforce this impression. The normal political response to a loss of life so large in UK waters or indeed on land would be to hold an independent public inquiry. Typically, one would expect this to be announced almost immediately but nearly a year has passed and there has been no such announcement. This is perhaps because it is still the official position of the UK Government that the boat sank in French waters. The UK Home Office in contrast with the French authorities are refusing to share any information.\nThe documentary maker sent me an advance embargoed copy and I was so shocked by it I decided to take the case up in parliament. My research reveals that solicitors acting for the families of some of the deceased and one of the survivors sent their evidence about what happened to the British Government in March this year. I put all of this to the junior home office minister for immigration in parliament on Wednesday. Then I asked him to tell me what it is about the people who drowned that means that no independent public inquiry has been announced into the circumstances of their drowning?\nOf course, he did not answer the question. Instead, he said that 98% of boats that attempt the crossing and pass the median line are helped ashore by Border Force, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution or the Royal Navy and paid tribute to the British authorities. He said they cannot secure the passage of everyone who chooses to get in an unsafe dinghy at the behest of people traffickers and cross the channel. The best advice is, “Do not make that dangerous passage. It is illegal and extremely perilous.” All of that is as maybe but the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea creates an obligation to rescue anyone in danger at sea. Article 98 obliges states to require all masters of a ship to help anyone in danger at sea, so long as it does not also cause serious danger to the rescuing ship. It seems that this obligation was not honoured here by either the French or the British and, whatever the legal position, the morality of what occurred is deeply troubling.\nI intend to continue raising this case in parliament. A friend who has worked with refugees in the Greek islands tells me that this sort of passing the buck about the safety of refugees in the seas between Greece and Turkey happens all the time. I would not want that to be the case here.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_endangering-uks-constitutional-system-of-checks-and-balances/content_260.html": "Boris Johnson is endangering the UK's constitutional system of checks and balances\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 22nd Apr 2022\nI’m writing this column in my office in Westminster listening to the debate on whether to refer the Prime Minister to the Committee of Privileges to consider whether his recent conduct over the partygate saga amounts to a contempt of the Parliament. By the time you read this we will know the outcome. It does rather look like the Tories are deserting a sinking ship and so it will be passed. They’ve already dropped the amendment they had designed to try and kick the can down the road.\nI sat in the chamber during Ian Blackford’s speech and the Speaker made it clear he wanted to confine the debate to the immediate issue of whether the PM mislead the house in relation to the partygate saga and that he didn’t want to hear about the PM’s misconduct on other occasions. Far be it from me to question a ruling of the Speaker, but it did mean I had to put the speech I had written in the bin. There are good reasons for not generally being allowed to call other MPs a liar but I think the public are pretty fed up with a House of Commons where these social niceties constrain what we can say about what is blindingly obvious to everyone else. To be hamstrung in this manner made it pointless for me to try to speak in the debate. What follows is what I would have said had it been permissible.\nThe sorry saga of partygate is not the first time this PM has been found to have acted unlawfully and to have the misled the House of Commons. If we don’t act now he will do so again and again. Back in October 2019 when the PM was the leader of a minority government, he pulled the wool over the eyes of his own Cabinet and Her Majesty the Queen to shut down parliament so that he could stop it from scrutinising the almighty mess he was making of conducting the Brexit negotiations.\nFortunately, because of the legal action taken by me and other parliamentarians, the Inner House of the Court of Session saw through his bluster and concluded that his advice to the Queen had been “motivated by the improper purpose of stymying parliament”. The UK Supreme Court agreed with Scotland’s highest court that the prorogation had been unlawful, and parliament reconvened.\nWhat greater contempt of parliament could there be than to shut it down unlawfully? Yet when parliament resumed it failed to hold the PM to account for his actions and to remove him from office. We are now living with the consequences of that failure to act. Throughout the unlawful prorogation the PM’s behaviour was wholly lacking in integrity. He lied to MPs, including his own cabinet, about the reasons for the prorogation and he misled the Queen. He was forced to give documents to the Scottish court, which showed disdain for parliamentary democracy and a desire to lay a false trail as to the real reasons for the prorogation.\nNo doubt that is why during the proceedings he refused to swear a written statement on oath in support of his position and why no other minister was prepared to do so either. Then, as now, Boris Johnson doesn’t much fancy the chances of a court swallowing his lies. I imagine that’s why he paid the fixed penalty notice even though he now claims that he did not think he was breaking any Covid rules because the gathering that he has been fined for, so far, was covered by the workplace exemption. If he really thought that excuse would fly, why not refuse to pay the fine and set out his defence in court? I reckon he did not do so because he was afraid of his record to date in the courts of both Scotland and England. Judges and juries, like the voting public, tend to have a pretty good handle on issues of credibility and reliability.\nUnfortunately, parliament to date has been rather more forgiving. The failure of parliament to hold him to account for the unlawful prorogation has meant he has been able to continue with his lies and cavalier attitude to the law. Rather than a contrite response to the Supreme Court’s judgment we saw a combative one laced with denial. Over time this has been followed by repeated attacks on the legal profession, the judiciary and now proposals to restrict the right to judicial review of government actions and to render the Human Rights Act toothless and useless.\nWe have also seen a slew of legislation designed to curtail the rights of people resident in the UK and those who seek asylum or refuge here, legislation which breaches the European Convention on Human Rights and other international obligations such as the refugee convention. Just look at the Police Bill, the Nationality and Borders Bill and now the egregious proposals to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, currently a dictatorship with a terrible record on human rights.\nThe high watermark of all this illegality was the Internal Market Bill which the PM’s Northern Ireland Secretary of State admitted was designed to break international law “in a very specific and limited way.” It led to the resignation of the Advocate General, Richard Keen QC and the Permanent Secretary of the Government’s legal department Jonathan Jones and to the trashing of the UK’s reputation in Europe and beyond.\nThe problem of illegality is systemic in this UK government, and it comes from the man at the top. Whether Westminster can do anything about this is perhaps the most important test of the robustness and efficacy of the checks and balances in the British constitution that we will see in our lifetime. If the Tories keep this PM in office without a proper and public assessment of whether parliament was misled, if they do so for party political reasons and if they ignore the Ministerial Code, then it means that any party with a big majority is effectively an elected dictatorship, and the British constitution means little or nothing. These are not my words but those of the respected political commentator Robert Peston. We have a PM in office who not only has been found to have acted unlawfully by the UK Supreme Court but also found to have breached laws which he himself made. It is clear to any reasonable person that he also lied to parliament to cover this up. If he does not suffer consequences for this, then British democracy is broken beyond repair.\nThe Constitution of the UK in its uncodified form cannot be an invisible rope behind which polite people dutifully queue, simply because it is the expected and respectable thing to do. The boundary is being tested and the PM is showing that if you have no respect and no honour the rope does not exist, and you can push your way right through. This is no way to run a country, the UK constitution’s checks and balances are in danger of becoming performative rather than providing an actual stop on executive power.\nThe problems in the British state are acute and reinforce my belief that Scotland should be an independent country with a written constitution. However, for now Scotland is part of this union and elects MPs to Westminster. Our constituents are disgusted by the way this PM carries on. He is bringing the UK into disrepute. Parliament needs to act.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_protection-from-prejudice-must-be-for-everybody-not-just-politicians/content_51.html": "Protection from prejudice must be for everybody, not just politicians\n- First published in : Visit Website\nThere was plenty to welcome in this week’s Programme for Government. I applaud the recognition of the need for state support to boost green industries and create new jobs as has been done in the USA. It is also good to see land reform back on the agenda. And I particularly welcome the commitments to continuing action on disability rights and drug deaths and increasing the pay of social care workers in direct care roles. I have seen at first-hand how hard these people work and how important their contribution is to our society. We must work towards giving them a wage which recognises their increasingly vital contribution to caring for our ageing population.\nBut what I like most of all is the First Minister’s focus on supporting women, his recognition that women are disproportionately affected by the pressures of modern life and the measures he announced to address this including expanding childcare. I was also delighted to hear the FM speak out against misogyny, and against the harassment and the violence to which women are subjected too often in our society.\nI am not convinced that legislating to criminalise misogyny is the way to go. Great care would require to be taken that any legislation did not run counter to the free speech protections in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act (HRA). That said, a bill on misogyny, although problematic, would at least allow the issue to be properly explored in the Scottish parliament. However, I would prefer to see the Scottish Government legislate to make sure that the law recognises that women can be as vulnerable to offending behaviour motivated by prejudice as the other groups protected under Part 1 of Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act which consolidated existing law in this area. Not taking the opportunity to protect women from crimes aggravated by prejudice has sent out the wrong signal. It really cannot be right that a male cabinet secretary is better protected from hate crime than an ordinary working-class woman. The police lost no time in arresting and charging someone for allegedly shouting “deviant” at Patrick Harvie while the young men who displayed disgusting signs advocating extreme violence against women at a rally in Glasgow earlier this year have seemed very hard to track down despite their photographs being plastered across the media after unwitting politicians were photographed standing in front of them.\nEven worse, a middle-aged woman taking part in a peaceful demonstration in Aberdeen in July was attacked and punched in the face by a man trying to steal her banner. Rather than charging him with assault the police let him off with a warning. So much for zero tolerance of violence against women. Again, the contrast in the treatment of the perpetrator of this attack and the perpetrator of the alleged verbal assault on Patrick Harvie is quite striking.\nFeminist groups have written to Police Scotland expressing their concern about the police decision merely to issue a warning where a woman was injured while exercising her right to free speech. They have yet to receive a response. A similar letter to the Lord Advocate elicited a response from a Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal service official which failed to address most of the points raised.\nSection 6 of the Human Rights Act states that “It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention Right.” Article 10 of the ECHR protects freedom of expression. Article 11 includes protection for freedom of assembly. The Equality and Human Rights Commission have said that the HRA requires all public bodies including the police to respect and protect the human rights of all. How seriously the police take assaults on women meeting peacefully to discuss and assert their lawful beliefs will affect how their rights under Article 10 and 11 can safely be exercised. It seems to me that the police failed to properly fulfil their HRA duties in the way they dealt with the Aberdeen case and that the guidance they are following may not be human rights compliant. I would like to see our existing laws against violence against women properly enforced and the human rights of women put front and centre of government policy and by all public bodies. The lackadaisical approach to the violence and the threat of it against women described above is not confined to Scotland. In England a violent criminal was recently acquitted on charges of inciting violence against women despite video evidence.\n“At the Trans+Pride rally in London on 8th July, Sarah Jane (formerly Alan) Baker, who served 30 years in prison for crimes, including kidnapping, torture, and attempted murder, told the crowd: “If you see a TERF, punch them in the f**king face.” This incitement, and the response of the whooping, cheering crowd, were captured on film.\n“TERF” stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist. It is a slur often accompanied by misogynistic and sexualised threats. It is used against women who recognise the fact that men commit violence at greater rates than women, and that men cannot become women by changing their name, clothing, or parts of their anatomy. This belief is also termed “gender critical”.\nInitially, the Metropolitan Police brushed off women’s complaints about Baker’s threatening words. Only after multiple complaints from women and a public outcry did they arrest Baker. Despite his history of extreme violence and the evidence captured on video, the court accepted his explanation that his words were a “joke”, merely intended to get him some publicity and newspaper headlines.” As a result of this travesty feminists in England have written a public letter to the PM asking him to act against the escalating threats and campaign of intimidation against women and to reform a criminal justice system that is failing women. So far, the letter has gathered over 10,000 signatures. You can read the letter from which I have quoted above here https://sex-matters.org/posts/updates/prime-minister-will-you-stand-up-to-violence-against-women/.\nI would like to see our FM take similar action and what he said in his Programme for Government speech gives me hope that he will. I would also like to see all our political leaders and political parties lead by example by having policies of zero tolerance of misogyny. Party members and staffers should not be able to bully, abuse or threaten women on social media or elsewhere without disciplinary action.\nFinally, a word to male readers who may fear that their rights could be overlooked. Of course, I recognise that not all men are part of the sort of toxic masculinity described above. The FM spoke about how positive masculinity can help us all to build healthier relationships and lead to better mental health and wellbeing for men and boys. I am acutely aware of the pressures that men, young and old, face in our society. In order to understand this better I spent time this summer with men from Andy’s Men’s Club and the Men’s Shed movement learning about how men are getting together to offer each other peer support. The FM has promised new Human Rights legislation in Scotland. We should always remember that human rights are universal and must be available to everyone.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_joanna-cherry-a-tale-of-two-unions/content_75.html": "Joanna Cherry: A tale of two unions\nWe're told that Theresa May wants to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement, and with all eyes understandably on Ireland, I am asking: what about Scotland?\nThis article originally appeared on openDemocracy on 21st January 2019.\nScotland’s aristocratic and middle classes have long told themselves that thanks to the successful wars of independence (and of course, the icons of Wallace and Bruce), Scotland and England came together as two equal partners – first in the union of the crowns and then through a political union – rather than through conquest and subjection. It was a theme which would re-emerge during the 2014 independence referendum with the slogan that “Scotland should lead not leave” the UK in a partnership of equals.\nThe Brexit process has told voters in Scotland much about the nature of Devolution and Scotland’s standing in the partnership within the union of the UK. Whatever the UK is, it’s not a union of equals – and Scotland’s standing in the UK contrasts strongly with the status and standing of our Celtic cousin Ireland in the union of the EU.\nBrexit for the Scots has been a tale of two unions.\nScotland voted to remain in the EU by 62% – 75% in the City of Edinburgh, part of which I represent. Every local authority area in Scotland backed remain. Polls now show an even larger remain vote across Scotland, in the region of 70%.\nThe majority of Scottish voters do not hold the same concerns about sovereignty or immigration as are held by English voters. Scotland’s historic ties with the European continent have much to do with this – but so does devolution.\nScotland has to an extent been protected from the worst excesses of austerity because we have had left of centre devolved Governments since 1999. Throughout the austerity years, an SNP Government has tried to protect Scotland and currently spends £125m a year to ameliorate the worst of Westminster’s social welfare cuts. It is also a matter of record that Scotland has the best performing NHS in the UK. There has been considerable investment in social housing, ground-breaking homelessness legislation and the re-introduction of security of tenure in the private rented sector.\nBy contrast many working-class people in England have been led to believe that the cause of their difficulties getting a house or a well-paid job is immigration, rather than government policies.\nBut back to the tale of two Unions.\nSo far as Ireland (north and south) is concerned, British politicians largely overlooked the threat that Brexit posed to the Good Friday agreement until after the referendum. And even then, many of them – particularly in the Tory party – remained (and remain) unable to accept the reality of the legal obligations that the United Kingdom undertook in that agreement. However, because the EU27 got behind the Irish Government’s legitimate concerns, these concerns became central to the Brexit process.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_scotland-refugee-support/content_285.html": "Tories and Scotland contrast heavily in refugee support\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 07th Apr 2023\nAs Easter approaches, I found myself thinking about Alastair Campbell’s famous advice to Tony Blair – “We don’t do God”. Our new FM changed all that in Scotland when he posted a photo of himself and his family praying in Bute House at the end of their daily Ramadan fast. It was an arresting image illustrating the diversity of modern Scotland although some people did wonder whether Kate Forbes leading her family in Christian prayer would have met with a similarly positive reaction.\nReligion has had a bit of a bad press in Scotland recently, but in my experience some of the most important outreach work done in my constituency is carried out by faith communities. In as much as I might not agree with all the tenets of either Humza or Kate’s faith, I hugely appreciate the contribution our different faith communities make to modern Scottish society and respect their right to hold beliefs with which I and others might disagree.\nFor myself. I am a bit of a wishy-washy lapsed Catholic but still capable of being roused to passion if I think my faith community is being insulted. And so, last week in the House of Commons I lost it a bit when Robert Jenrick, the immigration minister, decided to use a parody of the words of St Augustine to mock Alison Thewliss’ excellent response to his statement on housing those who arrive by small boats in the most basic accommodation possible as part of their deterrent policy. As had already been reported in some newspapers. former military sites are under consideration as well as industrial barges.\nAlison Thewliss ruffled the Tory’s feathers by referring to the UK’s historic form on internment camps, most recently used in Northern Ireland in the 1970s when many innocent Catholics and nationalists were interned without trial in camps and, on a vessel in Belfast harbour. Jenrick resorted to the tired and dishonest Tory trope that Scotland has not taken its fair share of refugees and asylum seekers and accused the SNP of being “humanitarian nimbys” saying that Alison took a kind of St Augustine approach “Lord let us welcome refugees but not in our constituencies.” Given Glasgow’s outstanding record on welcoming refugees I was infuriated and accused him of blasphemy earning a rebuke from the Speaker.\nAlison was right. What is proposed is highly reminiscent of the refugee detention camps we saw in the BBC series “Years and Years” which many of us watched avidly during lockdown. In the dystopian science fiction drama set in a UK of the near future refugees are interned in the UK and a fascist right populist played by Emma Thompson is elected PM.\nJenrick riled Alison, myself and our colleagues by seeking to make a comparison between his plans to inter refuges on an industrial barge with the Scottish Government’s use of former ferry accommodation in Edinburgh and Glasgow to house Ukrainian refugees. The comparison is, as Alison said, both offensive and misleading.\nI visited the MS Victoria at Leith Dock last month and saw the difference with my own eyes. For a start, the accommodation used in Scotland was an emergency temporary response which is now being stood down. As Minister with special responsibility for refugees from Ukraine, Neil Gray was assiduous in keeping local parliamentarians informed of developments.\nAs a result of a joint strategy led by Glasgow City Council over the past three months, with support from the Ukrainian consul and third sector, all those on board the MS Ambition docked in Glasgow have disembarked for onward shorter and longer-term accommodation. Plans are well advanced to do the same in Edinburgh by the end of the summer.\nIt seems the UK Government looked into emulating the Scottish Government’s response but rejected the idea because of the expense involved and the fact that quality accommodation would not fit with their plans to “suffuse our entire system with deterrence.”\nThe Tories plan to isolate refugees and asylum seekers from those of us who already live in the UK. In contrast the Scottish Government provided wraparound support for the cruise ships, with local government, NHS, schools and community integration. Those running the cruise ships have also done a great job. When I visited the MS Victoria I saw high standard overnight and communal accommodation. There was a regular minibus shuttle service into Leith where children on the boat were attending local schools and some of the adults were working in the community. On board entertainment produced by the guests, children’s activities including a children’s club “Funny Moments” formed by ship charter organiser Landry and Kling employing a team of 7 Ukrainian guests from the ship with backgrounds in childcare, including teachers and a child psychologist. Activities have been organised for more than 380 children among a cohort of over 1,000 refugees onboard to keep them active and focused after school and at the weekends. We also met with the principal dancer of the Freedom ballet who lived on board with their family. All the rooms have ensuite toilet and shower and windows or an illuminated panel and the food is of high quality. The same cannot be said of many of the hotels commissioned by the Home Office.\nThe Scottish Government, Edinburgh and Glasgow City councils and the charter companies as well as the guests themselves are to be congratulated for what they have achieved. Of course, it is not ideal, but it is temporary and quite different from what the Tories have planned.\nAs well as being a security nightmare the Tories plans would breach the Refugee Convention on arbitrary detention and could amount to racial discrimination given the very different treatment given to refugees from Ukraine. Such housing for unaccompanied minors and those traumatized in warzones would be highly inappropriate and the security on such sites could be a nightmare.\nThe environment created on board the MS Victoria by the Scottish Government and their partners is one of respect and nurture recognising a difficult time for people fleeing the war, but there is no respect or support in the barge ships or the Tory policies surrounding it.",

But what will Labour do?\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 24th Nov 2023\nIt was announced yesterday that net migration is three times what it was when the Tories were re-elected for a third term in 2019 on a manifesto promising to reduce it. It is tempting to laugh but really, we should weep. One of the main reasons Brexit occurred was a result of the moral panic stirred up over immigration. And now we are left with a situation where we have lost free movement and skilled workers while refugees and asylum seekers are being treated appallingly, and all for nothing.\nAn incredible amount of parliamentary time has been devoted to reducing net migration, not to mention hot air, and yet here we are. Is it safe to hope that the dog-whistle rhetoric of the Tory right has had its day and that an incoming Labour government might see sense on these matters?\nOne hopeful sign was last week's judgement of the UK Supreme Court finding that the UK Government's crackpot scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful. Under the Migration and Economic Development Partnership (MEDP) agreed with the Rwandan government some of those seeking asylum in the UK could be sent to Rwanda to have their claims processed not by the UK but by the Rwandan government.\nIn the MEDP the Rwandans committed to comply with international human rights and refugee law including the principle of 'non-refoulement' i.e., not returning refugees to their country of origin, either directly or indirectly, if their life or freedom would be threatened in that country. However, the Supreme Court decided unanimously that the Rwandan policy is unlawful because Rwanda is not a safe destination, there being substantial grounds for believing there is a real risk that the human rights of asylum seekers sent there would be breached principally due to the risk that they would be sent on to face persecution. The court reached this decision after forming a view on evidence about the situation on the ground in Rwanda presented by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\nThey particularly focused on the fact that the general human rights situation in Rwanda is far from ideal, the inadequacy of Rwanda's current asylum system and Rwanda's failure to abide by obligations in a similar previous agreement with Israel. The evidence of human rights and rule of law concerns was extensive and included evidence about the persecution of people who are critical of the government in Rwanda, the lack of judicial independence and the fact that 100% of Yemenis, Syrians and Afghanis have had their claims for asylum rejected in Rwanda in recent years despite their fellow countrymen and women having a high success rate in the UK system during the same period. The UNCHR presented shocking evidence that more than 100 asylum seekers sent to Rwanda by Israel had been moved clandestinely to Uganda and in three cases the UNHCR had to step in to prevent Eritreans from being directly returned to Eritrea.\nThe Supreme Court went out of their way to make it clear that the non-refoulement principle is found not just in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but also in other international treaties to which the UK is a signatory, including the Refugee Convention; the UN Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). It is also a part of the domestic law of the UK by virtue of the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004.\nThis should put paid to the lazy argument that it is only the UK's membership of the ECHR which is stopping the Tory government from dealing with the problem of small boats. The days of crying wolf about 'foreign courts' should now be over. It's a domestic court that has stopped the scheme in its tracks. If the Tories want the Rwandan scheme to go ahead, they are going to have to repeal a lot of UK legislation and be prepared to leave or break numerous international treaties. Doing that would make them international pariahs. One former Tory minister has even argued it could mean that some British officials who travelled abroad could risk arrest. And of course, leaving the ECHR would undermine devolution, breach the Good Friday Agreement, and render our post-Brexit agreements with the EU on trade and co-operation, security, data sharing and Horizon unworkable.\nSo what does the Prime Minister propose to do? We should not laugh too much at Lee Anderson MP's suggestion that asylum seekers should instead be sent to an uninhabited island in \"the Orkneys\".\nEarlier the Tories were contemplating the Falklands as a destination. However, it seems for now that what the Tories have in mind is two things, fast-tracking a legally binding treaty with Rwanda and a law saying that, notwithstanding the court's findings, the country is a safe place. This would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. Parliament might as well pass an act of saying the moon is made of cheese. Furthermore, the courts, as one Cabinet secretary has commented, will go 'ballistic'. Because of the way in which the Supreme Court framed its decision there is no quick fix for the situation the Government has got itself into.\nThe court's recognition that the issue is not the Rwandan government's good faith, but rather its practical ability to fulfil the assurances it has given, makes it clear that there is a lot of work to be done before those assurances could be fulfilled, if ever. It also means that merely replacing the MEDP, which is not legally binding, with a treaty which is would not solve the problem because that would not address the practical problems of compliance.\nSo, for now it's going to be very difficult for the UK Government to get itself out of the hole it has dug. They have spent two years now and God knows how much money formulating a policy which looks unworkable. Their response should be to ask how they can produce a human asylum policy which works with safe legal routes for those genuinely fleeing persecution. The chances they will do so are slim, but the reality is that the ball may soon be in Labour's court. It is time for closer scrutiny of what they propose.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_i-wanted-a-contest-but-ill-back-john-swinney-heres-why/content_11.html": "I wanted a contest but I'll back John Swinney. Here's why.\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 03rd May 2024\nIf Kate had stood for the leadership of the SNP, she would have had my backing. She has not and therefore I will fall behind the leadership of John Swinney. I should have liked to see a contest and a battle of ideas about the future direction of our party, the Scottish Government, and the cause of independence, but I understand the fear that the acrimony generated by that would not be desirable with a challenging General Election so close.\nHowever, I will continue to argue for the reset that I believe the Scottish National Party needs, and to support Kate’s prescient words from the last leadership election campaign that continuity won’t cut it. If the events of Humza’s leadership have shown anything they have shown that Kate was right about that.\nI am reasonably optimistic that given his long experience in politics John will see that this is correct and chart a new course for the party and the government. I was hugely encouraged by the tone of John’s speech. He and I come from the same moderate left of centre tradition, and it was so good to hear him reach out to Kate Forbes, acknowledge the divisions in the party and pledge to restore internal party democracy and respectful debate.\nThe ending of the Bute House agreement is a huge opportunity for the SNP to reset our agenda in government. Out with identity politics and virtue signalling. In with policies to tackle the bread and butter issues that our constituents bring up on the doorsteps. There were two reasons for the Bute house agreement. The first was that John Swinney was nearly brought down as a Minister in a vote of no confidence at the end of the 2016-21 parliament. Nicola Sturgeon wanted a majority so that neither she nor any of her ministers would face such a threat again. The second reason was to lock in a pro-independence majority at Holyrood.\nSadly, it has not proved possible to use that pro-independence majority to advance the cause of independence. I had hoped it would be used to pass a bill paving the way to hold a second independence referendum, so that when the inevitable legal challenge came, the Scottish Government would be in a strong position both legally and politically to resist it and to turn legal defeat into political victory. However, notwithstanding the body of legal opinion that such a competent bill could be drafted, choices made by the former first minister but one meant that instead we went cap in hand to the UK Supreme Court looking for permission that was almost certain never to be granted. Then there was no political follow up strategy.\nAccording to Lorna Slater independence is no longer a red line for the Scottish Greens. Instead, she and her colleagues insist that the focus must be on a “progressive agenda”. However, as my fellow columnist Shona Craven illustrated so ably in her column earlier this week the word “progressive” has been much misused. I agree with Shona that “one man’s “progress” may be another woman’s step backwards.” A truly progressive agenda would be one which builds upon great policies like the child payment to alleviate poverty in our country and redistribute wealth, while at the same time creating wealth by supporting business to do that. Both John and Kate, as former finance secretaries, believe in economic growth and this is something they could work on together.\nA truly progressive agenda would tackle the greatest challenge of our time, climate change, with a Green New Deal involving an industrial strategy that reduces greenhouse gas emissions while creating jobs, enabling the Just Transition, and tackling poverty and inequality. Schemes like deposit return would be delivered efficiently and cost effectively with stakeholders onside. A truly progressive agenda would reverse the current top-down policy approach favoured by the Greens, It would listen to, consult, collaborate and work in partnership with local communities to deliver on important decisions relating to the marine environment for instance as well as delivering comprehensive land reform.\nA truly progressive agenda would not govern by headline grabbing announcements without doing the hard work to make sure they are delivered. It would not rely on the sort of faux progressivism that elevates the rights of men who identify as women above those of women, nor would it deny science and spread disinformation in the face of expert medical advice about the care of gender questioning children. A truly progressive agenda would recognise that equality, diversity, and inclusion extend to all the protected characteristics of the Equality Act. A truly progressive agenda would not tell women or same sex attracted people that their rights are conditional on accepting self-identification of sex.\nA truly progressive agenda would not monster a woman for her sincerely held Christian beliefs just as it would not monster a man for his sincerely held Muslim beliefs. A truly progressive agenda would not engage in double standards or hypocrisy.\nEarlier this week the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which I chair, launched an inquiry into the role of human rights in the UK democratic process. One of the things we will be looking at is the threat to democracy outlined in a major new report about Social Cohesion and Democratic Resilience by Dame Sarah Khan. The report identifies the phenomenon of “freedom restricting harassment” whereby 76% of those polled reported that they had restricted expressing their personal views in public, for fear of receiving such harassment.\nIn the last week we have seen Kate Forbes harassed for her religious beliefs in a way that was never done to her predecessor or other men in the SNP with the same religious affiliations as Kate. Her treatment is reminiscent of the harassment endured by the brave women and men who campaigned against self ID and puberty blockers for children and whose concerns have now been vindicated by cases like that of Isla Bryson and by the Cass Report.\nWe need to draw a line under this sort of harassment. I am optimistic that John Swinney as an elder statesperson of the party will feel able to do that. I am also optimistic that he will bring Kate back into government where she belongs.\nFinally turning to the central purpose of the SNP, in his resignation speech Humza said that independence feels frustratingly close. That is not quite how it feels to me. However, I don’t agree with the unionist commentators who think it is dead for a generation or longer. Lesley Riddoch has been very eloquent this week in pointing out the reality of the situation. Polls regularly show that approximately 50% of people living in Scotland want independence which means that the issue is unlikely to go away. However, there is democratic deadlock because, ten years on from the last independence referendum, there is no way people can have another say because of the democracy denying determination of the unionist parties to frustrate a second vote. This is not a sustainable situation. The challenge for the SNP, no matter who leads us, is to find a way out of this bind.\nI have known John Swinney since we were teenagers when together we set up the Young Scottish Nationalists in Edinburgh in 1980. To suggest that he does not understand this challenge and will not seek to address it would do a disservice to a man whose life has been dedicated to the party of independence.",

They provide food, safety, shelter, mental health support and more, every day, to millions of people.\nJoanna said: “I am so grateful to the small charities across my constituency who work tirelessly for local communities. I have visited many of them over the last few years, and I see how they contribute so much to our community. A new community charity run by Pentland Community Space is the Hub@531, which used to be a disused public toilet on Lanark Road at Juniper Green and is now a newly refurbished room running workshops and interest groups.

I recently visited the impressive COSS in Broomhouse who run a food pantry and offer advice and support for people who live nearby.”\nBut small charities are facing incredibly challenging times – just as the support they offer is needed more than ever.

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_scotland-independence-better/content_270.html": "Saying Scotland could do better if it had independence just isn’t enough\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 01st Apr 2022\nIf you watched PMQs this week you will have seen several of my SNP colleagues ask very pertinent questions. Carol Monaghan on why Westminster is punishing Scotland’s renewable sector with exorbitant grid connection charges, Chris Stephens on why the UK Government has cut food waste funding to zero, and Patricia Gibson on the Tories abandonment of their manifesto promise on the triple lock on pensions.\nWhat you won’t have seen is anything resembling a pertinent answer. This is a recurring problem in House of Commons question times but it’s worse at PMQs because the non-answers are usually peppered with a good few lies. Fact checking PMQs has become a full-time job.\nHaving Boris Johnson as PM means we have a moral void at the heart of British politics. It’s not just that someone who lies and dissembles as a matter of course has been promoted to high office, it’s that he continues there without any consequences for his actions. He should never have survived being found to have prorogued parliament unlawfully. That he was not held accountable for such a shocking attack on our democracy shows that there is something badly wrong with our system. That he went on to win an election does not cancel out what went before but it has emboldened him. For, as we all know, he has form.\nBefore he became PM and misled the Queen, parliament, and the courts, about the reasons for the prorogation he had lost his job as a journalist on the Times for making up stories and as a shadow minister for lying about an extra-marital affair. As editor of the Spectator, he lied about the victims of the Hillsborough disaster. His casual attitude towards facts as Foreign Secretary added years to Nazanin Zagari Radcliffe’s sentence in Iran and of course his lies about the savings to be made by leaving the EU helped deliver Brexit which is now having such a disastrous effect on the British economy. Boris Johnson’s lies have destroyed lives, reputations, and livelihoods.\nOn partygate he insisted for weeks that no rules had been broken. An enterprising journalist at Business Insider has identified that he did so on no less than 39 occasions.\nIt is particularly significant that some of these occasions took place in the House of Commons. As Robert Peston said earlier this week the fact that fines have been handed out now establishes beyond doubt that No 10 was party central during the covid lockdowns. So, when the PM told the House of Commons that there were no parties, and no rules were broken he misled MPs. British constitutional convention dictates that if a minister does that knowingly he or she should resign. Personally, I have no doubt he did so knowingly because that is what he does. But there is no sign of him going.\nAt the Liaison Committee this week, Pete Wishart suggested that if Johnson himself gets a fixed penalty notice he will be toast. I am not so sure. We seem to be in a very different place from where we were just a few weeks ago when everyone was obsessed with how many letters the 1922 committee had received. The war in Ukraine may have saved Johnson. The fact that so many Tory MPs chose to party on the very day that the first batch of partygate fines were handed down tells you all you need to know about how seriously they are taking this situation now.\nIf being PM at the time when the people of Ukraine are suffering so grievously has saved him then it’s a rich irony that on the one thing he could really do to help the Ukrainian people he has so abysmally failed. Perhaps his most egregious lie this week was when he told one of his own Tory backbenchers that visas for Ukrainian refugees who want to take advantage of the sponsorship scheme are being processed at the rate of 1,000 a day and that 25,000 have already been issued. In fact, the UK has granted only 2,700 visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and the remaining 22,800 visas have been issued to Ukrainians seeking to join relatives under the Ukraine family scheme. The rate of processing of the sponsorship scheme visas is as any MP will tell you grindingly slow. 28,300 applications have been submitted under the sponsorship scheme but only 2,700 have been processed. The scheme opened on 14 March. Did Johnson tell the truth when he said 1,000 are being processed a day? You do the maths.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish Government stands ready to take more than our fair share of the refugees who want to come to the UK, but their hands are tied by the red tape of the Home Office and the dogged insistence on visas. Across Europe other countries are taking in way more Ukrainians fleeing the war than the UK and not delaying matters with visa applications. Boris Johnson is bragging about schemes that are mere window dressing in comparison.\nIt is immoral. Yet, its trite to say Scotland could do better than this with independence. Readers of this paper know that. What they want to hear is a plan and the policies that together will deliver independence and the reality of doing things differently to Johnson when it comes to the big moral and humanitarian challenges of our time. Saying there will be an indyref next year is not enough. As well as the answers to the hard questions which we all know will be asked about borders, currency, EU accession etc. during a campaign proper, we also need to be proceeding with a policy agenda at Holyrood that prepares the ground for independence and demonstrating that in Scotland, even under devolution, we do things differently.\nLast week when I wrote about how executive accountability at Holyrood could be improved, many of the readers who chose to leave comments seemed to think this could wait for independence. I disagree. Doing things better than Westminster doesn’t have to wait for independence. It should be an ongoing project. It’s our parliament and if it too is failing to hold the executive to account properly there are things we could do to improve it right now. We don’t need to wait for independence. That Boris Johnson is beyond compare when it comes to evading responsibility for his actions does not mean that we too could not do better in our parliament.",

The full text of my objection was as follows:\nAs Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South West, I object to planning application 19/00863/FUL on behalf of those of my constituents who have contacted me with serious concerns about the proposed development.\nMy constituents, over one hundred of whom have already registered their objections on the planning portal, tell me that they believe this proposed development will have a damaging impact on their community and on the local area.\nThe main issue that my constituents have raised is that, if approved, a new student housing development would have a significant negative impact on the balance and sustainability of their community. Planning policy is intended to protect communities from experiencing an excessive concentration of student accommodation to an extent that would be detrimental to the maintenance of balanced communities or to the established character and residential amenity of the locality. I know myself that Gorgie is a diverse community with a varied social composition where residents have a strong sense of permanence and attachment to their local area. This means there is a great deal of commitment to improving the local area through a number of community projects led by and for the people of Gorgie. My constituents are worried that the character of the Gorgie community could be lost if there were to be an influx of transient residents with no attachment to the local area.\nIn addition, my constituents have raised a number of concerns about the development itself with me. They have told me that the design of the proposed six-storey building is not in keeping with the character or scale of the local tenement housing and represents significant overdevelopment of the site. Some also believe that the proposed development would limit sunlight and daylight to the properties and gardens of near neighbours and would have an impact on the privacy of local residents.\nIt seems clear to me that there is overwhelming and unified opposition to this development among local residents who have contacted me to express their views. I am aware that the issue of student housing is a somewhat contentious topic in Edinburgh anyway, and that there is a fine balance to be struck between the needs of the students drawn to our city by our world-class universities and the needs of permanent residents who call the area home, but it is vital that the views of residents are taken into account.\nI trust that the Planning Committee will listen closely to the views of local residents and ensure that it prioritises the diversity, vibrancy and sustainability of Gorgie’s community in its decision-making process.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_black-lives-don-t-matter-to-tories/content_256.html": "Racist policies show black lives don’t matter to Tories\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 12th Jun 2020\nIn the two weeks since George Floyd’s murder, politicians have rushed to embrace the sentiments behind the Black Lives Matter movement. Even the PM and the Home Secretary have uttered the words on the floor of the House of Commons. But actions speak louder than words and if we want to know just how much Black, and other minority ethnic, lives matter in Tory Britain, we need to take a long hard look at the impact of Tory policies on BAME lives.\nAnyone who watched “Sitting in Limbo”, Monday night’s BBC One dramatisation of the experiences of a member of the Windrush generation, could be left in little doubt that Theresa May’s flagship policy – the Hostile Environment – is a policy in which Black lives most definitely do not matter.\nIn 1965, at the age of eight, Anthony Bryan came to the UK from Jamaica with his mum. He left school at 16 and worked for almost 40 years paying tax and national insurance. When he applied for a British passport in 2015, immigration enforcement caught up with him and decided he had no right to stay in the country where he had lived and worked for 50 years. He lost his job; he wasn’t allowed to claim benefits and he was detained twice. He was on the verge of deportation to Jamaica where he hadn’t been since his childhood when the law and politics finally intervened.\nThe Joint Committee on Human Rights recovered his file from the Home Office, and we established that it was stuffed full of evidence of his right to live in the UK. We concluded that it was not possible that the Home Office treatment of him had been a mistake, rather that the treatment was systemic.\nMr Bryan is just one of 850 people who were wrongfully detained between 2012 and 2017. 83 members of the Windrush generation were deported despite having a right to live in the UK and at least 13 of these people died before the Home Office acknowledged it had been mistaken in its treatment of them. And guess what – they were all black members of the Afro-Caribbean community. This was no mistake. It was a systemic clear-out with a racial bias.\nI have constituents from other Commonwealth countries who have encountered similar problems with the Home Office refusing them a British passport due to a lack of documentation, despite long time residency in the UK, but none of them were detained or faced deportation. They were white.\nOf course, it was a Labour Government which first used the term “Hostile Environment” in 2007, but boy did Theresa May pick up the ball and run with it. In a state where Black Lives really mattered the Windrush scandal would have ended her premiership. Instead, Amber Rudd took the fall and two years later only 60 of the 1275 applications for compensation have been paid.\nThe recommendations of the Windrush Lessons Learned Report including a review of the Hostile Environment policy and its impact on race equality, have yet to be implemented despite repeated opposition calls lead by Stuart McDonald MP the SNP’s Immigration Spokesperson.\nWendy Williams who wrote the report concluded; “While I am unable to make a definitive finding of institutional racism within the department (Home Office), I have serious concerns that these failings demonstrate an institutional ignorance and thoughtlessness towards the issue of race and the history of the Windrush generation within the department, which are consistent with some elements of the definition of institutional racism.”\nI believe that those elements of institutional racism are present in other Tory Government policies particularly Home Office policies.\nTake for example the ‘no recourse to public funds’ (NRPF) condition imposed on migrants with limited leave to enter or remain in the UK. NRPF means they cannot access benefits, housing or homelessness assistance. The impact of this policy on migrant women who suffer domestic abuse is the last remaining stumbling block to UK ratification of the Istanbul Convention on Violence against Women and Girls.\nA report by Agnes Woolley called ‘Access Denied: The cost of the ‘no recourse to public funds’ policy’, found that most families with NRPF have a child who is British by birth and nearly all of these families are BAME. Therefore, NRPF is inherently more likely to affect BAME British children than white British children. Despite this clear evidence that NRPF is a policy with racially discriminatory impacts, the Home Secretary refuses to act. SNP MPs will keep pressing her to do so, and we continue to be at the forefront of fighting these racist polices at Westminster. However, the SNP, like all political parties, needs to do much more to address the concerns of BAME communities and to improve their representation among our elected representatives.\nOn Monday night I took part in a hugely oversubscribed Zoom call organised by Anne McLaughlin MP, the SNP Women and Equalities Spokesperson at Westminster and Councillor Graham Campbell. Over 80 members of the BAME community in Scotland and 40 SNP MPs, MSPs and councillors signed up. The purpose of the call was for the politicians to listen to stories of what it is like to be black and Asian in Scotland and we did.\nOne of my big takeaways was that we need to do more to encourage members of the BAME community, particularly women, to stand for election. To date, the SNP have only ever had one female BAME parliamentarian and Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh’s experiences of racist abuse should shame us all.\nAcross Scotland there are fantastic grassroots organisations like Score Scotland, based in Wester Hailes, in my constituency, working hard to address the causes and effects of racism and to promote race equality. Their aim is to break down the barriers to the full participation of minority ethnic communities in all aspects of civic life. Politicians must work in partnership with such organisations to realise their goals and to give the words Black Lives Matter true meaning in our communities.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_uks-anti-strike-law/content_315.html": "Grant Shapps is trying to pull a fast one with UK's anti-strike law\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 13th Jan 2023\nMore shocking details emerged this week of the extent of the partygate cover-up under former PM Boris Johnson who is being investigated by the House of Commons Privileges Committee for misleading Parliament. This week Ministers still in office continued to play fast and loose with the truth.\nScottish Secretary Alister Jack’s insistence that Scots don’t want to rejoin the EU may have been insulting in its absurdity, but the lies told by Business, Energy and Industry Secretary, Grant Shapps, as he introduced new anti-strike laws, were really quite disgraceful. To make matters worse, Rishi Sunak perpetuated the deception at PMQs.\nFor readers new to the concept of Grant Shapps, he’s a ‘self-made’ millionaire who, I think it’s safe to say, wouldn’t get out of bed in the morning for the average wage earned by keyworkers in the UK. When he entered parliament, he hid the fact that he had a second job by practicing business under a false name and then threatened to sue a constituent who revealed this fact, until he was forced to admit it was true. Nice.\nOn Tuesday he drew on all his skills of elision and subterfuge to claim that the new anti-strike laws he will start to pilot through parliament next week are about protecting the public from danger to life and limb, that they mirror what happens in other countries across Europe and that they will comply with international labour law. Lies, lies, lies.\nFor a start, the word ‘safety’ doesn't even appear in the bill. It’s a bill about minimum service levels. Yet Shapps, the PM and other politicians and officials, this week have repeatedly talked of minimum safety levels and seem happy for confusion between the two concepts to be caused. Furthermore, as Chris Stephens pointed out in the Commons earlier this week, in some sectors trade unions are already legally obliged to provide “life and limb’ cover. This is usually secured by local agreements.\nAs to European standards, most European countries have a rather different model of labour relations than the UK which, thanks to successive Tory governments, has one of the strictest systems of regulation of industrial action in Europe. Labour law experts will tell you that in most European countries minimum service levels are established by collective agreements between unions and workers. In so far as legislation exists, it provides a framework for these agreements rather than top-down regulation. The Scandinavians have no such laws. In contrast the Tories' Bill will enable the Secretary of State to make sweeping regulations restricting the right to strike with little to circumscribe his discretion. The bill will affect millions of workers in health services, fire and rescue services, education, transport, decommissioning of radioactive waste and spent fuel, and border security.\nAs to compliance with international labour law, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) have enshrined the right to strike in their convention to which the UK is a signatory. Minimum service levels are allowed but not if they are imposed by the government, because this would be an infringement of the right to strike and freedom of association. To comply with the ILO requirements the levels must be set by negotiation between employers and workers, through their union, if one exists, or by an independent body (as happens in Italy).\nOnly in European countries well known for flouting fundamental rights like Hungary and Russia do we see government-enforced minimum service levels leading to the sacking of workers and the bankrupting of unions fighting for fair pay and conditions.\nYet with this new bill the Tories will give employers the power to fire striking workers and to sue unions if they don’t ensure minimum service levels set by the government. Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that despite all their anti-Putin rhetoric the Tories want to emulate his approach to striking workers. After all Dominic Raab, the Deputy PM, hasn’t ruled out the UK joining Russia as one of the few European countries not in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, is keen this should happen sooner rather than later.\nThese laws were not in the Tories' manifesto for the 2019 election which tends to suggest that they didn’t perceive a problem with the existing arrangements for securing minimum service levels until they were embarrassed by strikes by the very keyworkers we were enjoined to clap during the pandemic. Now the Tories need an excuse to stymie the strikes, government imposed minimum service levels have become a matter of life and death.\nThe fact that these laws weren't promised in the Tories’ manifesto means that parliament should block them, if not in the Commons then in the Lords. It is to be hoped there may be some Tory rebels. Labour have promised to oppose the laws and repeal them if they win the next election but based on their past record there is justifiable suspicion they are not to be trusted on the second part of their promise. So far opposition has been led by the SNP who will continue to work hand in hand with the STUC through the good offices of Chris Stephens MP and other distinguished trade union activists including Bill Ramsay and Simon Barrow who lead the SNP Trade Union Group. Like the SNP, the STUC recognise that these laws are also an attack on devolution which has enabled a very different collaborative approach to trade union relations in Scotland.\nThe bottom line is that key workers are striking because their wages have not begun to keep in line with inflation and because interest rate hikes caused by Tory economic incompetence mean they can't afford their mortgage or rent payments. The UK Government needs to recognise the stark reality of workers' lives and work with their unions respectfully to reach agreement. Instead, the Tories have used these disputes as an excuse for yet another attack on fundamental rights, just as they used the climate action and Black Lives Matter movements as an excuse to clamp down on the right to protest. As the TUC have said, the right to strike is the last resort for workers. The decision to exercise that right is not taken lightly. People tend to forget that every day of strike action is a day of lost pay for people who are already struggling. If workers cannot exercise their right to withhold their labour, then they are wage slaves. Human Rights are founded in our dignity as human beings. The right to work and to withhold labour are fundamental to that dignity. Why is it so hard for self-made millionaire Tories like Shapps to understand that?",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_gender-bill-legal-challenge/content_313.html": "Gender bill might have faced legal challenge post-indy\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 20th Jan 2023\nEVERYONE knows I am opposed to the Gender Recognition Reform Bill. However, I believe the problems it creates should be addressed in Scotland if not by our Parliament, then by our courts. That said, to describe the use of the Section 35 power to block the bill as an attack on devolution doesn’t really make sense. It is of the essence of devolution that the devolved Parliament is subservient to the UK Parliament that’s why we as nationalists want independence.\nIn an independent Scotland the passing of the bill by a parliamentary majority would not necessarily have guaranteed that it would have become law without further challenge. If we were an independent country with a written constitution, I predict this bill would be facing a legal challenge based on the concerns about its impact on equality law and human rights. If you cast your mind back to the summer of 2014, you will recall that the transitional constitution (published in a white paper with a foreword by Nicola Sturgeon) enshrined the protected characteristics of the Equality Act and the rights protected by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in Scotland’s new constitution.\nThose protected characteristics include age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. Not in a hierarchy but all deserving of equal treatment. So, let’s have a little bit less hysteria and more cool heads. The women, the old ladies, people with disabilities and those who are same-sex attracted who have valid concerns about the impacts of this bill are as deserving of having their voices heard as the trans people whom it may benefit. They don’t deserve to have their voices drowned out by this issue being turned into a constitutional football.\nI am not opposed to simplification of the process of gender recognition for trans people, as was promised in the SNP manifesto, but simplification should not mean eliminating safeguards. The First Minister has said repeatedly the bill gives no new rights to trans people. That is correct. You will search in vain for the word “trans’ in the bill. It’s not there. Instead, the bill creates a new right for anyone to self-identify as the opposite sex with next to no meaningful safeguards. It’s pretty obvious that giving any man the right to be able to self-identify as a woman will impact on the rights of women to safety, dignity and privacy. And, for lesbians, the fact that any man can say he is a woman poses a threat to our right to be same-sex attracted.\nLet’s just remind ourselves of the sort of safeguards to the bill that were voted down in the Scottish Parliament. An amendment to prevent known sex offenders from obtaining a gender recognition certificate (GRC); an amendment to prevent those awaiting trial on sex offences from applying for a GRC (which would have protected rape victims from the humiliation of having to use female pronouns to refer to their attacker in court); amendments to protect vulnerable women in prison; amendments to ensure those receiving intimate care could elect to receive it only from members of their same sex; amendments to allow the continuation of single-sex wards in health care settings. Are we really saying this is acceptable and justifiable?\nIn my work as chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) at Westminster, I carefully scrutinise the human rights implications of bills that come before the UK Parliament. We don’t just look at the rights of those whom the bill is intended to benefit (with the Tories that’s generally their pals in big business or the privileged) but we also look at the impacts on the rights of others, whether intentional or unintentional.\nWhen I look at the GRR Bill, I see that it might assist trans people’s right to live in safety and with dignity, privacy and respect for their private life and beliefs, (Articles 2, 3 and 8, 9 and 10 of the ECHR) but I also see it could impact on the rights of women and LGB people to do the same. Sometimes rights conflict and when that happens accommodations between conflicting rights must be found. I don’t think there was a proper analysis of the full rights implications of the bill during the parliamentary process.\nLikewise, when it comes to the adverse effect of the legislation on the Equality Act, MSPs were warned about this by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and policy analysts such as Murray, Blackburn Mackenzie but these warnings were not subjected to an appropriately rigorous analysis. And to those who say that the GRR Bill explicitly states that it does not affect the Equality Act, I say that is a very naive understanding of how legislation works. You could pass a bill saying the sky was green but that wouldn’t change the fact that it is blue. A lot is also made of the fact that the bill has been subjected to six years of consultation and scrutiny but as National columnist Shona Craven has pointed out, we should not confuse the length of the process with the thoroughness.\nIt seems likely now that these rights issues will be revisited in court. If the Scottish Government proceeds with its judicial review of the Section 35 order, strictly speaking the court should confine itself to a consideration of whether the order was lawfully and reasonably invoked but I cannot see how it can do that without considering whether the Equality Act is indeed adversely impacted.\nSeparately, I would anticipate further legal challenges to the bill on the grounds that it conflicts with the human rights of women and LGB people. The Scotland Act provides that the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate in a way that is incompatible with the rights set out in the ECHR.\nWe all know the Tories aren’t too pushed about human rights and anyway, Section 35 does not allow the bill to be vetoed based on an adverse impact on ECHR rights. However, others care about the universality of human rights and women and LGB people now have some powerful and brave grassroots champions, notwithstanding the attacks to which they have been subjected.\nAnd that brings me to my final point. The behaviour of some MPs in the House of Commons Chamber during the debate on Tuesday was unedifying. A male Labour MP was allowed to launch a screaming tirade on a female Tory MP who had described her fear and discomfort at encountering what she perceived as a man dressed as a woman in a women’s toilets, with only the mildest censure from the chair. The Labour MP Rosie Duffield, a survivor of domestic abuse, was howled down by mainly male voices. It was just a small taste of what I and others have faced for raising concerns about the wider implications of self-identification and it was one of the reasons why I absented myself from the chamber during the debate. Bullying is never OK. It is not acceptable for anyone to bully women in their place of work or anywhere else just because they disagree with them. It’s particularly horrible to see men do it to women. Anyone who cannot acknowledge this to be the case shouldn’t be in public life.\nThe way in which some people have been allowed to conduct themselves during this debate is a disgrace to Scottish and British politics. When some of the most vocal proponents of legislation threaten women who express concern about its impacts with violence – including sexual violence – and politicians supporting the legislation look the other way, something is very wrong.\nFor daring to raise legitimate concerns about the impact of this legislation on women, girls and LGB people I have faced rape threats, death threats, a toxic working environment and the threat of the loss of my livelihood. My experience is typical of women across the UK in politics, the health service, education, and other sectors. If this is what I face as a woman in the privileged position of a Member of Parliament, then what hope is there for any working-class or vulnerable woman who wants to raise concerns about the impact of this bill on her dignity, safety, or privacy?\nScotland can do better than this.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_covid-vaccine-progress-challenges-remain/content_273.html": "Covid vaccine progress is tremendous, but other challenges remain\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 12th Feb 2021\nMore than one million people in Scotland have now had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine and nearly all residents in our care homes have been vaccinated. This is a tremendous achievement, and we should all applaud our Health Secretary, Jeane Freeman and all the NHS and care staff who are working so hard to get the vaccines into people’s arms quickly.\nBut while there is cause to celebrate, many older people are still suffering the terrible effects of isolation from their loved ones. The problem is particularly acute for older people in care homes who have been unable to have in-person visits. On Wednesday it was reported that coronavirus cases in care homes have more than halved and deaths have dropped by 30 per cent in the space of a week. Jason Leitch warned that it’s too soon to draw conclusions from these statistics but that they do offer hope that the vaccine is taking effect in care homes. Donald MacAskill echoed this cautious optimism and pointed out that “We are not noticing a similar reduction in England who started vaccinating in care homes at a later date.”\nAt the same time, on Wednesday, the Scottish parliament public petitions committee discussed a petition calling for one designated visitor/family carer to be granted care home visits. The petition was set up by my constituent, Natasha Hamilton, who is a member of the Care Home Relatives Scotland voluntary group. She set up the petition because her mum is in a care home with dementia. It is well documented that those with dementia can suffer greater decline when they don’t have loved ones around them to provide stimulation and interaction. Natasha would like one nominated family member per resident to be allowed to visit safely using personal protective equipment in the same way that staff, including agency staff, have access. But the matter is fraught with difficulty and there is no easy fix. The last thing either the UK or Scottish Governments want is to allow visits to recommence and then to be blamed for a spike in infections and deaths in care homes.\nHowever, it helps to look at this through a human rights lens. While the rights of some groups seem top of the agenda, we must ensure that others are not overlooked. Equality is for all. Age is a protected characteristic. As Robert Burns might have said - the rights of older people merit some attention.\nLast month, the Westminster Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am Deputy Chair, took harrowing evidence from relatives of those in care who have been unable to visit their loved ones south of the border. We did this as part of our inquiry into the impact of the Covid crisis on human rights. Article 8 of the European Convention on Human rights (ECHR) protects the right to a family life and there is no doubt that long lockdowns have interfered with that right for those in care home settings and their families. We believe that blanket bans are in breach of this legal right to family life.\nHowever, governments are also under a duty to protect the right to life under article 2 of the ECHR. In order to do so, some interference with the right to family life is justified but it must be proportionate and only made on the basis of looking at individual circumstances and making an assessment. That assessment should consider the risks to the person in care’s emotional wellbeing and mental health of not having visits. The evidence we have heard suggests that in some instances this is not happening consistently in England.\nIn order to try and address this dilemma the committee has drafted legislation which would require care homes to allow visits by a \"person significant to the service user\" – a friend or loved one. This mirrors a new law in Ontario in Canada where a close relative is regarded as part of the care team for the purpose of visits and tests. These designated caregivers may access the care home, provided they test negative before each visit. This acknowledges that it takes a team to care for someone; dedicated staff in the home or hospital and a loving family visiting.\nThe suggestions put forward by the committee seeks to achieve a similar outcome. It would require individual risk assessments to be undertaken to facilitate face-to-face contact, where possible, with family and friends whose support is significant to a resident in a care home or hospital setting. Where the risks posed by face-to-face contact were too great, the legislation would require that careful thought be given to alternatives to meet residents’ needs, including their emotional and psychological needs. Legislation like this would not replace government guidance but rather it would provide a human rights underpinning against which such guidance could be judged.\nThese are only proposals from a cross-party committee and there is absolutely no indication that the UK Government will take them on board. Indeed, I suspect they won’t. Unlike the Scottish Government, expanding human rights protections is not exactly top of the UK Government’s agenda. Also, to be fair to both Governments, I know from my own discussions with Jeane Freeman about the position in Scotland that the matter is not at all straightforward and the introduction of such legislation is fraught with difficulty. But I am pleased to say I also know that the matter is under active and anxious consideration in Scotland.\nHolyrood’s petitions committee have resolved to keep the petition open and to write to Jeane Freeman and Jason Leitch to emphasise the need for urgency in responding to campaigners. And it was good to hear the First Minister say at FMQs that new guidance on family member visits to care homes will be published imminently. So often the rights of older people are overlooked. It is time they were put front and centre in our society.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_human-rights-and-jury-trials/content_266.html": "European Convention must be protected at all costs\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 22nd May 2020\nBefore Brexit became the primary focus of the Tories anti-European zeal they were obsessed with repealing the Human Rights Act (HRA) which, in 1998, incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into the domestic law of the UK. At the same time, the ECHR was hard-wired into the devolution settlement in the Scotland Act.\nThe UK had ratified the ECHR in 1951 but the importance of the Human Rights Act and the Scotland Act was that they ensured UK citizens could access these rights directly through the domestic courts of the UK rather than having to go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which was both costly and time-consuming.\nIn 2015 the SNP played a leading role in the successful cross-party campaign to save the HRA.\nDuring the last but one round of the current negotiations with the EU on the UK’s future relationship, Michel Barnier said that the future security partnership between the European Union and the UK was being jeopardised by the UK Government’s refusal to guarantee that it will remain a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights. I questioned Michael Gove directly on this point at the Brexit Select Committee. He assured me that neither he nor the rest of the current UK Government has any intention of leaving the ECHR, explaining that the problem was the mechanism the EU wants to agree to ensure the UK’s adherence to the ECHR. I was left with the impression that Mr Gove and his Tory colleagues want to leave themselves some wriggle room.\nThe dilemma about what to do about jury trials during the pandemic is a good example of the importance of the rights we enjoy under the ECHR. The need to find a solution is not just about protecting public health and preventing an administrative backlog. It is also about protecting both the rights of accused persons awaiting trial and equally importantly, the rights of victims and other witnesses.\nIn England, earlier this week, some jury trials resumed. However, in Scotland, careful deliberations as to how this might be achieved are still underway.\nThe Justice Minister, Humza Yousaf, has told Holyrood that the discussions are focusing on the potential for smaller numbers of jurors, social distancing measures within existing court facilities, measures to enable the faster progression of jury trials to address the backlog following the easing of public health restrictions; and potentially adjusting the sentencing powers of Sheriff Courts.\nOn Tuesday, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service told Holyrood’s Justice Committee that if practical solutions cannot be found the only option will be judge only trials but, that a pilot to start a small number of jury trials could start soon. His primary focus seemed to be avoiding a backlog of trials, but human rights considerations will be looming large with the Scottish Government.\nWhat are these? Article 6 of the ECHR guarantees the right to a fair trial. Jury trials are not mandatory, but Article 6 is concerned with a member state’s procedural framework as a whole and jury trials in the most serious cases are a fundamental aspect of Scotland’s criminal justice system. This means their removal would at least require a major rebalancing of the systems and the introduction of new safeguards. Article 6 taken together with Article 5 (prohibition of arbitrary detention), also mean that accused persons should be brought to trial within a reasonable time.\nThe rights of victims, witnesses and others involved in the justice system must also be protected. Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR impose procedural obligations on the State to ensure the effective investigation and prosecution of crimes. Article 8 provides that States have a duty to protect the physical and moral integrity of an individual from other persons. In relation to sexual crimes, the European Court of Human Rights has held that Articles 3, 8 and 13 (the right to an effective remedy) taken together mean that the state must ensure these crimes are investigated and prosecuted effectively. The state must also avoid undue delay in getting these cases to trial.\nIn addition, the Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women imposes obligations on the state to ensure that investigations and judicial proceedings in relation to all forms of violence covered by the convention are carried out without undue delay while taking into consideration the rights of the victim during all stages of the criminal proceedings.\nUnder Article 2, the state has a duty to protect life and this underlines its duty to protect the health of all who might take part in a trial during the pandemic. Satisfying this legal obligation will benefit all.\nHowever, a solution which serves the rights of accused persons may not serve the rights of victims or witnesses. For example, while it is in the interests of accused persons facing serious charges to have a jury trial, Rape Crisis and other victims' charities have raised legitimate concerns about the risk of already traumatised victims having to give evidence more than once should a trial collapse, because jurors become ill, or something else goes wrong leading to a mistrial.\nThe debate about whether and how to continue jury trials during the pandemic shows how closely the rights ensured by the ECHR are woven into the fabric of our legal system in Scotland and, also, how the rights of one group of citizens may sometimes compete with those of another group.\nThe Scottish Government must find a solution which satisfies its obligations in respect of the human rights of all its citizens including accused persons, but also victims, witnesses and those involved in the administration of our justice system. It is not an easy task.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_hoarding-disorder/content_242.html": "A little-understood mental health issue finally being recognised\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 18th Jun 2021\nFor many people Covid19 has meant working from home. For some, that experience has been significantly better than for others, with many people finding the work/life balance easier to handle, enjoying the temporary respite from daily commuting and a more flexible schedule. For others, issues with childcare, flatmates, physical space, boredom, motivation and loneliness have been very stressful and, of course for some ,working from home is not possible at all.\nWe know that the pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of the population. For many of us our homes have been a sanctuary but for some people their home can be a source of stress, embarrassment and shame. Mental health really matters and so today I want to write about a significant mental health issue which I have encountered in my work as an MP, which effects people in what should be the haven of their home, and which is little understood. Hoarding disorder is estimated to affect 1 in 40 adults with older people more likely to suffer. The disorder affects people across all socio-economic and cultural groups and impacts both men and women at similar rates. Whilst most of us have a picture of hoarding from reality tv programmes, that type of often exploitative television does little to help understanding of this serious condition. Our national media should seek advice from experts including clinical psychologists about the portrayal of people with hoarding problems and desist from using mental health problems to entertain and shock the public. For a start we need to ditch the term ‘hoarder’ and stop othering and stigmatising people.\nHoarding disorder is characterised by accumulation of possessions due to excessive acquisition and difficulty discarding possessions, regardless of their actual value. This excessive acquisition can be characterised by repetitive urges related to amassing or buying items. Difficulty discarding possessions is characterised by a perceived need to save items and distress associated with letting them go. This excessive accumulation can result in living spaces becoming cluttered to the point that they are not just uncomfortable but also unsafe. The symptoms can result in significant distress for people and often cause significant difficulties in interpersonal and family interactions. In turn, these can damage family and personal connections and make the problems even worse. Extreme clutter can also be a barrier to people receiving vital help and support and can affect employment and housing status.\nHoarding is often a secret illness due to the embarrassment and stigma attached. However, it is now recognised as a complex mental health disorder. On the 1st of January 2022 the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) will come into effect and Hoarding Disorder will be officially recognised as a distinct mental health disorder. From that date there will be an expectation on Scotland’s health and social care professionals to be able to assess and diagnose Hoarding Disorder and provide treatment and interventions.\nThrough my work as a constituency MP my team have uncovered two serious cases of hoarding disorder both of which were on the radar of social services but where specialist support had not been provided. In both cases my constituents had had their water cut off, one by the council and the other by a social landlord - both because there was a leak to the flat below. In the case of the council the constituent’s water had been cut off for more than a decade.\nThink about that for a moment, it is difficult to conceptualise. An entire decade where you cannot go to the lavatory at home, you cannot wash, you cannot make a cup of tea or drink a glass of water. By contrast, if Scottish Water experience a mains supply issue their service level agreement aims to have it restored within 12 hours. If there is a major incident, customers receive at least 10 litres of bottled water for every person in the household. This is a testament to how fundamental access to water is.\nAs an MP, I and my small team help a wide number of people with a very varied array of problems. Typically, we assist with problems relating to government departments, usually benefits or immigration cases. But often people contact their MP’s office because they have very complex problems or have found it difficult to get help from statutory services and are in a state of desperation with nowhere else to turn.\nNo one has ever turned up and said: “I have a problem with hoarding and I need your help”. In the limited experience of my office, people have tended to present with multiple small problems where they needed my help. It has only been through developing a relationship with constituents and through the good work of my staff that we have been able to identify a problem and work with people to disclose their hoarding issue. The complexity of how these cases have presented and the coping strategies people have had in place makes identifying them very difficult.\nIt is estimated that only around 5% of people who hoard receive help from health and social care services. This is due to a combination of things including a lack of insight from people who hoard which means they won’t seek support, fear of being judged and a legitimate fear of severe interventions like forced house clearances which put people off seeking help. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge and understanding of the condition within health and social care and limited treatment and interventions available.\nAs a result of my constituent’s experiences I have written to Scotland’s new Health Secretary, Humza Yousaf, to ask the Scottish Government to provide clear national guidance to local authorities and other services like the police and fire service who often uncover cases of hoarding disorder. Without clear national guidance local authorities and other statutory services are making uninformed decisions about treatments which often include the forced clearance of properties which have a significant detrimental effect on individuals and often just exacerbate the problem. Everybody working with people who hoard should have access to training and information about good practice to make sure people get the right help.\nI was pleased to give the opening speech at the first international conference held in Scotland on Hoarding, Health and Housing in 2018 and things are improving. There are already signs of hope and Scotland is leading the way in this with the creation of the Hoarding Academy – a step towards an Institute. The Academy is headed by Linda Fay of Life-Pod a social enterprise community interest company. Linda is the UK’s only certified Hoarding Specialist. The Hoarding Academy are first in the UK to provide accredited training programmes and is now working with health and social care professionals across the UK.\nPeople who have a hoarding condition or their friends and families should feel increasingly confident about seeking help and a new conversation starter leaflet has just been created to help people who find it difficult to ask for help. This document can be printed off and taken to a GP or given to any other professional ‘helper’ as a way of getting things started. Help is out there; it is getting better and it is possible to live well with a hoarding condition. I hope that more people seek and receive the help they need.\nYou can download the conversation starter at https://life-pod.co.uk/support/",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-code-of-conduct-ash-regan/content_306.html": "Why is SNP code of conduct not being enforced?\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 24th Feb 2023\n“Now look! No one is to stone anyone until I blow this whistle, do you understand? Even, and I want to make this absolutely clear, even if they do say Jehovah.” The last words of John Cleese’s character as he officiates at the stoning of an old man in the Monty Python comedy the Life of Brian. Stoning is in no way comedic and sadly one of the cruellest forms of execution still used in barbaric countries today. Python however, beautifully illustrated the hypocrisy of moral indignation and how those taking the so called moral high ground are often as guilty of intolerance as those they seek to condemn. Although the movie has been accused of blasphemy this scene encapsulates the teachings of Jesus Christ who said ‘let he who is without sin throw the first stone”.\nThe ducking stool Kate Forbes has been put on this week has been painful to watch. She has given some very open and unpolitical answers when asked to explain her personal faith. She has tried to explain the separation between her personal and deeply held religious beliefs and the operation of government in a democracy.\nIf she had been part of Alex Salmond’s government on the 4th of February 2014 when, Holyrood voted for gay marriage, she like everyone else on the SNP benches would have been afforded a conscience vote. We now understand that Humza Yousaf, who was quick to condemn Kate, conveniently absented himself from the chamber that day. The vote wasn’t whipped (mandatory) and SNP members had a free vote to allow people of faith and others who disagreed with the policy to vote as their conscience dictated. It was a controversial bill but I, like many other lesbians and gay men, was delighted when it passed. Would the absence of a hypothetical Kate Forbes or a busy elsewhere Humza Yousaf have dented the joy in its passing or affected the parliamentary majority for extending marriage to same sex couples? No of course not on both counts.\nKate has handled her interviews badly and like many people I didn’t agree with her answers and the inflexibility with which they were delivered, and I don’t see how what she has said can build a consensus and take people with her. But that does not mean she should be pilloried or, as some of the SNP’s more intolerant members have suggested, suspended and investigated.\nSo far as I can see Kate has given no indication that she would use her role as leader of the SNP or FM to impose her beliefs on the rest of us via legislation. As Joan McAlpine pointed out this week in one of her powerful twitter threads, this in stark contrast to Humza, who was happy to try to embed in our law the secular ideology (without scientific foundation) that any man can become a woman, including a rapist, because sex is simply a matter of self-perception. Humza was also happy to pass the Hate Crime Act which threatens to criminalise anyone who disagrees with this ideology, and he ditched his own government amendments providing a free speech defence when the mob turned on those supporting them, accusing them of “transphobia”. The good news for those of us who believe in free speech is that more than 18 months later the legislation is still not in force for a variety of reasons including the growing realisation that it would not survive a human rights challenge because it discriminates against people who don’t subscribe to gender identity ideology.\nBefore I move on I would like to stress that I support legislation to criminalise hate speech (which already exists in Scotland) and reform of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) but in both cases only with inbuilt safeguards to protect free speech and the rights of everyone in our society, including women and LGB people. What I do not support is legislation that forces anyone to subscribe to someone’s else’s belief system. I need to be crystal clear about this lest the mob who have set upon Kate in the last few days turn their attentions to me.\nAnd yes, there is a mob out there consisting of members of the SNP, Greens, other parties and none, who have been encouraged to think that any woman who disagrees with their belief system is fair game for monstering, abuse and sometimes criminal threats.\nThe apotheosis of this was when politicians in Holyrood stood to applaud a trans rights activist with a history of threatening women with extreme violence and Alex Cole-Hamilton later lauded this person in a speech, which he has since disavowed. Sometimes it looks like our politicians are more interested in virtue signalling than due diligence on who they bring inside their tent.\nAt the height of the Kate Forbes pile-on as SNP staffers and party members merrily breached the party’s code of conduct by publicising their complaints about her online and calling for her head on a plate, I called for an elder statesperson in the party to step in and call off the dogs. The fact that this did not happen is a sad reflection of the deterioration of the way in which our party currently conducts itself in the public forum. It needs to stop. Fortunately, SNP members have the choice of one candidate who had the decency to call for calm and an end to the mudslinging. She is also someone who is not tainted by the governmental policy failings which contributed to Nicola Sturgeon’s resignation. Nor has her leadership bid blown up on the launch pad.\nI am supporting Ash Regan and I will be proud to introduce her at her launch today. Ash knows that the path to independence lies through strong, effective government. As First Minister she would focus on the nation’s priorities; NHS recovery, social care, the cost-of-living crisis, the economy, creating well paid jobs, education, energy and the environment. She will run her government as a team effort with the aim of good governance for its own sake and to give people the confidence to vote for independence. It will be back to the motto of “Record, vision and team” which won us the 2011 election outright and nearly took us to independence in 2014.\nAsh is also unequivocally in favour of equal rights for LGBT people and will defend the rights we have under the Equality Act, Human Rights Act and equal marriage legislation. She also supports reform of the GRA just not self-identification which threatens the rights of women, girls and LGB people. She, like me wants to find a route to reform that fulfils our manifesto promises to respect the rights of everyone.\nHowever, Ash will not waste time and public money on legal battles with the British Government which we cannot win, and which opinion polls show the public don’t support. She knows that devolution does what it says on the tin. Power devolved is power retained. Section 35 is just an inevitable, if egregious, aspect of that. Rather than banging her head against the brick wall of the limitations of devolution, Ash will concentrate on furthering the case for independence.\nAnd I mean the case for, rather than endless debates about process. It has wrongly been claimed that Ash unequivocally supports Nicola Sturgeon’s policy of a de facto referendum. However, she does think the party should debate the way forward and she does want to put independence front and centre of our manifesto and to devise a strategy which takes power back into our hands. She will take her proposals on this to a conference for consideration. She will also bring the independence movement back together through an independence convention involving all independence parties, organisations, think tanks and civil society to organise a new independence campaign body.\nFinally, I have confidence that Ash will take the necessary steps to restore good governance in the SNP, to restore our internal democracy, respectful debate and respect for the party’s code of conduct. The events of the last week have underlined the need for the SNP to get its house in order.\nSince having this column in the National I have called for a more open style of Government bringing in the talent we need, and I have tried to suggest ways our party and its leadership can listen to and work with the wider Yes movement. I have been impressed by what Ash has said on these issues and about having a more open style of Government. Leaders build teams and I’m confident that in Ash Regan we will have a someone who will let her ministers and the cabinet develop their individual portfolios so we can have the best vision and strongest team for Scotland. So many people inside and outside of Government want to work together to take our country forward. They’ve been ignored or held at arm's length for too long. Ash is showing us that we work best when we work respectfully together.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_use-courts-to-challenge-tories-until-independence/content_235.html": "We’ll use courts to challenge sleekit Tories until we have independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 09th Jul 2021\nIt’s been clear from the outset of the current PM’s term in office that this is a Tory Government which abhors scrutiny. Shortly after he took office, he tried to shut parliament down completely because he was finding its scrutiny of the Brexit process tiresome. It took litigation to restore parliament to its rightful role.\nAn unlawfully prorogued parliament is dangerous for democracy but so is a supine one. Because of the UK Government’s artificially inflated majority and its fear of due process and meaningful scrutiny, Westminster is a sad shell of its former self. Regulations impinging on our basic liberties during the Covid crisis have been rushed through with the minimum of debate. And it’s not just urgent Covid-related legislation that is treated in such a cursory way.\nEarlier this week we saw the Policing etc. Bill, a major piece of legislation affecting fundamental rights, sail through parliament without proper debate and scrutiny after a ridiculously short time allocation. A bill which will undermine the right to protest, and the right of the Gypsy Roma Traveller community to their very way of life went through parliament without proper discussion of its implications and without any sort of proper consideration of amendments. Most of the MPs who had put in to speak didn’t get to do so and amendments tabled after painstaking inquiries such as the one we carried out on the Joint Committee on Human Rights were ignored.\nThe UK Government does not like evidence-based policy making. In fact it doesn’t like evidence full stop. It likes to run the country free from scrutiny or accountability based on its Little Britain, ‘me first’ ideology and the personal ambition of ministers who look only to their mates for assistance in return for handsome remuneration and minimal record keeping.\nThe way in which they have handled the emergency Covid contracts typifies their approach. The sad thing for parliamentary democracy is that it is only through judicial processes, instigated by concerned citizens acting through the Good law Project (GLP), that the full scale of the government’s chicanery has come to light. Committees of the House of Commons have done their best to report on aspects of the sorry mess. They have pointed out that the need to act fast did not give the Government licence to rip up record keeping on decisions which led to the awarding of multi-million-pound contacts to their friends and relations nor to fail to publish contracts within the stipulated time limits. But it’s been impossible to achieve parliamentary accountability or censure.\nLast November, the National Audit Office revealed that the government awarded £10.5bn worth of pandemic-related contracts without a competitive tender process in a VIP lane, and that companies with the right political connections were ten times as likely to win them. They found that there had been “insufficient documentation on key decisions” and on how “conflicts of interest have been identified or managed”. Still it has been impossible to achieve parliamentary accountability or censure.\nThe GLP have brought two successful legal challenges against the UK Government’s handling of pandemic related procurements. The courts found that Government Ministers Matt Hancock and Michael Gove acted unlawfully. The GLP have a significant number of similar judicial reviews in the pipeline so more judicial scrutiny is coming at the UK government, despite their attempts to kick a judicial inquiry into the Covid crisis into the long grass.\nBut they can’t even accept what happened in court and have told porkies about the court decisions. They claim that the court did not find the government guilty of any actual bias. But this is a total red herring. The GLP did not seek a finding of actual bias but rather apparent bias. Apparent bias is a legal term which is well understood. Indeed, it was the reason why Alex Salmond won his civil action against the Scottish Government. The legal test for apparent bias is whether the circumstances would lead a fair minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility or real danger that the decision maker was biased. That’s the test the court applied in the GLP case against the Cabinet office and the court found that yes indeed a fair-minded, and informed observer would conclude that that there was a real possibility or a real danger the UK government awarded a significant contract to a company on the basis of bias. That is to say the Cabinet Office awarded a lucrative contract on the basis of favouritism – and, even in a crisis that is illegal.\nThe court process brought to light emails which otherwise would never have got into the public domain and which showed that the Guardian newspaper and Open Democracy had been right when they alleged institutionalised cronyism. We also learned that Michael Gove instructed officials to commission research on \"attitudes to the UK Union\" using the emergency contract given to Public First for pandemic research, meaning tax payers hard earned cash was used to further the interests of the Tory party. And, oh yes, they’ve lied about that too.\nThe sunlight shone on the government’s dodgy dealings by these two judicial reviews shows why a Judge-led inquiry into the Covid crisis is so important. Lying on oath is a very serious matter which, in a judge-led inquiry, would have the sort of repercussions that ought to mean most people will think twice before doing so. Witnesses are less likely to get away with prevarication and obfuscation under questioning from lawyers supervised by a judge. The power to compel witnesses and the production of documents will be very important. The cat ate the paper trail, or the redaction pen as trusty shield approach to government won’t cut it with a judge led inquiry. Obstructing judicial orders for documents is contempt of court and experience shows that that threat often brings to light records which haven’t yet made it to the virtual shredder.\nThere is something very wrong with British democracy when a Government elected with only 43.6% of the UK wide vote can rule like a dictatorship treating parliament as an inconvenience.\nSeen from Scotland the situation is even worse. This UK Government has no mandate and the party which does, the SNP, is treated with contempt. In the last few days we have found out what most of us already suspected – that the PM has so little respect for democracy he wants to close Scotland’s parliament down. He doesn’t need to worry too much about Westminster - he has already emasculated it.\nUntil the Scottish Parliament moves to use its mandate to hold a second independence referendum and get us out of this mess, using the law is the only way we can get to the truth of what this sleekit Tory Government have been up to. No wonder they want to limit the scope and availability of Judicial Review and no wonder they fear a Judge-led inquiry.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_conference-motion-will-plot-path-that-can-lead-us-to-independence/content_35.html": "Conference motion will plot path that can lead us to independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 29th Sep 2023\nAfter debate about the party’s independence strategy being discouraged for a long time, SNP members have been promised a debate at this year’s conference. At the time of writing the conference’s final agenda – which was supposed to be published on September 22 – has yet to appear despite the conference being only two weeks away. Members who have expended a lot of time and energy discussing and drafting motions and seeking support for them from across the country are still in the dark as to whether the fruits of their labour will be debated at conference and how much time will be afforded to the debate.\nThis is not an ideal situation, given the timescale, but perhaps it is explained by the fact that the time limit for amendments to the resolution tabled by Humza Yousaf and Stephen Flynn only expired on Wednesday.\nI believe it is vital that sufficient time is afforded for the debate and that it should cover not just the resolution put forward by the leadership but also resolutions from the grassroots. I would like to see a day, or a minimum of three hours set aside. Ideally, I think it’s a debate the party should have had in private but given the wide discussion already sparked in the media I think the ship may have sailed on that. I have given my support to one of the resolutions tabled by ordinary members and I am also co-sponsoring, with the SNP Trade Union Group (TUG), an amendment to Humza and Stephen’s resolution.\nThe resolution from the Almond and Earn branch which I and many others have co-sponsored proposes that the SNP put independence front and centre of every national election for either the UK or the Scottish parliaments. If the SNP and other pro-independence parties secure 50%+1 of the votes cast at such an election, that would constitute a mandate for Scotland to become an independent country. If within 90 days of the election the UK Government did not engage meaningfully with the Scottish Government, for example by meeting to discuss independence negotiations, then the SNP would withdraw our MPs from Westminster and convene a National Assembly consisting of MPs, MSPs and representatives of civic Scotland. What is envisaged here is explicitly not a de facto referendum. If 50%+1 votes are not achieved at the General Election, while Scotland will remain in the UK for the time being, the issue will be live again at the next Holyrood election. So, it is not a one-off, once-in-a-generation situation.\nIn truth, it’s a return to the old SNP position pre-devolution which recognises that given there has been an independence referendum won by the No side, and the SNP already have a majority of the seats at Westminster, what is now required for a mandate for independence is a majority of votes cast not just a simple majority of seats. The amendment which I have drafted to the leadership resolution, and with the backing of the TUG, also amends in the requirement of a majority of votes, not seats. But it goes further by restating the basic principle that as a matter of international law, the people of Scotland have the same right to self-determination as other peoples and are not prohibited from exercising that right by way of secession from the United Kingdom after a democratic expression of the view of the Scottish electorate. This is necessary because an unintended consequence of the ill-fated trip to the UK Supreme Court (UKSC) to ask permission for Holyrood to hold a referendum, were remarks made by the court to the effect that this right does not apply to the people of Scotland.\nFortunately, these comments were “obiter dicta” the phrase lawyers use for aspects of a judgment which are not binding. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of the UK could never have the final word on a matter of international law. I think they got the law wrong, and an independent opinion obtained by Neale Hanvey MP from Professor Robert McCorquodale, an expert in international law, agrees. Nevertheless, the principle requires to be restated by the SNP because the UKSC judgment has given currency to those who wish to thwart the independence movement. We are stuck with the UKSC’s opinion on the limits of Holyrood’s competence, but we don’t have to accept their mistaken view on the right of the Scots to self-determination.\nIn my opinion, confusion has arisen between the rights and competences of the current Scottish Parliament which is a creature of statute and the devolution settlement and the rights of the people of Scotland. The former may not have the power to end the Union between Scotland and England, but the latter certainly does, and this was the received wisdom of even Unionists until lately. This brings me to the second part of my amendment to the leadership resolution which reaffirms the commitment to set up a Constitutional Convention made by Nicola Sturgeon in January 2020. It is also designed to make sure that independence negotiations with the UK Government are taken forward by a Constitutional Convention constituted by the MPs elected to Westminster, MSPs and representatives of civic Scotland. This body, which would not be a creature of devolution, would accordingly not be hamstrung in any way by the limitations set out in the Scotland Act, but it would have democratic legitimacy.\nI am delighted to have secured the backing of the TUG for my ideas on strategy. I understand that they are also in support of the wording Tommy Sheppard has tabled as an amendment to the leadership motion which provides a longstop covering the eventuality of the party not winning a majority of the votes cast but a majority of seats at the General Election. In so far as that amendment would set up a negotiating position with an incoming UK Government for more powers for Holyrood including, vitally, the permanent transfer of legal power to the Scottish Parliament to determine how Scotland is governed, including the transfer of power to enable it to legislate for a referendum, I am also minded to support it. I sincerely hope that these resolutions and amendments will form part of the debate at conference, and for the reasons I have set out in this column I believe it is vital that they do so.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_snp-finances-shouted-down/content_275.html": "Those of us with questions about SNP finances were shouted down\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 21st Apr 2023\nIt goes without saying that anybody under suspicion of criminality is entitled to the presumption of innocence. It’s a cornerstone of the rule of law in a democratic society and it also makes good sense. In recent times we have seen commentators ending up with egg on their faces when they assumed that a leading political figure was guilty only for a jury to acquit him of all charges after actually hearing the evidence.\nFor that reason and because of the very strict Scots law rules on contempt of court when commenting on ongoing criminal proceedings I won’t be saying anything about Peter Murrell’s arrest in this article other than to note that he is very lucky that his SNP membership has not been suspended pending the outcome of the police investigation. Others have not enjoyed the same leniency. One thinks of Michelle Thomson, never arrested, ultimately exonerated, but thrown under the bus at the first hint of trouble. Tim Rideout was suspended for 6 months for an ill-judged tweet. Gender critical women have been suspended indefinitely for tweets exercising their right to freedom of belief and freedom of speech. This difference in approach is neither fair, nor in accordance with the principles of natural justice. In some cases it might even amount to unlawful discrimination.\nThe anomalies in how the SNP complaints and disciplinary process has been applied are part of a much wider problem with the party’s management which is now in the public domain because of recent events. I am conscious from my conversations with party members and from my mailbox that what has occurred has been deeply shocking for many. For others including myself albeit that some of the visuals have been shocking the fact that there is a significant problem has come as no surprise.\nAt the SNP conference in November 2020, I was one of a group of members elected to the NEC by thousands of fellow conference delegates on a promise to improve transparency and accountability. From the moment we set out our manifesto for change we were attacked and traduced by a small but determined cabal of fellow party members including councillors, parliamentarians, and other NEC members whose actions were condoned by the silence of the leadership. When some of those attacking us lost their places on the NEC at the elections, they were simply co-opted back on to the body despite the fact they had no democratic mandate to be there.\nThose of us elected by the membership were concerned about the party’s finances and governance. No one can seriously now doubt that that those concerns were well founded. Yet from the moment we were elected our efforts to get answers were frustrated. Worse, we were shouted down and hounded out of office. I have sat on several other management boards, and I have never witnessed business conducted in such a menacing atmosphere. With the benefit of hindsight, it looks to have been a deliberate attempt to hide the truth of what was going on.\nAt the first meeting of the new NEC in December 2020 we raised the issue of the liability of NEC members should anything ever go wrong and whether we were insured against that eventuality. We were promised an answer, but as with our questions about the party’s finances, the answers were never forthcoming. I should imagine the current members of the NEC will be more than anxious now to know the answer to this question. The party’s constitution is quite clear that the NEC is responsible for ownership of the Party’s assets and management of the Party's financial affairs and says that it has full control over all monies, funds, property, investments and securities of any kind belonging to the Party. That was certainly not my practical experience.\nReaders may recall that shortly after I started asking awkward questions about the party’s internal management, I lost my front bench role as the SNP Spokesperson on Justice and Home Affairs in February 2021. Yes, reshuffles happen and yes, nobody should assume an entitlement to a position but the way it was done was unusually brutal. Usually in these circumstances there would be some word of thanks at the following group meeting. Breaking with convention there was absolutely no acknowledgment of the work I had done over the last 6 years, including winning the case against the prorogation, none of the usual thanks, just a terse comment from Ian Blackford that I was guilty of “unacceptable behaviour” and “Joanna is leaving us” as though I had somehow been kicked out of the group rather than simply not taking up a role as spokesperson. He has yet to specify what he meant by that. Others including Kirsty Blackman made it clear from their social media attacks on me that I was being sacked for “transphobia”. I am still waiting to hear the evidence in support of these attacks which were, of course, in breach of the party’s code of conduct. My complaints about this like that of so many women in the party have been ignored.\nI have been open about my gender critical views since May 2019. They seemed only to become an acute problem when I sought and won election to the NEC on a manifesto for change and started asking searching questions. I am in no doubt that wrongful allegations of transphobia were weaponised against me and others who were rocking the boat to marginalise and discredit us. There was a strong correlation between those of us with the guts to question the party’s internal management and those with the courage to raise questions about the policy of self-identification of sex now embodied in the Gender Recognition Reform Bill. We have been proved right in our concerns about both. The weaponisation of our legally protected views against us was dirty politics at its worst and it put some of us in real danger.\nI expect those still in denial about the extent of the mess that has emerged in the SNP’s management will be unhappy about me setting all this out. But it needs to be said. If we are to rebuild our party and achieve meaningful unity there must be an acknowledgement of what has gone wrong, a proper investigation, major reform, and an end to the practice of bullying and smearing those who dare to ask questions or sound warnings.\nThere are still many people in the SNP and wider movement that seem to see the current mess as a wrinkle to be gotten over and who are keen to point out that our scandals aren’t as bad those of other parties. Many people have been wheeshting for Indy for so long that it is hard to break from that mindset. As an SNP member and supporter of long standing I care about the SNP and still see it as the main political vehicle to lead us to independence. So, in protecting the cause of independence, I also want to save the SNP, but this can only be done if we look at what has gone wrong, how it was able to go wrong and make sure it can never happen again.\nI was impressed, as I so often am given her integrity, by Kate Forbes’ dignified plea to members to stay. I would echo that, but I would not expect members to stay unless they see a firm commitment to address what has gone wrong. This means action now before this disaster engulfs both our new leader and our party. I support the calls by Alex Neill and Bill Ramsay for forensic accountants to be brought in to look at the party’s finances and report back to the party. This needs to be done immediately given the looming deadline with the Electoral Commission on 7 July. As a member of the Westminster group, I had no idea until it came out in the press that auditors had withdrawn their services as overseers of our group accounts. Now, I understand from press reports that the group only has until the end of May to submit properly signed off accounts.\nI also agree with Alex Neil that those who previously opposed reforms to the party’s structures to improve transparency and governance should consider their position and resign. What has gone wrong cannot simply be laid at the door of one individual. The problem is much wider than that and the party’s office bearers cannot delegate their constitutional responsibilities to an employee. Moreover, party HQ is not just the Chief Executive. There are staff specifically employed to deal with legal and operational matters and compliance. Again, looking to the party’s mismanagement rather than any suggestion of criminality we need a proper review of what they have been doing. A new broom is needed at SNP HQ. The selection panel for the new Chief Executive Officer should reflect the widest possible membership base and consist of people who have relevant skills and experience. If the prize of independence is to be won, employees like parliamentarians should be appointed on merit.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_uk-should-help-people-from-and-in-afghanistan/content_216.html": "What the UK should do to help people from and in Afghanistan\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 20th Aug 2021\nThis week I travelled down to Westminster for the recall of parliament, hoping to speak in the debate on the situation in Afghanistan. Alas, I didn’t get taken and nor did most of the SNP MPs who had asked to speak. I’m still glad I went. The level of the tragedy in Afghanistan and the level of concern of my constituents is such that it was my duty to be there to try to articulate our concerns for the Afghan people, particularly women, abandoned to a terrible fate by the insouciance of the Johnson administration and President Biden’s weakness.\nIf I had got to speak, I would have focused on the humanitarian disaster unfolding before our eyes. I would have said we need to help the living, but we must not forget the dead - 71,000 Afghan civilians, 69,000 Afghan soldiers and 457 British servicemen and women killed, and many more on all sides with serious and life-changing physical and mental injuries.\nOur servicemen and women risked their lives to make things better for the people of Afghanistan not worse. I do not presume to speak for them, but I can tell you what one veteran, my constituent John Robertson, who served in Helmand province, told me - “I feared for my own life and that of my brother comrades, but now my biggest fear is for the safety of the civilian population within the whole country, we know the history behind the barbaric Taliban and my fear now is for every woman and child...”\nWe owe it to the sacrifice of those who died, and their memory, to continue to help the people they died to protect. This has been a political failure by a government asleep on the job and it needs a political solution. The UK government must make amends, but in order to do so they must go against the grain of their anti-immigration ideology. In the circumstances that is the least they can do.\nThe proposal to take 5,000 refugees now then another 15,000 over a period of years is wholly inadequate. We need to help way more people than that and to do so we need a full suite of measures at home and abroad. People need help right now; they cannot afford to wait years. The UK should be taking at least 20,000 refugees now with an annual commitment to take more thereafter - the Refugee Council suggest 10,000 a year. We need to take these refugees directly from Afghanistan not just from surrounding countries. Many are trapped there and won't make it out. Refugees International are right to call for a humanitarian corridor. But why didn’t the British government make contingency plans for this before the terrible scenes at Kabul airport transpired?\nThe UNHCR which facilitates refugee resettlement was not even aware of the new British scheme until it was announced. This does not augur well. Even more concerningly the British Government appears to want to reframe and qualify the UNHCR definition of what is required to be a refugee, rather than sticking with the formula tried and tested by the experts on the ground. We must issue visas on a wider scale to the women the UK encouraged to take part in civic society who are now left horribly exposed. This includes teachers who taught female students, those students, politicians, journalists, judges and all those whose lives are now at risk from misogynistic fundamentalists.\nSeparately, the relocation and assistance scheme for Afghans who helped the British military should be reviewed & expanded urgently. It's time to stop overlooking third party contractors, interpreters’ family members, second order workers such as cooks and cleaners, and former interpreters sacked from jobs without the chance to appeal.\nBack home, refugees who make it to the UK using the so called “irregular” routes, such as crossing the channel, should not be criminalised and locked up, as planned Tory changes in the Nationality and Borders Bill, currently going through Parliament, will demand. All removal flights to Afghanistan must be suspended. The rules on refugee family union must be reviewed & expanded so that family members can join Afghanis already safe in the UK. Asylum claims for those already in the UK should be decided on the basis of the current situation and appeals reviewed on that basis.\nFinally, our budget for aid must be fully restored, not just for Afghanistan but for the surrounding countries and countries of first reception in Europe. It is simply not fair to expect countries like Greece to bear the humanitarian toll of the West's mistakes. President Macron is badly wrong about this. Greece is still feeling the effects of austerity and struggling with the effects of climate change. The Greeks cannot be left to deal with another influx of refugees.\nScotland stands ready to do our fair share and more. Contrary to what some ludicrous tory backbencher claimed in the Commons on Wednesday, Scotland took twice as many Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Refugee Resettlement Scheme as the UK average. All 32 Scottish Local Authorities took part. Many of the refugees who came, like the owners of Levant Sweets in Dalry in my constituency, now make a valuable contribution to their community.\nOn BBC Radio Scotland this week, Simon Diggins, a retired army colonel and member of the Sulah Alliance which helps interpreters attempting to leave Afghanistan safely, said Scotland has been ‘extraordinarily generous’ in looking after refugees. In relation to Afghan interpreters, he reminded us that the Scottish government stepped in and allowed them to go to university on Scottish student terms, an offer not matched by the UK Government so far.\nIt’s time for the UK government to take a leaf out of Scotland’s book. We need actions to match the platitudes mouthed by the PM and his pathetic sidekick the Foreign Secretary in the Commons debate. Nothing short of the sort of ambitious package I have outlined above will do.\nThe British Government’s foreign policy has failed. It's time for their humanitarian policy to succeed and in doing so to make amends for a shocking dereliction of duty and breach of trust.\nOne final thought. I am not an abstentionist. Neither I nor my SNP MP colleagues were elected on an abstentionist platform. Most of our constituents expect us to attend Westminster on their behalf. But that does not mean we could not do with a reset of our strategy and approach there. On Wednesday very few SNP speakers were taken, and, in a particular odious ‘point of order’ one Labour backbencher seemed to think we should not even get to make interventions. My friend and colleague Carol Monaghan MP remarked to me that often the SNP behave in Westminster with a respect for the process which is not matched by the respect accorded to us. She is right. Sure, we are the third party, but sometimes it feels like we are there on sufferance. We no longer hold the sway we did in the hung ‘Brexit parliament’. It's time to rethink how we approach things.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_covid-volunteering/content_291.html": "This is what we can achieve when we pull together\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 10th Apr 2020\nWe are all finding new ways of working during lock-down but what can this tell us about how we need to change in the future?\nThe job of an MP during lockdown is very different. Generally, I spend more than half of the week at Westminster and work Fridays and weekends in the constituency. My casework team support people in the constituency every day and I hold a surgery typically once a week for people who want to speak to me directly.\nHowever, in the current crisis, like many people, I am working from home and so my job has become more desk bound, and while Parliament is not sitting, I have much more time on my hands to focus on constituency work, which is just as well as my office is inundated with emails and calls from anxious constituents.\nIn order to make sure the needs of my constituents are met I have been spending a lot of time speaking to community workers and volunteers across Edinburgh South West and the good news is that the crisis has led to a flourishing of community work and outreach projects.\nFrom city centre communities like Fountainbridge and Gorgie/Dalry, through to village communities on the outskirts of the city like Balerno, existing local organisations are joining forces with a host of new volunteers and people who are good neighbours to make sure no one is left without a helping hand during lockdown.\nCommunity hubs like Space in Broomhouse and the Healthy Living Agency and Whale Arts in Wester Hailes have joined forces with smaller enterprises across Edinburgh South West to ensure that vulnerable families, children and older people are supported and fed while schools are closed and many older people are confined to their homes. The Heart of Midlothian football club’s offshoot Big Hearts Community Trust, which has a particular focus on kinship carers, is working alongside them.\nAll these organisations faced a dilemma about how to respond to those in need whilst keeping staff and volunteers safe, bearing in mind the risk that both they and vulnerable service users could be carrying the virus but not showing symptoms. They decided to create a distributed community network which enables organisations across the constituency to share knowledge resources and risk without getting in the way of the work of individual organisations. There is no hierarchy but rather a community working together with small numbers of workers or volunteers operating across a variety of venues using digital platforms to swap ideas, facts and processes. This model of working means that if one organisation’s staff or volunteers become unwell then staff or volunteers from another organisation can step in to help.\nAt the same time, local people are encouraged to be good neighbours and, assuming they are fit and well, to check on those who live alone, help with grocery shopping, take bins out and walk dogs whilst always following the NHS advice. Across the constituency, Facebook and WhatsApp groups have sprung up to facilitate this good neighbourliness. Local faith communities are also very much involved.\nCommunity Councils are rising to the occasion. The City of Edinburgh Council has won plaudits for its online information services during the crisis and the way in which it has also encouraged the good neighbour approach. The Council is coordinating volunteers through Volunteer Edinburgh with a dedicated Covid-19/Coronavirus page listing advice on how to fulfil your role as a good neighbour and how to do so safely. Helping as a neighbour can be more flexible than a formal volunteering role for people during this unprecedented crisis and many are keen to offer their time.\nShopworkers across Scotland have really stepped up during the Covid-19 outbreak and local corner shops have come into their own, which is why I tabled an Early Day motion in the Commons in support of our local shop keepers. For example, Dennis and Lynda Williams at the Oxgangs Broadway convenience store have been doing really amazing work supporting folk with home deliveries of groceries and home-cooked meals and making multiple round trips to ensure vulnerable folk who have to isolate can still top up gas and electricity meters. They have also launched a hardship fund to help local people facing financial hardship as a result of the crisis.\nIn recognition of the power of grassroots activism, early on in the crisis, the First Minister urged the SNP and the wider Independence movement to use their networks to deliver help and assistance during the crisis. Reports from SNP branches suggest this is going well.\nSo, what can we learn from this extraordinary generosity of spirit and pragmatic response for the way in which our country is run? The death of care worker Catherine Sweeney, who dedicated twenty years of her life to helping the vulnerable in her community, reminds us that people like her are the backbone of our society and we must think how better we can recognise that and celebrate their valuable contribution.\nEqually, our local democratic systems can learn much from these models of community-based working which seem to be flourishing and providing an immediate and valuable lifeline during this health crisis.\nLesley Riddoch has written frequently about the shortcomings of local democracy in Scotland. This is not to criticise our councils but to make the point that the average “local” council in Scotland serves a population seventeen times the European average; the physical size is almost 66 times larger than the average German council and it is not the ideal model for service delivery.\nWhat the current crisis shows is that community led service provision models work well with an ability to reach those in need quickly and safely. They are also sustainable. One of the lessons to be learned from the crisis is that small is beautiful. Let’s hope this is a lesson we can take forward when reshaping local democracy in the future.",

However, it has remained silent on one matter that links these two issues: the treatment of LGBTQI+ people in the UK who are fleeing persecution.\nAt this week’s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in London, the government has taken welcome steps to help protect the rights of LGBTQI+ people globally and the ‘Windrush generation’ in the UK. However, it has remained silent on one matter that links these two issues: the treatment of LGBTQI+ people in the UK who are fleeing persecution.\nOn Tuesday, Theresa May acknowledged the role of the UK in putting in place laws criminalising same sex relations during the Colonial era, and said she regrets “the legacy of discrimination, violence and even death that persists today”.\nShe also apologised to Caribbean countries over the treatment of the “Windrush generation”.\nThese are steps in the right direction, but the government would do well to match its apologetic words with action in the UK to protect LGBTQI+ people who are seeking asylum because of persecution in their countries of origin. It needs to stop detaining LGBTQI+ asylum seekers.\nThe UK is the only country in Europe that detains people in immigration removal centres indefinitely. Around half the people that the government detains are eventually released back into the community.\nResearch by Stonewall and the UK Lesbian and Gay Immigration Group has documented the discrimination, harassment and abuse experienced by LGBTQI+ asylum seekers in UK detention centres. Many LGBTQI+ asylum seekers have described how being in detention reminded them of the persecution they were trying to escape. As one man from Pakistan described, “Here in detention it is the same as where I came from. I was so scared”.\nThe impact on their mental health can be disastrous. One woman from Uganda, for example, explained that “I get flashbacks of exactly what happened in Uganda. I get bad nightmares. When I was in detention I even heard voices of this man that raped me who would try to tell me I am worthless. I have tried twice to take an overdose when I was at detention because I couldn’t take it anymore”.\nIn a case regarding the detention of a gay asylum seeker from Iran, The European Court of Human Rights found that “governments should exercise particular care in order to avoid situations which may reproduce the plight that forced these persons to flee in the first place”. Yet the UK government does not recognise that lesbian, gay and bi asylum seekers are at risk of harm in detention. The vulnerability of trans and intersex asylum seekers is recognised but they are still being detained.\nConcern over the detention of LGBTQI+ people has also been raised at the UN. The Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has “noted that in detention facilities there is usually a strict hierarchy, and that those at the bottom of the hierarchy, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, typically suffer double or triple discrimination. Complaints of insults, beatings, confinement and targeted forms of violence are not uncommon”.\nThis week’s Commonwealth leaders meeting is a chance for the UK government to demonstrate in practice leadership on the rights of LGBTQI+ people. As well as promoting the rights of LGBTQI+ people globally, the government should ensure that when the same people are on our shores seeking sanctuary, we treat them with dignity and grant them protection. The government must stop subjecting LGBTQI+ asylum seekers to situations reminiscent of those which they are fleeing – it must stop detaining LGBTQI+ asylum seekers.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_fresh-case-for-scottish-independence/content_232.html": "We must build a fresh case for Scottish Independence\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 16th Jul 2021\nWho shapes the policies that our governments implement? This is one of the questions raised by the investigation “Who runs Scotland?” published this week in the National’s sister paper the Herald. Working with Ferret Scotland they claim that industry and big business dominate access to the UK Government’s Scotland Office Ministers while professional lobbyists, including former politicians, advisors and a former minister have ready access to Scottish Government representatives, whom they seek to influence on behalf of clients including business, charity and industry bodies.\nOf course, there is nothing wrong in this if it’s done transparently, but does it make for better policy making? Without proper scrutiny and due process there is a risk of policy capture – meaning that decision making in a particular policy area is directed towards the interests of specific groups without due consideration for the potential impact on other groups and the wider population. At Westminster some of the think tanks with the greatest influence on the Tory Government’s policy agenda are ruthless organisations dominated by right wing free marketeers and libertarians who are secretive about their funding. This does not make for a healthy democracy.\nIn Scotland the independent policy analysis collective Murray Blackburn Mackenzie have raised questions about the adequacy of institutional safeguards against well organised and highly purposeful lobbying, particularly where groups who may be detrimentally affected do not have the same level of representation.\nIn Germany party affiliated think tanks such as the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung and the Heinrich Boll Stiftung develop centre right, centre left and Green policy. I would love to see something like this in Scotland.\nWhilst we don’t have the same phenomenon on a UK level, a plethora of think tanks surrounds the Westminster machinery of government but Scotland, with a parliament reconvened only 2 decades ago, is less well served. And, sadly, this week we lost one of our most hard working and productive think tanks due to a lack of funding. The independent Scottish Centre for European Relations founded and run by Dr Kirsty Hughes has had a prodigious output over the last four years providing research and analysis on EU and international affairs with a particular focus on Scotland’s European interests and policies. As Brexit has played out SCER’s contribution to understanding what’s going on in the EU, how best to exercise para diplomacy and how, why and whether an independent Scotland could join the EU has been unsurpassed. So why on earth can such an invaluable resource not find the funding it needs to continue?\nFortunately, the work done by SCER to date will be archived and available, but it is concerning that, as distinguished former diplomat Mariot Leslie commented, there is no obvious successor on the Scottish scene at present. SCER’s work was helpful in informing the policy choices that need to be made around Scotland’s economic and trading future and in which our relationship with the EU will be crucial. These choices are important whether or not Scotland becomes independent but for those of us who support independence they are pivotal.\nAlong with others I have repeatedly emphasised that Scotland needs a new prospectus for independence. One that fits the world we live in now which is a very different from the one in which the 2014 referendum took place. The three questions we need most to focus on are the economic prospectus, our trading relationship with the rest of the UK post-Brexit and the route to accession to the EU. These are the questions which repeatedly come up on the doorstep, which are repeatedly put to our leaders and spokespersons and they are not yet sufficiently well equipped to answer satisfactorily.\nOur new Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, Angus Robertson MSP, has welcomed the appointment of Party President Michael Russell to head up SNP preparations for the independence campaign and said that he looks forward to working with him to deliver what the public voted for when they elected a majority of MSPs committed to a second independence referendum. However, it would be unreasonable to expect Mike Russell to come up with the answers to these big policy questions on his own. The work needed to fund policy development can be costly and beyond the reach of already stretched party funding. That’s why the Germans have their model. Besides the SNP party constitution mandates the involvement of conference and the membership in policy formulation as Mike would be the first to recognise.\nThe Scottish government was elected with a mandate to deliver not just a second independence referendum but independence itself. Ultimately a heavy weight of responsibility lies on those who hold the brief for the constitution. I am sure they are mindful of the need to have the arguments required to persuade those not yet convinced of the case for independence. The reality which must be recognised is that support for independence has fallen back from a high watermark of 58% to about 50%. A net increase of 5% in support for independence is a poor return for the last 7 years which have seen three Tory Governments elected, Brexit delivered in the face of overwhelming resistance in Scotland, and the rebarbative Boris Johnson as PM. But all is not lost. I have no doubt that with a lucid new prospectus for independence and a plan for the transition to statehood we could surpass 60% support for independence and build on that to a firm victory in a second vote.\nIt is the role of the civil service to develop and implement the policies of the government of the day as effectively as possible. The paper Scotland’s Place in Europe was an outstanding piece of work and now we need more of the same concerning the current landscape. Prior to the Covid pandemic, on Brexit day, 31 January 2020, Scottish Government policy papers on some of the issues I have identified were promised. Understandably, these were put on pause during the pandemic, but, as we move forward and recover from the pandemic, I would expect this work to have resumed, particularly given that the UK Government is steaming ahead with its constitutional agenda and did not, as we have discovered thanks to the Good Law Project, pause its work on propping up the union during the pandemic.\nThe announcement that a new council has been tasked with drawing up a ten-year national strategy for the “economic transformation” of Scotland does rather beg the question of where independence sits in this plan. Some clarity on this is needed. As others have commented things have gone awfully quiet on the independence front since the election. That does not mean there is no activity, but I would expect the Scottish Parliament to be favoured with a detailed update on this work in the autumn.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_snp-route-to-indy-underlying-issues/content_41.html": "SNP still the best route to indy – but underlying issues must be our focus\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 24th Dec 2021\nChristmas is traditionally a time of peace and reconciliation. There are so many areas of conflict in our world that could benefit from this that I hope I will be forgiven for choosing to write about one that is close to home but very important to readers of the National. Last weekend in the Sunday National, my fellow nationalist, comrade and feminist sister, Ruth Wishart, wrote an impassioned plea for an end to what she called the uncivil war within the Yes movement. I agree with much of what Ruth said but the reality is that there can be no peace and reconciliation without an honest appraisal and acknowledgement of what has led to the conflict and a commitment to address some of the underlying problems.\nI have written about these problems in this column before. I do so not to cause trouble, nor because I want to replace the current leader of the SNP – for the record I don’t - but because I care about the future of my party and my country. I still believe the SNP is the best vehicle to lead us to independence and to provide the leadership the YES movement needs. But, if it is to succeed in doing so, there are some issues to be addressed.\nThere is a democratic deficit in our party. Conference is not playing its proper role as the supreme policy making body of the party. Huge important issues that need addressed go undiscussed, conference after conference. It was curious to say the least, and not conducive to good debate, that our party was the only one that met online rather than in person this Autumn, despite the precedent of the huge gathering at COP26 only a couple of weeks before. Perhaps this was why only hundreds as opposed to thousands of delegates took part and why it was the same old faces on our computer screen, motion after motion.\nThe year before last many of the democratic choices of the membership to serve on our NEC were deliberately side-lined and hounded from office. People were demonised for daring to stand on a platform for reform, or should I say daring to stand on a platform that was not approved by those who stand on their own little platform every year. An attempt to improve transparency and scrutiny is not an attempt to take the party down and it’s a shame that senior party figures continue to characterise it as such. I know the wider membership don’t see it that way.\nIn this year’s election one of our most able and respected MSPs, Joan McAlpine, lost her seat having been removed from the top of the list, where her local members wanted her to be, via a dubious equalities mechanism which served not to improve diversity but to settle a vendetta run by a noisy minority of party members against women who dare to speak up for their rights. These circumstances must never be allowed to be repeated. Particularly as the result has been that many local hard-working activists have lost heart and demitted office from their branches. This is a pattern which has been replicated across the country as members of long standing become scunnered with some of the problems I have outlined.\nAt the heart of the trouble lies a toxic political culture of name calling and demonisation. Political debate will always be impassioned. Indeed it is important that it is. What is wrong with aspects of our current political debate is the abuse and the hyperbole. Instead of relying on slogans and insults, those who wish to persuade others of the correctness of their position should explain the basis for it and discuss the issues that arise without resorting to language designed to close down the debate.\nI have said it before and I will say it again, if the poison, vitriol and downright lies that have been allowed to flourish in the discourse within our party on the potential conflict between reform of the Gender Recognition Act and women’s rights ever infects the independence debate then our cause will be doomed. What’s going on is not without parallel in the history of our nation. During the reformation if you used the word ‘heretic’ everyone got hysterical. During the 17th century the same pattern was repeated with the word ‘witch’. The cancer of hatred and fear reached right to the top of our society, including our king, and many innocent women were executed. The modern-day equivalent of the heretics and witches are the feminist campaigners wrongly called ‘transphobes’ for their wish to highlight the potential implications of self identification of sex.\nEarlier this week, another national columnist, Alison Anderson, took to Twitter to note the rich irony that whilst women executed as witches in Scotland are set to receive pardons, our political leaders fail to acknowledge the damage done by the “name calling, finger pointing, holier than thou modern day witchfinders who persecute women for holding certain beliefs.” Unfortunately, this demonisation is what an influential minority of SNP members are doing at present, not just to their fellow members, but to the public and it is starting to seep into the general consciousness. In the last week two opinion polls have shown that whilst the majority of Scots support equal rights for trans people, they are very unhappy about the implications of a system of self-identification of sex without a gatekeeper.\nFortunately the SNP manifesto did not commit to self-identification but rather to “improve and simplify the process by which a trans person can obtain legal recognition, so that the trauma associated with that process is reduced”. Accordingly there is a room for compromise here and that is why I recently reiterated the call I first made in June 2019 for a Citizens Assembly to look at the issue. Those at the top of politics have a responsibility to rein in the sort of bad behaviour that I have described. That is what true leadership involves.\nThis infighting is not inevitable. It is a common misconception that there is something peculiar to the history of the Scots in our quarrelsome infighting. Of course this is not true. Infighting happens in other nations. Look at the War of the Roses in England. Look at what happened after the Russian and French revolutions. It is not unprecedented for independence movements to fracture. In Catalonia there are several different pro-independence parties who have managed to work together in successive coalition governments.\nI believe that what Scotland needs to win our independence is a mainstream centre left constitutional nationalist party that is a broad church. That party is the SNP or rather it should be. That is why I have not defected to Alba, nor do I intend to do so, no matter how much some might strive to make my life in the SNP intolerable. The bottom line is I don’t give in to bullies.\nRuth ended her column with an excoriation of Boris Johnson. The pages of this newspaper are full of them. And rightly so. In its editorial this week the international Catholic Tablet described the current UK Government as politics without principle led by a man who has surrounded himself with second rate career politicians. They deplored the absence of virtue, integrity and truth in the UK’s public life.\nHowever, for those of us who support independence, as much as Boris Johnson may be a gift, our case cannot simply be ‘not this’. It must be ‘instead this.’ We need the much-promised fresh prospectus for independence and we need it now. We also need a clear roadmap to achieving it. The uncivil war won’t stop until we have these things, and we won’t get them until the party rediscovers its intellectual and democratic roots. We need a return to the sort of open, vigorous and honest debate that led to the adoption of our current policy on NATO. It goes without saying that tackling the current Covid crisis must be the priority of the Scottish government. We have a First Minister whose commitment to that task is not in doubt, likewise our Deputy FM and Finance Secretary. We also have dedicated health ministers. But there are others in our government who could be working on the roadmap and prospectus for independence. We have a Secretary of State for the Constitution with junior ministers and a government department behind him. In 2022 we need to hear something from them.",

The tributes to him were warm, heartfelt and humbling. The universal esteem in which he was held is a reminder that there is good (as well as bad) in every political party. Although he held many political positions with which I and readers of this column would strongly disagree, Sir David was undoubtedly a kind and generous man who tried to do the right thing according to his conscience. The UK parliament is the poorer for his loss.\nSir David spent his entire parliamentary career, which spanned 4 decades, as a backbencher. Backbenchers, freed from the onerous duties of Ministers or Shadow Ministers, have more time on our hands to pursue good causes brought to our attention by constituents or campaign groups and he was very skilled at doing so. While the primary focus of any SNP MP must be independence for Scotland it is only right that for so long as we are at Westminster, we use the power we have as MPs to do good for those who struggle to help themselves and Sir David’s career is a good exemplar of how to do that.\nWhen I heard of his murder last weekend, I was preparing to travel to speak at a large international feminist conference in Portsmouth. I decided still to go and although the weekend was interrupted by constant press requests for comment on MP safety in the wake of Sir David’s killing, I was glad I had gone, particularly as I had the opportunity to meet live via zoom with women in Africa who really need the help and support of parliamentarians in Scotland and the UK.\nThe women I met with are lesbians living in a refugee camp in Kakuma in the North-western region of Kenya. It’s been there for nearly 30 years and together with the nearby Kalobeyei settlement it houses around 200,000 refugees and asylum seekers. Lesbians escaping violence and lesbophobia in their home countries are sent to the Kakuma refugee camp by the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, because it has a dedicated LGBT Block 13. However, this identifies them to other refugees in the camp and they suffer ongoing violence and abuse as a result. Unfortunately, both UNHCR and local police are failing to protect them. As well as inadequate food and shelter, along with other LGBT refugees, these young lesbian women and their children are suffering constant physical and sexual abuse. Women are being raped. The Violence in the camps is awful, in the last few months a baby died after being hit by a tear gas canister and two young men were attacked with a firebomb. One of them later died from his injuries. Despite this, the women told us they still struggle to get UNHCR or the local police to take their concerns seriously.\nIt’s a difficult issue, much of Africa is still deeply homophobic and lesbophobic. Many of the women who spoke to us had fled Uganda after being subjected to abusive forced marriages. They had endured both domestic and sexual violence, suffering from their vulnerability both as women and as lesbians in a country where same sex acts are illegal. When these women make it to Kakuma they continue to be at risk both as a result of their sex and their sexual orientation.\nWhile adequate food, shelter and medical assistance are a priority, UNHCR need to provide some form of security for these women and to provide legal advice to enable them to move on with their immigration status.\nThe British Government also needs to do more, particularly given our historic links with Uganda and Kenya. Priti Patel herself is the child of Ugandan Asians who were welcomed by the UK when Idi Amin expelled them from their home country in the 1970s. I intend to remind her of this as I ask her to do something to help the women of Block 13. In modern day Uganda same-sex relationships are illegal. Many LGB Ugandans live secret lives, presenting as straight to the world. The necessity to do that often makes it more difficult from them to prove their sexuality if they can make it to the UK where they come up against a tough asylum system. Shamefully Home Office officials often ask inappropriate and demeaning questions of LGB refugees from Uganda and our asylum system retraumatises the already traumatised pushing them through humiliating hoops to prove their sexuality.\nThis needs to change but sadly the Nationality Bill going through the commons will make our already hostile asylum scheme worse. This week, as protestors outside parliament demanded that the UK make Refugees welcome, at the Joint Committee of Human Rights we heard evidence from legal experts, Médecins Sans Frontiers and UNHCR, about the terrible impact this bill will have on Britain’s once proud reputation as a ‘Global Refugee Champion’. Rather than pushing back or criminalising asylum seekers in the English Channel, the UK Government needs to provide safe legal routes to the UK and to collaborate with other countries on global resettlement schemes. The misery of Afghans who fled their country to Britain only to languish in shoddy hotel rooms without work or schooling is shameful and makes a travesty of the promised ‘Operation Warm Welcome’.\nThis petty, mean, approach will only change if politicians and members of the public pressurise Tory MPs to honour our humanitarian responsibilities. Meantime if you want to help the women of Block 13 in Kakuma you can do so by writing to UNHCR as well as your MP. Full information and template letters can be found at www.filia.org.uk.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_i-felt-demonised-by-my-own-party-because-i-just-wouldnt-wheesht/content_3.html": "I felt demonised by my own party because I just wouldn't 'wheesht'\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 31st May 2024\nYesterday saw the publication of a book which chronicles the long running campaign to protect women's sex-based rights in Scotland. In “The Women Who Wouldn’t Wheesht” more than thirty women tell their personal stories. I am proud to be one of them. My fellow authors include famous established writers such as JK Rowling, respected journalists like former MSP Joan McAlpine and Mandy Rhodes, Labour, Tory, SNP and Alba politicians, and survivors of male abuse who have written anonymously about their experience of being rejected as witnesses by the Holyrood committee that scrutinised the plans for gender recognition reforms.\nThe anonymous writer known as @Dis_critic on X also explains why she came up with the phrase “Women Won’t Wheesht”. Her phrase sums up the fight against efforts to silence women who wish to question or scrutinise a variety of policies pushed by determined lobbyists who believe that gender identity is more important than sex, that anyone should be able to self-identify into the opposite sex and that women must accept men who do so as women without question. It is a fight which is still taking place, but which is beginning to be won.\nThis ideology has taken root in public institutions not just in Scotland but across the United Kingdom including our police, our prosecution service, our courts, our prisons, our schools, colleges and universities, our political parties, and our parliament. Most shamefully it has taken root in organisations set up by women for women such as Women's Aid and Rape Crisis. Just last week an employment tribunal found that a woman was bullied out of her job at Edinburgh Rape Crisis (ERC) for questioning an approach which put adherence to this ideology above the needs of the female victims of male violence who Rape Crisis was set up to serve. This happened on the watch of a man who self-identifies as a woman appointed as Chief Executive of ERC despite the position being advertised as a job for a woman. Many are asking why this person is still in their job.\nWomen have been called “hateful” for questioning this ideology. Grassroots groups like For Women Scotland and LGB Alliance set up by lifelong feminist and lesbian activists have been maliciously labelled as “Hate Groups.” Statements of biological fact such as the statement that a woman is an adult human female have been described as “hate speech”. Accusations of transphobia have been used to silence perfectly reasonable concerns, women have been removed from social media platforms, had websites and social media forums shut down, been bullied and harassed at work, lost jobs and even been arrested, questioned and prosecuted for speech that was perfectly lawful.\nUnder the influence of lobby groups like Stonewall and the Equality Network organisations adopted policies and guidance which prevented people using ordinary language about the sexes. It was said that there should be “no debate”. Proposals were made for new laws on hate crimes that could have criminalised those who held the view that sex was more important than gender.\nThe story of how this came about in Scotland and the story of the fight to resist it is a cautionary tale from which we all must learn.\nThe editors who had the excellent idea of putting this book together are journalist Susan Dalgety and policy analyst Lucy Hunter Blackburn. My co-author and former SNP activist Caroline McAllister has pointed out that women's history is rarely recorded by those present and that alone is enough to justify this important book. However, it is also important because the story of what happened to these women for speaking up for the rights of women and girls and for the rights of lesbians does not reflect well on how we do politics in Scotland and politicians of all parties need to read it and learn the lessons.\nI have written a chapter about what happened to me when I spoke out. It tells how I was demonised, ostracised, bullied, and harassed for speaking up for the rights of women and lesbians and how I had to fight against attempts to have me suspended or expelled from the SNP. It does not reflect well on those who did the bullying or on the leadership of Nicola Sturgeon who famously said the views of women like me were “not valid” and tried to brand us a racists and homophobes as well as transphobes.\nPeople sometimes ask me why I have stayed in the SNP despite this treatment. The answer is quite simple. Firstly, one should never give in to bullies. Secondly, the SNP was founded by intellectuals, artists, poets, and thinkers. The lack of debate and the Stalinist adherence to the leadership line which was expected in the Sturgeon years would have been anathema to them. Thirdly, I knew that this ideology had been adopted without any proper debate or discussion in the party and that many activists and members were very unhappy about it although they were afraid to say so. Finally, I knew that the policies being advanced would be damaging to my party and my country as well as women, girls and LGB people and I felt it was my duty to stay and fight against them. I still do.\nI am pleased that under the leadership of Humza Yousaf and now John Swinney steps have been taken to distance the SNP from Nicola Sturgeon’s approach on this issue, to encourage respectful debate and an end to the demonising of women who dare to dissent. I am hopeful that things will now start to improve in the SNP.\nHowever, the lessons which need to be learned from this book go way beyond the SNP. Politicians from all political parties demonised the Women Who Wouldn’t Wheesht while lionising trans activists some of whom subsequently turned out to have rather unsavoury histories. And yes, Alex Cole Hamilton, I am thinking of you. The Scottish Green party, unable to cope with the fact that the tide is turning on this ideology, recently expelled several longstanding activists for daring to speak up for women’s rights.\nThere are also lessons to be learned for the Scottish parliament particularly as it approaches its 25th anniversary and for candidates in the UK General Election. Shallow virtue signalling is no substitute for evidence-based policy making. Human rights are universal. Sometimes rights conflict, compromise is necessary but compromises that destroy the rights of one group in favour of another are unfair. There is no hierarchy of protected characteristics under the Equality Act and care must be taken to ensure that policy and legislation does not discriminate against one protected characteristic such as sex or sexual orientation in favour of another such as gender reassignment. Safeguarding matters should never be ignored.\nParliamentary committees whose job it is to scrutinise legislation should not be made up of partisan zealots who are only interested in one side of the argument. Parliamentarians are elected to legislate for all, to sift complex information and to weigh difficult choices. We need people in our parliaments who are prepared to do that and who won’t just follow party or lobbyists lines without demur.\nAbove all, Scotland needs to do politics better in future.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_i-saw-inside-manston/content_20.html": "This is what I saw inside the notorious Manston asylum centre\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 11th Nov 2022\nLast week I wrote about the outcry over the conditions in which asylum seekers were being kept at the Manston Asylum facility in Kent. This week I went to see for myself. The visit was organised by Westminster’s Home Affairs Committee, and I was invited along as Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. My SNP colleagues Stuart McDonald MP and Anum Qaisar MP were also on the visit. Unlike Suella Braverman we travelled by train and minibus not Chinook helicopter.\nThe site at Manston is a former RAF base dating back to the First World War. It is now a facility designed to put new arrivals through the asylum assessment process before they are moved on to hotel accommodation or, in some cases, immigration detention prior to removal. No one should really be there for more than 24 hours, and it is designed to deal with a maximum of 1600 people at a time. But as is now well known it has ended up housing around 4,000 people at a time with some of them being there as long as 28 days. When we arrived on Tuesday morning its population had been reduced again to about 1,500 but we were told that officials expect it to get very busy and overcrowded again soon.\nAs we entered the camp, we could see tents surrounded by fences with disconsolate looking young men wrapped in blankets standing around on small patches of asphalt outside the tents afforded for the taking of fresh air. Bags of discarded clothing and bedding awaiting removal lie around everywhere. We were taken to see the processing facilities people are taken through on arrival. These are pretty rudimentary but there are refreshment facilities and other basic needs are catered for. We were pleased to see notices on the wall advising of the right to legal advice and how to access it. However, they could do with being bigger and in languages other than English. Processing can be hampered by the fact that Brexit means the UK no longer has access to EURODAC, the EU’s multinational biometric data base which contains the fingerprints of all asylum applicants from each EU member state and people apprehended in irregular border crossings.\nNext we were taken to what was described as the “family marquee’. Inside a large tent we found several young couples with children. There were 166 children in total in the camp the day we visited. The adults were mainly seated on makeshift seating or lying on the floor looking depressed and unhappy while the children ran around. Some of the children pulled at my coat telling me their names and that they wanted to go to school. One of their fathers had a little English and explained that all the families in the room were Iraqi Kurds. Some had been in the marquee for 11 or 13 days. There is nothing for them to do and only a small area with fake grass on asphalt for them to take fresh air. There are no exercise facilities. At night they sleep on thin mattresses of the sort normally supplied to those in police custody. There are basic toilet and shower facilities which appeared reasonably clean.\nIt was hard to move on from this tent. As visitors to the site, we had been issued with the same high visibility jackets worn by staff and therefore had an official air. Naturally the families there thought we might be able to help them. I tried to explain our role as parliamentarians, but I am not sure if they understood. The adults and some of the children were visibly distressed.\nFrom there we moved on to what we were told was better quality hotel style accommodation in a building which had formally accommodated the officers mess. A door opened to reveal a young couple in a stuffy bedroom with very basic furniture. The wife was weeping. With broken English we understood they too were Iraqi Kurds and had been there for 28 days. Their two little girls aged 4 and 5 were outside playing. Their mum told me they have nits and showed me the treatment for it she had obtained from the medical centre. Her husband indicated that he is very concerned for her mental health. She tugged at my arm pleading for me to help her. It was very upsetting. We were advised that it is more difficult to move families on than single men because of the challenge of finding hotel rooms large enough to accommodate family groups or a number of rooms together to afford separate accommodation for older male and female children.\nI was impressed by the staff I met. I believe they are trying to do their best in very difficult circumstances. I was particularly impressed by the medics headed up by an expert in Accident and Emergency medicine. His account of the state of some of the refugees was harrowing. He told me how many are covered in skin pustules after weeks of sleeping rough and that some tested positive for Diphtheria and MRSA when swabbed. There are worries that public health measures may require to be taken in due course.\nI was struck by the fact that despite all the scare stories about Albanian ‘economic migrants”, the families who we met were all Iraqi Kurds. The Kurds remain a stateless nation. Britain has occupied Iraq and Kurdistan twice in the last 100 years. We have been happy to use their services as allies to fight against Saddam Hussein and ISIS/Daesh and as interpreters in war zones. In turn they have been targeted as an ethnic group by despotic regimes. I think it is fair to say we owe them a debt of gratitude.\nIt was particularly fitting that we were accompanied on our visit by Alf Dubs, the Labour Peer. Alf was born in Prague in 1932 and at the age of 6 was one of over 600 mainly Jewish children evacuated to England on the kindertransport. He has had a distinguished career in public life. Elected as a Labour MP in 1979 he went on to be director of the Refugee Council and was made a life peer in 2004. At the age of 89 he continues to be active in the House of Lords particularly in the cause of child refugees. His “Dubs Amendment” to the 2016 Immigration Act gathered cross party support and was designed to ensure that unaccompanied refugee children in Europe could be reunited with family members in the UK. Ultimately it was dishonoured by the Johnson government who voted down attempts to guarantee continued family reunion in the UK for such children after Brexit.\nAs we remember our war dead this Remembrance Day, we need to remember the kind of world that those who died in World War Two were fighting for. The kind of world for which brave RAF pilots flying from Manston during the Battle of Britain gave their lives to save these islands from Nazi invasion. I believe it was the kind of world typified by politicians like Alf Dubs, not Suella Braverman. It was not a world where asylum seeking families displaced by the aftermath of a war in which the British government was fully embroiled should be reduced to sleeping on the floors of improvised refugee camps on British soil for weeks on end.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_when-i-wrote-about-discrimination-i-didnt-expect-to-be-next/content_261.html": "When I wrote about discrimination, I didn’t expect to be next\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 05th May 2023\nWhen last week I wrote about the discrimination against gender critical women in public life I had no idea that I was about to join their ranks. For all the column inches, tweets and vox pops expended this week what has happened to me is really quite simple. In January of this year after an approach from my colleague and friend Tommy Sheppard MP, the Stand Comedy Club invited me to appear as one of their guests in a series of ‘In Conversation’ events at this year’s fringe. I said yes.\nThere was no financial gain in it for me, but I thought it might be fun. What was envisaged was a wide-ranging chat about my career in politics. I did a similar event with Matt Forde at last year’s Fringe, and it was a sell-out. I enjoyed it, the audience seemed to do so as well and there was no problem. So, to be clear, the event is not about trans rights, it is not my event, it’s the Stand’s event and I agreed to do it at their invitation albeit through an intermediary.\nNow they have cancelled it because some of their staff don’t feel “comfortable” working with me because of my views about Self-ID and are refusing to work at an event at which I am platformed. I understand they think I am transphobic. They are wrong about that. I support equal rights for trans people as afforded under the Equality Act’s widely drawn protected characteristic of gender reassignment. However, I don’t support the notion that any man should be able to self-identify as a woman and certainly not without any safeguards. Although some people claim that it is “best practice’ there is no legal basis for saying that self-identification is a human right. Indeed, the current system of Gender Recognition that applies across the UK and the safeguards it contains have been held to be compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court on Human Rights has said that where somebody wishes to change their legal identity ‘stringent’ procedures aimed at identifying the underlying motivation are justified. So, my beliefs are grounded in international human rights law.\nAs a Gender critical lesbian feminist, I believe that sex is immutable, a biological fact and not the same thing as gender, which is a social construct. I do not believe that a man can become a woman simply because he says he so and I don’t think lesbians have penises. That those beliefs are worthy of respect and protected under the Equality Act protected characteristic of ‘religion or belief” is a matter of law, settled now in a number of cases thanks to a woman called Maya Forstater who took the test case.\nTo discriminate against someone including refusing them a service on the basis that they hold these beliefs is unlawful just as it would be if the staff at the Stand refused to work at an event platforming someone who was Catholic, disabled or from an ethnic minority. Also, as well as being wrong, it is very damaging to my reputation and to my personal safety to allege that my beliefs are transphobic. I know that to my cost because wrongful allegations of transphobia against me have led to both rape and death threats. Public misrepresentation of my position has consequences for me and those close to me.\nAnti-discrimination law is quite clear that companies such as the Stand cannot hide behind the discriminatory views of their staff in order to avoid a claim of discrimination. Otherwise, someone who owns a bar could say, for example, that they would love to welcome black customers into their pub but cannot do so because their staff would not serve them.\nIt is amazing how many people, particularly how many politicians and at least one trade union do not seem to understand this. It is also surprising how many people including politicians think that the right to free speech stops as soon as someone is offended by a view with which they disagree. And it is astonishing how many people fall back on the argument that because I get to air my views elsewhere such as in the pages of this newspaper or on the radio or in a podcast, its ok for the Stand to no-platform me. I wonder if the same people would say to a Catholic who got refused a pint in a pub on account of their faith, oh cheer up I am sure another pub will serve you? It is really very, very silly.\nLast year when the committee I chair at Westminster was looking at the issue of Human Rights reform and recommending resisting Tory attempts to roll back human rights protections, we also recommended that there should be better civic education on human rights law to ensure people understood that human rights are universal. I am starting to think the same recommendation should be made in respect of Equality Law because it is alarming to hear that a Cabinet Secretary such as Lorna Slater is so ignorant about both the extent of the protections under the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of belief and the extent of the protections afforded by anti-discrimination law.\nUnfortunately, her ignorance of the law seems widespread and already the Stand’s actions are having a knock-on effect and emboldening bullies such as the ironically named “Cabaret Against Hate” who are now campaigning to get another Edinburgh venue to cancel an event featuring female poets who hold the same views as me.\nFor all these reasons, but particularly to protect other women who don’t have the same voice as me, it is important that I as a public figure take a stand against this sort of discrimination.\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has written to me. I have been quite overwhelmed by the number of messages of support. Someone asked me what the ratio was between messages of support for my stance and messages supporting the Stand and I can tell you it is about 99:1. I am also very grateful to SNP colleagues and other politicians who have spoken up in my support and for the pastoral support I have received from the leader of the SNP Westminster Group and the Chief Whip.\nThe anonymous operator of the Cabaret against Hate twitter account wondered how I am managing to get my other work done this week. I was happy to reassure him, for I am pretty sure it is a he, that I am used to working long hours and like most women I am reasonably good at multi-tasking. This week I have been primarily focused on preparations, including the presentation of a parliamentary petition, for my meeting with the PM to put pressure on him to make sure the UK offers safe sanctuary to female judges and prosecutors left behind in Afghanistan who are now in mortal danger from the Taliban. This took place on Wednesday. It was a good meeting, and I am hopeful he will act. I also found time to host an event at Westminster about health and safety in the workplace on behalf of the Association for Project Safety who are based in my constituency, to meet with the UN Special Rapporteur on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity who is currently visiting the UK and to chair a lengthy meeting of the Joint Committee on Human Rights as well as overseeing my constituency staff team’s work on constituency casework. So, life goes on.\nMany readers of this newspaper and fellow Yessers have been very supportive. I look forward to meeting with some of you at the Independence March in Glasgow tomorrow. We are marching in support of the sovereignty of the Scottish people and for a better Scotland. That will mean a more tolerant Scotland where yes, we can disagree, but respectfully. I would hope that is what most of us want.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_duty-to-stand-against-abuse-of-power/content_279.html": "Events in America serve as a reminder of healing after division\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 22nd Jan 2021\nThe inauguration of Joe Biden this week has been a moment of hope in dark and difficult times. It has reminded us that national renewal is possible after a period of division and turmoil. The international euphoria was palpable. Some might say a little over the top. But for myself I must confess I was both laughing with joy and crying with relief as the new President and Vice President took their oaths of office. America, the so-called land of the free, has had a pretty rough time recently. The storming of the Capitol was shocking. But so too are the endless series of brutal homicides of black men at the hands of the state.\nIn a lecture marking the approach of Holocaust Memorial Day, David Miliband has argued that the fact that the most powerful democratic country in the world is under attack from within is symptomatic of the retreat of the rule of law across the world. He reminded us that those who are in thrall to government cannot hold them in check and that we all have a duty of vigilance to stand against the abuse of power. He criticised the tone of contemporary political discourse and argued we should aspire to passionate disagreement and avoid demonization of those with whom we disagree.\nThe retreat of the rule of law can be seen closer to home as the United Kingdom Government thumbs its nose at the international rights-based order and this week refused to reconsider trade agreements with regimes found by the courts to be committing genocide. And indeed, even in Scotland, we should not be complacent as new allegations came to light this week about the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody. The time it has taken to get to a public inquiry into this matter is unacceptable but now we must let it take its course. Meantime everyone in Scotland can surely acknowledge that Black Lives Matter and equality is something we must honour by our deeds not just by our words.\nPresident Biden is, of course, of Irish descent and rightly proud of that. Yet this week the land of his forebears was coming to terms with its own scandal. Last Friday, the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation reported on the abuses perpetrated on unmarried women and their children in Ireland in the period 1922 to 1998. The report described a “brutally misogynistic culture”, the enforced institutionalisation of thousands of unmarried women and the death of 9,000 children and babies – a mortality rate much higher than the national mortality rate at the time. Many of the children didn’t even get a proper burial.\nAnyone who has seen the film ‘Philomena” based on a true story will recognise the horror of the practice of sending young unmarried women to institutions where they gave birth, sometimes in brutal conditions, and then were separated from their children who were often offered up for adoption against their wishes.\nThe report was met with controversy. Some felt that the Church and State had got off rather lightly with too much focus on the families of the women and the men who abandoned them. Other commentators, to their shame, sought to take the structural oppression of women out of the equation altogether. The respected journalist Fintan O’Toole countered that the fear instilled in unmarried mothers was the very epitome of coercive control. He was right.\nBut it was left to the President of Ireland to centre the suffering of the women and children at the heart of the scandal and to lay responsibility firmly at the door of the Church and the State. One paragraph of his compassionate and shrewd statement in particular caught my eye:\n“It is the State that is charged with safeguarding the welfare of its most vulnerable citizens, and it is the State that must bear primary responsibility for failing to provide appropriate supports for these tens of thousands of young women and their children. It is important, too, to recognise, and with what consequences, how a newly independent State was captured by a judgemental, authoritarian version of Church/State relations that sought to be the sole and ultimate arbiter of morality.”\nHow did it to come this? Irish independence was born with high ideals. The Proclamation of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic began with the words “Irishmen and Irishwomen” and went on to guarantee “religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens” and promised to cherish the children of the nation. Many of the revolutionary generation who brought about Irish Independence espoused socialism, sexual liberation and radical feminism. They aspired to tackle the inequality endemic in Irish society under British rule and to tackle poverty in what were some of the worst slums in Europe. The first Dail boasted the first female cabinet minister anywhere in the world outside communist Russia and she was the minister for Labour at that. But within years censorship had taken hold together with a terrible heartless prudery in sexual matters and the worst sort of misogyny.\nThe story of these mothers and babies is a warning from recent history of the dangers of institutional capture and what can happen when a special interest group, intolerant of any departure from their orthodoxy, gets the ear of government to the exclusion of others. It should also sound a warning for those who wish to control the thoughts, speech and actions of others in order to conform with their belief system. And it is a warning that even those who start out with high ideals of equal rights and civil liberty don’t always live up to those ideals.\nI think most people would agree that there could and should be no place for authoritarianism in an independent Scotland. And that there should be no place for those who do not respect and provide for the needs of women and children. Human rights and equality are for all and no one has the monopoly on belief systems. As we look at events across the world from American to Ireland it is good to be reminded of this.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_snp-need-new-strategy-so-scotland-can-thrive/content_278.html": "SNP need a new strategy so Scotland can thrive\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 08th May 2020\nFive years ago today, voters went to the polls in the 2015 General Election. Fifty per cent of voters in Scotland voted SNP and the party returned 56 out of the 59 Scottish MPs. The outcome was unprecedented and was described by some as the SNP Tsunami. I was lucky enough to be one of those 56 MPs and I have been reflecting on the experience and the lessons to be learned. For me, the biggest lesson is that simply winning elections under the current constitutional set-up of the United Kingdom is not enough to further the cause of independence.\nDespite the fact that members of the 56 worked hard in the 2015-2017 Westminster parliament, and in their constituencies, when the snap General Election came in 2017, the party was ill-prepared to defend our record. We struggled to articulate the benefits of having such a large representation at Westminster with the result that we lost 21 seats and some very talented colleagues. In the end, that proved a setback for independence because the First Minister felt impelled to ‘reset’ the Indyref2 timetable.\nIn the 2017-2019 parliament, despite our decreased numbers, we made a more significant impact because we held the balance of power in a hung parliament. In contrast with the shambolic official opposition, undermined by Labour’s internal warfare, we shone as disciplined, organised and united, and earned the title of ‘the real opposition’ even from commentators south of Scotland. In particular, when it came to Brexit we spoke with one voice, representing the views of the overwhelming majority of voters in Scotland. Our MPs were at the forefront of cross party working which led to some major defeats for the Tory government.\nIn the 2019 General Election, the esteem in which the Scottish electorate held us for that performance led to an increase in our MPs from 35 to 48. But now we are stuck back in a parliament where the Tories have a massive majority from English constituencies and where, like the 2015-2017 parliament, we are relatively powerless, because we can always be outvoted. The startling lack of democracy in the make-up of the Scottish Affairs Committee pretty much tells you all you need to know. Despite our election promises, Brexit has not been stopped and our request for a second Independence referendum has been refused. These harsh facts mean that the SNP needs a major rethink of our strategy, and not just at Westminster.\nLast weekend, an opinion poll predicted a resounding victory for the SNP at the next Scottish election. While these results are to be welcomed as a quite amazing achievement for a party that has been in government for 13 years, I would caution against complacency. Currently, we are at the peak of a crisis led by a leader who is widely respected and trusted. However, when the peak of the crisis is over and we start return to some degree of normality, that won’t be enough. After World War Two was won, when Britain went to the polls, voters chose not the leader who won the war but Clement Atlee who had a radical plan for the peace.\nAfter this crisis is over people may well be in mood for radical change in Scotland. We need to make sure the SNP is the party of that radical change. We exist to win independence for Scotland not for the sake of it but to make sure that the vital decisions about how we run our economy and our society are taken closer to home so that we can do things differently and better. This means that despite the current crisis work should be continuing apace within our party on policy development and strategic direction.\nWhile dealing with the public health emergency and saving lives must be the priority of the Scottish Government, the SNP as a party rather than as a government should be looking to our overall strategy and our policy direction. There are many party members, elected officials and office bearers in the SNP, who are not members of the government and who currently have time on their hands. Whilst parliamentarians’ primary focus must be on their constituents’ concerns, we have more bandwidth than usual because the Westminster and Holyrood parliaments are running to very reduced timetables. There are plenty of resources to call upon both in and outwith the party. It is clear from reading this newspaper that many of those who write for it and read it are brimming with ideas. Think tanks like Common Weal and the Scottish Centre for European Relations are churning out interesting papers. It is worth remembering that the Beveridge report was written during the Second World War. This crisis, although very different, offers a similar moment of clarity that we should seize and use to embrace fundamental change.\nThe FM has made it clear that easing the lockdown will be something that happens over months rather than weeks. Many of us can expect to be working from home for quite some time. Whether the party’s October conference can take place in the normal way must be in doubt. This means the party will have to use online platforms to maintain party democracy and facilitate policy development during the pandemic. This should not be too much of challenge. If the dinosaur of the Westminster parliament can adapt so quickly and surprisingly well to virtual working than so can our party. Debate is good and healthy. It is only by entertaining new ideas and sometimes by disagreeing with each other that we move forward to develop policy and strategy. Now is the time for the SNP to do the work to create the vision for the Scotland we want to see at the other end of this crisis.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_stories_the-week-that-westminster-paved-the-way-to-reject-a-brexit-deal/content_63.html": "Joanna Cherry: The week that Westminster paved the way to reject a Brexit deal\nThis article first appeared in The Sunday National on 16th September 2018.\nAs Westminster returns briefly after the summer break before rising again for the three-week conference recess, the only show in town is Brexit. Yet apart from a statement by Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on the first day back, PMQs and rather a lacklustre and poorly attended debate on the Monday of the second week, not much has happened on the floor of the House.\nMost of the interesting action is off stage, as different Leave factions jockey for position; Boris Johnson once again resorts to a tasteless comment to get attention for his plot to unseat the Prime Minister, the European Research Group (ERG) go on manoeuvres, scaremongering about the consequences of no deal reaches fever pitch and the Scottish Tories try to concoct an implausible narrative that the problems of Brexit are somehow the fault of the SNP.\nOn the day before Parliament resumes, the Brexit Select Committee goes to Brussels to talk to Michel Barnier about the progress of negotiations.\nHe is negative regarding the economic aspects of Chequers, less so regarding the security aspects – and the debate over whether the Chequers deal is dead rages on resembling nothing so much as Monty Python’s dead parrot sketch.\nOn the first day back Dominic Raab looks like a frightened rabbit as he delivers his Brexit update, caught in the headlights of the sort of truck that will soon be backed up at Dover. I am reminded of the article by Marina Hyde, where she described the new Brexit secretary as having a face that says “I need to take back control of my sphincter”.\nI attend a briefing by Best for Britain who are keen for a People’s Vote. I point out that as Scotland’s voters and parliament have been routinely ignored and outvoted throughout the Brexit process, if they want SNP support for a People’s Vote they will have to give us something pretty major in return, for example by conceding that it is the Scottish Parliament who should decide when the next Independence referendum is held.\nOn Thursday I head home to Scotland to attend the annual CBI dinner in Glasgow. There I detect an unfortunate note of resignation about the inevitability of Brexit.\nThe missed opportunities of the last independence vote are underlined when I speak with a major employer in my constituency who is opening an office in Dublin to cope with the likely loss of financial passporting after March 29, 2019.\nAt my surgery the next day, as happens most weeks, a constituent comes to see me keen for the SNP to get behind the idea of a People’s Vote.\nIt’s a subject which arises again on Sunday at the National Assembly in Edinburgh, where by far the largest discussion point is the Growth Commission’s currency recommendations.\nThere is concern that using the pound could mean that Scotland won’t have the independent monetary policy required for EU accession.\nMany of us conclude that there is room for compromise on currency, with a shorter period of Sterlingisation leading into having our own currency. All are agreed there is an urgent need to formulate a policy which the whole party can get behind given the potential proximity of a general election, independence referendum or People’s Vote.\nBack at Westminster on the Tuesday evening of week two the SNP group meets in a room right next door to the one where the ERG is meeting. We are sorely tempted to put a glass to the wall but there is really no need as they leak their plans to oust the PM in time for the 10 o’clock news.\nOn Wednesday morning I’m at Brexit select committee haggling over the draft of our latest report on the progress of the negotiations. Halfway through our lengthy discussion Victorian throwback Jacob Rees-Mogg announces he is leaving to launch the ERG’s report on the solution to the Irish border problem.\nThis comes as news to most of us and we are agog to hear what he will say. He refuses a preview but returns in time to vote against our report. The Remainers outvote the Brexiteers and we will produce another majority report next week giving a realistic update.\nOur deliberations are interrupted by PMQs where I note the benches behind the Prime Minister are considerably more sparse than usual as many of the ERG are still at their launch. As usual Corbyn misses an open goal on Brexit and it is left to Ian Blackford to hit the back of the net.\nMeanwhile, Juncker’s State of the Union speech in Brussels simultaneously scorns the Chequers proposals whilst still holding out the possibility of a deal which will keep the UK close to the EU.\nThe week peters out with more alarming warnings about the consequences of no deal as Dominic Raab insults British business and threatens to withhold the severance payments which have already been agreed with the EU.\nAt the same time, the Bank of England issue more dire warnings of financial armageddon in the face of a no deal, and an interv\nention from Vince Cable on the implications of a People’s Vote for a second independence referendum serves as a reminder as to why the LibDems are a spent force in Scottish politics.So what does all this mean for the SNP? During the last week a visitor from a major Irish stakeholder told me that “Scotland has gone off the radar”. And it does indeed seem a long time since the First Minister went to Brussels in the aftermath of the EU referendum and Juncker said “Scotland has earned the right to be heard in Europe”. We must fight hard to put Scotland’s future back at the top of the agenda and work solidly to build alliances with our European friends.\nIt’s clear that the Tory Government is deliberately hyping up the consequences of no-deal Brexit so as to blackmail their opponents on all sides into voting for whatever deal Theresa May can secure – no matter how bad it is for the economy and how unpalatable to the ERG.\nI don’t think the Chequers plan is dead and I believe it will probably be a springboard to a deal which the EU can live with, but for which there will be no majority at Westminster.\nThere is a serious chance of a deal by mid-November involving the UK backing down on the Northern Irish backstop and a fudged political declaration regarding the future relationship.\nIt is unlikely to be acceptable to the DUP or the ERG. Labour want a general election so most of them will vote it down and there are no circumstances in which the SNP could support a deal which takes Scotland out of the single market and the customs union, so we will also vote against.\nIn the event that Westminster rejects the deal, we must have a position on what should happen next.\nThe options would likely be a People’s Vote or a general election. If it’s full steam ahead to a no-deal Brexit or if Westminster votes to accept the deal, Brexit will happen, and in that event, we have to decide when to hold the independence referendum for which we have a mandate.\nWhat needs to be understood is that the endgame is fast approaching and the Groundhog Day of the last two years will soon be over. Scotland must be prepared.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_voters-deserve-better-than-the-same-policies-with-different-faces/content_4.html": "Voters deserve better than the same policies with different faces\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 14th Jun 2024\nAccording to a report by election guru Prof Sir John Curtice, published earlier this week, trust and confidence in British politics has fallen to a record low. The report focuses on the events of the 2019-2024 Westminster Parliament, and it identifies that trust and confidence has fallen most drastically among Leave voters.\nIt also finds that voters across the UK who are struggling financially and those dissatisfied with the NHS have lower levels of trust and confidence in government. Most significantly for readers of this newspaper it finds that those with low levels of trust and confidence are more likely to back constitutional change.\nThe report was published on the same day as Sky News found little enthusiasm for the latest Sunak v Starmer TV debate among shoppers at Asda Chesser in Edinburgh where I was on the campaign trail with First Minister John Swinney. The footage has now gone viral and shows doughty Edinburgh South West pensioners telling Sky News they would rather go to bed than watch the debate and then giving a pithy summary of the case for Scottish independence. It made me rather proud of my home patch and the constituency I have represented for the last 9 years. However, it is important that those of us who support Scottish independence and a vote for the SNP at the General Election are not complacent about the impact of loss of trust and confidence in Scottish politics.\nThe loss of trust and confidence in UK politics has a long genesis. We can trace it back to Tory sleaze and cash for questions under John Major’s government in the early 90s. But when Labour came to power in 1997, after the initial euphoria wore off, they made their own contribution to the problem with the Iraq war’s dodgy dossier. Then came the MP expenses scandal of 2009 which reflected badly on all parties.\nLies told by the winning sides in the independence and the Brexit referendums have particularly shocked voters in Scotland. Then we had Boris Johnson’s premiership with his unlawful prorogation of parliament and his Covid rule breaking followed by Liz Truss’s reckless financial incompetence. And on the toxic legacy of Brexit even Leave voters think it has been a failure. So yes, much of this can be laid at the door of Tory and Labour Westminster Governments, but it would be crass exceptionalism to pretend that Scotland and Wales have not also had an equal share of their own problems. So how do we fix this? I think we need to restore integrity in our politics and offer people real change.\nBack in 1994 when the Tory sleaze scandal was at its height, the then PM, John Major, established the Committee on Standards in Public Life which went on to set out a code of conduct called the seven principles of public life sometimes known as the Nolan principles after the first chairman of the committee, Lord Nolan. The principles are as follows\nSelflessness: Holders of public office should act solely in terms of the public interest.\nIntegrity: Holders of public office must avoid placing themselves under any obligation to people or organisations that might try inappropriately to influence them in their work. They should not act or take decisions in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. They must declare and resolve any interests and relationships.\nObjectivity: Holders of public office must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias.\nAccountability: Holders of public office are accountable to the public for their decisions and actions and must submit themselves to the scrutiny necessary to ensure this.\nOpenness: Holders of public office should act and take decisions in an open and transparent manner. Information should not be withheld from the public unless there are clear and lawful reasons for so doing.\nHonesty: Holders of public office should be truthful.\nLeadership: Holders of public office should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour. They should actively promote and robustly support the principles and be willing to challenge poor behaviour wherever it occurs.\nIn Scotland, the principles are extended further with two additional requirements:\nPublic Service: Holders of public office have a duty to act in the interests of the public body of which they are a board member and to act in accordance with the core tasks of the body.\nRespect: Holders of public office must respect fellow members of their public body and employees of the body and the role they play, treating them with courtesy at all times.\nIf all politicians conducted themselves with these principles in mind, then I think we would be on the way to restoring public trust and confidence. However, we also need more substance to our politics, more vision, and more commitment to delivery of that vision. We keep hearing the media parrot Labour’s line that this is the ‘change’ election. But just exactly what change are Labour offering?\nIt’s hard to pin down what will change under Keir Starmer other than the faces on the Government bench. As one of the Chesser shoppers said he is a “hollow man”. I am out and about knocking doors in Edinburgh South West most days now and speaking to voters and I sense no enthusiasm for Labour’s offering. In fact, it is pretty much impossible to say what that offering is other than more of the same under different management. A commitment to the cap on child benefit but no cap on banker’s bonuses tells you all you need to know.\nAs both the SNP and the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have warned, Labour are poised to announce big spending cuts to public services across the UK if they win power. The IFS say the cuts will be in the region of £18 billion pounds. In the face of this withering assessment, Labour’s house mag, the Daily Record, yesterday proudly trumpeted a pledge to give an incoming Labour Scottish secretary £150 million to fight poverty in Scotland. But, as Stephen Flynn was quick to point out, this is a mere drop in the ocean compared to the SNP Government’s Scottish Child Payment which is lifting 100,000 children out of poverty at a cost closer to £500 million each year.\nIs it any wonder the polls are closing, and the SNP have come from behind to be neck and neck with Labour in Scotland? The Labour manifesto launched yesterday offered nothing new of any substance for Scotland. Chesser shoppers were right when they said that the change we need can only come with independence.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_unionists-shouldnt-be-stopping-indyref2/content_202.html": "Unionists shouldn't be so confident about stopping indyref2\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 12th Aug 2022\nWednesday saw the UK Government publish its response to the Lord Advocate’s Supreme Court bid to obtain clarity on whether the Scottish parliament can legislate for a second independence referendum. I have had a lot of queries from people who are confused by the legal process so I thought I would devote today’s column to explaining where we are.\nAt the end of June, the Lord Advocate filed a reference with the Supreme Court. Here is the question she wants them to determine:\n“Does the provision of the proposed Scottish Independence Referendum Bill that provides that the question to be asked in a referendum would be “Should Scotland be an independent country?” relate to reserved matters? In particular, does it relate to: (i) the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England (para.1(b) of Schedule 5); and/or (ii) the Parliament of the United Kingdom (para.1(c) of Schedule 5)?”\nThe references to paragraphs and schedules are to the Scotland Act 1998 which set up the current Scottish parliament. The argument in court will focus on whether the parliament has the power under the 1998 Act to pass the Independence Referendum Bill.\nWhile our current parliament is a creature of that Act, if you see it, as Winnie Ewing did, as the reconvention of the parliament adjourned on 25th March 1707, following the Treaty of Union, and the democratically elected parliament of the sovereign people of Scotland, then I am sure that, like me, you feel its powers should be considerably wider. The Lord Advocate is not making that point, but the SNP have sought permission to intervene in the case as a third party in order to make submissions on the right to self-determination. If permitted to intervene, our legal team will argue that self-determination is a central pillar of modern international law and, therefore, should inform the interpretation of the 1998 Act when considering the question posed by the Lord Advocate. You can read the SNP’s written argument here. The position on the right to self-determination in international law is set out at paragraphs 32-49. Readers might find paragraph 37 particularly interesting as it sets out what the UK had to say about self-determination when it made a written statement to the International Court of Justice about Kosovo’s unilateral declaration of independence. The UK accepted that international law does not “... prohibit secession or separation, or guarantee the unity of predecessor states against internal movements leading to separation or independence with the support of the people’s concerned.” This is a rather more generous position than they are currently taking towards the democratic mandate in Scotland for a second independence referendum.\nThe arguments which the SNP seek to make need to be heard in order to put matters in their proper context. They also cover the separate and discrete constitutional tradition in Scotland and the fact that the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle which has no counterpart in Scottish Constitutional law. In Scotland it is the people who are sovereign. But it is perhaps on the issue of the right to self-determination that it is most important that they are heard.\nPrior to devolution Scotland’s right to self-determination was well recognised. Indeed, the view was widely held, including by Mrs Thatcher, that all that was needed to commence negotiations for Scottish independence was the election of a majority of SNP MPs at Westminster.\nThere is precedent in the history of the unwritten British constitution for a union such as that between Scotland and England to be dissolved. The Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland effecting their union in 1800 were brought to an end on 6 December 1920 following a negotiated agreement. What triggered the process was the election of a majority of Sinn Fein MPs to the British parliament in December 1918. And yes, there was a war of independence in between and no, I am obviously not advocating that we should follow suit. My point is that there is legal precedent for the process of bringing the union to an end by negotiated agreement after a general election victory for the nationalist cause.\nIt would be a strange thing indeed if the Scotland Act 1998, an Act designed to enhance democracy in Scotland, should have reduced or hobbled in any way Scotland’s right to self-determination. It would also be a curious thing if a very recent statute establishing the modern phenomenon of Scottish devolution was to be the last word on Scotland's right to self-determination, negating any other legal or constitutional arguments that might have been made.\nThe Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether the SNP will be permitted to intervene and make these arguments but expect a decision soon as the case is set down to be heard on 11 and 12 October.\nIt will be fascinating to see what the UK Government’s legal team have to say in response to the SNP’s arguments on self-determination, particularly given their position on the Kosovan case. You won't be surprised to hear that their written case lodged this week is silent on the issue. In fact, the UK Government wants the Supreme Court to throw the Lord Advocate’s reference out, without even hearing the substantive arguments. They say that the case brought by the Lord Advocate does not fall within the jurisdiction of the court, because the Scottish parliament has not as yet passed the bill and that even if it did, the court should use its inherent discretion to decline to hear the case.\nOn the substance of the Lord Advocate’s question, their position is that a referendum on Scottish independence “plainly” relates to the reserved matters of the Union and of the parliament of the UK. The UK Government’s submission is grist to the mill of those unionists and commentators who have rubbished the argument that the Scottish parliament has the power to legislate for a second independence referendum. They are wrong to do so.\nThe argument that the Scotland Act can be construed in such a way as to allow for Holyrood to hold an independence referendum is well established. In 2012, before the Edinburgh Agreement was reached, 7 legal academics including 3 distinguished professors published a paper challenging the view that only Westminster had the authority to call an independence referendum.\nSo, it is simply wrong to say, as I heard one unionist commentator argue recently, that ‘no lawyer of standing” supports the case. I support the case and so does Aidan O’Neill QC, counsel in the recent Keatings case. Given that together we lead the teams that won two of the most important constitutional law cases in the UK, ever (the prorogation case and the Article 50 revocation case), I would hope we might be seen as “lawyers of standing”.\nI have long argued that we should test the argument in court as part of a wider political strategy, so I am pleased that the idea of court action has now been embraced. However, my plan was that the case would be heard after the Scottish parliament had passed the bill. This might have avoided any arguments about prematurity, and I think it would have strengthened the case by demonstrating that the democratically elected parliament was foursquare behind the bill, thus making it more difficult for the Supreme Court to overturn.\nHowever, the Lord Advocate's advice has led to testing the case in advance and the FM has won plaudits from many on what could prove to be a canny strategy.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_scottish-independence-case-at-uk-supreme-court/content_84.html": "Here's the facts on the Scottish independence case at the UK Supreme Court\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 14th Oct 2022\nMany column inches have been expended this week on the Lord Advocate’s Supreme Court reference. This newspaper had several reporters covering the proceedings, so readers have been favoured with detailed accounts of what was said in court. Due to my parliamentary duties, I was only able to watch the first morning. However, I have followed reports closely and caught up with a bit of the livestream.\nIn a nutshell what seems to have happened is that the UK Government lawyer spent most of his time trying to persuade the court not to address the substance of the issue, while the Lord Advocate addressed both the arguments for and against the Scottish parliament being allowed to legislate for an advisory independence referendum. Sadly, we heard little or nothing about the right to self-determination and the other important issues addressed in the written arguments supporting the SNP’s third-party intervention because the party’s lawyers were not allowed to make an oral submission and had to sit in the cheap seats with the rest of us.\nLight relief was provided by Alex Cole-Hamilton who popped by, didn’t understand what was going on and stomped off in a childish tantrum saying it was “boring”. Thus, he afforded us an insight into why the party he now leads, once a proud supporter of home rule, has been reduced to a sad rump in the Scottish parliament.\nThere's been some excellent analysis of the case in this newspaper and others by Andrew Tickell, the legal expert and broadcaster, so I won't repeat what he has said. Rather today I want to take the opportunity to remind readers of the basic political and constitutional facts surrounding this case.\nIf the UK Government had any respect at all for Scottish democracy, this court hearing would not have been necessary. At the 2021 Scottish election voters elected a government with a manifesto commitment to hold a second independence referendum. The last time that happened, after the 2011 Scottish election, the U.K. Government respected that mandate and, after a period of negotiation, Alex Salmond and David Cameron entered into an agreement to put beyond doubt the legality of the independence referendum the Scottish parliament went on to hold. They also agreed that both governments would respect the result.\nSo, there is an established constitutional precedent of the right thing to do in these circumstances. The unwritten British constitution proceeds by way of custom and practice. If the UK Government respected their own constitution and democracy, they would replicate what happened a decade ago, come to the negotiating table and enter into a second Edinburgh Agreement. That they will not do that this time round is unconstitutional as well as a denial of democracy.\nJust think how English voters would have felt if, after they elected a Tory Government in 2015 with a manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on leaving the European Union, the EU Commission had tried to block that referendum. You don’t need much imagination to envisage the outrage that would have prompted.\nIt looks like we may have to wait some months for the result of the court hearing. The fact that the court will take such a significant amount of time to look at the issue carefully shows, like the two days of argument in court, that those who assumed it was a foregone conclusion that the Lord Advocate would lose the case were wrong. Clearly the Justices engaged with the substance of the argument. Dr Andrew Tickell has reminded us that the legal controversy underlying this case is real and that academic opinion on the likely outcome is divided. There has existed for some years a respectable body of legal opinion, of which I am part, that the Scottish parliament does have the power to hold an advisory referendum.\nAileen McHarg, Professor of Public Law and Human Rights at Durham Law School, was right to say that that the outcome of constitutional cases can be unpredictable. The chattering classes thought both the article 50 revocation case and the case about the unlawful prorogation of parliament, by Boris Johnson, were doomed to fail; but I and my fellow litigants proved them wrong when we won both cases.\nI still hope that the Supreme Court will consider the wider constitutional context including Scotland’s right to self-determination, the constitutional importance of the SNP’s manifesto pledges, and the principle of democracy which should play a key role in the UK’s constitution. I think it’s a real pity that these issues were not addressed in any detail in the oral submissions.\nProfessor Ciaran Martin, of the University of Oxford’s Blatnavik School of Government was previously a UK Government civil servant and one of the architects of the Edinburgh agreement. He has written extensively about the current situation. He has knocked on the head any idea that the “once in a generation” phrase, parroted by Conservatives in their attempt to block a second referendum, is anything other than a slogan. It has no constitutional relevance he says. I agree and I would also point out that the idea that voters in Scotland should have to wait indefinitely for another poll does not sit easy with the terms of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 which envisaged that a cross border poll on reunification of Ireland may be repeated after a period of 7 years. Why should Scottish democracy be curtailed in a way that Northern Irish democracy is not?\nProfessor Martin has said that if there were to be a conflict between the law and the clear political mandate of the Scottish Government, that would be a “…very difficult situation for the UK as a whole.” It would go “…to the heart of the question of the character of the union between Scotland and England. Is it a union of consent or a union upheld by the force of law?”\nWe don’t have an answer to that question as yet, but I think is fair to say most people had assumed that the union of Scotland and England was one of consent. There is no constitutional impediment to Scotland leaving the UK. If it turns out to be the Hotel California where you can check out, but you can never leave, that would be a highly undemocratic situation and one which would be politically and constitutionally unsustainable.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_labour-apologise-ban-lgbt-armed/content_213.html": "Labour must apologise for ban on LGBT people in armed forces\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 21st Jul 2023\nAt the start of Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, Rishi Sunak issued an apology on behalf of the British state for the harm caused by the ban on LGBT people serving in the military between 1967 and 2000. For me this apology touched a very personal chord. In the late 1980s I was close to someone who suffered considerably when she was thrown out of the army for being a lesbian. Someone who had their distinguished and lengthy period of military service cut short, who was humiliated in the process, and found it initially very hard to find employment commensurate with her skills and worth as a human being. All this happened to her just because she was a woman who loved other women.\nMore than 30 years on this seems hard to believe. What is perhaps even more hard to believe is that the long arm of the state didn’t just interfere with her personal privacy and her right to love who she chose, but it also tried to invade the privacy and sully the dignity of her civilian friends and her lover as the army investigated her life. None of us felt there was anyone in authority to whom we could turn to defend our rights. A wave of homophobia was sweeping Scotland and the UK because of the AIDS crisis and Thatcher’s pernicious section 28. There was no Equality Act and those of us who were same sex attracted did not enjoy the protection of the law from discrimination or infringement of our human rights.\nThe ban was not overturned until 2000. Having failed in the courts of England and Wales, four lesbian and gay veterans, discharged because of the ban, took their cases to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Their names were Duncan Lustig-Prean, a supply officer on HMS Newcastle; Jeanette Smith, an RAF nurse; John Beckett, a weapons engineer mechanic; and Graeme Grady, of the RAF, who had been posted to Washington DC. They were supported by Stonewall, the human rights organisation Liberty and Rank Outsiders, an organisation set up by another veteran, Robert Ely, who was thrown out of the parachute regiment for being gay. After the court considered the facts of their cases in detail it held that the investigations into their homosexuality and their administrative discharge on the sole ground that they were gay constituted a violation of their right to respect for their private life under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nSome of the details the court heard were shocking. As one veteran, Carol Morgan, said this week “we were hounded like animals for our sexuality.” People’s rooms were searched, their most personal belongings were confiscated including letters. Some were imprisoned, beaten, sexually abused. Some were even put through conversion therapy both chemical and psychiatric. Some veterans felt suicidal after their experiences and tragically, some took their own lives.\nAs a result of the Strasbourg court’s ruling the UK Labour government announced the end of the ban in January 2000. The four litigants were awarded compensation by the European Court but many others who had suffered like them did not receive any compensation. The UK government did not set up a compensation scheme. Worse still, some ministers called for the ban to be reviewed as soon as possible arguing that without it morale would be damaged. But the ban was gone, and things changed quickly with Armed Forces personnel marching in uniform at Pride for the first time in 2007. But still no compensation.\nMy friend Anya Palmer, the expert discrimination law barrister, who then worked for Stonewall spent 8 years working for an end to the ban. She remembers that, after Labour came to power in 1997, the Labour party spent two years defending the ban until the European court ruling. She thinks that the Labour party also owe the shamed veterans an apology and I think she is right.\nMany years after the ban had been overturned and I had become an MP, I attended a dinner organised by the Pink News where the British military were feted as LGBT allies. I left early in disgust. After what I and my friends had experienced, I felt it was completely inappropriate for the organisation to be lavished with praise simply because they had been forced by law to embrace equality and without an accounting for their past wrongs to my community.\nNow at last there is some hope that there will be a proper accounting for the wrong that was done. The Prime Minister’s apology was prompted by a long-awaited judge-led review and many years of campaigning for justice. In 2020, specialist charity Fighting with Pride was set up by former Royal Navy officer, Craig Jones and ex-RAF navigator, Caroline Paige to right the wrongs of the ban and to seek financial remedies for lost pensions and earnings. Craig Jones and Caroline Paige joined veterans to hear the apology in parliament this week. They estimate that up to 5000 veterans have been affected both mentally and financially by the ban. Lord Etherton, who led the Review into the impact of the ban, has made over 60 recommendations, including substantial financial reparations. Fighting With Pride want the immediate creation of a hardship fund to support those with urgent needs and money for people with terminal conditions, followed by a comprehensive compensation scheme to remedy financial losses due to the ban. I support their call. There are also recommendations on housing and health related issues which could be taken up by the devolved administrations. I was pleased to see the Scottish Government’s veterans minister, Graeme Dey, say the ban was abhorrent and should never have been in place.\nThe UK Government’s belated apology was made to the LGBT community, but it was a ban on homosexuality that was at issue. The report records that “no distinction was made between transgender and lesbian and gay personnel. The view adopted in the enforcement of the ban was that, if a person was experiencing gender dysphoria, they were either a gay man or a lesbian. For this reason, although the ban was concerned with homosexuality, and therefore with sexual orientation, it also encompassed gender identity.” This sorry chapter of our history illustrates the importance of universal Human Rights and legislation prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual orientation and transgender status. It is also a salutary reminder of why so many same sex attracted people who lived through those times are so vigilant to protect our lives from homophobia in any guise.\nThis week’s events also show how powerful and important a public governmental apology for past wrongs can be. However, words alone are not enough, they require to be followed up by actions and I hope Lord Etherton’s recommendations, particularly on compensation will be acted upon with expedition.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_penny-mordaunt-sex-and-gender-debate/content_211.html": "Penny Mordaunt could have a big problem with the sex and gender debate\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 15th Jul 2022\nThe week at Westminster has been dominated by the Tory party leadership election. While the Tories have indulged themselves in what is, superficially at least, a pleasing exercise in internal party democracy and debate, at Westminster democracy and debate have been further debased. The “caretaker government’, hastily assembled under the lame-duck PM Johnson, is busy pulling legislation from the parliamentary programme and refusing to submit itself to scrutiny.\nYesterday we heard that the enormously important, but also controversial, Online Safety Bill won't reach the end of its House of Commons journey next week despite 50 hours in bill committee and a full day on the floor of the House this week. Meanwhile, Priti Patel withdrew from a scheduled appearance before the Home Affairs Committee with less than 24 hours' notice, prompting a point of order from their Chair and an angry letter. Dominic Raab, who has long been scheduled to appear before the Joint Committee on Human Rights next week to be grilled about his repeal of the Human Rights Act, also pulled out. He gave us a week’s notice but that was still not enough time to replace him with other witnesses and so he has knocked off course a carefully planned schedule of evidence on one of the most important and far-reaching bills currently before parliament.\nThose in authority seem unable to do anything about any of this, just as they have, to date, been unable to penalise Johnson for his lies. When the Alba MPs staged their stunt at the start of PMQs it seemed to me that the most noteworthy aspect of what followed was the contrast between the hysterical reaction to their protest and the notable inaction towards Johnson’s repeated contempt of parliament. Go figure.\nThe emerging favourite in the Tory leadership race is Penny Mordaunt. She’s a right winger who, like Keir Starmer, likes to be photographed between 2 union jacks. She knows, understands, and cares little for Scottish politics. But she has come up against what could be a big problem for her given the lies of her predecessor. For it seems she has been less than truthful about her past position in the conflict between gender identity theory and those who believe that biological sex matters and is immutable.\nUp until recently, Penny Mordaunt was a fully paid-up supporter of gender identity theory who proudly recited the mantra “Trans women are women” at the despatch box, supported Self ID, and tried to remove the words “women” and “mother” from a maternity rights bill. Now she is backtracking, not by saying she was wrong, but by attempting to pretend that none of this ever happened and that she has always been on the other side of the debate.\nThe problem here is that Mordaunt is persistently misrepresenting her previous position. That should override whatever view one might take on this issue. We don’t want another Tory Leader who is prepared to be so untruthful.. The starting gun on this tory leadership race was fired because of political dishonesty. Any candidate who tries to rewrite history so shamelessly should be out on their ear.\nIn my experience the approach people take to this particular issue is a pretty good indicator of their integrity as a politician. By that I don’t mean what side of the debate they are on but rather whether they are prepared to state their position clearly, answer questions about it, debate it and be tolerant and respectful of those on the other side of the debate.\nOn Monday I attended a cross-party parliamentary event in support of Free Speech. Unfortunately, our guest of honour, Martina Navratilova, was too unwell. after her recent bout of covid. to attend, but we enjoyed speeches from speakers from all the major parties. Many who spoke expressed concern about moves to favour gender identity over the lived reality of biological sex in policy making across a range of issues. including sport. This is not a culture war or a right-wing issue. Many of the organisations who backed the event, including LGB Alliance, were founded by lesbians and feminists from the left-wing tradition who simply want to uphold the rights of women and lesbians while also recognising the right of trans people to enjoy equal rights. The key word here is equal. No one group’s rights should trump those of others. Balance is required. Policy making should be evidence based.\nLater in the week I tabled and spoke to amendments I have drafted to the Online Safety Bill to ensure that, when moderating online content, Twitter does not discriminate against women, those who hold gender-critical beliefs, or those with a same sex orientation. My amendments would make it clear that Twitter is subject to the Equality Act when operating in the UK and therefore must respect all the protected characteristics set out in the Equality Act, not just those dearest to the beardy Californian blokes who control its content.\nThe protected characteristics set out in the Equality Act are age; gender reassignment; being married or in a civil partnership; being pregnant or on maternity leave; disability; race, including colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin; religion or belief; sex and sexual orientation. It is against the law to discriminate, victimise, or harass anyone because of any of those protected characteristics.\nBut Twitter doesn’t include ‘sex’ as a protected characteristic in its hateful conduct policy and frequently deletes expressions of belief on the immutability of biological sex and penalises the account holders who post such tweets while failing to remove tweets threatening violence against women and taking no action against the perpetrators.\nI also took time in parliament this week to applaud a very important court judgment on what the Equality Act means for freedom of expression, particularly in the workplace. In the of case of Maya Forstater vs Centre for Global Development, the Employment Appeal Tribunal and a subsequent Employment Tribunal have made it clear that that gender-critical beliefs are protected under the Equality Act and that women, and indeed men, must not be discriminated against, harassed or victimised for either holding those beliefs or stating them. This means that all employers will require to review their workplace practices and their equality, diversity and inclusion policies to ensure that they comply with the law as stated in that judgment.\nEmployers will now require to recognise that gender-critical beliefs align with the definition of man and woman in law and that workplace policies on sex and gender reassignment must not create a potential risk of discrimination, bullying or harassment against those with gender critical beliefs. They will need to consider whether their policies create a hostile environment for those with gender-critical beliefs for example, by calling them ‘transphobic”. If they have signed up to external benchmarking schemes such as Stonewall’s Workplace Equality Index which encourage discrimination against gender-critical people, they will need to revisit this decision. They will also need to make sure that their internal LGBTI+ and women's networks don’t seek to enforce sex denialism.\nThe Forstater judgments could also have very significant implications for political parties who are also bound by the Equality Act not to discriminate against their members on the grounds of any of the protected characteristics. Definitions of ‘transphobia” will require to be rewritten in order to be compliant with non-discrimination law. Likewise, political parties who discriminate in the provision of goods and services by banning organisations like LGB Alliance or gender-critical feminist groups from taking stalls at their conference may find themselves on the wrong side of the law.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2020_options-for-indyref-2/content_243.html": "Why we need to explore all legal routes to indyref2\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 03rd Jul 2020\nIn a speech last weekend, Michael Gove urged a radical post-Brexit revamp of Whitehall to make it “less southern, less middle class”. He called for innovation and experimentation in policymaking and criticised those in the establishment who consider ‘that any departure from the status quo must be assumed to be more downside than upside’. He went on to say that had these establishment bodies ‘been able to interrogate George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton in 1783 they would have concluded that American Independence was an expensive, untried and unjustifiable innovation……they would have said it was novel and contentious and therefore it should be stopped.’\nWell bravo, Michael Gove. I look forward to quoting his words back at him next time he pours scorn on those of us who support Scottish Independence!\nI am sure of course that Mr Gove did not intend his paean to embracing risk, adventure, experimentation and novelty to apply to viewers in Scotland. And, in truth, as other commentators have noted, it was not nearly as clever and original as Mr Gove thought it was, but there was something in it.\nFrom the critical reaction across the board to the rather staid Higgins report last week one senses that an appetite in Scotland exists to really do things differently as we exit the Coronavirus Crisis and seek to rebuild our society and economy. This appetite is reflected in the enthusiastic response of many on the nationalist left to Common Weal’s plan for a Resilient Scotland. Scotland needs a revamp. But while the sort of adventurous innovative revamp we need could be commenced under devolution it can only be fully realised with independence.\nLast week in my column I argued that the SNP should be discussing and debating how we secure our independence and what we do with it. I said the time for avoiding discussion of Plan B is over. There was the predictable chorus of outrage from some including those who really ought to know better. It is extraordinary and not healthy that to advocate debate is seen as controversial. The words #nodebate should have no place in the SNP lexicon.\nFor the record, I have not endorsed the Plan B advanced by Angus Brendan McNeil and Chris McEleny which I understand to involve using the 2021 election as a proxy vote. I am not sure that plan has been fully developed or addresses how you bring the UK Government to the negotiating table which will be vital. However, I think the SNP should consider what we do if Boris Johnson continues to refuse a section 30 order and I applaud Angus and Chris for trying to stimulate that debate.\nFrom time to time activists send me lengthy legalistic arguments about Scotland’s nebulous status in the union which they believe if ventilated in ‘the international courts” would lead to Scotland’s independence. I’m afraid that belief is misguided. There is no legal short cut to independence.\nThe route to independence is through the ballot box. We had an independence referendum in 2014. At that stage a clear majority voted against independence. We need to demonstrate public opinion has changed. Ideally, this should be done through a second referendum legally sanctioned by a section 30 order, like the first. However, the present Tory Government have indicated they won’t agree to that, presumably because they know it is likely we would win this time. Therefore, we need to discuss what to do in the event that they continue to withhold their agreement to Scotland holding a referendum sanctioned under the current constitutional set up.\nI have never advocated a wildcat or illegal referendum. It would be more than a little surprising if I had done so, given my legal background and that I spent a considerable amount of time last year litigating in the Scottish courts and the UK Supreme court to reverse the effects of unlawful action taken by Boris Johnson.\nMy interest is in the question of how Scotland might hold a legally sanctioned referendum on the question of independence without having to be dependent on the Westminster Government’s permission. Earlier this year, in her speech marking Brexit day, the First Minister acknowledged that it might be within the competence of the Scottish Parliament to hold an independence referendum and she spoke of the possibility of testing that in court, albeit she indicated she was reluctant to do so at that stage. The argument that the Scotland Act could be read in such a way as to allow Holyrood to hold a referendum on the question of independence is well established. In 2012, before the Edinburgh Agreement was reached, 7 legal academics including 3 distinguished professors published a paper challenging the view that only Westminster has the authority to call an independence referendum.\nRecently, one of the authors of that paper, Professor Aileen McHarg and her senior colleague, Chris McCorkindale reaffirmed this view and pointed out that;\n“Although it is frequently asserted that a referendum on independence falls outwith devolved competence (as part of the reservation to Westminster of “the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England”, Scotland Act 1998, Schedule 5, Part 1, para 1(b)), that issue has never been conclusively settled”\nEarlier this year, Aidan ONeill QC, fresh from his triumphs in the Article 50 and prorogation cases, produced a detailed opinion setting out the argument that Holyrood could legally hold an independence referendum. In it he employed some of the arguments about Scotland’s constitutional history and status in the union that activists who write to me assert and it is here that I think these arguments may be usefully employed.\nWe may find out sooner rather than later whether Aidan’s arguments will find favour because he has been instructed by Martin James Keatings, Convenor of the Grassroots Group Forward as One, to bring a case before the Court of Session. The case has commenced and it seeks a ruling “that the Scottish parliament has power under the provisions of the Scotland Act to legislate for the holding of a referendum on whether Scotland should be an independent country without requiring the consent of the UK Government or any further amendment by the UK parliament to the Scotland Act 1998.”\nIt is possible that the court may rule the question hypothetical in the absence of any bill currently before Holyrood. However, the Advocate General (the British Government’s law officer for devolved matters), the Lord Advocate and the Scottish Ministers are called as defenders. This means they will require to set out their position in writing to the court so we should get a good idea of the respective positions of the British and Scottish Government before long.",

  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_tories-disregard-for-human-rights/content_43.html": "One chilling moment exposed the Tories' disregard for human rights\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 03rd Dec 2021\nAmidst all the usual shouting and mayhem at PMQs this week there was a truly chilling moment when Boris Johnson nodded enthusiastically as one of his more swivel eyed backbenchers demanded the UK’s withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Andrew Rosindell urged the PM to take the UK out of the ECHR as the only way to let us pass the laws necessary “to stop the endless waves of illegal migrants crossing the English Channel”. He also asked the PM to get rid of the Human Rights Act and bring in a British Bill of Rights. Although the PM declined to agree to either, confining himself to a “review of the human rights system” and songs of praise for the ghastly Nationality and Borders Bill, it was noticeable that during Rosindell’s diatribe the PM was nodding.\nConcerns that the UK Government’s review of the Human Rights Act (HRA) may extend to replacing it altogether and the UK’s withdrawal from the ECHR are not fanciful and they are widely held. Earlier this year the British Government’s Justice Minister, Robert Buckland QC, reassured the Joint Committee on Human Rights that there was no intention to withdraw from ECHR but he’s been sacked and replaced by Dominic Raab, a zealot for what is euphemistically called “reform”.\nRaab has said that the Human Rights Act is “fundamentally at odds with the British legacy of liberty going back hundreds of years”. He doesn’t like the ECHR much either and has previously talked about \"the spread of rights contagion\", \"unaccountable\" judges, and a court \"lacking in experience\". He has been campaigning for a long time to end the jurisdiction of the ECHR in the UK and now he says he is working on a “mechanism’ to bring this about by “overhauling” the HRA.\nEarlier this year after taking a lot of evidence the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) concluded that there is no evidence that the HRA requires reform. We also found that the HRA is compatible with the Tories much loved English constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty because whilst courts can find legislation incompatible with our ECHR obligations, the courts cannot overturn primary legislation, keeping parliamentary sovereignty intact. We pointed out that the HRA is a central part of the UK’s devolution settlement and that to amend it would be a huge risk to our constitutional settlement and to the enforcement of our rights. And we also said that the HRA “does not unduly constrain domestic courts” and that the requirement for UK courts to take into account Strasbourg judgements is “entirely sensible”. We concluded that the UK Government must be cautious about any changes to the Act that would limit the enforcement of human rights within the UK. So it was pretty much a trenchant rejection of everything Raab has ever said on the matter. At present we are waiting to see Raab’s proposals. We should get a taster next week when he gives evidence to the committee.\nBut it’s not just at home that a close eye is being kept on what the British Government is up to regarding the HRA and ECHR. International human rights watch dogs are very concerned about the direction of travel. Last week I wrote about the UK Government’s cavalier attitude towards ECHR and other international treaty obligations in Nationality Bill. The representative of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees ( UNCHR) told the Human Rights committee that “The UK so far has been a very valuable champion for refugees and asylum.” However, she expressed concerns that if the Bill was passed it could weaken the “UK’s advocacy abroad” as the UK would be “seen as not willing to do at home what it would be asking other countries to do”. The message is clear that the Bill will damage the UK’s reputation as a global champion for refugee and human rights.\nSimilar concerns were raised this week by a delegation from Council of Europe (COE) led by the President of the Assembly, Rick Daems, who have been visiting Westminster to meet with Ministers and Select committee chairs, Yesterday I met with him in my capacity as Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee of Human Rights. The COE is an international organisation founded after the Second World War to uphold Human Rights, democracy and rule of law in Europe. It’s Europe’s leading human rights organisation and quite separate from the EU. The European Convention on Human Rights was the first Convention passed by Council of Europe’s convention and it is the cornerstone of all its activities. Adopted in 1950, it entered into force in 1953 and its ratification is a prerequisite for joining the Organisation. The political message from the COE is clear that the UK needs to be 100% on board with the ECHR otherwise our reputation abroad will be damaged and our lax attitude towards human rights exploited by other bad state actors in countries like Hungary and Poland.\nAs well as talking to him about the work of the Committee I also took the opportunity to update the President on the work of the Scottish Government. The contrast could not be more marked. The Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government are actively seeking to strengthen human rights protections. A National Taskforce on Human Rights Leadership was established in 2019 to take forward the recommendations made in the 2018 Report of the First Minister’s Advisory Group on Human Rights and to prioritise actions to progress human rights and equality in Scotland. That report recommended the incorporation of four international treaties in a multi-treaty Bill incorporating economic, social, cultural and environmental rights as well as enhanced rights and protections for women, disabled people, older people, minority ethnic and LGBTI people. The framework created by the Bill will demonstrate global human rights leadership placing Scotland at the forefront of human rights legislation and practice.\nOf course, as we know from the recent debacle in the UK Supreme Court over the Bill incorporating the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Scottish parliament only has power to legislate for rights matters in so far as within its devolved competence. Only with independence can we truly enshrine human rights in the new constitution of Scotland and take our place amongst the top human rights defending nations. However it was good to be able to tell the President of the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly that not all of the UK is going backwards on Human Rights protections and to point the leader of a major international institution to Scotland’s very different direction of travel.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_tory-attempts-to-curtail-civil-liberties/content_258.html": "Tory attempts to curtail civil liberties are a warning to us all\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 19th Mar 2021\nThe Right to Protest is a fundamental part of any democracy. As has been graphically illustrated by the horrendous scenes in Myanmar, it is one of the first things dictatorships clamp down on. In the last week I have had many emails from constituents concerned about the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill which received its second reading in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Part 3 of the Bill contains enhanced police powers to deal with public order and wider offences and increased sentences for breaching conditions imposed on assemblies and processions by the police.\nThe changes to the law on the right to protest will only have force in England and Wales but they will impact upon people living in Scotland. There is a long tradition of Scots travelling to London to protest. In my twenties I frequently endured overnight bus journeys to London to protest cuts to student support, nuclear weapons, and Section 28. More recently Scots travelled in their droves to London to protest against Brexit at huge demonstrations.\nAs an MP I am often visited at Westminster by constituents attending parliamentary lobbies on matters such as climate change. These lobbies are often accompanied by marches and rallies outside the House of Commons which now face being severely curtailed. So, the changes in this bill will impact on the rights of people living in Scotland to protest UK Government policy at the seat of Westminster power.\nMany of the emails I have received also expressed outrage at events in London last weekend when the police broke up the protest on Clapham Common. The two issues are closely connected. During the pandemic our civil liberties have been curtailed in a way which was previously unimaginable. Most of us have accepted this in order to protect life and public health but, along the way, injustices have occurred. Black Lives Matter protestors in London were kettled, photographed and asked to provide their names as a condition of their liberty, with no legal basis. Yet Police Scotland allowed football fans to party on the streets of Glasgow and even gave them an escort to their destination of choice. Then, last weekend, in London police officers man-handled and detained women protesting the death of Sarah Everard as a serving policeman was charged with her murder. It is hard to imagine a more offensive misuse of police powers.\nAll this has occurred because the law on protest in a pandemic is not clear. Although the regulations governing Level 4 lockdowns in Scotland and England don’t permit gatherings, you are allowed to leave your home with a reasonable excuse and the list of examples is not exhaustive, so doing so to protest could potentially be a reasonable excuse in law.\nIn England the Court of Appeal has held that under section 3 of the Human Rights Act the lockdown regulations must be interpreted in a way that is compatible with the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), including Articles 10 and 11 which govern freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. This means that because the regulations do not expressly prohibit all protest, the courts and all public authorities should read them in such a way as to permit protest where it would be unnecessary or disproportionate not to. However, that is not how the authorities interpret the regulations so people have the impression they cannot protest at all.\nOn Wednesday police broke up a socially distanced peaceful picket of workers involved in an industrial dispute in Edinburgh with threats of fines and further “punishment” for anyone orchestrating the dispute. Unite Scotland have expressed concern claiming that they had conformed to all the statutory requirements with regard to the pandemic and informed the Police in advance. The union have taken the matter up with the Justice Secretary,\nIn England, at the end of last year, after legal action, a new exception was introduced to their Coronavirus regulations to give specific protection for picketing as long as the organiser takes required precautions. It may be that something similar is required in Scotland. But still on neither side of the border is there specific protection for other forms of protest.\nThe Joint Committee on Human Rights at Westminster has looked at this problem and we have recommended regulations to clarify the right to safe protest during the pandemic.\nIt’s one thing to have a lack of clarity in temporary laws during an emergency but the provisions in the UK Government’s Bill to curtail the right to protest beyond the pandemic are more serious because they will be permanent. To take just two examples, the bill affords hugely expanded powers to the police in England and Wales to stop protests which would cause ‘serious unease” and creates criminal penalties for people causing “serious annoyance”. But causing annoyance is part of our freedom of speech. If you can prevent a protest for being annoying, you can prevent any protest. All movements for change involve an element of peaceful protest. Think of the suffragettes. I am sure many of us did when we saw the photos from Clapham Common last Saturday night. If women cannot speak up to protest their rights what is our society coming to?\nYes, the Extinction Rebellion protests in 2019 may have been very annoying to people going about their business on London’s streets and public transport – I know because I got caught up in them. But these activists were protesting the biggest problem of our age – climate change – I think that gives them the right to be a bit annoying.\nDuring the pandemic we have seen what can happen when the law governing our right to protest is unclear. The same problems will occur if the margin of discretion granted to the police and the Home Secretary is left as wide as it is in this Bill.\nParliamentarians, whether of the left or the right, should never be in the business of giving governments and police forces powers to stifle dissent, particularly where there is a risk that they will be used against those whose beliefs make the Government and the establishment of the day uncomfortable. As the Policing bill continues through the Westminster parliament SNP MPs will work cross-party to attempt to ameliorate the parts which threaten civil liberties.",

Just think how much higher it could go once we launch a campaign and answer the questions that still trouble soft No voters.\nSo it is very important we do not lose sight of the prize.\nThe new NEC and officer bearers elected by SNP conference delegates are going to have their hands full. At the same time as ironing out troublesome governance issues we are also going to be very busy overseeing the putting together of a manifesto with policies to win next year’s election and, also, planning for the independence vote that will follow. So let’s pull together and stop tilting at windmills and setting up strawmen to attack. Its time now to play the ball, not the man or the woman. We are sons and daughters of the Scottish Enlightenment. The best parts of that tradition should be what we take forward as we debate ideas and look at the detail of policy. We cannot have areas of policy that are no-go whether it’s the question of a fall-back strategy if Westminster continues to say no or the importance of protecting womens’ rights as well as the rights of trans people.\nGiven that a false account of my position on the latter issue has pedalled by some people who really ought to know better I want to take the opportunity to set the record straight in the hope that we might move on without any more malicious misrepresentation.\nThe SNP manifesto for the 2016 Scottish election committed the Scottish Government to “review and reform gender recognition law”. It did not commit the SNP to a policy of self-identification. The process of review and reform was ongoing until paused for the pandemic.\nConcerns have been raised about proposals to change to a system of self-identification of sex or gender and we should recognise that these concerns are legitimate. In particular there is a very real conflict with the sex-based protections set out in the Equality Act, including female only spaces such as changing rooms, hospital wards, sanitary and sleeping accommodation, refuges, hostels and prisons and the right to refuse consent to males in single sex spaces or males delivering intimate services to females such as washing, dressing or counselling.\nI am proud of the fact that in Scotland we have very good rights-based protections for trans people. No one is seeking to change that. I think in the current climate we need to be careful that the knowledge of and confidence in those existing rights isn’t erased or undermined by people using fear and misinformation to argue for further change.\nThe debate has become toxic and dominated by name-calling. I have neither said nor done anything which is transphobic and yet I am repeatedly accused of being a transphobe including by elected parliamentarians, councillors and members of my own party who are breaching the SNP members’ code of conduct with their wild allegations. Joan McAlpine and others have suffered the same treatment. This behaviour could just be seen as childish and silly except it isn’t silly for me or my loved ones because it has brought down a tsunami of abuse and violent threats on occasion requiring me to have police protection.\nThose who are seeking to shutdown debate by ignoring the legitimate concerns of women do a disservice to everyone and undermine the rights set out in the Equality Act. We need to find a way through this that is measured and respectful of the concerns of trans people and women.\nIn June 2019, together with a trans woman who is a constituent, I wrote to Shirley-Anne Somerville and proposed that a Citizens Assembly be set-up to identify the problems and work to find solutions. I am sorry that our suggestion was not taken up. When the new NEC meets it is a suggestion that I will renew with the proposal that some sort of mediated process could help to heal the rifts in our party which have grown up over this issue and move us towards a solution.\nHowever, this is just one area of policy which has already taken up a great deal of bandwidth. There is still a lot of work to be done in other areas which are of huge importance not just to winning independence but to managing the transition to independence successfully.\nIt is policy and planning that will win the prize of independence. Once the independence campaign proper begins a searing focus will be turned upon our plans for the economy, trade relations with the rest of the UK and the process of re-joining the EU.\nSo we must have clear answers on these issues.\nA huge amount of thinking about these matters has been done within our academic institutions and by bodies such as the Scottish Centre for European Relations, the Common Weal, Business for Scotland and the Scottish Independence Convention. The answers which emerge from this work need to be pulled together and packaged for consumption by voters.\nFortunately, our new policy Convenor, Chris Hanlon, is a real ideas man and someone who gets things done. It should be remembered that he championed the idea of Citizens Assemblies and that it was his energy that helped bring this issue to the conference floor and into party policy. He has the focus and the drive to deliver real policy change and delegates have elected a very talented diverse group of people to the policy committee to help him.\nThere’s a lot of work to be done so let’s make sure our new NEC gets started on it and frees up our First Minister and her government to get on with tackling the Covid crisis so together we can plan for the independent future that will follow.",

Last month, when I praised the Scottish Government’s free speech amendment to the bill, I unleashed a backlash which led to my removal from the SNP Westminster front bench and a tsunami of abuse including a threat of rape from a fellow party member. That should concern us all. So should the fact that the amendment was subsequently withdrawn. Some might say what happened proves that those of us concerned about free speech are right to be concerned. However a chink of light has appeared with the announcement that, together with opposition parties, the Scottish Government have prepared a new draft free speech amendment which will be discussed at a public roundtable on Monday.\nI shall refrain from further comment on this bill until the amendment has been debated save to say that free speech really does matter. So does the use of language in legislation. Last week Westminster debated a bill about maternity leave which didn’t mention women. Given that it is women who give birth and women who benefit from maternity leave this seemed more than a little odd. A number of MPs from across the chamber raised the bill’s use of language with the Minister leading on the bill. We did not get a satisfactory answer. I fear that the drafters of the bill have been influenced by the ideological trend which has seen moves across schools, universities and the NHS to discourage the use of the words “woman” and “lesbian”. Most women don’t even know that this erasure of their sex class is going on – when they find out they are appalled. They cannot believe it.\nI believe that it is possible to be inclusive without erasing women and lesbians from the statute book. The truth is that while sex is binary, gender is fluid. By recognising that, it is possible to be inclusive of trans and non-binary people without removing laws which protect women and lesbians from discrimination. Those of us who try to warn of the consequences of the erasure of the biological reality of womanhood from legislation are often attacked and misrepresented.\nMany politicians are now so in thrall to those who wish to erase women for the purpose of advancing gender identity theory that they call those of us who advocate for women’s sex based rights transphobic even when we have never done or said anything against equal rights for trans people in our whole lives and even when we were trans allies long before it was fashionable.\nIt is not transphobic to advocate for women’s sex-based rights under the Equality Act. It is possible to support both trans people’s rights and women’s rights. Neither should be sacrificed for the sake of the other. We can have an inclusive society without doing that.\nUnder the Equality Act 2010 it is against the law to discriminate against someone because of a protected characteristic. These consist of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation. Under the act sex is defined as either “a reference to a man or to a woman”.\nThe UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) tackles discrimination based on sex and defines sex as “the physical and biological characteristics that distinguish males and females. Sex is a protected characteristic for very good reason. Discrimination against women is rooted in their biology. That is our lived experience.\nWe saw a very good example of this when Holyrood magazine published its exclusive poll showing that a third of MSPs answering their survey had received a death threat. While both male and female MSPs had received death threats, only female MSPs (29% of them) had received rape threats. Speaking as someone who has received sexualised abuse an threats of sexual violence from young men who seek to deny biology, it seems very ironic that the same men are quick to recognise biology when they are abusing and issuing threats to women.\nWe need to find a way to be inclusive without erasing women’s biology – and women’s lived experience - from the statute book and official guidance. Recently advice was issued to midwives in Brighton that they must refer to “chest-feeding” rather than “breast-feeding. But women are not chest feeders - women have breasts – they feed children with their breasts.\nLesbians are same sex attracted. We are attracted to women’s bodies not to male bodies. To say we must be attracted to male bodies is homophobic. The backlash against those who insist that language reflects scientific reality is now so out of control that earlier this week, in the Scottish parliament, the Justice Secretary felt unable to answer the question of whether the Scottish Government now believe there are more than two sexes, and if so, what they are. Based on my own experiences I understand why Humza Yousaf ducked the question. If he had said there are only 2 sexes, he would doubtless have been called a transphobe. He might have lost his job and he might have found his personal safety under threat. If he had said that there were more than two sexes, he would have been denying scientific reality and he would have struggled to explain what he meant. This is not a healthy state of affairs.\nIt is dangerous to subvert reality when we are passing laws to protect our citizens from hate crime or discrimination. If we cannot stand up to bullies when women’s and lesbian rights are on the line what hope do we have of standing up to the bullies in Boris Johnson’s government who would seek to deny Scotland the right to self-determination?\nI have long warned that if we didn’t tackle the toxicity in the debate around reform of the Gender Recognition Act and the protection of women’s sex-based rights under the Equality Act, it would bleed into other areas of our public discourse and damage the cause of independence. We saw an example of this earlier this week when prospective SNP candidates and employees of the party pilloried a respected disability rights activist from another party. It was not a good look.\nIt’s time to pull back from the brink and have a respectful debate about equality and inclusivity. Let’s hope next Monday’s Justice Committee public session discussing the free speech amendment to the Hate Bill can be the start of this.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_protest-is-a-fundamental-right-not-a-mere-inconvenience-for-police/content_134.html": "Protest is a fundamental right, not a mere inconvenience for police\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 23rd Sep 2022\nLast weekend chilling video footage emerged on Twitter which should concern us all. It appeared to show two police officers following a lone young woman home from an anti-monarchy demonstration in Edinburgh and, when challenged, saying “Tell us where you live, and we will let you go...”. Not only did it show a scene which we would normally expect to see only in a totalitarian state, but it also showed an alarming insensitivity in the light of the circumstances surrounding the murder of Sarah Everard.\nThe good news is that what happened to this young woman is being investigated by her constituency MSP. The bad news is that this may not be an isolated incident. I have received reports of protestors at a recent pro-independence demonstration in Edinburgh being followed by police in a similar fashion and asked for their names and addresses. The police may legitimately ask you for your name and address if you are a witness to a crime or if they suspect you of having committed an offence, but they must first inform you of the general nature of the offence they believe you have committed. However, this does not seem to have been the position in the cases reported to me.\nAnd these are not isolated incidents. There have been many reports from across the UK of overzealous police responses to anti-monarchist demonstrators. Questions are rightly being asked by politicians of all parties and questions have been raised in the Scottish parliament. The Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Keith Brown, promised to take concerns up with the Chief Constable of Police Scotland. However, he said that during the events following the Queen’s death, overall, the police had done a ‘superb job’. While that may be true it cannot be allowed to obscure the seriousness with which we should treat unwarranted interference with the right to peacefully protest.\nThe reason why the police operation went so smoothly is that years of meticulous planning went into preparations for the aftermath of the Queen’s death. So, it is puzzling, to say the least, that little thought seems to have been given to how best to facilitate the right to protest. That some might wish to demonstrate against the proclamation of the new King was foreseeable given the existence of lively republican sentiment across the UK. Lessons require to be learned in time to make sure the same mistake is not made in advance of the coronation.\nIn England and Wales, the Tories have been clamping down on the right to protest in the Police, Crime Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Bill. In our report on the first of these measures, the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR) looked carefully at the right to protest. We noted that current rhetoric around protest tends to downplay the importance of the right to peaceful protest and treat it as an inconvenience in conflict with the public interest. This results in discussions focusing on “balancing” the rights of protesters against the rights of members of the public. This is problematic because it often leads to the right to protest being given insufficient weight in the “balancing” compared to the rights of the public.\nGiven that the right to protest is protected by Articles 10 (freedom of expression) and 11 (freedom of assembly and association) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) it should be facilitated so far as possible. It is also wrong to automatically assume that the rights of protesters inevitably conflict with the public interest. Whilst protests may cause inconvenience, they are also fundamental in a democratic society to facilitate debate and discussions on contentious issues, and this is of value to the public generally.\nWhilst the ECHR provides that protests can be limited to protect the rights of others, any restriction of the right is only lawful if it is both proportionate and necessary. The scales are, therefore, weighted in favour of protecting the right to protest, rather than equally balanced. If protest is viewed as inherently problematic and ‘inconvenient' rather than as a necessary and important element of a free society, the ‘balance' will almost always fall on the side of maintaining order and preventing crime.\nThe starting position should be that peaceful protests should not be restricted and should be facilitated so far as possible. To help ensure this happens the JCHR proposed the introduction of express statutory protection for the right to protest, setting out the obligation on public authorities to refrain from interfering unlawfully with the right but also the duty to facilitate protest. Needless to mention our suggestion was not taken up by this Tory Government. I hope it will find a more sympathetic ear in Scotland.\nPoor policing decisions around the right to protest are not confined to republican and pro-independence demonstrations. Recently in England and Wales lesbians engaging in planned protests about the right to disagree with extreme gender ideology, which denies the existence of sex as a biological reality or same sex attraction, have faced intimidation and abuse from counter protestors. Too often, instead of facilitating the right of such women to protest, the police have suggested that women desist from marching to protest their rights “for their own safety.” A statutory right to protest might help restore fairness to such situations.\nOne good thing about the outcry over the treatment of anti-monarchist protestors has been a resurgence of interest in the right to freedom of expression across the political divide, including from some politicians who have previously embraced the “No Debate” mantra in some areas of public discourse. It was refreshing to see Patrick Harvie argue that minority views must be allowed to be expressed and to read that Maggie Chapman believes that “Freedom of Speech and the right to protest are cornerstones of our democracy, even when views expressed are uncomfortable or challenge the elite.”\nBoth these statements are of course correct. Furthermore, like all human rights, the right to free speech and the right to protest are universal rights meaning they apply to everyone. I hope this will be remembered next time women who believe in the immutability of sex and the value of same sex attraction seek to make their voices heard in the debate around sex and gender.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2021_hold-citizens-assembly-to-de-escalate-gender-debate/content_207.html": "We must hold a Citizens’ Assembly to de-escalate gender debate\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 27th Aug 2021\nIt seems likely that the Draft Co-operation Agreement and Shared Policy Programme agreed between the Scottish Government and the Scottish Green Parliamentary Group will proceed with the approval of both political parties. I am all for cross-party working, as, in my experience, it’s the best way to achieve results. We saw this in the successful campaign that preceded the 1997 devolution referendum and we saw it also in the success of the cases taken by me and others against Boris Johnson’s unlawful prorogation of parliament.\nThere is much to welcome in the Co-operation Agreement and Shared Policy Programme – for example, the renewed measures to tackle climate change, including the promotion of 20-minute neighbourhoods, and the commitment to strengthening tenants’ rights and introducing rent controls. I also welcome the renewed commitment to land reform, albeit it’s a very significant loss that Andy Wightman won’t be in the parliament to make sure it happens.\nI would have liked to see more in the Shared Policy Programme about the partners’ plans for independence. During the National Roadshow last week, SNP President Michael Russell confirmed that producing the new prospectus for independence and a new white paper will not be his job but that of the Scottish Government and, in particular, Angus Robertson.\nHe also emphasised the importance of the change in SNP party policy resulting in the manifesto commitment to pass a bill to hold a second independence referendum with or without a section 30 order. I presume the Scottish Greens are on board with this, but it would have been good if this could have been spelled out in the agreement. I would also like to have seen the policy programme linked into the new prospectus for independence with the development of a ten-year plan encompassing what can be done before the next independence referendum, during the transitional period and thereafter. A timetable for producing a new white paper, with input from both partners in the agreement, would also have been welcome.\nThere are a lot of fine words about “doing politics better” in this agreement. The opening paragraphs of the agreement state, “The cornerstone of this agreement, and of delivering effective and responsible leadership over this Parliament is mutual trust and good faith.” The partners want “a country that is characterised by fairness and equality for all.”, and, where they differ, they will do so “constructively and respectfully”. There is also a commitment to “mutual respect, transparency and candour.”\nThe Shared Policy Programme repeats similar aspirations and reminds us, “The founding principles of our Parliament challenge us to be more collaborative in our politics…” A Citizens' Assembly is promised on the issue of Local Government funding and we are told that the partners “believe that an increased use of deliberative engagement with the public will improve outcomes and develop more effective policies and public services. This includes citizens' assemblies, citizens' juries and other participatory democratic innovation. The development of a sustainable infrastructure to support effective citizens assemblies will include the consideration of the governance, remits and subjects that could be put to an assembly.”\nI really hope these worthy aspirations will be put into practice. When Patrick Harvie was interviewed on Scotland Tonight earlier this week, he indicated that he regretted the ‘ugly and toxic atmosphere’ at Holyrood in the last session and that it was ‘really important to deal with differences constructively, respecting those differences but also working together on the common ground.’ I do hope that in future he will practice what he preaches rather than calling women with legitimate concerns about reform of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) transphobic, and questioning their professional fitness as journalists/commentators/politicians etc. Sadly, he is not alone in this behaviour and we don’t have to look very far to see examples of politicians and officials from other parties attacking women for their gender critical beliefs, notwithstanding a recent appeal court decision reminding us all that such beliefs are protected in law under the Equality Act.\nIf we are to have respectful politics and transparent processes, then these values must apply across the board. There can be no areas carved out where anything goes and women, or indeed men, can be abused and traduced for seeking honest debate and scrutiny of policy.\nThe Shared Policy Programme commits to reform of the GRA with a bill to be introduced in the parliamentary session which starts next week. Yet in relation to this most totemic and controversial legislation, the approach of the partners to the co-operation agreement has so far failed to live up to the values they have now so clearly set out in writing. Like many people, I support reform of the GRA to make it less traumatic for trans people to get a gender recognition certificate. This reflects the SNP manifesto commitment.\nWhat I and many others, do not support is self-identification of sex for anyone, which would negate the importance of sex in the legal protections afforded by the Equality Act, in the Criminal Justice system, in medical research and in many other important areas of public policy. We are where we are now because ‘reform’ has come to mean self-identification. Indeed, self-identification has already been introduced by stealth in many areas of public life and anyone who questions it is branded a bigot. This is no way to do fundamental reform or change. Much of the vitriol and the shouting down of dissenting voices in the media, on social media and in our parliament is designed to prevent debate because when light is shone on the proposals for self-identification of sex it becomes clear that there are very real risks to hard won rights to women only spaces, to vulnerable women in prison and to the health of women, men, and indeed trans people, if sex disaggregated data is not collected.\nWe are now only days away from the publication of a legislative programme that will include a bill on GRA reform, but the responses made to the consultation on GRA reform carried out between December 2019 and March 2020 have yet to be published. I understand there were over 17,000. Last autumn an independent analysis of the responses was commissioned. It reported in May but has also yet to be published.\nIt’s not too late to reset the debate on this troubled issue. The consultation responses and the analysis should be published without further delay. Thereafter we need to find a way to facilitate a debate where the voices of all those affected by these reforms can be heard respectfully in line with the values espoused in the co-operation agreement.\nMore than two years ago, together with a trans constituent, I wrote to the Scottish Government suggesting a Citizens' Assembly be convened to do that. In Ireland such assemblies dealt successfully with what were fraught debates on equal marriage and abortion rights and I believe in Scotland a Citizens' Assembly could do the same for the debate on reform of the GRA. So today I am renewing my call and I hope that, as it is wholly in keeping with the values of the co-operation agreement and the shared policy programme, it will finally receive the consideration it deserves.",

I stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and with communities in the USA and across the world who are fighting back against racism in all its forms.\nFollowing the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis, mass protests have brought thousands of people onto the streets. I am appalled by the reports and images of deadly violence being inflicted upon these protestors. I am also very concerned by reports of violence and intimidation towards journalists, including those from international networks.\nI am also disturbed to learn that the police may be carrying out this violence with the assistance of equipment imported from the UK.\nToday, the SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford MP, directly asked Boris Johnston to affirm that Black Lives Matter and pressed him to challenge Donald Trump on the appalling situation. He also called for the UK Government to urgently review the export of riot control equipment including tear gas to the US.\nWatch Ian Blackford's questions to Boris Johnson at PMQs\nAs the MP for Edinburgh South West, I have signed Dawn Butler MP’s letter calling on the UK Government to take urgent action to freeze the export of all policing and security equipment to the USA.

As you may be aware, yesterday the UK Government published its review of the relative risks of COVID-19 to specific groups, including BAME people. This report describes the risk to those with Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicities as “disproportionate”. The UK Government must now set out how it proposes to deal with this disparity in health outcomes. My SNP colleague Alison Thewliss MP raised this with the Health Secretary yesterday and I hope to participate in further debate about this in the House of Commons tomorrow.\nThis review relates to England and Wales only. In Scotland, a preliminary analysis by Public Health Scotland has suggested that there has not been a similarly disproportionate number of coronavirus cases in Scotland’s BAME communities. This data is so far very limited, however, and the Scottish Government has asked Public Health Scotland to carry out further analysis on this important issue.\nIn Scotland, the SNP Government is taking concrete action to advance race equality, tackle racism and address many of the barriers that prevent some people from minority ethnic communities from realising their potential. In March 2016, the Scottish Government published the Race Equality Framework for Scotland which sets out how the Government aims to make progress in tackling racism over a fifteen-year period from 2016 to 2030.\nThe Race Equality Action Plan Programme Board met last month to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on Scotland’s minority ethnic communities. They will play an active role in overseeing and supporting work across the Scottish Government.\nPlease be assured that I will continue to stand up for human rights, support the Black Lives Matter movement, and hold the UK Government to account for its failure to challenge Donald Trump over the appalling situation in America.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_defining-what-is-a-woman/content_249.html": "There is nothing transphobic about defining what a woman is\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 06th May 2022\nWestminster is currently prorogued (legally this time) as we await the start of a new parliamentary session next week. On Monday I spent the day walking around my constituency with council candidates and our local organiser speaking to voters. We had a list of former SNP voters who had not bothered to vote at the Scottish elections last year and we wanted to find out why and to see if we could persuade them to vote this time round.\nThe results were instructive. As regards the local elections, former supporters want to see less virtue signalling and more focus on local bread and butter issues. On independence they want to see a campaign with well thought through answers that will withstand debate on questions such as who will pay their pension after independence. This theme was repeated on Tuesday when I attended the funeral of a family friend in the west of Scotland. He was an independence supporter, with many friends and family of the same persuasion. At the purvey there was much discussion of where the SNP stand after 15 years in government and the message was that people would like to see less hot air and more action.\nDuring the local election campaign the number one issue voters have raised with me is the cost-of-living crisis. An opinion poll this week showed that Scots believe Holyrood could do more to tackle this issue. Undoubtedly so too could Westminster. It’s the current biggest challenge for both parliaments and yet the issue which has dominated the airwaves for the last ten days is misogyny in parliament. Regular readers of this column will be aware that I agree there is a problem with misogyny in politics. That has certainly been my experience. However, at a time of national crisis I think politicians should be focusing less on their own problems and more on those of their constituents.\nThat said, the hypocrisy surrounding this stooshie really needs closer examination. I have been slack-jawed listening to male politicians bumping their gums about misogyny when the same men have, to my certain knowledge, at best ignored and at worst participated in the bullying, intimidation, and harassment of women in public life who do not agree that anyone should be able to self-identify as a woman. Misogyny is “dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women” and yet the same men will entertain the argument that it is transphobic to define what a woman is. Worse still, so will some women.\nEarlier this week the First Minister refused to define what a woman is and insisted that to do so would oversimplify the gender debate and risk harming trans people. She said she would argue “until my dying breath” that there was “no conflict between women’s rights and trans rights”. Several commentators responded by pointing out that the FM has not actually argued this case other than to dismiss women’s concerns as “not valid”.\nNot to be outdone, Ruth Davidson also declined to define what a woman is, describing it as a “gotcha” question and went on to say that the debate over reform of the GRA is polarised and has been oversimplified. Yet, if you look at Ruth’s track record at Holyrood and in the House of Lords, she has done nothing to address the complexity of the debate or indeed to encourage debate at all. When brave SNP and Labour MSPs such as Joan McAlpine and Johann Lamont were trying to address these issues in committee and on the floor of the Holyrood chamber she was nowhere to be seen. And as their lordships have grappled with the policy issues thrown up by self-identification across the board from prisons to hospitals, Ruth’s voice has been unusually silent.\nDavidson said the issues are nuanced. She is right about that. They require a proper understanding of complex legislation such as the Equality Act 2010. But it is the job of politicians to read and understand the law. You cannot properly reform the existing law if you don’t understand it.\nThere is, in fact, nothing “transphobic’ about defining what a woman is. The Equality Act, passed by a Labour Government and supported by the SNP, defines a woman as a female of any age.. Is that transphobic? In 2014 the Scottish Government proposed to enshrine the protected characteristic of sex in an independent Scotland’s interim constitution. Was that transphobic? Is biology transphobic? When you put it this way you really see how ludicrous what passes for the debate on this issue has become.\nYou cannot defend women’s rights if you cannot define what a woman is. Likewise, you cannot legislate for trans rights if you are not prepared to define what a trans person is. And the reforms to the GRA don’t do that. The right to self-identification which it is proposed to enshrine in law is not confined to trans people, it is for anyone. This means that any man, whatever his intentions or motivation, can self-identify into the category of women. This is what concerns women like me. It is not trans people we fear but men, and many of us have the experience of working with survivors of male violence and sexual abuse to know that we are right to be fearful.\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission have set out in some detail the problems that self-identification could pose for women’s rights in the fields of criminal justice, single sex spaces, sport and data collection. They have made it clear that under the Equality Act, females have a right to single-sex spaces if they are a “proportionate means to achieve a legitimate end”, Such ends include protecting privacy for women in areas such as refuges, changing rooms, rape crisis centres, and prisons and ensuring fairness as well as safety in sport.\nThe attempt to slander the EHRC’s work on this as transphobic failed when the UN dismissed an unfounded demand by some campaigners on one side of the debate to have their A status as a human rights body removed. It is now the responsibility of MSPs to address the EHRC’s well founded concerns.\nHowever, it is little wonder, given the onslaught on the EHRC and politicians like me and Rosie Duffield, that most of our current MSPs seem reluctant to address the detail of this debate. They are worried about being branded ‘transphobic’, losing their positions, and receiving violent threats. Based on my personal experience they are right to be worried. However, my personal experience also shows that it’s possible to survive such attacks and to go on arguing for what you believe is right. The tide is turning, with a number of significant legal victories for gender critical women and increased awareness of the issues despite the best efforts of some lobbying organisations to have “No debate”. One council candidate in Edinburgh said they had received more emails on the issue of sex and gender identity than all the other issues put together.\nIt is a pity that no SNP conference has never properly debated these issues. It would have been useful to have had a debate of the calibre of the famous NATO membership debate back in 2012. As things stand the policy of the SNP is to reform the GRA. I have no difficulty with that. My difficulty is with the policy of self-identification which was not in the SNP manifesto and for which our conference has never voted.\nSo, here’s my challenge to Nicola Sturgeon and Ruth Davidson. I’ll debate these issues with you in public. Name the date and the place and I will be there. As For Women Scot have said – “Asserting you are right and refusing to hear opponents is not an argument”.",

So is democracy. So, I am looking forward to this weekend’s SNP conference. My party has been dealt a strong hand and provided we play it well we should soon be commencing a second independence campaign\nYou can tell things are going well for the independence movement when Gordon Brown is wheeled out. During his latest Broontervention he chose to echo the words of Theresa May, saying “now is not the time”. The trouble is that for Scotland, British politicians telling us not now tends to mean not ever.\nThe British Government are pressing ahead with their constitutional priorities, Brexit, the undermining of the devolved settlement and attacks on the rule of law, regardless of the pandemic and its economic fallout.\nSo, whilst the First Minister and the Scottish Government have rightly had their primary focus on the Covid crisis, we cannot afford not to counter the British Government’s constitutional agenda.\nTo those who parrot the words of our former and current First Ministers during the first indyref campaign that this was a “once in a generation” vote, I say that that was then, and this is now.\nBesides what constitutes a generation in political terms? I’m a member of Generation X born between 1965 and 1980. The next generation was the Millennials born between 1981 and 1996. These are time spans of only 15 years. With respect to devolution 18 years passed between the 1979 and 1997 referendums. So, rather longer than a generation. But we should remember that until Labour won the 1997 General Election Scotland’s renewed desire for devolution was ignored by the Tories for more than a decade. Something to bear in mind for those who say we don’t need a Plan B….\nThe events of the past 6 years have been considerably more tumultuous than we normally experience in a generation. In the years since 2014 we have lived through a number of political generations. The days of Cameron and Clegg feel like ancient history. Theresa May is now in the political wilderness together with a host of well-respected Tories who find themselves politically homeless. The Liberal Democrats who were part of government until 2015 are now reduced to a rump with their latest UK leader but one ousted at the last General Election. The Corbyn era has come and gone. Britain has left the European Union. And Trump will soon leave the White House.\nOn the issue of sovereignty and Irish unity, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that the Northern Irish Secretary shall not allow a second border poll any earlier than 7 years before the previous poll. Even allowing for the very different context, if 7 years between referendums to leave the UK is acceptable for Northern Ireland why not for Scotland?\nIf the party or parties who have a clear commitment to a second indyref in their manifestos win the Scottish election next year then it would be a Trumpian denial of democracy for such a referendum not to happen. But, if ever any UK leader was capable of Trumpian behaviour then its Boris Johnson, so it makes sense for us to think about what we should do in the event that the PM refuses to reach agreement with the FM about the means by which a second indyref can be held, as David Cameron did with Alex Salmond in the Edinburgh Agreement 2012. A recent poll suggested that two thirds of voters want a fall-back strategy to secure a second independence vote if a section 30 order is refused this time round.\nBut some in the SNP are reluctant to contemplate the options in such a scenario because they believe that to do so might detract from the pressure on the PM to do the right thing. To them I say he’s not renowned for doing the right thing particularly when it comes to Scotland.\nI understand the argument that his refusal to grant a section 30 order is unsustainable. Whether that is right remains to be seen. For now, it’s a comforting thought that his position is unsustainable but it’s a hope at best and it’s my belief that this hope should not prevent us from looking at what leverage we have in the meantime. It should be remembered that the capitulation of David Cameron and the signing of the Edinburgh Agreement came after protracted discussions. It was secured as the result of pressure that was irresistible not just because of the mandate the SNP won in 2011 but also because of the robust leadership and statecraft of the Salmond government. Some of the present reluctance to discuss alternative strategies comes from the absolutely correct view that the means by which independence is secured must be legitimate in order that the outcome is internationally recognised. I agree and would add that a democratic and legitimate process is also necessary to bring the British Government to the negotiating table after the vote is won.\nBut Scotland is not Catalonia. The UK is not Spain. There is nothing in the unwritten British constitution which prohibits Scotland from choosing independence. Indeed, the British constitution has already shown it is flexible enough to permit an independence referendum for Scotland.\nSo let’s look forward with optimism to the somewhat delayed discussion of alternative strategies, Plan B if you like, which will now take place at the SNP National Assembly in January. In her Brexit day speech last January, the FM was canny enough not to rule out testing in court the legal question of whether the specific constitutional reservation in the Scotland Act puts any form of independence referendum outside the powers of the Scottish Parliament.\nThose of us not privy to the legal advice from the Lord Advocate are not in a position to fully understand the Scottish government’s tactics in respect of the Keatings case. I certainly would have preferred a court case to take place in the context of what Kevin Pringle has described as a ‘carefully crafted bill.” But we are where we are and the full legal argument in Mr Keatings case will happen in January. Those in the SNP who are tasked with taking forward the product of the national assembly’s discussions may well be assisted by the debate and decision in this case.\nSo let’s hope delegates to the SNP conference will elect officer bearers, an NEC, Organisation and Policy convenors and a policy development committee who believe in the importance of good internal party governance, open debate and developing the right policies and strategies to win and who will put independence front and centre. Because if not now, then when?",

It seemed like most of Balerno was there! Artwork from local schools featured and Joanna assisted in giving out some of the prizes to the children. There were stalls from the Co-op, who had sponsored the prizes, Hadeel and others. Although it was a very friendly and enjoyable morning Fairtrade has a serious message for sustainability in the face of climate change.\nCoffee, tea, bananas and chocolate could soon be much more difficult to buy. Climate change is making crops like these harder and harder to grow. Combined with deeply unfair trade, communities growing these crops are being pushed to the brink. Here in Scotland, as a nation of people which has come to love tea, coffee, bananas and cocoa – and as part of a nation which sources many other foods from overseas, these crises will affect us too. If we don’t take action now, availability of products like these could decline to the extent that they become luxury items or completely unavailable to us. For example, if current rates of warming continue, it is predicted that by 2050: as much as 50% of global land currently used for coffee farming may no longer be suitable. Adverse climate conditions will trigger a drastic decline in bananas yields in 10 countries. Many regions in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire, who produce over half the world’s cocoa, will become too hot to grow the crop.\nNow, more than ever, we need to ensure that farmers receive fair pay, prices, and have power to make their own choices, meet their everyday needs and deal with the challenges posed by climate change. More people choosing Fairtrade means extra income, power and support for those communities. We, in richer, industrialised nations and as contributors to climate change, must also take and urge urgent action to drive down emissions. We must ensure the UK government’s trade policy helps, not hinders, the path to net zero.\nLink to Balerno Free Trade on Facebook",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_uk-government-is-abandoning-its-moral-duty-to-palestinians/content_23.html": "UK Government is abandoning its moral duty to Palestinians\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 17th May 2024\nOn Tuesday it was reported that right wing protesters in Israel had blocked aid trucks destined for Gaza, throwing food packages onto the road and ripping open bags of grain. Whilst the UN Aid Agency confirmed that Northern Gaza is now experiencing full-blown famine, video footage showed fit young men in their late teens and early twenties stomping on food parcels and throwing their contents down a ravine. The attack happened at the Tarqumiya checkpoint, west of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. US national security adviser Jack Sullivan said: “It is a total outrage that there are people who are attacking and looting these convoys coming from Jordan, going to Gaza to deliver humanitarian assistance.”\nThat same day in Westminster Hall in the House of Commons MPs from across parliament came together to call for urgent family visas to allow people with loved ones in Gaza to bring them to the safety of the UK temporarily. I spoke in the debate alongside SNP colleagues. I started by declaring my support for the Balfour project. The Balfour project was set up in 2011 by husband-and-wife Roger and Monica Spooner. They had been on holiday to the middle East with friends who were Jordanian and were shocked to learn about Britain’s role in Palestine. Promises were made by Britain to Arabs in 1915 that a state would be created stretching across the Near East including Palestine in return for a military alliance with the British against the Ottoman Empire an ally of Germany during the first world war. However, those promises were betrayed notwithstanding the Balfour Declaration in 1917 which appeared to promise a Jewish homeland whilst doing nothing to prejudice the rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\nOn their travels the Spooners met many Palestinians who blamed Britain for the loss of their nation and the dispossession of their land during the Nakba. Nakba, Arabic for \"catastrophe,\" refers to the 1948 displacement of roughly 700,000 Palestinians. Following the UN partition plan for Palestine, war erupted between Palestinians and Jewish forces. Many Palestinians fled violence or were forcibly expelled from their homes. The Nakba remains a central point of tension in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians seek a right of return to their lost lands, a demand disputed by Israel. The Nakba's legacy is one of dispossession and longing for a homeland.\nThe Spooner’s work on raising awareness has grown into the charity the Balfour Project. It has three broad aims, to acknowledge Britain’s historic role in shaping 20th and 21st century Palestine/Israel, particularly in light of the Balfour Declaration and the policies of the British Mandate; to Support Palestinians and Israelis in building a peaceful future based on equal rights, justice and security for all, and to work for the British Government’s recognition of the State of Palestine.\nThe British Government recognised the State of Israel in 1950, but Palestinians remain stateless, exiled, refugees or second-class citizens within Israel and the Occupied Territories. That is why so many people in the UK feel that Britain bears a responsibility for what has happened to the Palestinians since the Nakba and why the UK Government should be doing far more than it is at present to help Palestinians who have been so cruelly caught up in the war. Of course, none of this condones the evil actions of Hamas on October 7 but it does go to underline the plight of innocent civilians in Gaza suffering as a result if Israel’s backlash and to put the whole terrible situation in its historic context.\nMPs called on the UK Government to allow British Citizens with immediate and extended family members in Gaza to come to the UK on temporary visas. My constituent Dr Eman El-Bahnassawy is a specialist dentist who managed to evacuate her 79-year-old mother from Gaza to Cairo. As a child, this now elderly lady witnessed the Nakba and she has endured all the recent wars on Gaza. She has already been displaced 9 times during the current war and her home has been destroyed by the bombing, so she has nowhere to go back to.\nThe UK Government has previously introduced successful bespoke pathways for those fleeing persecution in Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong so it can quickly introduce visas when it suits it. What is being called for here, however, is not akin to homes for Ukraine. British Citizens living and working here simply want to be able to house and support their own family members and get them out of Gaza before they are killed. In the absence of a specific family route, they can only rely on existing visa routes, such as a family visa for example as a spouse or partner or based on refugee family reunification, or a skilled worker dependent visa. These types of applications involve prolonged waits, up to 6 months for a family visa, and hefty fees - £1846 per person if applying from outside the UK to join one’s partner, parent, or child, in addition to an immigration health surcharge of at least £2587.50 per adult. So many of the children in Gaza have been orphaned because of the war, under the existing schemes it is very difficult for the remaining extended families to rescue their kin, so these existing routes do not fit in the current crisis.\nYou cannot apply for a visa unless you are able to have your fingerprints scanned and a digital photograph taken of your face in a UK Visa processing centre. You cannot get out of Gaza to the UK without these scans and you cannot have them without getting out of Gaza. The only remaining option is to evacuate to Egypt. This evacuation process has forced many families to crowdfund tens of thousands of pounds to pay private companies to facilitate their loved ones’ exit from Gaza into Egypt. That option is now also closed due to Israel’s recent occupation of the Rafah crossing. Those who have already fled to Egypt are trapped in limbo - unable to join their loved ones in the UK because they are waiting for the outcome of an application (if they can afford it) or because they are simply ineligible under existing routes. Palestinians’ precarious immigration status in Egypt also means they lack effective access to state support to rebuild their lives.\nSome online commentators reacting to the debate in parliament said that neighbouring Arab countries should accept refugees from Gaza and that it is not the responsibility of the UK. However, what is being talked about here is people with family ties to British citizens being allowed to join their families in the UK. The refusal of Egypt and Jordan to accept large numbers of refugees is rooted in their fear that Israel wants to permanently expel Palestinians into the Sinai desert to finally end Palestinian demands for statehood. Many Palestinians live as refugees in other countries, 300,000 people fled mostly to Jordan during the 1967 Middle East War. Displacement is at the root of the ongoing conflict.\nThe UK Government has repeatedly failed to introduce more safe and legal routes for refugees to come to the UK. They show no sign of agreeing to allow Palestinians living in the UK to bring any relatives here, even when they are old ladies or children, and family sponsorship is promised. It’s a humanitarian outrage and a dereliction of the UK’s historic moral responsibilities.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_why-the-only-hope-of-stopping-priti-patels-ugly-rwanda-plan-is-through-courts/content_228.html": "Why the only hope of stopping Priti Patel’s ugly Rwanda plan is through courts\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 10th Jun 2022\nAs is so often the case, one of the most powerful indictments of Boris Johnson this week came from a former friend and ally, the well-respected Tory MP Jesse Norman. In an excoriating letter he set out the reasons he had no confidence in the Prime Minister. The Johnson government, he said, lacks a sense of mission; it has a majority but no long-term plan and, rather than governing, it prefers the easy road of constant campaign mode, replacing sensible planning with empty rhetoric.\nHe singled out one recent initiative to underline the moral bankruptcy of the Johnson government describing the policy of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda as “ugly, likely to be counter-productive and of doubtful legality.” On that as on so much else in his letter he is undoubtedly right.\nIn my work as Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights (JCHR), together with cross-party colleagues I have been scrutinising this latest rebarbative Priti Patel proposal and the more we look at it the more Jesse Norman’s description rings true.\nA quick recap. The UK Government has entered into an agreement with Rwanda whereby people seeking asylum in the UK can be transferred to Rwanda on a one-way ticket to have their asylum claims dealt with there. Patel says this will deter “illegal immigrants” from making dangerous channel crossings and deprive people-smugglers of their evil trade. Incidentally, there is no evidence that this is the case as the crossings have continued, notwithstanding the large amount of publicity surrounding the policy since it was first announced a couple of months ago. But let’s just unpick Patel’s words. If this policy is a deterrent, then clearly, she sees Rwanda as a less attractive destination than the UK, otherwise why would the threat of ending up there rather than here deter people?\nFunnily enough the UK Government’s official assessment of Rwanda is keen to downplay concerns about the country’s human rights record despite well documented concerns from both Governmental and Non-Governmental bodies. On at least two occasions only last year the UK called for the United Nations (UN) to investigate torture, deaths in custody, extra judicial killings and forced disappearances in Rwanda. A 2020 US State Department report raised similar concerns. The UK’s anti-slavery commissioner has drawn attention to evidence that Rwanda has detained thousands of potential trafficking victims without providing them with proper care in the past year.\nThe Agreement between the UK and Rwanda is a Memorandum of Understanding which is not legally binding on either party and does not confer rights on any individuals. So there are no human rights guarantees. The UK Government’s position is that it retains no legal responsibility for asylum-seekers once they reach Rwanda and it is not clear what remedy an individual would have if their rights were breached whilst in Rwanda. For example, unlike the UK, there are no specific anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT people in Rwanda and the Foreign Office advice for LGBT UK citizens proposing to travel there is that they may “experience discrimination and abuse, including from local authorities.” At least UK-based visitors have the option of coming back to the UK. That will not be an option for the people Patel sends there on a one-way ticket.\nThe UN High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) has stated that they are firmly opposed to arrangements that seek to transfer asylum seekers to third countries in the absence of sufficient safeguards and standards.\nThe legal experts who gave evidence to the JCHR this week indicated that there are compelling arguments that the Rwanda policy breaches the UK’s obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) and the Refugee Convention. One of our witnesses said that the people Priti Patel sends to Rwanda will be “human canaries in a human rights coal mine.”\nNot surprisingly, Priti Patel’s plans are facing a legal challenge with emergency proceedings launched in the English High Court earlier this week. The claimants are seeking to have the policy declared unlawful and an injunction preventing the first plane from taking off as planned on 14 June. The grounds of challenge include whether there is a lawful basis for the policy, whether Rwanda is a safe country and whether the policy complies with the Human Rights Act.\nThe Rwanda policy has been introduced by executive fiat without legislation or any real scrutiny on the floor of the House of Commons. If it is to be stopped legal action is probably the only hope. The idea that the policy might be reversed in the light of concerns from some of the Tories who voted no confidence in the PM earlier this week is a forlorn one. Yes, Boris Johnson may be behaving like the Black knight after Monday’s vote but when it comes to this charlatan it doesn’t do to be too complacent. The normal rules of politics don’t seem to apply to him.\nUndoubtedly, he is weakened but to what extent remains to be seen. A vote of confidence in parliament would be a pointless exercise as Tory MPs will rally to his flag in the face of an opposition attack and the PM will still be able to count on his huge majority to get most if not all of his legislative programme through. He is not in the same precarious position as Theresa May before him, who faced a significant rebellion with no majority to rely on.\nLike many other Yessers who are mere foot soldiers in the movement, I was a little disappointed that more was not made of the opportunity afforded by the immediate aftermath of the vote on Monday. It could have been a moment for what Jonathan Shafi has called “some inspiring rhetoric” or better still the announcement of the date of the next independence referendum and the launch of an inspirational campaign. It could have been the ideal time for Angus Robertson, the Cabinet Secretary for the Constitution, to come out of the traps with the eagerly awaited plan for next year's promised independence referendum and to start publishing the promised policy papers. Sadly, that was not to be but on the positive side we know that something is promised soon.\nIt is really important that this promise is delivered upon. Earlier this week Kevin Pringle argued that the time has come for the SNP to make a sharp pivot from making the democratic case for a referendum to setting out a convincing social and economic case for independence. I agree. Otherwise, some of Jesse Norman’s remarks about replacing sensible planning with empty rhetoric risk being levelled closer to home.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2022_elon-musks-twitter-bid-is-a-reminder-of-importance-of-free-speech/content_254.html": "Elon Musk’s Twitter bid is a reminder of importance of free speech\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 29th Apr 2022\nElon Musk’s takeover of Twitter has prompted renewed debate about free speech and how Twitter moderates its content. Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” leading to concerns that Twitter could become a forum used by criminals, bots and others for nefarious purposes and to incite hatred and violence. This would not be desirable. However, unfortunately, Twitter already allows some users to incite hate and violence without sanction and paedophiles to hide in plain sight while algorithms steer them towards the accounts of young children.\nBoth the UK Government and the EU have reminded Musk of his duty to protect the rights of Twitter users. Frankly they could do with remembering that themselves as Twitter frequently ignores the law on free speech, freedom of belief and non-discrimination. Twitter’s content moderation policies could do with being brought into line with these laws so that, for example, people can challenge prevailing orthodoxies such as gender identity theory without being suspended or banned from the platform.\nWhile some worry that the UK Government’s Online Safety Bill could be a threat to free speech, with appropriate amendments it could also be a vehicle to ensure that in the UK at least Twitter’s moderation policy takes account of the right to freedom of speech and freedom of belief and the right not to be discriminated against under the Equality Act. If the Online Safety Bill can do this at the same time as protecting the safety of children online, then it will be worthy of support.\nThe right to free speech is not absolute. Most democracies recognise that threats, bribery, defamation, perjury, false advertising, and workplace harassment do not deserve to be protected in law. The trick is to get the balance right.\nIn a dictatorship free speech is one of the first things to go. At present, for obvious reasons, the UK Government are very keen for us not to look too closely at Rwanda’s human rights record despite having demanded an inquiry into it at the UN last year. In March of this year Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported on a wave of free speech prosecutions in Rwanda against journalists, commentators, and opposition politicians. HRW explained that whilst Article 38 of Rwanda’s 2015 Constitution protects freedom of expression it limits that protection by permitting ill-defined restrictions based on “public order, good morals, the protection of the youth and children, the right of every citizen to honour and dignity and protection of personal and family privacy.” The government, with the support of the judiciary, has used this clawback clause to impose restrictions on freedom of expression in ways that are incompatible with Rwanda’s regional and international obligations.\nIt’s useful to contrast the free speech provisions of Rwanda’s current constitution with Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It allows public authorities to place restrictions on freedom of expression in certain circumstances, but the interference must be prescribed by law, pursue a legitimate aim and be proportionate and necessary in a democratic society. In practice these are strict tests to meet, and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights makes it clear that there is little scope for restrictions on political speech or on debate about questions of public interest including matters which give rise to considerable controversy, or which concern an important social issue. Politicians north and south of the border would do well to remember this.\nLast week I attended the launch of the Free Speech Union in Scotland as a member of its Advisory Council. FSU is a membership organisation comprising members of all political parties and none which stands up for the free speech rights of its members. It has opened a Scottish office due to overwhelming demand from Scottish members concerned that free speech is under threat in Scotland. Many are particularly worried about the chilling effect of the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act, when it is brought into force. There is also considerable concern about potential threats to free speech from the UK Government’s Online Safety Bill (unless it is amended) and the crack down on the right to protest in England and Wales in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill passed at Westminster this week.\nThe Director of the FSU in Scotland is Fraser Hudghton, a former SNP staffer and activist and the son of well-respected former SNP MEP and party President Ian Hudghton. The Advisory Council includes others from the nationalist left including Ian Macwhirter, Jim Sillars and the award-winning poet and National Collective activist Jenny Lindsay. The right is represented by Murdo Fraser MSP and Brexit campaigner Tom Walker. As I said at the launch it would be very foolish for the left to leave the defence of free speech to politicians of the right. Free speech is a universal right and the bedrock of any democracy.\nWhile there are mainly laudable aims behind both the Hate Crime Act and the Online Safety Bill, aspects of such laws are open to being weaponised by bad actors to censor legal speech. It is important that those affected by such weaponisation have support. Many of those who have found themselves targeted cannot themselves afford to instruct lawyers to defend them when they are bullied, harassed, and intimidated in the workplace or when they face criminal investigations for ‘hate speech’ which is in truth is nothing of the sort.\nWithin 48 hours of the launch of the FSU in Scotland we saw the need for it when a political meeting due to take place on the Aberdeen University campus was cancelled at short notice because the political party holding it opposes self-identification of sex and some students decided this was “transphobic”. It should be emphasised that it was the students’ association that sanctioned this censorship not the university itself. Incidents like this show why Scotland, the home of the Enlightenment, requires Free Speech defenders. Our universities should welcome debate on public policy. Students who cannot cope with hearing an opinion with which they disagree should perhaps reconsider whether university is an appropriate choice for them. They may also find any workplaces rather challenging.\nAt the FSU launch the Scottish poet and my fellow Advisory Council member Jenny Lindsay said: “In nearly twenty years of programming and writing in Scottish literary culture, I have never known an atmosphere so stifled, nor the precepts of freedom of expression so disregarded by individual writers and arts organisations alike. This does not need to be the case, and I dearly hope for robust discussion about re-energising Scotland's literary landscape so that writers and thinkers are free to explore complex contemporary issues without fears of no-platforming, ostracization, smearing and loss of livelihood.”\nThe situation which she describes pertains not only in the literary world but also in politics, universities, public bodies and charities. It is not healthy and if Scotland wants to take its place among the constitutional democracies of the world as an independent nation and have a proper debate about the journey there, our public discourse needs re-energising so that policy and ideas can be discussed openly.",
  "https_www_joannacherry_scot/https_www_joannacherry_scot_newspaper-columns_2023_scotland-on-rejoining-eu-reality/content_314.html": "How does Scotland turn platitudes on rejoining EU into reality?\n- First published in : Visit Website\n- First published on: 03rd Feb 2023\nTuesday marked three years since Brexit. It also marked the publication of a number of reports confirming that Brexit was an act of self-harm. Bloomberg economists concluded “The main takeaway is that the rupture from the single market may have impacted the British economy faster than we or most other forecasters expected.”\nStephen Flynn summed it up nicely at PMQs when he said on the 3rd anniversary of Brexit we had learned three things, the UK’s trade deficit has grown, the UK’s economy has been hit to the tune of £100 billion each year and the UK economy is expected to be the worst performing of all in the G7, even worse than sanction hit Russia. No wonder Rishi Sunak was met with a wall of laughter when he said Brexit had nothing to do with the cost-of-living crisis. But it is not a laughing matter – research suggests Scotland has lost £3.2 billion in tax revenues to Brexit calculated as a fraction of the £40 billion lost by the UK as a whole. This paper has done an excellent job of investigating and reporting on the damage done to Scotland by Brexit as we approached the 3rd anniversary. And all despite the fact Scotland voted Remain by a hefty margin. Support for EU membership in Scotland has since increased, but sadly the promise that Scotland would not be taken out of the EU against our will proved to be hot air.\nWe know the economic picture but three years on where are we politically? Where stands the cause of independence in the light of the Brexit disaster? And what of devolved Scotland’s approach to Europe and the EU? How do we turn platitudes and promises into reality?\nRecent polls have shown that support for re-joining the EU in Scotland stands around 72%. That’s a very healthy majority reminiscent of the consensus support for devolution in the 1997 referendum. Unfortunately support for independence remains hovering around the 50% mark. Yet given Labour’s craven acceptance of the Brexit disaster, the only realistic route for Scotland to rejoin the EU is to become an independent nation. So how do we get support for independence up?\nLike others, I have often argued in this column, that if we are really serious about delivering a vote for independence, we need a bit less focus on process and a bit more focus on how we get support for independence above the 60% mark and on towards the sort of levels of support devolution garnered during the 1990s so that by the time there was a referendum in 1997 the result was a foregone conclusion.\nThis will mean a laser like focus on the economic questions and the questions about EU membership and cross-border trade that trouble those not yet convinced of the case for independence. To be frank, the Building a New Scotland policy papers published to date by the Scottish government have not yet delivered the flesh required on the bones of these issues. The planned paper on EU strategy is a chance to put that right.\nIn addition to emoting about the cost of Brexit we need a concrete strategy for alignment with the EU linked into our socio-economic case for independence. Commentators with an expertise in the EU have been critical of Scotland’s approach to EU relations which they say is too disconnected from the debates currently going on within the EU. Scotland, they say needs an effective strategy for its post-Brexit EU relations and action to maintain strategic connectivity with the EU. For example, there is disappointment that to date the Scottish Government has not been able to fulfil its commitment to keep laws in devolved areas aligned with EU law.\nThat is not to decry what has been achieved. Scotland has offices in Brussels, Berlin, Paris, Dublin and Copenhagen with staff working hard to engage positively with the EU. However, the impacts of the sort of paradiplomacy to which a devolved government is confined are limited.\nProtests took place across Scotland on Tuesday. Lesley Riddoch and Time for Scotland are to be commended for organising the rally outside the Scottish parliament and I’d like to acknowledge the contribution made by staff from my office, who in their free time helped with the logistics particularly the organisation of the torch lit procession. Speeches were made at that rally by some pro-indy parliamentarians, but, on the third anniversary, I would have liked to see a set piece speech from the FM our perhaps our Constitution secretary in a European capital, looking to the future.\nThe high-level speech setting out Scotland’s future European strategy which I would have liked to see this week would inevitably have linked to our independence strategy. The speech the FM gave three years ago on Brexit day promised a Constitutional Convention. Since then, we have had a global pandemic followed by a cost-of-living crisis and the Scottish Government currently faces a number of policy challenges, however, its over time that Constitutional Convention was got off the ground. Perhaps the conference on 19th March could be a launch pad? The decision SNP delegates need to take there is one of process. I am currently enjoying discussions with branches in my constituency and beyond and with Westminster colleagues and I look forward to setting out my concluded thoughts in this column in the weeks to come."
