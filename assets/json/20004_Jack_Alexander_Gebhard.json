As cabinet member for Arts, Leisure Culture, Tourism and voluntary services, her department plays a key role in delivering many of the services which the council provides that make a noticeable difference to people across the county. Here, Cath reports her experience of the cabinet since she took on the role:\nI was honoured in May to be appointed to the role of Cabinet member for Arts, Leisure, Culture, Tourism and voluntary services, a hugely exciting portfolio within the county council that includes sports and leisure, libraries, tourism information, arts centres, play, museums and heritage, to name but a few. My area of work also includes a number of external organisations and I have recently been pleased to be appointed to the boards of Active Northumberland, Northumberland Tourism and Northumberland Sport.\nUndoubtedly the council is facing a number of challenges across all the areas of it's work but I am pleased to confirm that we as an administration have given a commitment to arts, culture, leisure and tourism as we recognise the contribution these areas make towards healthier and more resilient communities and the huge role tourism and events have to make towards the economy of our beautiful county.\nSince May I have been lucky enough to attend a number of exciting events like the Northumberland Schools Games where hundreds of young people from across the county competed in over 20 different sports. I also look forward to the Tour of Britain cycle race returning to the county on 4th September, and the opening of the Sill, The National Park Discovery Centre at Bardon Mill this weekend.\nWhere there are challenges come opportunities and I look forward to looking in detail at how culture, arts, leisure and tourism can be developed and sustained for years to come. As a committed volunteer in my home town I also appreciate the vital role that voluntary organisations play in our communities and I intend to develop this work further. A number of reviews are currently underway and I look forward to providing you with more updates in the months to come.",

We have achieved so much in the last year and have dealt with some serious challenges. We are overcoming those challenges and are on the way to re-building our county after decades of neglect. In 2019 and beyond, I am looking forward to a new and optimistic future for Northumberland.\nThe 'Beast from the East' was an unexpected challenge early last year and I would like to thank county council staff for their incredible work. The public looked to us for help and I was delighted with how we responded.\nWe also continue to address the legacy of debt from the previous Labour administration and are striving to deliver services more effectively. My administration looks for solutions to problems rather than using the excuses of the past.\nWe are well on the way to investing the £100 million which we promised for roads in Northumberland and are exploring options for a much needed relief road for Blyth. Bringing back passenger rail services to South East Northumbeland is also top priority after years of broken promises from Labour. The dualling of the A1 will begin this year and we’ll continue to back further upgrades and improvements.\nWe are the only county in the North of England building new schools. To compliment that we’re increasing capacities and improving facilities at others. Our focus is to improve standards for all.\nArch has been abolished and residents continue to learn why this was an important step. We have set up a new development company to Advance Northumberland’s economic opportunities which has already started delivering jobs and growth.\nLabour’s Developers Charter has been removed, stopping the 26,000 new houses in the county which would have added more pressure onto our communities. We have established a new Local Plan which will focus on jobs and the economy over big housing developments. Our Plan will create up to 15,000 new jobs and will be passed early in the new year.\nNorthumbrians are rightly proud of the area they live in. This year that pride was shared by thousands of others nationwide as they backed Northumberland as the number one tourist county in the UK. We can build on this success together by backing the initiatives our council is delivering. ‘Discover our Land’ will launch in early 2019 to promote all the things that make Northumberland great.\nThe foundations are now in place to build an economy in which all of our neighbours can achieve their potential. Advance Northumberland is appealing to global companies to invest in our county, with some major announcements expected over the coming year. The Conservative government is backing our region with two vital devolution packages. The ‘North of Tyne’ area will boost our economy with a £600 million growth fund while improving education and training to make sure Northumbrians are well placed to make the most of the opportunities North of Tyne devolution will deliver. The Borderlands Growth Deal will also help stimulate growth in rural areas on both sides of the border. Thanks to this commitment from central government our future success will be in our own hands.\nThe foundations we have laid will increase the opportunities available for all Northumbrians. They will also make sure we’re equipped with the skills needed to make the most of a strong, progressive county. We will continue to celebrate our culture and heritage, protecting it for future generations so that we can make sure Northumberland achieves its potential. 2019 will be our year, but only if we build together.",

This morning he was selected to become the candidate representing the party in the Wansbeck constituency at this year’s election which was announced last month.\nJack was born in Ashington at the Wansbeck General Hospital and was raised in nearby Morpeth where he went to Abbeyfields First School, Newminster Middle School then King Edward VI High School.\nHis priority for the constituency is to encourage investment so residents can benefit from well paid, high quality jobs with the right training so that everyone can achieve their potential.\nSpeaking of the appointment Jack said:\n“For as long as I’ve been involved in politics I have wanted to stand for the area I was born and raised to give residents the opportunity to back a local Conservative candidate.\n“Under Boris Johnson we’re finally able to deliver on the result of the referendum in 2016 and after that we can get on with the rest of the country’s priorities.\n“We need to invest in town centres across the constituency, bring back the Northumberland to Newcastle rail line and create good, well paying jobs so that people can see this is a place to live and raise a family.”",

Asked specifically about the scheme, Rayner refused to commit to it stating that the Labour Party wouldn't 'overpromise', despite it already receiving the go-ahead from government.\nDocuments published after the chancellor’s budget address to the House of Commons revealed the Department for Transport had deemed the scheme \"unfunded and unaffordable\", despite the same budget hitting Northumberland workers and businesses with crippling tax rises.\nRichard Wearmouth, the Conservative deputy leader of Northumberland County Council said:\n“£67 million had been invested by the last Government on land acquisition, gaining planning permission and completing design works.\n“The project was literally shovel ready. There was money available from the scrapping of HS2, and from the huge tax increases heaped on hard working households across our region by the Chancellor in today's budget. But yet again Labour turned its back on the North East and took voters here for granted as they always do.\n\"The scheme is of vital importance to our local and regional economy, it would strengthen the union in terms of better links to Scotland and it would significantly improve safety for Northumberland residents.\n\"I am in the process of contacting National Highways to seek immediate discussions to ensure the work done to date is not squandered. Needless to say our Conservative-run council will campaign tirelessly to get this project back up and running at the earliest opportunity and we will be seeking to have finishing this work as a firm manifesto commitment in any forthcoming general election.”",

That is why we are working hard to ensure their needs are met.\nNorthumberland has many vulnerable residents including those who are ‘shielding’ on government advice because they have health issues; older people, either those at home and needing support or those who live in residential homes; and residents with physical or mental health issues, some of whom live at home and use our day centres, or those who live in supported housing.\nThe county council has been working to support all of these groups.\n-‘Shielded’ residents are those who have been advised on health grounds to isolate completely. The government is supporting them to ensure they have food delivered when they need it. The Council’s Community Hub is ensuring this is achieved. We are liaising with supermarkets and delivering food boxes and supplies directly to those in need. They are also supporting those struggling financially in the same way, with the help of local food banks and their support groups.\n-There are local support groups across the county who have provided invaluable help. Hundreds of volunteers have ensured that vulnerable people are receiving prescriptions and food, as well as other services, and anyone in need can still sign up to request support from one of the council’s volunteers.\n-Council-run day centres for working age adults with physical and mental issues were closed at the start of the outbreak as parents and carers wanted to keep their family members safe. Despite this, we are supporting them at home when needed to ensure families have had the help to manage and we are continuing to ensure that those living in supported accommodation are safe.\n-Providing adult social care during this difficult period has proven especially challenging but thanks to the tremendous work of dedicated staff, we are looking after our most vulnerable citizens. Thousands of older people in our county - parents, grandparents and neighbours - simply could not manage without them and it has been testament to these organisations and their staff that they have been able to maintain the essential care and support to those in need.\n-Early on in the pandemic, private care providers in Northumberland struggled to source Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Our council recognised how important this was for our care providers and residents, so we went beyond other councils in sourcing the PPE carers needed whether they were council-run services or not. A lot of this vital equipment was generously donated from local businesses, who were motivated only by a desire to help out in their community!\n-We have continued to keep in very regular contact with our care homes and home care providers to ensure that they have the PPE they need to control infection and continue testing. Although Northumberland care homes have not been Covid free, almost two thirds of the homes we commission have not had any cases at all.\nIt has been an uphill challenge, but together we have ensured that the county’s most vulnerable have had the support they need, despite the ongoing crisis.",

The plan builds on the party’s record over the last 8 years, with an offer of providing quality services, while avoiding tax rises of up to 10%, as proposed by Labour-run Birmingham in February.\nThe event was attended by the Conservative Party’s Shadow Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Robbie Moore, who represented Alnwick on Northumberland County Council before his election as Member of Parliament for Keighley.\nNorthumberland Conservatives’ 6 point plan includes:\n- A well run council – Don’t risk mismanagement again and council tax rises of up to 10%.\n- Quality services – We have kept our promises to invest right across the county and deliver our pledges.\n- Roads to recovery – We will spend £130 million on the county’s roads over the next four years.\n- Jobs for Northumberland – With a £110 million Northumberland Growth Fund we will create thousands of high quality, well paid jobs for Northumbrians.\n- Free parking – We will keep parking free in market towns across the county.\n- Homes for Northumbrians – We will continue to build affordable homes in the county while fighting Labour’s plans to concrete over the county’s greenbelt.\nCouncil leader Glen Sanderson said:\n“We have kept our promises we made four years ago and we will keep them again if our residents give us their support on May 1st. We will fight Labour’s plan to concrete over the greenbelt. We will protect free parking in Northumberland. And we will spend £130 million on the county’s roads.\n“It is a huge honour to represent our residents and we take our responsibilities very seriously - so we have used your money sensibly to protect our frontline services, to invest in the future by bringing huge investment and jobs and improved our services across the board.\n“There is more money coming into Northumberland than at any time in the past - it is a County that is leading the way and we will keep it that way.”\nRobbie said:\n“Voters in Northumberland have a clear choice between a well run council and quality local services with the Conservatives or mismanagement again and tax rises of up to 10% with Labour.\n“Taxes are going up in Labour areas across the country, while bins are going uncollected and services aren’t being delivered. That’s what Labour will bring to Northumberland if successful on 1st May. Meanwhile, Reform candidates are showing a clear misunderstanding of what a local council is responsible for, focusing on national issues with no plan for Northumberland.”\n“Only the Conservatives are promising to protect market towns by keeping free parking. Only the Conservatives are opposing Labour’s attacks on rural communities. And only the Conservatives are focused on the local issues that the council can address, like spending £130 million on the counties roads, protecting the greenbelt and investing in young people with state of the art education facilities.”",

Ian Lavery chose not to participate in the vote.\nDuring the debate about the Winter Fuel Allowance, Labour’s spokesperson James Murray MP refused to rule out a further attack on pensioners through the removal of travel concessions for people of state pension age and single-person discounts on council tax.\nCouncil leader Glen Sanderson said:\n“It is very disappointing to see our new MPs let pensioners of Northumberland down in this way. Labour’s own research has said that up to 4000 pensioners could die as a result of their actions, and our council will do all it can to mitigate the impact of their policy.\n“Northumberland has been identified as one of the areas worst affected by this change. Sir Keir talks about pension credit as an alternative, but there are around 70,000 pensioners in Northumberland who will lose out as they don't meet the threshold for pension credit. As a rural county we have many residents using expensive oil heating as they live off the gas grid, and we have a higher than average percentage of residents on the cusp of qualifying for the payments under the newly proposed criteria.”",

She works for a housing organisation that works to ensure that new houses built in the United Kingdom are of a good standard for residents. Legally qualified, and having spent time working at a solicitors firm , Ros is currently the only candidate with the experience to deliver for residents as the Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC).\nRos is aware of the size of the challenge. Crime in Northumbria has risen over the last year, and the current Labour PCC, Kim McGuinness, has presided over a drop in the level of public confidence in Northumbria Police, which will undoubtedly dent the confidence of our hardworking local officers. McGuinness has recently been publicly criticised for her failure to hold Northumbria Police’s management to account for a lack of action dealing with a number of serious incidents, instead focussing on her own campaign to become the North East Mayor. While Labour have selected another career politician as their candidate, Ros has pledged to put the politics aside and focus on the job of cutting crime. Her plan includes:\n· Getting tougher on offenders and ensure that Northumbria Police have the resources, facilities and cell space to properly enforce the law, and securing more officers on the frontline across the Northumbria Police area.\n· Taking a no-nonsense approach to fighting crime, with a reduction crime numbers and putting in place strategies to deal with violent, knife and acquisitive crime and violence against women and girls.\n· Keeping the policing precept of our Council Tax as low as possible after years of continual Labour increases.\nRos said:\n“We need Northumbria Police to focus less on PC media campaigns, and more on getting PCs on the streets. We need to get back to the basics in Northumbria and stop trying to police “woke” issues, like spats on social media. I want to see more police officers on the streets, robustly and energetically dealing with the issues that matter to our communities, which will act as a deterrent for offending.\n“In April this year we met the Conservative Party’s 2019 manifesto pledge to increase police numbers across the country by 20,000. Across Northumbria that has amounted to 705 new recruits, yet crime is continuing to rise and public confidence in our police is falling.\n“Improving Northumbria Police is possible, but to do this, we need a Conservative Police and Crime Commissioner, who will put residents first and focus on the job of cutting crime.”\nTo stay in touch with Ros’ campaign you can see follow her on Twitter/X and Facebook.",

The amount is over three years but over half is being given this year.\nThis money has meant that we have been able to increase the amount that we pay to care homes for residential care, something that the homes have been asking for. But we have taken the opportunity not just to lift the rates we pay but to restructure how we make these payments, driving up standards by linking the payments to the quality ratings homes received from the government’s Quality Care inspectors and have set a “Gold”, “Silver” and “Bronze” rate based on these.\nWe’ve also been able to increase payments to those homes which offer specialist care such as dementia care and are making extra payments to smaller care homes as it increases choice and, on average, smaller homes are more likely to offer a high quality of care.\nWe know that older people prefer to stay at home as long as they can, and this relies on good home care being available.\nWe currently deliver over 20,000 hours of home care per week throughout Northumberland, funded by the Council. The situation in Northumberland is better than in some other local authorities but still difficulties in arranging care packages was becoming a more serious problem, particularly in the most rural areas.\nThe government’s money has allowed us to be able to increase these fees too. It’s also allowed us to look again at how we assess “extra rural” areas and we have been able to extend this category so that we are making extra payments for care in areas where more support is needed. The areas which we have classified as “very rural” are those where there have recently been the most serious problems in promptly setting up care packages so that people can go home sooner so we’ve given this help so that older people don’t have to stay in hospital unnecessarily.\nAnd finally we’ve been able to use some of this money to support those with learning disabilities and more widely for campaigns to help residents in Northumberland lead a healthier life.",
