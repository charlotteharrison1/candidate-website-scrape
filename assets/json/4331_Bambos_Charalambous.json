But it doesn’t have to be that way. With the right priorities, the right partnerships and the right values under a Labour government, Britain can and will thrive.\nLabour’s vision is for a Britain reconnected, for security and prosperity at home. This includes seeking a new UK-EU security pact, strong armed forces and resilience against 21st century threats; pushing for climate action to become a fourth pillar of the UN; and reforming the FCDO after the disastrous merger with DFID, re-establishing the UK as a trusted, reliable and influential partner while protecting Britons abroad.",

We spoke about the resources local authorities can use to help victims of domestic abuse and the severe impact social media has on cultivating misogynist attitudes among teenage boys and young men. We also discussed the role of the UK Government in supporting women in conflict zones internationally. We took a tour of Parliament where we saw pieces of suffragette history, including the cupboard where Emily Wilding Davison hid in on the night of the 1911 census!\nThis discussion served as a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in creating a safer society for women and girls. Currently there is a worrying level of sexual violence, domestic abuse and harassment experienced by women daily in the UK. By the end of 2023, there were only 2008 convictions for the 67,938 rape offences recorded by the police and data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that almost a quarter of women aged 16-24 experienced sexual harassment last year.\nBeyond these numbers are survivors whose lives have not only been deeply harmed by the abuse they have experienced, but also the failing systems they have turned to for support. It is imperative that the Government views the safety of women and girls as an utmost priority over this parliament, so we can strive towards a society where women are empowered rather than inhibited.",

  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_my-statement-on-the-war-in-israel-and-palestine/content_453.html": "I have watched the recent events unfolding in Israel and Gaza with horror. It is difficult to find the right words at such a distressing time.\nI have received hundreds of emails from people in our community over the past two weeks.\nYou can read my thoughts below.\nMy statement\nThousands of innocent people have been killed. Many thousands more have been injured. Both these numbers are likely to rise. My thoughts are with the victims and everyone who has been affected by this appalling, and ongoing, violence.\nFirstly, as your local MP, I have been in close contact with community leaders and the police to discuss community safety, and to reassure the Jewish and Muslim communities I represent. With Tell Mama and CST reporting over 300% increases in Islamophobic and anti-Semitic incidents, it is absolutely vital we come together as a community to support each other and stand against those who seek to divide us, as we know events in the Middle East cause huge pain in our communities here in the UK.\nI unequivocally condemn Hamas’ terrorism and the senseless violence against innocent people that occurred on 7 October.\nThis was a massacre, reminiscent of pogroms which took place in the 19th and early 20th century. I want to express my sympathy to all grieving families in Israel and across the world, and all those affected, including the British hostages held by Hamas. My thoughts are also with our Jewish community in Enfield Southgate who I know are in deep shock and grief following Hamas’s brutal attacks.\nIn Gaza, the already dire humanitarian situation is escalating to catastrophe.\nWhole neighbourhoods have been razed to the ground, with more than 3,000 people killed due to Israeli airstrikes, including thousands of children. The order that over a million Gazans leave their homes has led to chaos – without international aid, they will face hunger and thirst which will undoubtedly lead to many more deaths. My sympathy is with Palestinian families who have lost loved ones, or who are struggling to get news as to whether their relatives are alive or dead.\nI believe we need a negotiated ceasefire immediately – to protect innocent civilians.\nThe international community has a responsibility to promote this. International law must be upheld. Hostages must be returned to their families. Palestinian civilians need immediate safety from airstrikes. And we urgently need humanitarian aid corridors to be opened so that people can access food, water, medicines, and shelter. If this does not happen immediately, it will be nothing short of a humanitarian disaster.\nThe world must act before it is too late.\nIn the long term, we must support progress towards a negotiated settlement based on two states: with a safe and secure Israel alongside a sovereign Palestine. This, now, feels more remote than ever. And as the horrifying backdrop of war continues, the international community must make efforts to ensure all perpetrators of war crimes are held accountable. To be clear: the deliberate targeting of civilians is a war crime, as is the wilful destruction of civilian infrastructure which will undoubtedly lead to loss of civilian life.\nThis week I have written to the Foreign Secretary on the above points, urging the UK Government to support a ceasefire to protect civilian lives, and for the UK to do all it can to ensure aid reaches Palestinians in desperate need.\nImportant information, charity links and donations\nCharities working in Gaza\nI know this conflict will have deeply affected many people in our community, and many have asked how we can come together to help people in Gaza right now.\nAs the crisis in Gaza escalates, I think often of the Gazans I have met – in particular, the brave staff of Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), who are working around the clock to provide life-saving care in the most brutal of circumstances.\nMAP have launched an emergency appeal to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where hospitals are struggling to cope.\nMany other charities and organisations are appealing for support too, and you can find some more appeals below.\n- The Red Cross – https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territory-appeal\n- Save the Children – https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/how-you-can-help/emergencies/gaza-israel-conflict\n- UNICEF – https://www.unicef.org/appeals/state-of-palestine\n- World Food Programme – https://www.wfp.org/support-us/stories/palestine-appeal\nFCDO Travel Advice\nIn the past two weeks, my office has supported constituents and their families who were stranded in the region following Hamas’s terrorist attacks.\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office is regularly updating its travel advice, including for Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan.\nYou can find the latest advice on the FCDO website here: https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\nThis page was last updated on 20 October 2023.",

  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_consultation-response-on-train-station-ticket-offices/content_181.html": "Closure of Rail Ticket Offices in Enfield Southgate\nAfter hearing from constituents, the strength of feeling in our local community is clear. The closure of local train station ticket offices will be bad for safety, bad for passengers, and bad for staff.\nI have now responded to London Travelwatch’s consultation and you can read it in full below.\nSent via email – London Travelwatch\nI am writing on behalf of my constituents in Enfield Southgate to object to the proposed closure of ticket offices at Great Northern, including ticket offices at Hadley Wood, Enfield Chase, Grange Park, Winchmore Hill and Palmers Green in my constituency.\nFrom speaking to constituents about this issue, the strength of feeling in our local community is clear. The closure of these ticket offices will be bad for safety, passengers, and staff. I have set out the reasons for my objection in more detail below.\nImpact on passengers\nEveryone should have the right to travel with freedom and confidence. I am therefore deeply concerned that ticket office closures would cause a significant worsening of the facilities and support offered to vulnerable passengers, including disabled, Deaf and older people.\nAlready, disabled people face numerous barriers in accessing the rail network and are three times less likely to travel by rail than non-disabled people.\nFor example, research by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has found that only 3% of people with sight loss said they could use a ticket vending machine without problems and 58% said it was impossible. At the same time, 23% of disabled adults and 6% of non-disabled adults are unable to use the internet, and wheelchair user discounts can only be purchased at ticket offices.\nClosing ticket offices will require all passengers to purchase tickets online or through Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs) at the station.\nFor many of my constituents, online ticketing is simply not an option and using TVMs is difficult and not an accessible alternative. Indeed, the ticket office is the only way for passengers to ensure that they get the appropriate and best value fare for their journey. I recently met with the Hadley Wood Rail Users Group and they highlighted how passengers are unable to book advance tickets at TVMs but can at ticket offices. As you know, advance tickets are often a fraction of the price and removing this option could therefore hit people already struggling with the cost of living crisis.\nOne of my constituents, who is in her seventies, also told me that the “closing of ticket offices is awful. I am 77 and so many folks I know who are older with worse problems than me” will be affected.\nShe urged me to “Please keep ticket offices open, as doing everything online is not always a safe option. It seems we are no longer able to communicate verbally which has a huge impact on mental health.”\nThe Enfield Over 50s Forum also shared with me their concern about the negative consequences of ticket office closures for their members.\nThey reported that “apart from being a mine of information and expert advice, it is a point of human contact and a presence in what can be an unmonitored space. This is especially important as, with increasing age, people often find travelling stressful. They may need to check the journey is viable, get information on options or about platforms, as limited mobility makes unnecessary moving up and down steps over-demanding.\n“Clearly, fear of travelling will further fuel isolation when many families are now widely dispersed and visits to children and grandchildren, for example, should be as stress free as possible.”\nFor disabled passengers, the ticket office is about more than just tickets. At many stations ticket office staff are the only staff present, and their responsibilities often include assisting passengers on to trains, including with ramps where required and meeting them off the train.\nThey are the first point of contact when disabled passengers arrive at the station. Multifunctional staff who roam around the station are not an accessible alternative. For example, disabled people with mobility or energy impairments cannot travel through the station to try and find assistance, and blind and visually impaired passengers may struggle to identify a member of staff. Ticket offices are also the only designated point in the station with a hearing induction loop.\nAnother constituent wrote to me and shared her concerns about removing ticket offices for vulnerable passengers. She said: “I am concerned for the safety and security of vulnerable passengers and those with impaired sight who have difficulty using ticket machines or perhaps even negotiating the entry gates and stairs.”\nA recent audit by the Office of Rail and Road found that only 51% of disabled passengers were able to successfully receive assistance using help points. A system that fails half its disabled users cannot be implemented.\nFor the reasons outlined, I am very concerned that people in my constituency will be unable to access the assistance they need as a result of these ticket office closures and I urge Great Northern to reconsider these proposals.\nImpact on staff\nTicket office staff provide a valuable service to the community. I understand that the proposals from Great Northern mean staff who work in ticket offices will move to the concourse or a location in the station where they can provide additional support to passengers.\nI have serious concerns about how this would work at stations in my constituency.\nAs one constituent, who contacted me recently, said: “I live within walking distance of Winchmore Hill station and my immediate thought was ‘How could the staff be redeployed within the station if the ticket office was permanently closed?’ I can understand how this could be done at a large station where there is a main concourse and multiple platforms, but I cannot see how this would work at a small station such as Winchmore Hill so I can only assume that the station would be permanently unmanned with the ticket office staff subsequently losing their jobs.”\nI share these concerns. I am deeply worried about the job security of station staff in my constituency, and fear that these ticket office proposals are merely a prelude to job losses.\nRecently, speaking in the House of Commons, the Rail Minister said: “In the event that there are some [staff] that don’t wish to make that transition, then of course the train operators will need to look to that [job losses].”\nAnd I understand that Great Northern are currently running a staff consultation on the proposed changes.\nI have not received any assurances about the job security of staff, and I think it is difficult to see how train operators would be able to demonstrate that their proposals would make cost savings, unless there is the intention to reduce staffing.\nI am wholly opposed to any cuts to station staffing. I believe any supposed cost savings cannot be used to justify a policy that will worsen passenger service, accessibility, safety, security and access to the rail network and public transport.\nSafety\nStaffed ticket offices have an important role in supporting passenger safety and security. Ticket offices provide a place of safety for both staff and passengers. Requiring staff to undertake transactions out on the platform puts both passengers and themselves in a more vulnerable position.\nTicket office staff are trained and experienced in dealing with difficult incidents and the presence of staff deters abusive and anti-social behaviour.\nTicket office staff provide support and assistance to passengers during times of disruption or in response to emergencies and their role often includes carrying out safety and security checks at the station throughout the day.\nAs passenger watchdogs will be aware, there is a consistent theme emerging from research, which is that passengers like and value the presence of staff. I have shared evidence from constituents throughout this response that demonstrates this fact. Having staffed ticket offices supports passenger perceptions and feelings around safety, and closing ticket offices could lead to passengers no longer feeling safe when travelling.\nAs the Enfield Over 50s Forum said: “Empty stations, especially at night and off peak, are a gift to those with criminal intent, especially as travellers may well have money and cards to steal and be unable to defend themselves or run away. This is a major cause of anxiety.”\nClosing ticket offices will therefore inevitably, in my view, discourage many from travelling on the rail network.\nLength of consultation period\nFinally, I was disappointed that the length of the consultations on such a consequential change to our rail networks has been limited to only 21 days.\nGiven the huge scale of public concern around this issue in my constituency, the fact that passengers and staff have had only three weeks to put forward their views is simply not good enough. They want their views to be heard and properly considered.\nUltimately, for the reasons outlined above, I believe London Travelwatch must reject the proposals from Great Northern to close ticket offices in my constituency at Hadley Wood, Enfield Chase, Grange Park, Winchmore Hill and Palmers Green.\nBambos Charalambous MP for Enfield Southgate",

We spoke about the resources local authorities can use to help victims of domestic abuse and the severe impact social media has on cultivating misogynist attitudes among teenage boys and young men. We also discussed the role of the UK Government in supporting women in conflict zones internationally. We took a tour of Parliament where we saw pieces of suffragette history, including the cupboard where Emily Wilding Davison hid in on the night of the 1911 census!\nThis discussion served as a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in creating a safer society for women and girls. Currently there is a worrying level of sexual violence, domestic abuse and harassment experienced by women daily in the UK. By the end of 2023, there were only 2008 convictions for the 67,938 rape offences recorded by the police and data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that almost a quarter of women aged 16-24 experienced sexual harassment last year.\nBeyond these numbers are survivors whose lives have not only been deeply harmed by the abuse they have experienced, but also the failing systems they have turned to for support. It is imperative that the Government views the safety of women and girls as an utmost priority over this parliament, so we can strive towards a society where women are empowered rather than inhibited.",

Anton, Shireen’s brother, handed us a letter demanding international backing for an independent inquiry into Shireen’s killing and accountability for her death.\nWe also met staff at the Saraya community centre in the Old Town and the long established residents of the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem to hear about settler violence and evictions.\nDay 2 started with a visit to a Bedouin village in the E1 area of the West Bank which relies on a weekly mobile medical centre from Medical Aid for Palestinians. The portacabin used for medical appointments, part funded by the British Consulate General in Jerusalem and other international donors, had a demolition notice on it.\nWe later visited Beita, near Nablus, with the Palestine Red Crescent Society to hear about attacks on Palestinians protesting against illegal settlement outposts, and we also heard testimony from two terrified families in Burin whose homes had been subjected to settler violence.\nWe finished the day with an excellent discussion with Meretz MK Mossi Raz about the future of peace.\nOn Day 3, I had the pleasure of meeting Dr Amal Jadou, Palestinian Deputy Foreign Minister in Ramallah. We learned more about the Palestinian Authority’s vision for the future and the challenges it faces in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\nOn a busy final day, we saw the impact of the fence on the community of Al Walaja, visited Al Arroub refugee camp to hear of the excellent work done by the UN Relief and Works Agency, and then heard testimonies in Hebron from former IDF soldiers now part of Breaking the Silence.",

Since their catastrophic mini-Budget, costs have skyrocketed and family finances are being devastated.\nSupport is needed, but we can’t trust the Tories to provide it.\nThe Prime Minister was warned by experts about this in the autumn. But his Government has been too consumed by its own law-breaking, its own chaos and the never-ending Tory psychodrama to care.\nWe need practical measures to tackle this crisis, including requiring lenders to allow mortgage holders to temporarily switch to interest-only mortgage payments and to lengthen the term of their mortgage period. And requiring lenders to wait a minimum of six months before initiating repossession proceedings, because we’re seeing a 50% rise in repossessions already as a result of this crisis.",

This is a terrible result and shows he has effectively lost the confidence of his backbenchers.\nIt’s a worse result than Thatcher in 1990; worse than May in 2018; and worse than Major in 1995.\nBoris Johnson is a dead man walking, but the Conservatives have chosen to ignore the British public and hitched themselves and their party firmly to him and all he represents. They have no plan to tackle the issues we are facing in this country, and I believe the Government will continue to lurch from one scandal to another under his leadership.",

But they are reliant on us for support too – with charitable donations making up around 70-80% of their income.

Sadly, I expect this to continue over the coming weeks.\nThe Passport Office now has a 10-week target to process applications and many people looking forward to a long-awaited holiday are now facing an anxious wait for a passport, often applied for months ago.\nThe Government should be clear with people whether the situation is going to get worse before it gets better and take urgent action to address organisational failings.",

The redevelopment will ensure the Civic Centre reopens with a larger footprint to serve residents as a hub for Council services and offer public cultural spaces.\nIt is also wonderful to see how the Council have used the online consultation, Civic Voices, to engage with local residents and use their views to design this new and improved Civic Centre, while preserving history and celebrating important memories.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/thumbnail_be00283e-e06b-4d1f-9dd0-d8b6ff67538b.jpeg250390Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-05-02 09:12:372025-05-02 09:12:37Haringey Civic Centre Groundbreaking Ceremony\nIt was great to visit My Dental Care in Bounds Green on Friday to meet dentist Mark Marcou to discuss issues accessing NHS dentistry in Southgate and Wood Green and challenges facing NHS practice owners.\nI am pleased that the Government is committed to saving NHS dentistry and ensuring everyone who needs access, can get it.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/edac97fb-877a-4fd9-9cbe-74807b4e1b13-1.jpeg15362048Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-04-28 10:38:152025-04-28 10:38:15Visit to My Dental Care\nIt was wonderful to open Aaron Gayle Court in Wood Green today with Joanne McCartney AM, Leader Cllr Peray Ahmet, Deputy Leader Cllr Sarah Williams, and the Deputy Mayor for Housing Tom Copley.\nWith 23 new homes for Haringey, Aaron Gayle is part of Haringey Council’s programme to deliver 3000 new council homes by 2031.\nIt was wonderful to visit the staff and residents of Five Oaks Care Home today in Cockfosters.\nThank you to everyone for all your hard work in making the care home run so smoothly and for the wonderful spread!\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GoQtZLiXEAA5YqH.jpg675900Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-04-14 08:54:412025-04-14 08:55:10Visit to Five Oaks Care Home\nToday, I spoke up for our local Enfield and Haringey Councils in the Local Government Finances in London Westminster Hall debate.\nEnfield and Haringey deserve the right funding to provide good services for residents, and both councils have seen severe declines in their funding since 2010. Damping council funds is wrong – the inner-outer London formula is unfair and must be scrapped.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-172159.png7771780Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-26 17:49:592025-03-28 12:21:01Local Government Finances in London Debate\nI had a lovely visit to St Michael at Bowes Primary School yesterday to meet the school council. We had an important discussion on bullying and the impact it has on children.\nIt was great to hear what they like about school and their favourite lessons, and discuss a visit for the council to come to Parliament!\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1954-scaled.jpeg19202560Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-18 16:45:372025-03-18 16:45:38Visit to St Michael at Bowes\nI welcomed the Southgate and Wood Green Women’s Constituency Labour Party to Parliament to have a serious discussion about tackling violence against women and girls in today’s society as we marked International Women’s Day last week. We spoke about the resources local authorities can use to help victims of domestic abuse and the severe impact social media has on cultivating misogynist attitudes among teenage boys and young men. We also discussed the role of the UK Government in supporting women in conflict zones internationally. We took a tour of Parliament where we saw pieces of suffragette history, including the cupboard where Emily Wilding Davison hid in on the night of the 1911 census!\nThis discussion served as a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in creating a safer society for women and girls. Currently there is a worrying level of sexual violence, domestic abuse and harassment experienced by women daily in the UK. By the end of 2023, there were only 2008 convictions for the 67,938 rape offences recorded by the police and data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that almost a quarter of women aged 16-24 experienced sexual harassment last year.\nBeyond these numbers are survivors whose lives have not only been deeply harmed by the abuse they have experienced, but also the failing systems they have turned to for support. It is imperative that the Government views the safety of women and girls as an utmost priority over this parliament, so we can strive towards a society where women are empowered rather than inhibited.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2c325923-b34b-4143-ba96-56d3447a9f26.jpeg15362048Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-13 15:00:372025-03-13 15:01:22Women’s Branch of the CLP in Parliament\nSunday the 9th of March marked Covid Reflection Day, a time to remember the lives lost during the pandemic.

While other benefits have been uprated in line with inflation, LHA has remained at the same level as it was 3 years ago – which is based on rents in the year up to September 2019. Since then, bills and the cost of living have increased significantly, with rents rising at the fastest rate on record.\nLHA is a critical element of people’s income and many are now being forced to make up the difference between their rent and LHA. Many have already, and will continue, to reduce their spending on other necessities such as food and heating or risk getting into rent arrears, which puts them in danger of becoming homeless.\nThis is causing hardship for people in our community, and it is something that comes up in my casework day in, day out.\nI wrote to the Chancellor about this issue urging him to consider taking steps to support people in our community by increasing LHA in line with inflation.\nI was pleased and relieved that the Chancellor listened to these calls.\nIt is not all good news though. The uplift in LHA will not be implemented until April 2024, which means people in our community will face another uncertain and difficult winter with the cost of living and rent.",

I look forward to welcoming residents from these areas to my constituency should the plans be finalised.\nThis proposal is different from the initial plan, outlined in 2021, to merge Enfield Southgate with parts of Barnet. However, this proposal is now the final consultation on the revised boundaries.\nThe consultation is open until 5th December. More information about the latest proposals and the consultation can be found on the Boundary Commission website.",

  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_raac-scandal-update/content_378.html": "As children went back to school, the full extent of the Government’s incompetence on RAAC has come to light, and I know people are understandably anxious about this situation.\nIt is unacceptable that parents have been in the dark about the dangers posed to their children at school and what buildings contain reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC).\nLocal update\nAs information finally comes out about what schools are affected, we know there are three schools in Enfield impacted. However, none have had to close and all schools in the borough were able to open for the return of the academic year as normal.\nIn our constituency, I understand that Winchmore School has identified RAAC in a small part of the school, and this area has been sealed off with no danger to staff and pupils. I will continue to update constituents as the situation develops, including with more information about other public buildings that may be affected.\nIn other parts of England, the identification of RAAC has caused massive disruption and anxiety for pupils, teachers and parents, with some schools forced to close.\nRishi Sunak’s responsibility in this crisis\nBack when he was Chancellor, Rishi Sunak was warned about the state of school buildings and the need to properly fund a school rebuilding programme.\nHe was reportedly presented evidence by Department for Education officials that there was a ‘critical risk to life’ and that these problems needed urgent action; it was recommended that funding was needed to rebuild 300 to 400 schools a year in England. Rishi Sunak ignored this advice, providing initial funding for 100 schools, which was then halved again to only 50 schools.\nWe are seeing the impact of these decisions today, with crumbling classrooms symptomatic of the years of neglect and failure we’ve faced under consecutive Conservative governments.\nSchool buildings are unsafe, the first week of term has been ruined for pupils and teachers, and parents are grappling with their children learning from home once more. All the while, the Education Secretary wants parents to thank her for her hard work.\nThe Government needs to stop failing the next generation and get a grip on this crisis.",

Thousands are already confirmed dead with that number expected to rise; infrastructure has been flattened; and hundreds remain trapped in buildings that have collapsed.\nMy thoughts are with all those impacted by this tragedy, including people in Enfield Southgate with family and friends in the region.\nAs a member of the Shadow Foreign Affairs team, I’ve been supporting calls for Britain to play its full part in assisting in the emergency and ensuring that families in the UK are kept informed about the safety of their relatives in the region. I welcome the FCDO’s decision to send a team of search and rescue specialists, equipment and rescue dogs to Turkey and its continued co-ordination with the UN in support of those in Syria.\nEmergency appeals and information on donations\nFollowing the earthquakes, I know people in our community are concerned about the situation in Turkey and Syria. Several charities and organisations have launched appeals and are providing support on the ground, and you can find some information on this below.\nDisasters Emergency Committee (DEC) charities and their local partners are among the first responders providing urgent help. Immediate priorities are search and rescue, medical treatment for the injured, shelter for those who have lost their homes, heating in safe spaces, blankets, warm clothes, and ensuring people have food and clean water.\nMore information on the DEC appeal here: https://www.dec.org.uk/appeal/turkey-syria-earthquake-appeal\nRed Cross Turkey Syria Earthquake Appeal: https://donate.redcross.org.uk/appeal/turkey-syria-earthquake-appeal\nIslamic Relief Turkiye Syria Earthquake Appeal: https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/giving/appeals/turkiye-syria-earthquake-appeal/\nOxfam Turkey and Syria Earthquake Appeal: https://www.oxfam.org.uk/oxfam-in-action/current-emergencies/turkey-and-syria-earthquake-appeal/\nSave the Children: https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/how-you-can-help/emergencies/turkey-syria-earthquake\nThe situation in Syria is incredibly concerning.

Viewpoint Estates have since appealed this decision and an inquiry is currently underway with the Planning Inspectorate.\nDuring my evidence session yesterday, I supported that a town must evolve, however this must be done in a manner that is in the interests of residents now and in the future, and should not take away more than it contributes.\nFollowing on from many conversations with constituents over the last two years, I raised the following concerns with the Inquiry:\n- The proposed 17-storey height is excessive, an overdevelopment and out of character for the area, especially as this would be on a hill top in an area where no other developments are higher than six-storeys.\n- This proposal would result in overdevelopment and local infrastructure would not be able to keep pace with the added pressure likely to be placed on for example, schools and GPs surgeries.\n- The development is close to a conservation area and the proximity would adversely impact on views and light for surrounding properties;\n- There is a lack of genuinely affordable accommodation and much of the development will comprise one-bedroom flats, which does not meet the need in the area for housing for local families.\nFollowing on from the Council organised Planning panel meeting, constituents of Enfield Southgate have made the strength of their objections clear since that time, and I fully support them in their objections on the above grounds.\nThe Inquiry Inspector brought attention to the housing crisis and a need to build new homes. Whilst I agreed that there is a severe shortage of housing, the development does not meet the need for housing with three or more bedrooms to assist families. Southgate Office Village comprises 206 housing units with only 16 of those proposed to be 3 bedrooms, with 190 1-2 bed units. With over 3000 homeless families in the borough, this proposal does not contribute to our community or provide an affordable solution to the housing crisis.\nI hoped to amplify the voice of constituents and to safeguard the needs of residents in response to this proposal; I asked that the Inquiry listens to my constituents and our community.",

Now, as we face a crucial deadline of 31st March, when support and interest free loan periods come to an end, the Government must set out a long-term plan for rebuilding business.\nHere’s what needs to happen:\n-Use the £2bn in business rate relief, that supermarkets have pledged to return to the Treasury, to establish a Hospitality and High Streets Fightback Fund for those firms hardest hit throughout the crisis\n-Set out a plan for businesses that have had to take on debt and cannot access grants as they are not legally required to close\n-extend the deadlines for business rates and VAT holidays and repayments of bounce-back loans, keeping them interest free for longer\n-provide proper and timely clarity for local councils on the one-off discretionary payment funds – how long should it last and what happens next?\n-clarify how the £594m in discretionary funding for businesses has been calculated and will be allocated\n-provide clarity for businesses about what happens if, by the time we reach deadline dates for support, there are still public health restrictions in place.\nStitch is just one example of a local business that fell through the cracks. They’ve been trying to secure grants to survive. I am helping Stitch, and many other small businesses, because I know how vital small businesses are to our local economy. I’ve also questioned the Government today on two important issues:\nWhat assessment the Government has made to understand how the removal of retail business rates relief will impact independent retailers?\nWhat assessment the Government has made to understand how demanding payment of bounce-back loans before lockdown ends, will impact independent retailers?\nOver the next six weeks, I will be contacting all small businesses in Enfield Southgate to find out their views.",

Here’s a roundup from me.\nCrisis and IPPR event on homelessness\nFirstly, it was a pleasure to speak at the Institute for Public Policy Research and Crisis panel event about homelessness amongst non-UK nationals.\nI made the point that the cause of homelessness is a direct result of the hostile environment policies introduced by this Conservative government, which continues to criminalise people and slash vital local authority budgets. There was broad agreement that the hostile environment has been a big cause of homelessness for non-UK nationals among the panel.\nRefugee Action panel event on refugees\nWith Refugee Action, I chaired a fantastic panel at conference on defending the rights of refugees and people seeking asylum. Speakers included Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds, and it was great to hear widespread concerns about the Nationality and Borders Bill.\nRefugees deserve compassion. The Government’s proposals, as they are currently written, do the opposite.\nMeeting young ambassadors from Send My Friend\nI was also grilled by the incredibly articulate and insightful young ambassadors from Send My Friend. Questions focused on the climate crisis, education and the impact of policies on young people across the UK. Our future is definitely in safe hands!\nLabour policy announcements\nWe also heard from colleagues during conference about what a Labour government would look like, including a superb speech from Keir Starmer highlighting the need for a good society and strong economy. The Labour values of work, care, equality and security will underpin our policies as we go into the election.\nHere’s a look at some of the policies announced this week.\nMental health\nThe way we approach mental health in this country needs to change. Labour will transform mental health services with 8,500 new mental health staff, open access mental health hubs, specialist support in every secondary school and new funding to improve mental health outcomes.\nGreen investment\nIt was also great to see the climate investment pledge made by Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves of £28 billion each year until 2030 on green infrastructure and jobs. By acting, Labour will avoid spiralling costs in the future as the Tories continue to kick the climate can down the road.\nEducation\nOn education, I was proud to see the policies announced at conference. The Labour Party is committed to investing in children’s futures, enabling them to develop the skills that will set them up for life. This includes making work experience compulsory, boosting arts and digital funding, offering better careers guidance to children, ensuring all children are offered the chance to play a musical instrument or sport, and teaching students about pensions, mortgages and contracts from a young age.\nThese policies will change lives and will be funded by removing the charitable status from private schools.",
  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_gambling-act-review-timetable-letter/content_95.html": "Adult Gaming Centre in Palmers Green update\nThe consultation for the new adult gaming centre in Green Lanes has closed and the Council has now issued a licence for the premises.\nThis is disappointing news. On behalf of local residents, I lodged my objections to this licence application last month as I am extremely concerned about what another adult gaming centre will mean for our high street and for residents.\nFollowing the licence being granted, the next stage of the process will be a planning application for the new Adult Gaming Centre premises. As soon as I am aware that the application has been lodged, I will alert constituents so that objections can be made.\nHowever, we know that Local Authorities have very limited powers to refuse gambling premises licences.\nBack in early 2021, Merkur Slots obtained permission to open a 24 hour Adult Gaming Centre in the heart of Palmers Green at 292/292a Green Lanes, N13 close to several existing betting shops. As many will remember, there was a huge local campaign objecting to these new premises, including a petition signed by over 4,700 people.\nHowever, given the limited powers to refuse gambling premises licences, Enfield Council was unable to prevent these premises opening.\nAt that same time, the Government was undertaking a review of the Gambling Act 2005, and taking submissions until the end of March 2021.\nI encouraged those who contacted me to respond to that Review and to raise the issue of enhanced powers for local licensing authorities when considering gambling premises licences, to enable them to take into account local factors, such as a clustering of gambling premises in the area. And to bring the licensing process into line with that for applications for premises selling alcohol.\nUnfortunately, it took the Government over two years to respond to the Review, with its White Paper published on 27 April 2023: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/high-stakes-gambling-reform-for-the-digital-age/high-stakes-gambling-reform-for-the-digital-age#chap6\nIn the meantime, and before any reforms to the system have been made, we now have yet another Adult Gaming Centre licence to contend with.\nIt is a testament to the local strength of feeling on this issue that the Gambling Act Review White Paper’s analysis of the submissions made acknowledged the participation of 98 Enfield residents in a “campaign that raised concerns about the opening of an Adult Gaming Centre in Enfield, stating that further powers were required for Local Authorities”. This amounted to 15% of responses that came from identifiable campaigns.\nThe White Paper states several times that the Government will introduce primary legislation to bring the licensing regime into line with that for alcohol by legislating to introduce a formal system of Cumulative Impact Assessments (CIAs) “when Parliamentary time allows.”\nA Cumulative Impact Assessment would enable local licensing authorities to take into account local information, such as statistics on local crime and anti social behaviour, health and environmental health.\nWhilst this would help in making an effective challenge to a gambling premises licence application, I am concerned by the vague commitment to introduce this legislation “when Parliamentary time allows”.\nWhile the Government delays the introduction of legislation to reform gambling, our high streets remain at risk of even more gambling premises opening. Local businesses and residents are working to improve the local high street area and develop family friendly spaces, but their efforts are undermined by the continued growth in gambling premises in the area.\nI have therefore written to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport asking her to commit to a timetable for the introduction of this legislation as soon as possible. You can read my letter in full below.\nI have now received a response from DCMS. It says that the Government is committed to giving Local Authorities the powers they need to regulate gambling in their local areas, but we still don’t know when this legislation, which is so desperately needed, will be introduced.\nLast updated 22.09.23",

The aim should be to cut Russia out of the western economic system, targeting the finance, energy, technology and defence sectors as well as individuals linked to Putin and the Russian government. After more than a decade of inaction, the influence of corrupt Russian money must now be extricated from the UK.\nWe also need to unite the international community against Putin’s ideology of authoritarianism, imperialism and ethno-nationalism. But we must be clear that our opposition is to Putin and his gangster regime, not ordinary Russian people.\nWe’ve already seen images and videos of Russians united in protest against the invasion of Ukraine.

I was disappointed to hear little about tackling the cost of living crisis as people in Enfield Southgate face soaring energy bills and the highest tax burden in 50 years.\nInflation is soaring; household bills are soaring; and the cost of the weekly shop is soaring while people’s wages are running out earlier and earlier in the month. The Government’s announcements this week needed to meet these challenges.\nInstead, it’s clear the Conservatives are out of ideas while they continue to row back on promises made to voters. For example, where was the promised Employment Bill? Or the ban on foie gras and fur?\nFirst and foremost though, we need action on the cost of living crisis. People need real help, right now, and Labour is calling for an emergency budget to tackle this crisis with a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to support households. I hope the Government wakes up and listens to people’s concerns.",

What is clear is that the asylum system is broken. The number of people waiting more than 12 months for an initial asylum decision was over 33,000 last year, which is ten times the number in 2010, according to recent research by the Refugee Council. The Government are threatening to make the system even worse with their Nationality and Borders Bill which offers no solutions but a lot of hostile rhetoric about people seeking sanctuary here. As we approach the 70th anniversary of the Refugee Convention I will do all I can to fight for a fair, effective and humane asylum system.",

I am the first MP elected for the new constituency of Southgate and Wood Green at the 2024 General Election. Before my parliamentary career began, I was a solicitor and worked for Hackney Council on their housing litigation team for 16 years.\nI was the first MP whose parents are both from Cyprus. I was born in London and raised in Bowes Park. I love Enfield – I grew up here and many of my friends and family live in the area.\nAs a child, I went to St Michael at Bowes Junior school, where I am now a school governor. I was a councillor for Palmers Green ward for 24 years – the place that has been my home for most of my life.\nBefore entering Parliament, I was Enfield Council’s cabinet member for Leisure, Culture, Localism and Young People.\nI have previously sat on Labour’s frontbench as the Shadow Immigration Minister and Shadow Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East and North Africa.\nI will always speak up for Southgate and Wood Green in Parliament and campaign on the issues that matter to you.\nConstituency contacts\nParliamentary Questions asked\nLetters to Government Ministers\nSpeeches in parliament",

  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_meeting-with-local-businesses-26th-feb-2021/content_358.html": "Local businesses that have been hit hard by the pandemic, joined Labour’s Shadow Minister for Business and Consumers, Lucy Powell MP and I, to talk about what support they need now, and over the next 12 months.\nWhile some businesses have made huge profits from the pandemic, many more are on the brink of collapse. As Lucy Powell rightly pointed out in our meeting, the original support for businesses from the Government was designed for a three-month shut down, not 12 months. Businesses face a cliff edge and a £50bn bombshell in April when support comes to an end.\nAlthough business grants have been welcome, they still don’t go far enough for some businesses. Many have fallen through the cracks and have received no money at all. Local councils are under pressure with no extra resources to administer grants and are grappling with slow, restrictive, and complex guidance on where financial support can go. As a matter of urgency, I am taking up issues that local businesses have with outstanding grants from Enfield Council. The recent additional grant money to local Councils is not even enough to absolutely guarantee every businesses’ survival, but it absolutely vital to saving as many as possible.\nRevenue-based grant schemes have been used by some European Countries and seemed to have worked much better for businesses. Perhaps the Government’s intention was right, but the mechanisms and scale of support have fallen short.\nLocal businesses, from a wide range of industries – weddings, wellbeing, garments, hospitality, transport, all raised serious issues that are being felt by the business community up and down the country. Some landlords are ignoring the code of practice, putting businesses in incredibly vulnerable positions, insurance companies are refusing to pay up, there’s a lack of parity for businesses on social distancing measures, the Government has failed to appreciate the seasonal nature of some industries and some have been unable to keep on trainees and apprentices, jeopardising the future of whole sectors. Not to mention the depleted personal financial resources of business owners who now feel there is only a very bleak future ahead.\nThe asks were clear: an extension of the business rates holiday; sector specific support that will keep them afloat and sustain their futures; furlough extensions; government backed insurance for some sectors to give confidence to consumers; and extra resources to speed up the process of paying out grant money.\nLabour are backing the business community in their call for more support. We’re calling for an extension to the business rates holiday and an extension to the reduced rate of VAT. The Chancellor has a chance to make this a reality in this week’s budget. He also has a chance to heed our calls for a ‘smart’ extension to furlough alongside urgent action to fix the youth unemployment scheme and support for job creation. Sunak could park all the CBILS and Bounce Back Loan debt into a separate bank. Labour would establish a new British Business Recovery Agency to manage all the loans and offer businesses more options to deal with the debt they’ve taken on, including only demanding repayments for Bounce Back Loans for small businesses when they are actually growing again.\nIf the Government doesn’t take action, hundreds of thousands of businesses could go bust in the next three months. That will put almost two and half million jobs at risk.",

We spoke about the resources local authorities can use to help victims of domestic abuse and the severe impact social media has on cultivating misogynist attitudes among teenage boys and young men. We also discussed the role of the UK Government in supporting women in conflict zones internationally. We took a tour of Parliament where we saw pieces of suffragette history, including the cupboard where Emily Wilding Davison hid in on the night of the 1911 census!\nThis discussion served as a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in creating a safer society for women and girls. Currently there is a worrying level of sexual violence, domestic abuse and harassment experienced by women daily in the UK. By the end of 2023, there were only 2008 convictions for the 67,938 rape offences recorded by the police and data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that almost a quarter of women aged 16-24 experienced sexual harassment last year.\nBeyond these numbers are survivors whose lives have not only been deeply harmed by the abuse they have experienced, but also the failing systems they have turned to for support. It is imperative that the Government views the safety of women and girls as an utmost priority over this parliament, so we can strive towards a society where women are empowered rather than inhibited.",

My thoughts are will all those affected by this terrible situation, including constituents in Enfield Southgate who have contacted me about their family, friends and loved ones in Afghanistan.\nLike all MPs, my team and I have been supporting many constituents affected by the crisis, including UK nationals & their dependents, interpreters, Chevening scholars and government staff. We will continue to do everything we can to help as the situation develops.\nI will continue to call upon the Government to provide safe and legal asylum routes out of Afghanistan. This is part of our international obligations to all those fleeing persecution and violence around the world. The rights of women and children matter, at home and abroad – and we therefore continue to have a responsibility to the Afghan people.\nI have also been deeply moved by the strength of feeling from our community. My office has received hundreds of e-mails, letters and phone calls about Afghanistan, and it has been wonderful to see local people come forward to support those in need. I would like to thank everyone who has got in touch, donated to aid organisations and charities, delivered clothing and essential items locally, or simply kept the conversation going with friends and family. For those interested in getting involved, I have included a list of aid organisations and charities taking donations and collections for Afghanistan below.\nIf you are based in Enfield Southgate and are personally affected by the crisis or concerned about loved ones, please do get in touch with my team and I at bambos.charalambous.mp@parliament.uk. My team will continue to try to get responses from the Government on what they are going to do to assist you and your families, and we will be in touch as soon as we have an update.\nThe Government has created a portal for offers of housing support for people arriving from Afghanistan. More information on the Afghanistan housing portal can be found here.\nAs you know, the situation is constantly changing, and we must act as soon as possible. For all those affected, I would recommend reading the latest government advice which can be found here.\nBest wishes, Bambos\nAid organisations and charities providing support to Afghan refugees\n- Care4Calais: For donations of clothes, shoes, phones and other basic essentials for refugees.

At a time when people can’t afford to heat their homes, can’t get a GP appointment, and can’t buy basic fruit and veg due to food shortages, the Tories are once again seeking to demonise the most vulnerable to distract from their own failures.\nIt is the latest in a long line of proposals announced by the Conservatives. Last year, it was the Rwanda offshoring plan. That has cost the taxpayer £140 million, every penny of which has been a total waste.\nBefore the Rwanda deal, it was the Nationality and Borders Bill. Since this legislation was introduced, there has been a 60% increase in people waiting for an asylum decision – 160,000 people in total.\nLike the measures before it, this latest Bill will fail too, as it completely fails to address the problems that exist in our asylum system. We need safe and legal routes for people seeking protection, we need to clear the asylum backlog, and we need to strike returns agreements with safe countries. Until then, we will not crack down on the criminal smuggler gangs that profit from putting vulnerable peoples’ lives at risk.\nInstead, we now face a Bill that drives a coach and horses through our world-leading modern slavery legislation and rips up the UK’s commitment to the Refugee Convention.\nI believe our country deserves an asylum system that offers the public confidence that the Government is in control of it; that is fair and consistent; and is based on showing compassion to those who are fleeing for their lives.",

They crashed the economy and are now making working people pay the price.\nWe can’t afford the Tories anymore. Living standards are falling while inflation, food, mortgages, and energy costs are all going up.\nBut this was not inevitable, the Tories have led us here. The previous Chancellor’s mini budget created economic carnage. Because let’s be clear, no one was talking about cuts to public spending two months ago.\nAnd this budget will have real consequences for our community.\nThe Chancellor deployed a raft of stealth taxes taking billions of pounds from ordinary working people, while prioritising bankers’ bonuses and protecting the richest. One of the freezes in the personal allowance will cost the average earner over £600, making it even harder to make ends meet during the cost of living crisis.\nInstead of properly funding local councils, the Government announced it will be ordering councils to raise Council Tax. This will hit the poorest in society the hardest. It also means the Government is passing the buck and expecting local authorities, who have faced significant funding cuts since 2010, to bail them out for September’s disastrous mini budget.\nAfter 12 weeks of Conservative chaos, and 12 years of Conservative failure, it’s clear we need a Labour Government with fairer choices and a long-term plan to tackle the cost of living crisis to get our economy growing again.",
  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_natwest-southgate-branch-closure/content_202.html": "I recently met with NatWest to discuss their decision to close the local branch in Southgate. The branch is set to close on 5 October and I raised concerns about the impact this will have on regular customers, including elderly and vulnerable people in our community who rely on face-to-face banking services.\nAs we know, across the UK, the number of bank and building society branches has decreased by over a third since 2012. Locally, we have seen similar trends, with Nationwide, HSBC, Barclays, and Santander closing local branches in recent years.\nAccording to NatWest, transactions at the Southgate branch have reduced by 61% with only 5 customers now visiting NatWest in Southgate on a regular weekly basis.\nWhile of course the way many of us bank has changed over time, I do think we have an important duty to support those who haven’t yet moved to online banking. We have to maintain an easy-access and free-to-use cash network, as well as face-to-face banking services, as we do not want to see people cut off from full participation in society, unable to access goods and services. I am therefore pleased that the Palmers Green branch of NatWest will remain open to customers.\nOn 14 September, NatWest will be hosting a drop-in session at the Southgate branch. This will provide customers the opportunity to ask questions about the branch closure and receive one on one support based on their individual needs. The local postmaster from the Post Office will also be in attendance.\nYou can find more information about this event below and I would encourage any constituents impacted to attend.",

Citizens Advice have a comprehensive advice hub on support which you can view here.\nSmart Energy GB has worked with fuel poverty charity National Energy Action (NEA) and Energy Action Scotland (EAS) to create a simple guide for anyone who may be worried about their energy bills and falling into debt here.\nEnergy UK has published advice for energy bills this winter here.\nHousing\nEnfield Council is providing support for people facing housing challenges during the cost of living crisis.\nConstituents may be eligible to apply for a Discretionary Housing Payment (DHP) from Enfield Council if you get Housing Benefit or Universal Credit housing costs and think that you need extra help paying your rent. More information can be found here.\nHouseholds may be eligible for a discount, disregard or exemption on Council Tax, which you can apply for here.\nTurn2Us can offer support and advice regarding managing debt and grants that may be available to you.\nNo Recourse to Public Funds\nPeople who are granted leave to enter or remain in the UK for a limited period will usually be subject to a ‘No Recourse to Public Funds’ (NRPF) condition. You can apply to have this condition removed if your circumstances have changed.\nYou can submit an application here.\nFurther advice from the NRPF Network can be found here.\nChildren and young people\nFree School Meals\nCheck if your child qualifies for free school meals here.\nEssentials\nIf you require clothing or equipment for a baby, GrowBaby may be able to assist you. Further details here.\nBreakfast clubs\nCarer’s Breakfast Club for over 50’s and their carer: ageuk.org.uk\nEnfield Council Grants for Breakfast Clubs: https://new.enfield.gov.uk/healthandwellbeing/grants-for-breakfast-clubs\nFood and essentials\nFor those struggling with the cost of food and basic essentials, there are a number of food banks supporting our local community.\nFood banks\nSt Monica’s Church, N13 4DH\nNorth Enfield food bank, EN1 1FS\nSt John the Evangelist, N13 4DA\nThe food bank runs on Fridays between 12-2pm at the front of the church. It is for anyone to come to, no paperwork needed, it is just a case of queuing up. The food bank will be running over the holiday period. Each person gets a bag of groceries including fresh items, a packed lunch and hot meal to take away. If you need toiletries please ask the person on the door.\nSt Andrew’s Southgate, N14 5PP\nThe food bank is open every Saturday 10-12 at the Church, not the hall and anyone can access the food bank.\nCooking Champions community kitchen\nThe Cooking Champions community kitchen is open every Friday at St Matthew’s Church, South Street, Ponders End EN3 4LA.\nAsda’s Winter Warmer programme\nAsda is offering everyone aged 60 and over the chance to enjoy soup, a roll and unlimited tea and coffees for just £1 in its in-store Asda cafes, all day and every day throughout November and December. This initiative will run alongside the current ‘Kids Eat for £1’ offer, which runs until the end of the year.\nBenefits checker\nCheck which benefits you may be eligible for here.\nWarm banks\nFind warm spaces in Enfield here: Find a Warm Welcome Space Today\nWarmer Homes programme\nAround 9,600 households in Enfield could be eligible for the Mayor of London’s Warmer Homes programme, which will make grants of between £5,000 to £25,000 available to low-income households to make homes warmer, greener and cheaper to run.\nFunding is available for low-income households living in low energy efficiency homes and includes grants for measures including:\n– Heat pumps\n– Insulation for walls, lofts and floors\n– Heating system improvements or repairs\n– Draught proofing\n– Solar energy installations\nMore information about the Warmer Homes programme can be found here: https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/housing-and-land/improving-quality/warmer-homes\nBritish Heart Foundation: Cost of living support\nThere is cost of living information and support from the BHF.

These riders are at a higher risk of road danger than the average rider, due to time pressures from employers.\nToday, I met with my constituent Susan Cole from Valproate Victims UK, and many other dedicated campaigners, amid her 20 year fight for justice for valproate victims like her and her daughter.\nIn a debate secured by Sharon Hodgson MP, I called on the Government to offer interim payments and speed up compensation for those harmed by valproate & pelvic mesh, as recommended by the Hughes Report in their steps towards justice.\nWe must deliver for these women and children.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ac5c4e9f-e32e-487b-b69e-ccf8d951e1de.jpeg16001200Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-27 17:56:362025-03-27 17:56:51Meeting with Valproate Victims UK\nToday, I spoke up for our local Enfield and Haringey Councils in the Local Government Finances in London Westminster Hall debate.\nEnfield and Haringey deserve the right funding to provide good services for residents, and both councils have seen severe declines in their funding since 2010.

Auto-enrolment is the right thing to do.\nListen to the highlights of my speech here.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-14-151140.png10701851Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-14 15:34:332025-03-14 15:35:12Free School Meals Auto-Enrolment\nI welcomed the Southgate and Wood Green Women’s Constituency Labour Party to Parliament to have a serious discussion about tackling violence against women and girls in today’s society as we marked International Women’s Day last week. We spoke about the resources local authorities can use to help victims of domestic abuse and the severe impact social media has on cultivating misogynist attitudes among teenage boys and young men. We also discussed the role of the UK Government in supporting women in conflict zones internationally. We took a tour of Parliament where we saw pieces of suffragette history, including the cupboard where Emily Wilding Davison hid in on the night of the 1911 census!\nThis discussion served as a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in creating a safer society for women and girls. Currently there is a worrying level of sexual violence, domestic abuse and harassment experienced by women daily in the UK. By the end of 2023, there were only 2008 convictions for the 67,938 rape offences recorded by the police and data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that almost a quarter of women aged 16-24 experienced sexual harassment last year.\nBeyond these numbers are survivors whose lives have not only been deeply harmed by the abuse they have experienced, but also the failing systems they have turned to for support. It is imperative that the Government views the safety of women and girls as an utmost priority over this parliament, so we can strive towards a society where women are empowered rather than inhibited.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2c325923-b34b-4143-ba96-56d3447a9f26.jpeg15362048Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-13 15:00:372025-03-13 15:01:22Women’s Branch of the CLP in Parliament\nI am deeply concerned about recent attacks on Alawite, Druze, Christian, Kurdish, and other minority communities in Syria.\nToday, I asked the Minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan to condemn these attacks and to outline what support the Government can give to these communities.\nListen to his response here.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-10-182806.png6251314Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-10 18:29:492025-03-10 18:29:50Question to the Minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan\nSunday the 9th of March marked Covid Reflection Day, a time to remember the lives lost during the pandemic. I would like to pay tribute to the sacrifices made by our community and brave frontline workers in Southgate and Wood Green.\nMarking the fifth anniversary of the pandemic, I paid a visit to the Covid Memorial Wall earlier this week, where families honour their loved ones and the 247,458 people who died from coronavirus.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/c4abb6a8-1d64-4514-832f-10e9f15e12c4.jpeg16001200Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-10 14:52:362025-03-10 15:42:35Covid-19 Day of Reflection\nThis week, as part of the Great Daffodil Appeal, I met with nurses and volunteers from Marie Curie, along with their supporter, Larry Lamb, in Parliament.\nIt was important to discuss palliative and end of life care, focusing on how MPs can show support to the sector, as I continue to call for increased funding for hospices.\nIt was great to talk to them, and I am proud to support Marie Curie and the incredible service they give to people at the end of life.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MC-050325-035-scaled.jpg17072560Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-07 12:34:272025-03-07 12:34:27Meeting with Larry Lamb and Marie Curie\nYesterday, I met with Year 9 students and school councillors at Mulberry Academy Woodside.\nWe had a productive Q&A, discussing a variety of topics. I was asked for my advice for young people, what parliament does, and to explain a typical day at work for me.\nIt was wonderful to meet so many young people keen to engage with and learn about politics. I hope to come back soon!\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_8938-2-scaled.jpg15082560Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-07 12:22:192025-03-07 12:22:19Visit to Mulberry Academy Woodside",

But right now, the cost of living crisis is threatening these services.\nHospices like North London Hospice typically rely on charitable donations for around 70-80% of their income. But in the midst of a cost of living crisis, it is becoming increasingly difficult to raise those necessary funds and many hospices are in desperate need of support as they face massive increases in their energy bills.\nReducing energy consumption is not an option for hospices as they need to keep medical machines running and inpatient units warm, to continue caring for the most vulnerable. As a result, North London Hospice expects their energy bill to rise to over £460,000 in 2023/24, even with the support of the Energy Bill Relief Scheme which is due to end in March.\nThis is a crisis for hospices across the UK and I urged the Minister to take action to urgently help the hospice sector with rising energy bills.\nThe Government is acting like the cost of living crisis is over. But people and businesses across the UK are still struggling – and we face a massive spike in energy prices in a matter of weeks.\nI am pleased that Labour is committed to tackling this crisis by introducing a proper windfall tax on oil and gas companies and using this to stop energy bills rising for families across Britain this April.",

  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_spring-budget-response/content_213.html": "My response to the Spring Budget\nAfter 13 years of Tory failure, we needed to see a plan for growth from the government and a plan to tackle the cost of living crisis. Instead, while family incomes and living standards fall to record levels, the Conservatives made it their priority to give a pension tax break to the richest 1%.\nLabour will be voting to reverse this handout. We would grow the economy for the benefit of all, not the richest 1%.\nThe Government should have made the cost of living crisis the priority. Recent polling from 38 Degrees found that 40% of people in our community haven’t been able to afford to turn the heating on, while 26% have missed rent payments in the last six months.\nBut with growth downgraded, our public services on the floor, and people facing the highest tax burden in 70 years, people in Enfield Southgate are paying the price for more than a decade of economic failure under the Conservatives.\nAt the same time, it’s clear that Labour is once again winning the battle of ideas. It’s great that the Government is finally talking about childcare, something which has been central to Labour’s plans for years.\nHowever, we need reform now, not a distant promise for 2025. The real test for these policies will be whether they make high-quality childcare more affordable, more available and deliver the economic growth our country needs. That remains to be seen.\nIn short, people in Enfield Southgate deserve better than yet another Tory budget of sticking plasters. A Labour Government would realise Britain’s huge economic potential by creating good jobs, wealth and sustained growth across every part of the country – making everyone, not just a wealthy few, better off.",

This will drive up jobs and tackle the climate crisis while saving UK households £93 billion over the rest of this decade.\nGB Energy\nA Labour government will create GB Energy, a publicly owned, renewable company that will help generate the clean power we need to make Britain an energy independent superpower.\nThis exciting policy will ensure we have energy security and will create new jobs across the UK.\nHousing and homeownership\nOn housing, we heard a number of announcements that will help people in Enfield Southgate, from a renters’ charter to make renting safe and affordable, to a new, comprehensive mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers onto the ladder – with a target of 70% home ownership and 1.5 million new homeowners.\nFunding the NHS workforce\nThe NHS is on its knees after 12 years of Conservative mismanagement. To fix this, Labour will implement one of the biggest expansions of the NHS workforce in history.\nBy reversing the decision to abolish the top rate of tax, a Labour government would double the number of medical school places and create an additional 10,000 nursing and midwifery placements every year.\nFully-funded breakfast clubs\nIt was also great to hear Bridget Phillipson’s announcement that Labour will introduce breakfast clubs for every primary school child in England.\nThis will ease pressure on parents and will form part of a comprehensive plan for investing in childcare – which has been left behind by the Tories and exposed during the pandemic and now the cost of living crisis",

This question follows a visit from the Minister for Sentencing to Wood Green Crown Court in December, on which I was pleased to join him.\nI was glad to hear that the Government are serious about tackling court delays, whatever the cause.\nI asked the Minister for the Future of Roads, Lillian Greenwood, what steps the Government were taking to protect two-wheeling couriers in the gig economy. These riders are at a higher risk of road danger than the average rider, due to time pressures from employers.\nToday, I met with my constituent Susan Cole from Valproate Victims UK, and many other dedicated campaigners, amid her 20 year fight for justice for valproate victims like her and her daughter.\nIn a debate secured by Sharon Hodgson MP, I called on the Government to offer interim payments and speed up compensation for those harmed by valproate & pelvic mesh, as recommended by the Hughes Report in their steps towards justice.\nWe must deliver for these women and children.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ac5c4e9f-e32e-487b-b69e-ccf8d951e1de.jpeg16001200Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-27 17:56:362025-03-27 17:56:51Meeting with Valproate Victims UK\nToday, I spoke up for our local Enfield and Haringey Councils in the Local Government Finances in London Westminster Hall debate.\nEnfield and Haringey deserve the right funding to provide good services for residents, and both councils have seen severe declines in their funding since 2010.

We spoke about the resources local authorities can use to help victims of domestic abuse and the severe impact social media has on cultivating misogynist attitudes among teenage boys and young men. We also discussed the role of the UK Government in supporting women in conflict zones internationally. We took a tour of Parliament where we saw pieces of suffragette history, including the cupboard where Emily Wilding Davison hid in on the night of the 1911 census!\nThis discussion served as a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in creating a safer society for women and girls. Currently there is a worrying level of sexual violence, domestic abuse and harassment experienced by women daily in the UK. By the end of 2023, there were only 2008 convictions for the 67,938 rape offences recorded by the police and data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that almost a quarter of women aged 16-24 experienced sexual harassment last year.\nBeyond these numbers are survivors whose lives have not only been deeply harmed by the abuse they have experienced, but also the failing systems they have turned to for support. It is imperative that the Government views the safety of women and girls as an utmost priority over this parliament, so we can strive towards a society where women are empowered rather than inhibited.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2c325923-b34b-4143-ba96-56d3447a9f26.jpeg15362048Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-13 15:00:372025-03-13 15:01:22Women’s Branch of the CLP in Parliament\nI am deeply concerned about recent attacks on Alawite, Druze, Christian, Kurdish, and other minority communities in Syria.\nToday, I asked the Minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan to condemn these attacks and to outline what support the Government can give to these communities.\nListen to his response here.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-10-182806.png6251314Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-10 18:29:492025-03-10 18:29:50Question to the Minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan\nSunday the 9th of March marked Covid Reflection Day, a time to remember the lives lost during the pandemic.

But the Conservative Government is missing in action, paralysed by a leadership election with two candidates more interested in pandering to Conservative members than taking concrete steps to help people with the cost of living.\nA household energy bill of over £4,000 would be a social and economic disaster, and we can’t continue making working people pay whatever the big energy companies demand while they make eye-watering profits.\nLabour’s proposals meet the scale of the crisis now, while also investing in sustainable, home-grown energy to bring bills down in the long term.",

  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_downing-street-lockdown-parties/content_555.html": "The Prime Minister is taking the British public for fools.\nAt Prime Minister’s Questions this week, Boris Johnson admitted he attended a party in Downing Street at the height of the first Covid-19 lockdown. He broke the rules. Rules his Government imposed on the country but failed to follow themselves. It is unforgivable and points to a pattern of behaviour under the Conservatives where it is one rule for them and one rule for everyone else.\nFrom the Prime Minister’s closest advisor driving to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight, the then Health Secretary breaking social distancing guidelines at work and since early December, revelations about several lockdown-breaking parties and gatherings in Downing Street have now emerged, with videos of those who attended laughing and joking about covering them up.\nMany constituents have contacted me about this issue, and I share their anger. While people across Enfield Southgate grieved via Zoom, followed the rules and made incredible sacrifices to save lives, the Prime Minister and his staff threw an illegal lockdown party.\nAs this latest scandal emerged, my thoughts again turned to the bereaved families and those who have lost loved ones to this terrible virus.\nI have met with the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice on a number of occasions, most recently in September 2021 where I joined families walking the length of the Covid-19 Memorial Wall in Westminster. The human cost of Covid-19 has been appalling, and while the Prime Minster hosted a ‘BYOB’ party in Downing Street to “make the most of the lovely weather”, 496 people died from Covid-19 in Enfield in 2020.\nIndeed, when people sacrificed so much to follow the rules, the Prime Minister decided he was above them. That is why I support calls for Boris Johnson to resign. The party is over. We cannot have a Prime Minister who treats the British public with contempt, a Prime Minister who partied while people died.\nMore widely, as the NHS faces a difficult winter, it is crucial that everyone follows the rules to protect each other. Our success in tackling Covid-19 ultimately rests on people’s willingness to comply with the rules, which in turn relies on confidence in the people making the rules. While the Government has undermined public trust and distracted from key public health messaging, people in Enfield Southgate continue to show incredible resilience and I have no doubt we will continue to protect each other and stay safe.",

  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-bill-16th-march-2021/content_18.html": "Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill\nI voted against the Government’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. This Bill is one of the biggest to ever come out of the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice. I fear its effects will create more criminals rather than preventing crimes from being committed in the first place. Victims certainly are not at the front and centre of this Bill.\nViolence against women and girls\nRather than using legislation to try and divide the country, the government should seek to unify people against this endemic violence. The government should work with Labour to tackle the crisis of violence against women that is forcing women across the country to live in fear.\nThis Bill does nothing for violence against women and girls. As violence against women and girls increases, convictions fall & services struggle and there is nothing on outlawing harassment.\nThe Right to Protest\nGiving the police more powers over protests threatens to undermine our democracy and may disproportionately affect different communities.\nThe Bill’s intention to impose conditions preventing and limiting the right to public protest is an outrageous attack on our civil liberties and this is clearly intended to target organisations such as the Black Lives Matter movement and Extinction Rebellion following their protests last summer. This Bill would also criminalise the many women who attended the vigil in Clapham Common on Saturday night where the police massively misjudged the sentiment and detained several women by force.\nMany of you have written to me and rightly said that policing should be there to protect our right to protest, not to threaten it.\nGypsies and Travellers\nThe Bill targets the Roma and Gypsy community with the aim of criminalising them. Seeking to criminalise one ethnic group does nothing to promote community cohesion or harmony and there are far better ways to approach the controversial issue of their encampments than by creating more criminals. These powers are also likely to be in conflict with equality and human rights legislation.\nAbuse of retail workers\nAttacks on retail staff have been steadily increasing in recent years and over the past year, many retailers have become the victims of attacks for trying to enforce another set of government regulations; the wearing of face masks.\nNo-one should face physical or verbal abuse just for doing their job. This Bill fails to include any provisions to protect retail workers from abuse which USDAW union has been campaigning for.",

  "https_www_bambos_org_uk_/https_www_bambos_org_uk_meeting-with-local-primary-school-teachers-and-shadow-minister-for-schools-wes-streeting-mp-13th-jan-2021/content_89.html": "Yesterday, I met with local primary school head teachers and Labour’s Shadow Schools Minister, Wes Streeting MP, to discuss the major pressures our school staff, parents and children are under.\nWes and I are immensely grateful to the head teachers for their incredible work and for taking the time to speak to us. They were frank and honest about how the pandemic has affected our school communities. From rapidly shifting government guidance and deep concern about colleagues in hospital, to the digital divide and funding strains, the head teachers’ experiences highlighted how Government failings and chaos have made their jobs so much more difficult. A Teacher Tapp survey shows anxiety levels have rocketed and the head teachers told us they just didn’t feel the Government was on their side.\nThe Christmas holidays should have been a time for teachers, support staff, parents and children to have a much-needed break. Instead, government U-turns with no time to plan for school ‘closures’ were learnt about on twitter and 24hr news channels. Everything appeared reactionary, with no foresight.\nThe head teachers felt the Government were too late to ‘close’ schools. I say ‘close’ because they are very much open and teaching large numbers of keyworker kids – many more than during the March lockdown. The Government’s unclear guidance on bubble sizes, and the lack of space means that schools are unsure if they might have to turn away some of these kids. Accurate risk assessments can only follow from clear Government guidance backed up by scientific evidence – all of this is needed to build confidence for staff and unions.\nWe all know it’s not in children’s best interests to carry on like this, but as one head teacher said, “It was infuriating to hear the Government say schools are safe, when we know how easy the virus is spread in schools and we have teachers who are seriously ill in hospital with Covid-19.”\nStaff are clearly on their knees already. They now hear gossip that schools may not return after half term and their message was clear – give head teachers at least two weeks to plan.\nAs more kids are in school and rightly demanding teachers’ time, this puts pressure on the quality of online learning those very same teachers provide. The digital divide, for disadvantaged kids who don’t access to devices and data, is leaving kids behind. There simply aren’t enough devices for those who need them. Even if there were, some families are not digitally or technologically capable of installing them, or they might not be able to afford the electricity to keep them on.\nMany children in the most vulnerable category are just not turning up to school and teachers are struggling to get through to them and their families.\nSo much more catch-up funding will be needed in the future. So many hours of lost learning, for already disadvantaged children across the country, will cost millions if not billions. All at the same time as inevitable deficits caused by extra cleaning costs and loss of income from rent and wraparound care that schools might usually provide.\nWes Streeting MP said: “Head teachers are doing a brilliant job in very difficult circumstances and unfortunately, their job is being made harder as a result of the chaos in government. I really valued the opportunity to talk directly to heads about the challenges they’re facing, which will directly impact on Labour’s work in Parliament to hold the government to account and demand better for pupils in Enfield and across the country.”\nI have now raised these serious issues with Gavin Williamson, the Secretary of State for Education, and our asks are clear:\n-Get on top of this pandemic to get all children back to school.\n-Gather clear data on staff sickness and absence.\n-Give schools clear and timely guidance.\n-Give schools the funding they need.\n-Give teachers and school staff priority vaccination.\n-Roll-out mass community vaccinations. Quickly.\n-Put in place well organised, mass-testing regimes in partnership with schools.\n-Give confidence back to a stressed and anxious schools workforce.\n-Urgently put together a post-covid plan for schools.\n-Make ending child poverty a priority to close the opportunity gap.\nWithout these, we risk so much. In the Labour opposition, we are worried about the schools’ workforce, and we’re worried about children’s futures. To make sure we get the very best out of every child and that we retain the excellent head teachers, teachers and school staff that are working so hard up and down the country, we need much better from the Government.",

But it has been another challenging year for them. As businesses, they are often neglected by government, and not given the respect their enormous contribution deserves.\nFrom battling with the Covid-19 pandemic to now a cost of living crisis, soaring rents and inflation, and short-termism from the Tory government, small businesses urgently need a proper, long term plan that recognises their value and provides them with real support.\nThat’s why I support measures such as scrapping business rates and creating a fairer system for high street shops, and tackling anti-social behaviour to revitalise our high streets and make our streets safer.\nFrom creating jobs, breathing life into our high streets, and providing the innovation and services we need, it was great to celebrate some of our small businesses and hear about their experiences and challenges, including The Master Locksmith, Panache on the Green, Philanthropy and Our Print Shop.\nStarting with The Master Locksmith on Green Lanes, who provide locksmith services at their shop in Palmers Green but can also travel to your location if you need help at home or by the roadside for emergency car locksmith work. It was great to catch up with their team.\nNext up was Panache on the Green, a lovely local flower shop. From rare and seasonal flowers to arrangements for special occasions, do check them out on Station Road.\nPhilanthropy is a wonderful second-hand shop in Palmers Green. And not only did they provide my Christmas jumper this year, they also do some amazing work giving back to our local community.\nAs a Community Interest Company (CIC), Phil and Esther’s shop employs adults with learning difficulties or people suffering from mental health issues, and they work closely with Enfield Council and Working Well Trust to help people find paid employment. It is amazing to have a local business which does so much good in our community, and I would encourage you to check them out if you haven’t already.\nThey are just on the corner of the Triangle and Green Lanes, at 248 Green Lanes.\nFinally, I popped into Our Print Shop, a great printing shop in Palmers Green.",

A continuation of the austerity of George Osborne, now in its 11th year.\nDuring the budget debate this week, I spoke out against the insulting 1% pay increase for the NHS which, when you factor in inflation at 1.7%, will actually end up as a pay cut. No increase in pay for other public sector workers and a £30bn cut to NHS funding. There was nothing for social care, and nothing for local authorities – some of which are on the brink of collapse. This is the true face of the Chancellor’s Budget in 2021.\nSince 2010, NHS nurses’ salaries have been cut in real terms by £2,379. After the huge sacrifices nurses and NHS staff have made, and the pain and trauma of being on the frontline throughout this pandemic, supporting patients and their families, it is simply not fair or decent.\nThe Government has spent billions on contracts that don’t deliver, on ineffective or undelivered PPE, but are denying our NHS staff the pay rise they need and deserve.\nInstead, they are given a pay cut in real terms.\nIn July, the Secretary of State said, ‘We absolutely want to reward NHS staff for what they have done.’ Is a pay cut really the reward he had in mind?\nMyself and the rest of the Labour Party are calling on the Government to honour the provisions make in the NHS long-term plan and to offer, at the very least, a 2.1% pay rise.",

Damping council funds is wrong – the inner-outer London formula is unfair and must be scrapped.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-26-172159.png7771780Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-26 17:49:592025-03-28 12:21:01Local Government Finances in London Debate\nI had a lovely visit to St Michael at Bowes Primary School yesterday to meet the school council. We had an important discussion on bullying and the impact it has on children.\nIt was great to hear what they like about school and their favourite lessons, and discuss a visit for the council to come to Parliament!\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1954-scaled.jpeg19202560Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-18 16:45:372025-03-18 16:45:38Visit to St Michael at Bowes\nI welcomed the Southgate and Wood Green Women’s Constituency Labour Party to Parliament to have a serious discussion about tackling violence against women and girls in today’s society as we marked International Women’s Day last week. We spoke about the resources local authorities can use to help victims of domestic abuse and the severe impact social media has on cultivating misogynist attitudes among teenage boys and young men. We also discussed the role of the UK Government in supporting women in conflict zones internationally. We took a tour of Parliament where we saw pieces of suffragette history, including the cupboard where Emily Wilding Davison hid in on the night of the 1911 census!\nThis discussion served as a powerful reminder that there is still a long way to go in creating a safer society for women and girls. Currently there is a worrying level of sexual violence, domestic abuse and harassment experienced by women daily in the UK. By the end of 2023, there were only 2008 convictions for the 67,938 rape offences recorded by the police and data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that almost a quarter of women aged 16-24 experienced sexual harassment last year.\nBeyond these numbers are survivors whose lives have not only been deeply harmed by the abuse they have experienced, but also the failing systems they have turned to for support. It is imperative that the Government views the safety of women and girls as an utmost priority over this parliament, so we can strive towards a society where women are empowered rather than inhibited.\nhttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2c325923-b34b-4143-ba96-56d3447a9f26.jpeg15362048Bamboshttps://www.bambos.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BC-Logo.svgBambos2025-03-13 15:00:372025-03-13 15:01:22Women’s Branch of the CLP in Parliament\nSunday the 9th of March marked Covid Reflection Day, a time to remember the lives lost during the pandemic.
