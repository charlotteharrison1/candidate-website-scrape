Chris is married to Margie, they are residents of the beautiful Oxfordshire village of Harwell along with their daughter Megan.\nFamily is the cornerstone of any strong and thriving society. It is within the family unit that values, traditions, and a sense of belonging are instilled in future generations. A strong family foundation fosters resilience, compassion, and responsibility, shaping individuals who contribute positively to their communities.\nEnsuring the safety and well-being of our children is not just a duty but a moral obligation. Safeguarding their future means creating an environment where they can grow, learn, and prosper without fear or hardship. This requires access to quality education, secure housing, and opportunities that allow them to reach their full potential.\nA community is a group of people connected primarily by location. Whilst they may not necessarily share the same values or interests, they support and interact with one another to foster mutual well-being.\nAs a community, we must work together to support families, ensuring they have the resources and protection needed to raise children in a stable and nurturing environment. Investing in our children’s future is investing in the future of our nation, strengthening the foundations upon which our society is built.\nA country is a distinct territorial entity with defined borders, a sovereign government, and a shared national identity, encompassing its people, culture, and institutions.\nThe best way a person can serve their country is by contributing positively to society, upholding its values, engaging in civic duties, supporting their local community, and striving to make it a better place for future generations.\nBritain is a great nation, rich in history, culture, and the arts. Yet, it has been neglected and overrun. Like many of my fellow Reform UK members, I am driven by a deep desire to Make Britain Great Again.\nWith your vote, you can be confident that I will give my all to serve families, communities, and our country.
