  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2019_02_londoners-need-a-four-day-week/content_205.html": "Londoners need a four-day week\nAt the London Assembly two weeks ago, I proposed an amendment to the Mayor’s 2019-20 Budget asking amongst other things, that: “the GLA’s Chief Officer conducts a study looking into the potential benefits for GLA employees and the wider organisation of implementing a 4-day week – without cuts to pay – across the GLA group.”\nThis is why:\nWhat we mean by ‘the working week’ is changing. Ideas around what are reasonable hours and working conditions have been evolving since the demise of the six-day week at the turn of the last century. The six-day week was finally dispatched during the Great Depression when shorter hours were seen as a remedy to underemployment.\nYet in the last 100 years the five-day week has remained the norm, despite technological advances and the transformation in the way we work in the UK, away from manufacturing and towards more service jobs.\nIn the UK, we have the dubious honour of the longest working hours (42 per week) compared with any other country in Europe, conversely amongst the G7 nations we come second last in terms of productivity.\nThe two are connected. Longer working hours are exhausting, with the result that productivity goes down. People are more stressed, sickness rises and mental health slumps.\nThe solution is to decrease the hours we work per week to 35, spread over four days, for the same rate of pay.\nThis will give us more time to do what matters, whether that’s being with family and friends, volunteering in the community, learning new skills, caring for loved ones or simply relaxing. The three-day weekend could make us happier and healthier by helping to ease work-related mental and physical health problems and by enriching our lives.\nA shorter working week would also go some way to lessening the imbalance between those who are overloaded and those who don’t even have jobs, making for a fairer society. The drive to work harder and longer does nothing to improve productivity or creativity. People rarely see the results of breaking their backs like this, as profits are funnelled upwards, and it does very little to enrich their own lives.\nTrades unions are also taking up the campaign for a four-day week and making the point that “Reducing working time is a way [for workers] to share the gains of increased prosperity”. Businesses, too, are getting in on the act, with the latest – and one of the largest – being the Wellcome Trust. This £26bn London-based science research foundation is examining whether to move its 800 head office staff to a four-day week, with the aim of boosting productivity and improving work-life balance.\nAnd, it’s not about maintaining economic growth. Part of the concept of the four-day week is to create a more sustainable economy with a lower impact on the environment. We need to stop being obsessed by never-ending growth and start thinking about a system that supports us as people and works in unison with the planet’s resources.\nWe need to shift from a culture which has us toiling harder and harder for longer and longer, often without reward or satisfaction. And, to recognise that true freedom will only be found when people have more control of their time and how they spend it.\nFeatured image courtesy of James Cridland via Flickr creative commons",

Please list the locations that are and are not being monitored and share TfL’s findings so far.\nWritten response from the Mayor:\nTfL monitors the entire Cycle Superhighway network to ensure it is operating safely and effectively. This includes more than 50 bus stop bypasses across the capital. There have been no reported collisions between pedestrians and cyclists at bus stop bypasses.\nHowever, I do understand concerns raised about them, particularly from vulnerable pedestrians such as older people and blind and partially sighted people.\nAs a result, TfL has established a working group of key stakeholders representing older and disabled people and cyclists, to support a trial of zebra crossings at bus stop bypasses at the following locations:\nBlackfriars Road, Stop U\nBlackfriars Road, Stop SA\nWhitechapel Road, The East London Mosque\nWhitechapel Road, Stop C\nStratford High Street, Stop J\nStratford High Street, Stop M.\nThe trial sites vary in the numbers of cyclists and pedestrians using them and are spread between Cycle Superhighway 6 and Cycle Superhighway 2, including both one-and two-way cycle tracks.\nThese sites will be monitored before and after the zebra crossings are installed, using video surveys, pedestrian and cyclist surveys and accompanied journeys with disabled people. The results will be published by spring next year.",

More and more Londoners are using pay-day loans and high-cost credit providers as a source of financial support.\nAs Chair of the Economy Committee I looked at Londoners’ financial health, investigating whether there is good quality, inclusive financial services that is easy to access, and whether in the current climate there is financial resilience to cope with an increasingly unpredictable economy.\nIn January, I published Short changed: the financial health of Londoners which drew on the experience and insight from a wide range of Londoners including small businesses, academics, professionals working in finance, charities and organisations helping improve people’s financial health.\nGuests invited to the committee spoke about the challenges that many people face and shared with us the programmes and tech solutions they are involved with trying to improve Londoners’ financial health.\nIn addition to other key findings, the investigation found that:\n• 44% of people in the UK, who are in financial difficulty are between the ages of 18 and 34\n• Around a quarter (27%) of 18-30 year-olds in London say they are in debt all the time\n• A third of all users of high-cost loans are 18-34 year-olds\nMore than a quarter of young people are in debt and are exposed to economic uncertainty, financial insecurity and consequentially have poor financial health.\nSo, at the Mayor’s Question Time in May, I urged the Mayor to recognise the important role he could play in bringing together partners to explore new ideas and innovations that would help improve the financial health and well-being of Londoners and in particular young people.\nIn response, the Mayor said that he would host a summit this autumn to support the financial health of young people, and his office would stay in touch with me so I could forward any recommendations of people or organisations that should attend.\nI met with someone from the Mayor’s team and shared a list of organisations and people who specialise in improving financial health of young people, such as MyBNK and Capital Moments.\nSo, if you belong to an organisation that you believe should be invited to in this event then please email me and I will forward your details to the Mayor’s team so your voice can be heard.",

And there are no plans to take that beyond the north and south circular.\nLondoners should be able to trust the air they breathe.

This year we saw the hottest February on record when Kew Gardens hit a high of 21.2°C, and then the hottest Easter since records began. This was on top of the heatwaves we experienced last summer.\nI called on the Mayor and the London Assembly to stand with me and declare a Climate Emergency in December 2018, and I’m very glad they did. Other major world cities have since followed – most recently Auckland in New Zealand.\nBut just declaring a Climate Emergency is not enough on its own – we need to act now and really understand what we’re facing – so, I commissioned a report to look at exactly this, the risks London faces from climate change, and what I learned was very worrying.\nRead the report in full here.\nAfter I started working on this report members of Extinction Rebellion were rallying more and more people to their cause, leading to the headline grabbing occupations of places such as Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge in April of this year. This was fantastic in raising awareness about the risk of climate change, and I visited their protests every day on my way home from City Hall. I met with so many people who didn’t know what else they could do but be there to help increase the level of public alarm about the risks of climate change.\nPeople are right to be concerned, London is an ancient city, and its buildings weren’t designed to keep us cool. My report found that two thirds of London flats could experience overheating by the 2030s, that’s people’s living rooms, bedrooms and kitchens hitting an unbearable 28 degrees.\nOur vital services weren’t built with extreme weather events in mind, meaning that 23 tube stations are at significant risk of flooding, along with 643 schools. London’s businesses (particularly small, local businesses) are the least prepared for droughts and heatwaves and other growing threats such as flooding.\nBut we also found that there are gaps that exist in the evidence, for example we know how many schools are at risk of flooding, but there is a lack of research on the impact that this will have on things like teaching days and pupil attainment. There are also gaps in the research about what kind of impact heatwaves will have on employees’ wellbeing and productivity as a result of working in buildings that weren’t designed for these sorts of conditions. Anyone who commuted through last summer’s heatwave will know how unpleasant that was – these will be normal summers in the next couple of decades.\nThis gap in research was identified in both my report and Mott McDonald’s report from May 2018 that was commissioned by the GLA.\nI asked the Mayor to fill these gaps when I questioned him at Mayor’s Question Time back in May. His response was lacklustre, dismissing the idea that more research is needed, which is nonsense.\nHe needs to commission more research so that we can make up the shortfall in the data that we have, so we can understand better what challenges we are likely to face and how we can best adapt to living in a warming word. I have submitted another question to the Mayor this month asking him to reconsider and do this vital work.\nMy report recommended that the role of the London Climate Change Partnership (LCCP) is enhanced to make sure that it can focus on the task of making London resilient. So, I asked the Mayor to increase their resources, he currently gives them £62,000 a year which funds one staff member, but he didn’t agree. His response was that he is already helping them. But what he is doing is not enough, he could do more, he needs to provide more money so that the Partnership can be more effective.\nIn November 2018 I asked him to commission an assessment of the economic risks of climate change and to include this in the data sets in the final Economic Development Strategy, but once again this was not done.\nWhat we all do in the next decade will determine our future. It’s already a matter of life and death in many countries right now. What they are facing today, we will face tomorrow. The time for action is now. I urge the Mayor to tell the whole truth about climate change and fill the gaps that my report has shown, so we can know and deal with all the risks Londoners face. Climate adaptation is not getting the attention and resources it needs to help prepare London for the huge climate change impacts that we can expect.\nHe must prepare for these huge changes, London needs to be ready.",
  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_londoners-need-a-four-day-week/content_224.html": "Londoners need a four-day week\nAt the London Assembly two weeks ago, I proposed an amendment to the Mayor’s 2019-20 Budget asking amongst other things, that: “the GLA’s Chief Officer conducts a study looking into the potential benefits for GLA employees and the wider organisation of implementing a 4-day week – without cuts to pay – across the GLA group.”\nThis is why:\nWhat we mean by ‘the working week’ is changing. Ideas around what are reasonable hours and working conditions have been evolving since the demise of the six-day week at the turn of the last century. The six-day week was finally dispatched during the Great Depression when shorter hours were seen as a remedy to underemployment.\nYet in the last 100 years the five-day week has remained the norm, despite technological advances and the transformation in the way we work in the UK, away from manufacturing and towards more service jobs.\nIn the UK, we have the dubious honour of the longest working hours (42 per week) compared with any other country in Europe, conversely amongst the G7 nations we come second last in terms of productivity.\nThe two are connected. Longer working hours are exhausting, with the result that productivity goes down. People are more stressed, sickness rises and mental health slumps.\nThe solution is to decrease the hours we work per week to 35, spread over four days, for the same rate of pay.\nThis will give us more time to do what matters, whether that’s being with family and friends, volunteering in the community, learning new skills, caring for loved ones or simply relaxing. The three-day weekend could make us happier and healthier by helping to ease work-related mental and physical health problems and by enriching our lives.\nA shorter working week would also go some way to lessening the imbalance between those who are overloaded and those who don’t even have jobs, making for a fairer society. The drive to work harder and longer does nothing to improve productivity or creativity. People rarely see the results of breaking their backs like this, as profits are funnelled upwards, and it does very little to enrich their own lives.\nTrades unions are also taking up the campaign for a four-day week and making the point that “Reducing working time is a way [for workers] to share the gains of increased prosperity”. Businesses, too, are getting in on the act, with the latest – and one of the largest – being the Wellcome Trust. This £26bn London-based science research foundation is examining whether to move its 800 head office staff to a four-day week, with the aim of boosting productivity and improving work-life balance.\nAnd, it’s not about maintaining economic growth. Part of the concept of the four-day week is to create a more sustainable economy with a lower impact on the environment. We need to stop being obsessed by never-ending growth and start thinking about a system that supports us as people and works in unison with the planet’s resources.\nWe need to shift from a culture which has us toiling harder and harder for longer and longer, often without reward or satisfaction. And, to recognise that true freedom will only be found when people have more control of their time and how they spend it.\nFeatured image courtesy of James Cridland via Flickr creative commons",

He is charged with breaking the Parliament Square bye-laws adopted by Boris Johnson, which require permission to hold a banner in the square. When he applied for permission last week to hold a banner protesting against his arrest for holding a banner, Boris Johnson’s London Assembly refused him that permission.\nThe reason they gave was that even though he was applying for permission to hold one banner, he had not provided proof that he had £5 million worth of public liability insurance, which they were insisting that he have.\nCaroline Russell said “This is a unique opportunity for all the London Mayoral candidates to demonstrate that they support free speech, that they oppose the destruction of the right to democratically protest and oppose the privatisation of the freedom to assemble.”\nShe added “Even if other Mayoral candidates cannot make the placard holding event at 6pm, I ask them to support the call for abolition of the recently adopted London Assembly byelaws that require permission is sought to hold a placard in Parliament Square and that protesters have public liability insurance.”\nShe finished: “ My heart goes out to Ryan for the ordeal he is going through this week. If I was the Mayor, no one would ever suffer like this again, simply for holding a placard in London. Our democracy is too precious for it to be destroyed by Boris Johnson’s legacy.”",

While it was not possible at that time, I was glad to see Jennette propose a motion this month, calling on the Mayor to recognise and formally mark the United Nations International Decade for Peoples of African Descent, running from 2015-2024. The full motion text is at the bottom of this post.\nGreen Group amendment:\n“This Assembly also notes that the UN International Decade for People of African Descent 2015-2024 calls on those that have not yet expressed remorse or presented apologies to find some way to contribute to the restoration of the dignity of victims. This Assembly therefore asks the Mayor to support calls for the establishment of an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth and Reparatory Justice.”\nMy speech proposing the amendment:\n“I am so glad that Assembly Member Arnold has brought this motion – it is something we discussed last summer so I am pleased to hear it today.\nHowever, I am proposing an amendment, not to detract from this motion or water down its aims – but to make it more inclusive of the asks of campaigners – and those are the voices I am bringing to the Assembly today.\nThis motion recognises the UN’s International Decade for peoples of African Descent and asks that the Mayor’s work reflects some of the actions listed in the Decade. It rightly highlights celebrating Black history, improving education – and – anti-discrimination policies.\nWe on the Green Group believe there is a simple to fix omission in this motion and that is the issue of reparatory justice.\nThe UN International Decade for peoples of African Descent also has under the programme of activities for the justice theme the text:\n“Inviting the international community and its members to honour the memory of the victims of these tragedies with a view to closing those dark chapters in history and as a means of reconciliation and healing;\nFurther noting that some have taken the initiative of regretting or expressing remorse or presenting apologies, and calling on all those that have not yet contributed to restoring the dignity of the victims to find appropriate ways to do so and, to this end, appreciating those countries that have done so.”\nIn London we owe so much to Africans and people of African descent – and not just here in this city, but in all our connections and communities all over the world.\nLet me remind everyone listening here today that it was only in 2015 that our Government stopped paying off the debt they took on to “compensate” businesses and people “forced” to stop trading in human lives.\nAnd over the last 200 years the equivalent of £17 billion pounds in today’s money has been paid out.\nThis so-called “compensation” went the wrong way.\nI spoke with the Stop the Maangamizi campaign just yesterday, a group co-led by the extraordinary legal expert Esther Stanford-Xosei and Kofi Mawuli Klu.\nShe told me that the first thing her campaign group is asking for is to be heard. For us to hear about the impact of intergenerational harm, for us to hear about what communities are doing to prevent this harm, and for us to hear about how they are healing from this harm.\nShe asked me to tell you that real reparations mean not just addressing historical enslavement and the money made in human suffering,\nBut real reparations means recognizing the critical future role that communities and individuals who continue to suffer have to play.\nIt is vital that communities from the African diaspora are at the heart of the process of any investigation into reparations. Their voices, their stories, their solutions, should be the driving force.\nBut even working out how to do that starts with establishing a commission to study the impact and legacy of our country’s involvement in slavery and what reparatory justice means.\nThis is why the amendment I have brought to you today calls on the Mayor to support the establishment of an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth & Reparatory Justice.\nI hope you will vote for this amendment.”\nThough the amendment did not pass I was left hopeful by the response of my fellow assembly colleagues, passing Jennette’s motion with applause and Jennette’s generous words as she summed up:\n“There are parliamentarians who should be looking to themselves and asking themselves why aren’t they doing their job, and asking directly to my colleague, Lord Simon Wooley, and I would like to meet up with him and Assembly Member Russell because I think he would be the ideal chair for this all-party parliamentary commission.”\n“I wish you all the very best with your campaign.”\nI am optimistic that we can build on the progress Jennette has made in putting forward her motion, and I look forward to working with her cross party to build support for an All-Party Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry for Truth and Reparatory Justice.\nJennette Arnold AM’s motion is here passed unanimously by the Assembly on February 4, 2021.\nYou can also watch Jennette Arnold AM proposing her motion as well as her closing comments, and my Green Party London Assembly Member colleague Sian Berry on why she seconded the motion.\nMy speech is here:\nThe full text of Jennette’s motion:\n“This Assembly is committed to eradicating and ending racial injustice and anti-Black racism. In our pursuit of these aims, the London Assembly is passing this motion to recognise formally and mark the United Nations International Decade for peoples of African Descent running from 2015-2024.\nThis Assembly recognises the work undertaken by the Mayor of London in promoting diversity and inclusion, and celebrating Black Londoners through Black History Month activities, the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm, and working with the Black Curriculum to provide relevant education resources and to review the London Curriculum.\nThis Assembly calls on the Mayor of London to recognise formally and mark the UN’s Decade by embedding in policies where possible, the UN’s General Assembly resolution on the International Decade for People of African Descent. The Mayor’s work should reflect the following requests from the Programme of Activities for the Implementation of the International Decade for People of African Descent:\n- Work with schools and community organisations to ensure that the educational histories and narratives of Black people are properly taught and celebrated in schools across London all year round;\n- Work on reviewing and reworking policies that continue to have a discriminatory effect on peoples of African descent across London;\n- Consider establishing policy directives to mainstream equality and non-discrimination considerations in all policy-making, including measures to ensure the equal enjoyment of rights and opportunities for people of African descent; and\n- Ensure that the end of the decade is marked in 2024, celebrating progress made in moving towards racial justice.”",

I have a vision of it as not just the world’s greatest city but also the world’s greenest city – a diverse, healthy, fair and prosperous community where everyone, from the wealthiest to the poorest, shares in its success.\nI will promote London as an example to the world of how economic prosperity can go hand in hand with a green revolution that radically improves the quality of:\n* The homes we live in\n* The streets we use\n* The air we breathe\nThese priorities demand serious innovation – but London is the most innovative city in the world. London’s dynamic economy should turn its focus to the challenge of delivering a transformation in housing, cleaner air and safer, greener less traffic dominated streets. London has the chance to be at the forefront of a worldwide revolution in green technology and social innovation, and all Londoners will benefit.\n######The homes we live in\nLondon housing is increasingly unaffordable both to rent or buy. Many homes are poorly insulated and expensive to heat. There is a building boom, but it is providing investment opportunities rather than the affordable homes that Londoners need. We need new models for retaining public assets in public hands, delivering affordable, low carbon homes throughout the city.\n######The streets we use\nOur streets are traffic dominated, with far too many people killed and seriously injured as they go about their daily lives. We need efficient public transport, less lorry danger, fewer cars, less road death and injury, improved health for all and investment in the infrastructure we need to get more people walking and cycling.\n######The air we breathe\nMore than 4000 people are dying each year in London due to our filthy air. Diesel vehicles are contributing disproportionately to the toxic, cancer-causing brew we breathe each day. We need to urgently clean up our air, green our city and safeguard our environment.\nThe Mayor of London has the power to change all these things.

My report highlights the issues I’ve uncovered over diluted and derailed schemes, delayed plans and spending pushed into the future.\nThe Mayor should be spearheading a cycling revolution, not constantly be falling behind on his own pledges.\nMy key findings:\n-\nNo new Cycle Superhighway schemes have broken ground under Sadiq Khan and the Cycling Delivery Plan he said would be out by winter 2017 has been let slip. A Cycling Action Plan is now due by the end of 2018 – well over halfway through his term\n-\nAlthough the Mayor announced six new routes in January he is only planning to complete two before the end of his term\n-\nHe is set to make safer just over half of his chosen 73 dangerous junctions and will take up to five more years even to do that\nThe bold promises he made and his now infamous quote that London would become a byword for cycling simply haven’t happened.\nI’ve been questioning him over when he’s even going to release a London-wide plan for new routes he intends to build, not just finishing off schemes put down by the previous Mayor.\nPlans for the six new routes he announced to great fanfare in January aren’t firmed up – in fact the Deputy Mayor for Transport, Heidi Alexander, said only two would be complete by the end of the Mayor’s term. That’s another 16 km of protected space, but these routes haven’t even been consulted on yet so they’re only at a very early stage.\nWhat do you think of cycling in London?\n“No distinct cycle lanes on my 35 min commute, and the road closest to the pavement where bikes end up is always in poor condition. Pretty bad!” Gwen\nThe Mayor has also slashed funding for local walking and cycling schemes, downgrading Mini-Hollands to Liveable Neighbourhoods and dampening the potential for truly transformative schemes.\nHe has expanded the definition of what a Mini-Holland is and now says there are 106 schemes on-going, but the schemes listed are just fragments of what should be a borough-wide overhaul of walking and cycling facility. The Waltham Forest Mini-Holland is an extraordinary scheme that has had a hugely positive impact – children born in 2013 at the beginning of the scheme will each live on average for an extra six weeks, according to researchers from Kings College London. And the scheme isn’t even finished yet.\nWe need this all over London, and especially in outer boroughs where safe walking and cycling routes don’t yet exist and car use is high. We need it now, not promised to spend money pushed into the future, the Mayor may not be in office after 2020.\nWhile the Mayor does have ambitious targets in his Transport Strategy to have 80 per cent of all journeys in London taken by walking, cycling and public transport, he’s aiming for this to be reached by 2041, well after his time in office. These targets will never be met if he doesn’t do his part and build new, safe routes to enable more people to walk and cycle.\nMy recommendations for the Mayor to meet his pledges include:\n-\nFinish safety studies for all junctions in his Safer Junctions programme\n-\nPublish plans for brand new routes that will make up the mileage to meet his pledge to triple segregated lanes\n-\nMeet his promise to publish his Cycling Action Plan this year\n-\nBring about political support to match the public support for the shovel-ready schemes\nWhat do you think of cycling in London?\nI used to cycle but bike been in shed for years now because as a parent I feel too vulnerable, like it’s not worth the risk for my kids… We don’t own a car and I would love to be able to get around as a family on bikes.” Natasha",

This galvanised Caroline into taking action on the dangers of traffic close to people. From campaigning with Living Streets and Twenty’s Plenty, Caroline became involved with the Green Party and is now their national spokesperson on transport policy.\nShe said that we face a ‘perfect storm’ at the moment:\n- the climate emergency – we have 11 years to act;\n- a crisis of physical inactivity – a public health crisis, particularly for children;\n- air pollution – children’s lungs are not growing as they should, so their long-term health is affected; older people are suffering from lung and heart health conditions exacerbated by air pollution, everywhere, not just in London and big cities.\nTwo other factors making things worse are the lack of public transport and the hostile street environment for walking and cycling.\nTechnology also contributes – online shopping means more delivery vans circling, satnav apps directing drivers into residential streets, and Uber undermining public transport.\nHowever, in the face of this crisis, there has been an explosion of campaigning.\nCaroline highlighted recent developments in London that suggest that the tide is turning. The Mayor’s new transport strategy includes, for the first time, a target for 80% of journeys to be by walking, cycling and public transport by 2041 (should be sooner, we have 11 years…). Achieving this will involve bringing down car ownership to free-up space for safe cycle routes and safe road crossings. She challenges the way we have come to accept that privately owned cars can be parked on public roads, and that most cars are unused for 95% of the time.\nShared ownership and car clubs will be components in the shift away from privately owned cars, giving access to cars only when they are needed. Towns and cities must get to grips with this shift and in changing streets so they become primarily places for healthy, happy people getting around under their own steam, rather than travelling by car.\nShe then outlined the Healthy Streets concept developed by public health specialist Lucy Saunders. The basis of this is a matrix of 10 measures of how people feel about streets – ‘People feel safe’, ‘Easy to cross’, ‘Clean air’, and so on. Lucy Saunders has developed this into a spreadsheet tool for Transport for London engineers who must ensure that proposed changes to roads and footways do not adversely affect any of these measures. This is changing the approach taken so that people come first, not cars. Dedicated cycle tracks mean that people of all ages can relax and feel safe while using them.\nThe most visible evidence of this new approach is in the ‘cycle superhighways’ in central London, but these do not yet create a comprehensive network, and the situation away from the centre is, for the most part, as dreadful as ever. Children walking to school still have to negotiate major, hostile roads, and even crossing side roads may not be possible at junctions with main roads because they are often wide, and designed to enable vehicles to turn into the side roads at speed. She gave an example of an audit of a child’s walk to school along a main road in Brentford – the assessors had to walk 100m up the side roads before they could safely cross over, then walk 100m back to continue their journey.\nShe cited the mini-Holland project in Waltham Forest as a wonderful demonstration of a new, successful approach. Networks of residential roads bounded by major roads have bollards installed to stop rat-running, but cars can still drive to every house. Junctions where side roads join main roads are narrowed with raised continuous pavements, giving priority to people on foot, so cars have to slow down. These ‘Copenhagen’ crossings mean that traffic turning off the main roads slows right down, so these become more civilised places for people on foot and cycling. Bus stop ‘bypasses’ enable cycle routes to be built up into continuous networks.\nExtensive evidence from around the world shows that this approach is good for local businesses (often contrary to the concerns and expectations of the businesses beforehand), as people come regularly to places where they feel comfortable and safe.\nShe concluded her inspiring talk with an outline of the London mayor’s Vision Zero, and gave the example of railways, which are designed to ‘fail safe’, ie if things go wrong the process leads to a safe shut-down . The same approach must be applied to our streets.\nBefore inviting questions and discussion, John Metcalf said that Hertfordshire Local Transport Plan 4 is excellent in its aspiration, but has no targets for delivery. However, he hoped that St Albans would take forward the new idea of becoming one of the county’s sustainable travel towns.\nCaroline then responded fully to a wide range of questions from the audience.\nE-assist cargo bikes can provide an alternative to vans for local deliveries. Sainsbury’s are using them in London, and they are commonly used in Holland by tradespeople.\nChange can come about through pressure from communities who develop an inclusive vision involving politicians and everyone who will be affected, as exemplified in Waltham Forest. The approach should not be ‘We want better cycling facilities’ but ‘We want a better place to live’.\nKeeping engines running while stationary is an anti-social habit, and people in queuing cars often sit in a ‘tunnel’ of polluted air. Turning off engines while stationary shouldn’t need enforcing, but pressure should be put on local authorities to run anti-idling campaigns so that it becomes socially unacceptable, like drink-driving in the 1970s. We have such a campaign underway in St Albans and we can all be inspired to support it.\nFiscal measures and road user charging are being widely discussed – London’s ultra-low emission zone will be extended to the North Circular in 2021. Caroline favours a smart road user charging approach, involving micropayments related to distance travelled and the emissions from your individual vehicle, which would encourage people to drive less, car share and use public transport.\nIn Islington, controlled parking zones are helping to keep cars out of residential streets, but looking 10 or more years ahead, significantly reduced car ownership is inevitable. Electric cars have some positive effects but in the climate emergency simply replacing petrol and diesel cars by electric vehicles is not enough. Recognition of air quality as a major public health issue is growing, and ‘citizen science’ projects such as monitoring NO2 levels with diffusion tubes can help, though they cannot be used to measure the equally significant particulate pollution (PM2.5). Community involvement through churches, mosques, schools, hospitals, surgeries etc can make such approaches more effective, and raise awareness that all cars pollute.\nCaroline emphasized that flexible, reliable, affordable public transport options are vital. We cannot depend on each citizen investing in their own solutions – a common approach is essential. She acknowledged that buses do not at present offer enough flexibility, especially in less populated areas, and that more investment is needed if people are to accept them as acceptable alternatives to private cars. Other approaches, such as car clubs and e-bikes, also have significant parts to play.\nOne negative impact of electric cars is the provision of charging points on the footway, for private companies to sell electricity to fuel cars. This is another example of the assumed importance of cars, as is parking on pavements, which is sometimes justified as ‘being considerate’, even though this is only true for other drivers, not for people walking or in wheelchairs. If we want children to be able to walk and cycle to school then we must make our streets safer.\nJohn Metcalfe thanked Caroline on behalf of all those present for her informative and inspiring talk.\nNick Clarke\n31 May 2019",

OHG first issued notice to quit five years ago and have recently begun eviction proceedings.\nThis is a sadly familiar story in a city where land values are escalating and rents are too high. The residents of [Islington Park Street](http://islingtonparkstreet.org) are the most recent example of a London-wide story of unfair evictions, fuelled by the rocketing ‘value’ of property. The 18-strong community is bemused at the way the home they have shared for 39 years has fallen into the hands of a Housing Association that claims “we’re a ‘not-for-profit’ that loves to make a profit.” And talks about offering a range of support services to their “customers” including “those who find themselves homeless”. Islington Park St residents are preparing and daring to fight back for their home.\nOn my first visit, it immediately became clear that this was a very special place. My bike was ushered in to a bicycle storeroom that also functions as a dry food store. All over the house there are signs of collective organisation in the form of functional racks and notice boards to enable efficient living.\nA big pot of soup and a huge bowl of salad seemed to feed an endless stream of people who came in and out of the kitchen and joined the urgent conversation about how to resist eviction by One Housing Group.\nThe house is run on cooperative principles. There is no hierarchy, residents take it in turns to chair meetings and decisions are made as a group. Some residents have lived there for more than thirty years. Their allocations policy ensures that they are helping low income individuals to find a home, requiring that applicants earn no more than £23,000 and own no property. There’s a mixture of ages from 19 to 79 and residents describe it warmly as like living in an extended family supporting each other through a range of health and other issues including: depression, learning needs, cancer recovery, Parkinson’s disease and escape from domestic violence.\nEighteen people with just four fridges, a few cookers and a huge kitchen table are living together, sharing utility and food bills, providing support to those who need it and showing that a different model for living in a city is possible. This is seriously low impact living. They asked us to guess what they spent on food and utility bills each week. We guessed £50 thinking it was probably more, but it was just under £35 per head. Shopping and cooking in bulk delivers huge savings as does sharing facilities like cookers and fridges.\nThe newly arrived eviction notices were the main topic of conversation. They arrived out of the blue, about five years after a previous notice to quit. The only offer of engagement by OHG is around the “decanting process”, which understandably residents are loathe to engage in. They want a discussion between tenants and landlord to find a resolution that enables them to remain. Perhaps unsurprisingly it is not the first time that [One Housing Group has been scrutinised](http://www.camdennewjournal.com/news/2013/jun/one-housing-support-workers%E2%80%99-pay-cut-protest) for its reluctance to engage with those who bear the human cost of their business decisions.\nI found myself wondering about the people who had made the decision to evict and on what basis they made the decision. In a city becoming ever more divided – where communities are forcibly evicted if they cannot pay unaffordable rents – the mixed-need, low-income example of Islington Park Street could be a jewel in the crown of a housing association’s portfolio.\nIf the Board members of OHG would only come and meet the residents and see the kindness and inclusion in their collective decision-making and actions to care for those that need help, they would perhaps be inspired and see the need to arrive at a different solution.\nIn the context of an ageing population, rising bills for social care and squeezed public sector budgets, surely we should be exploring models for housing such as this? We must persuade the directors at One Housing Group to engage with these residents and negotiate a way forward.\nClearly this community has accrued wisdom about this mutually-supporting, communal model of living. As our city becomes increasingly unaffordable it makes sense to think about living in different ways. Celebrating and developing this model, pioneered so successfully for 39 years in Islington Park St, seems a great place to start.\nYou can help the residents of Islington Park Street and Crescent Road, their sister community in Kingston, by signing and sharing their [petition](https://www.change.org/p/save-our-2-communities)\nPost updated 6.55pm 6th June to correct minor details e.g. quantity of fridges.",

In these boroughs, over 30% of jobs are low paid.\nThe five boroughs (Tower Hamlets, Islington, Southwark, Camden, and Westminster) with the lowest proportion of jobs paid below the London Living Wage, are all in Inner London. None were over 15%.\nMany boroughs have experienced relatively large changes in the number of low-paid jobs compared with 2013-14. For example, mostly Outer London boroughs such as Sutton, Merton, Havering, Redbridge, Barking & Dagenham and Barnet all saw increases of five percentage points or more.\nOf the five boroughs (Waltham Forest, Enfield, Barking and Dagenham, Brent and Newham) with the highest proportion of low-paid residents, four are in Outer London, with three in the Outer East & Northeast. The borough with the highest proportion of low-paid residents is Newham (34%), in Inner London.",

At Mayor’s Question Time, the Mayor confirmed:\n1) “Energy for Londoners’ will provide Londoners with “better more competitive choice of energy suppliers” and “fairer tariffs for all its customers”\n2) The Mayor’s officers are working closely with the council-run municipal energy companies Robin Hood Energy (Nottingham), Bristol Energy and Our Power in Scotland, to establish the most appropriate structure for “Energy for Londoners”. Its overriding objectives will be to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate fuel poverty.\n3) The Mayor will consider the Green Party Group’s feasibility report on establishing a fully licensed energy supply company that offers all Londoners competitive, low carbon energy and alternative to the Big 6.\nThe revenue generated from sales of energy would be reinvested into solar panels and renewable energy investment, and energy efficiency measures to tackle fuel poverty.\nCaroline Russell says: I’m delighted that the Mayor is setting up a not for profit energy company. It could make a real difference to Londoners, providing residents, schools, hospitals and businesses with affordable, low carbon energy. It also provides a massive opportunity to reinvest profits from the sales revenues in generating more renewable energy and addressing fuel poverty with energy efficiency measures.\n“However, a genuine Energy for Londoners must involve the community energy sector in the governance and set up of the company. The Mayor must ensure the board reflects London’s diversity and include voices from small and community owned energy companies.”",

The Mayor promised not only that London would be a ‘byword for cycling’ but he also committed to Sign for Cycling, specific pledges brought to him by the London Cycling Campaign, including:\n- More space for cycling on main roads and at junctions\nOur next Mayor must triple the number of miles of protected cycle lanes on London’s roads, to help people of all ages and abilities access the road network by bike. - A ‘Mini-Holland’ for every London borough\n- An end to lorry danger\nThis must include upgrading the Safer Lorry Scheme and using planning powers over major construction projects so that only the safest lorries, with ‘Direct Vision’ cabs and minimal ‘blind spots’, are allowed onto London’s streets.\nTo meet his promise of tripling the extent of protected cycle lanes the Mayor would have only had to keep delivering lanes at the speed they were being put in just before he was elected.\nI asked him exactly what he had achieved but received a 313-word essay that didn’t contain the two numbers I had asked for.\nSo I brought it up again at Mayor’s Question Time where I could interrogate him face-to-face.\nHe finally admitted he’d only built 10 km of properly protected (that’s segregated) bike lanes since his election. That’s less than half a kilometre a month. We can’t encourage people to walk and use bikes unless the infrastructure is there for them to do so safely and conveniently.\nLCC published a map that shows in the 24 months since the Mayor took office, a few schemes begun under the previous Mayor have been finished but no new TfL protected cycle routes have broken ground.\nHow many kilometres of protected cycle lane the Mayor inherited is disputed – although after my questioning the Mayor is now doing a full audit with results due next year.\nAccording to London Cycling Campaign the Mayor needs to build 82.8km more by 2020 to meet his promise of tripling provision. The Mayor’s calculation is more conservative but even by his own count there were 50 km in London in 2016 so after building a paltry 10 km he has 90 km to go to meet his pledge of tripling what he inherited.\nThis isn’t good enough. I’ve been asking questions about when the Mayor is going to get on with Cycle Superhighway 4, Cycle Superhighway 9 and Cycle Superhighway 11 – three large schemes that have seen interminable delays.\nHe told me CS4 would start next year, CS9 would ‘break ground this autumn, with construction planned for 2019’ and there was no clear answer on CS11.\nThe fanfare made back in January about the six new strategic routes he announced seemed to be all fan, no plan, as I’ve now been told I have to wait until the autumn – nearly three years into his term and a year after they were announced – to see a ‘cycling delivery plan’.\nThe recent spate of serious collisions leading to people being killed or very seriously injured shows just how crucial it is that Mayor gets on with building a network of properly protected cycle routes.\nLondon needs more, and better, ways to travel that aren’t polluting and inefficient private cars. Together with healthy streets and an improved public realm to make walking journeys more pleasant, safe and convenient the Mayor has an opportunity to make a huge difference – but that opportunity is slipping through his fingers.\nPingback: Are the wheels coming off the Mayor’s cycle lane programme?",

Nor should we go to back to the way things were, with our centralised system bringing in weary commuters on overcrowded public transport from dormitory suburbs of soulless town centres lined with rent-a-chains, betting shops and charity stores punctuated by empty properties.\nLockdown has shown us that many of our local areas still provide us with most of our essentials, albeit supplemented by online shopping. However, the continued necessity for physical distancing impacts both our ability to travel via public transport and work in busy, central London office blocks. Even if people can get into their place of work, they face queuing for hours to get into lifts that can only carry one person at a time or walking tens of flights of stairs.\nCoronavirus has created an abrupt transformation of our workplaces and practices. Looking forward, there is the likelihood that a significant number of the cafes, barbers, sandwich shops, nail bars and pubs – many of which depend on London’s glass towers being full of hungry, thirsty and time-poor employees – are at risk of closing because of the new coronavirus model of working from home or in physically distanced offices. As I highlighted in my letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak in April, three quarters of businesses surveyed by the Guardians of the Arches and East End Trades Guild will not be able to pay their next quarterly rent.\nLuckily, although not quite ‘shovel ready’, there is a model providing the economic activity and jobs that supports a green recovery which Robert Jenrick, Minister for Housing, Communities and Local Government, has asked mayors and business leaders to provide [paywall]. It’s called the 15-minute neighbourhood.\nIdeally, the money that the Government is providing for the recovery should use the 15-minute neighbourhood as its model to enable Councils to put in the infrastructure needed to make it easier for people to get around on foot and by bike. Too many of London’s villages and local high streets are designed around cars, with the negative consequences of congestion, air pollution, lack of physical activity and the climate crisis. All of these have a massive economic impact, with traffic jams alone costing the UK £7.9 billion a year. And the physical benefits of cleaner air and safer roads are ones that many people want to keep after lockdown, with a survey showing that 54 per cent of Londoners do not want to go back to pre-Covid traffic and pollution levels.\nAlready, the reduction in public transport use enforced by physical distancing is creating a car-led recovery, but we can rein this inhttps://www.politico.eu/article/life-after-covid-europeans-want-to-keep-their-cities-car-free/ by https://www.politico.eu/article/life-after-covid-europeans-want-to-keep-their-cities-car-free/making it safer and more convenient to walk and cycle around our local areas, which will also create opportunities for small businesses. As Transport for London has found, the retail spend per square metre for cycle parking is five times higher than the same area of car parking. With more people working from home, perhaps those firms that supplied the needs of the city-based office staff should be encouraged to set up shop back in the towns and high streets closer to where they live.\nLondon now has the highest rate of home working in the country and far too many people have had to improvise offices in bedrooms or at kitchen tables because their homes aren’t big enough to provide separate workstations. People need access to alternative, affordable places near their homes where they can find the peace, space and facilities they need to work without disturbance from other household members, children and noise, among other things. With the school holidays having begun, and few of the usual summer activities for children available, quiet space for parents and carers to work in are essential.\nAt Mayor’s Question Time on 16th July, I asked Sadiq Khan what measures he is putting in place to support boroughs to provide bookable access to buildings with fast wifi, copying, printing facilities etc. One way of doing this is through ‘Meanwhile Use’, which would allow empty units, usually retail or commercial, to be taken out on short leases. The retail sector has been hit hard by both coronavirus and the move to internet shopping, so many high streets and shopping centres have voids. Landlords must be encouraged to rent these out as ‘pop-up’ serviced offices or workspaces, appropriately physically distanced of course. Other imaginative uses for these units should be considered too, such as for the arts, which has been so hard hit by lockdown.\nThe 15-minute neighbourhood also requires quick and easy access to green space. 21 per cent of households in the capital don’t have gardens, compared to between 7-to-13 per cent elsewhere in the UK. Fields in Trust’s Green Space Index shows that Londoners have the lowest amount of publicly accessible park and green space available to them at just 18.96 sqm per person.\nA quick solution to this lack of green space would be to enable residents to turn individual parking spaces outside their homes into mini parks or ‘parklets’, or for businesses to create them in pedestrianised shopping centres, like these ones in Putney. Planters used to filter streets to reduce rat running and support active travel is another affordable option. The Mayor’s Streetspace programme has invited boroughs to roll out low traffic neighbourhoods using experimental traffic orders and planters. This could transform whole neighbourhoods very quickly.\nCities and towns across the world are already implementing 15-minute neighbourhoods – Paris, Copenhagen, Ottawa and Melbourne being prime examples. Here in London, Islington have announced plans for a third of the borough to be part of a low traffic neighbourhood by the end 2020, and Camden have started work on reinventing its centres to create ways of working that match how residents live using a healthy by design approach.\nIt is the healthy aspect that is so important in how we redesign our neighbourhoods going forwards. Since coronavirus, many of us are experiencing more local, slightly less frantic lives, and the months of lockdown left us with cleaner air and quieter skies. We have woken up to birdsong even in the heart of a city. Maybe we can keep some of that?",

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2021_01_streetspace-needs-improving-not-removing/content_5.html": "Streetspace needs improving not removing\nThe implication of Wednesday’s judgement from a judicial review of the Mayor’s Bishopsgate A10 Streetspace scheme brought by United Trade Action Group (UTAG) and the Licenced Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) is not as simple as it looks. The review reported here by the BBC examined the legality of the way that Transport for London (TfL) made decisions during the first lockdown to introduce the Mayor’s Streetspace plan.\nWhat the review has said clearly is that taxis do have a special status in law, and TfL acted unlawfully by failing to actually make a clear decision that responded to that. In fact in reviewing TfL’s planning and guidance for Streetspace, the judge was frustrated that there were few references – if any – to what place taxis had in the plan.\nThe review importantly and rightly pointed out that decision making must be informed by the Public Sector Equality Duty. TfL was only able to show the court that it had considered the needs of disabled people after making a decision, not before. This is not acceptable, in fact it is disgraceful.\nTo be very clear, and contrary to what is suggested in some news reports, the review did not question whether the Mayor needs to act to reduce traffic and clean up the air.\nThe judgement which focussed principally on taxis, and the needs of disabled people didn’t say that reducing traffic and making more space for walking and cycling was wrong. What it said was that the way that the Mayor and TfL made those changes was not lawful, and that there should be proper engagement with disabled people, including using full Equality Impact Assessments to inform decision making.\nThis is not the first time the Mayor has lost a judicial review on a street safety scheme. In 2019 a judicial review of the Cycle Superhighway 11 (CS11) scheme was won by Westminster Council. That case was lost because Transport for London was again unable to pinpoint a clear decision to proceed with a safety scheme.\nIt is of no benefit to making streets safer if schemes fail because of sloppy decision making processes that can’t stand up to legal challenge. After the CS11 judgement I asked the Mayor if there was a need to review procedures at TfL. His reply was complacent and dismissed my concerns. If TfL and the Mayor had learned from the CS11 judgement they might have had a better process in place by now and avoided this latest challenge.\nThe pandemic has disrupted the daily flows of commuters and tourists who provide taxis with a livelihood. The Mayor has the responsibility to regulate taxis, but not the resources to support them through this. It would be good if he developed clear guidance on the role of taxis in Streetspace and in our city especially while their business is so disrupted by coronavirus.\nThe Streetspace initiative has brilliantly adapted our city at pace to provide more safe space to walk, queue safely outside shops and make more trips by bike. This is a good thing while public transport capacity is reduced as we try to control the virus. It is right to provide alternatives for Londoners, so people are not forced to choose between using a car and congesting the roads and worsening air pollution or filling public transport in a way that feels unsafe.\nStreetspace must be accessible for children, older and disabled people so everyone can get around locally whether on foot, wheelchair, mobility scooter, bike or using a white cane – level pavements and proper tactile paving are crucial even in temporary schemes.\nLast Autumn I discussed Streetspace with Transport for All, Guide Dogs UK and Wheels for Wellbeing. They told me that apart from better engagement, they feel there are both basic improvements that could be picked up like more dropped kerbs, smooth pavements, reliable tactile paving, minimum lane widths to accomodate adapted bikes and more fundamental changes like always extending pavements with level extensions or having tapping rails around tables and chairs on the footway. Simple changes like these are the difference between a scheme being inclusive and not, and they should be planned from the outset.\nNone of this is news to the Mayor. I raised each of these issues with him in October and he claimed he was acting. Disability organisations have been calling for more engagement for years, and despite some moves by the Mayor I remain concerned that disabled people’s involvement in delivering safe inclusive streets is seen by TfL as optional. We need to listen carefully to the voices of disabled people and consider their needs before decisions are made – not after.\nWhen I engaged with Transport for All last year, they had started an in-depth research project, into one of the key programmes within Streetspace, Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs). Areas of lower traffic, using measures to restrict vehicles from using minor or residential roads as through routes are not new in London, and this research has rightly looked at the wide range of impacts on disabled people – both positive and negative. As London moves to reduce traffic, tackle the climate emergency and provide more space to walk and cycle it is vital we all learn from research like this. Their report Pave The Way is published today.\nThe Mayor is seeking to reduce traffic in London with Streetspace, which I fully support, we have to do all we can to enable people to be active in their daily journeys and to clean up the air during this respiratory pandemic and after it. The question is about the way we deliver change, not the end results or even the principle of removing through traffic from residential streets or adding cycling and walking space to main roads.\nIt would be easy to believe from the discussion about the judicial review that taxis or disabled people can only gain if walking and cycling don’t. I don’t accept that. It’s not a one-way street. We need more people walking and cycling, and we do still need the ability to use some vehicles – bus, taxi or other – for those journeys that need it.\nThe Mayor is right to appeal the decision, to check carefully the implications, and there is a need, right now to include disabled people in the move to lower traffic, safer streets and to work with the taxi trade to find their place in a cleaner, greener post pandemic London. Streetspace needs improving, not removing.",
  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2018_08_the-fight-against-heathrow-expansion-aint-over-yet/content_157.html": "The fight against Heathrow expansion isn’t over yet…\nIn a devastating blow for clean air campaigners in the protracted battle over Heathrow, the Government secured the backing of the Commons for their expansion plans. However, the case for a third runway has not been made and I am sceptical that it will ever go ahead. If the Government had genuinely considered the evidence, expansion would have been rejected outright on the grounds of noise, pollution and climate breakdown that is currently showing in extreme heatwaves and terrifying fires.\nAs Chair of the London Assembly Environment Committee, I wrote to all London MPs making it clear that we vehemently oppose the expansion of Heathrow Airport. That is united position of the Committee and indeed the whole of the London Assembly, we re-affirmed our opposition before the Common’s vote.\nSince the vote, the Mayor of London who had provided Hillingdon, Wandsworth, Richmond and Windsor & Maidenhead with technical support, announced he will join them in their legal action against the third runway.\nI asked the Mayor during the July Mayor’s Question Time what else he would do to stop the third runway at Heathrow, you can watch our exchange below.\nAt my urging the Mayor agreed to meet with Plan B – an environmental charity, who are taking the Government to court because the UK’s carbon targets are based on 2 degrees warming and not 1.5 degrees as per the Paris Climate Change agreement – to help inform his joint legal action.\nWhat happened in the Commons?\nThe Government’s prolonged PR exercise to justify expansion at Heathrow vastly overinflated the economic benefits of a third runway and seriously downplayed the environmental and health impacts.\nTwenty-seven London MPs, who should know better and do better for their constituents, backed the Government. Former Mayor of London Boris Johnson, after making a huge fanfare about his opposition, performed an astonishing vote-dodging disappearing act.\nThe economic case just does not stack up. The Airports Commission said it would gain £147 billion in economic benefits, yet the present net value ranges from £3 billion over sixty years to minus £2 billion.\nAccusations that the Government deliberately staged the Heathrow vote three days before the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) report to Parliament was published to keep MPs in the dark are well founded. The CCC report to Parliament revealed “marked failure” on the Government’s climate record with warnings that the UK will fail to meet their fourth (2023-2027) or fifth (2028-2032) carbon budgets.\nThis key report should have been available to MPs to counter the the glib assurances that Chris Grayling made on being able to deliver a third runway within UK climate change obligations. This evidence could have significantly altered the outcome of the vote.\nAround 700,000 people are already affected by noise from Heathrow – this impacts the health (especially because of disturbed sleep from night flights) and education (because of disturbed lessons from day flights held under rumbling flight paths) of people unfortunate to live under flight paths.\nIt’s estimated that the noise from a third runway will affect 300,000 more people. No amount of the promised sound insulation will compensate Londoners for the racket they will be exposed to when outdoors in their streets or gardens. This will be particularly unpleasant during hot summer months when people face the option of stifling nights with their windows shut to block out noise, or opening them for fresh air and being woken up by late night or early morning flights.\nThe Government wants us to believe that somehow by adding 700 extra planes a day with a third runway, they will still be able to meet air pollution limits, despite its own analysis showing exactly the opposite. The additional car journeys from people travelling to Heathrow to take these extra flights will bring gridlock and pollution to already congested roads.\nThis blatant disregard for the health of Londoners is simply unacceptable. The Government has a duty to protect and improve the health of the people it serves, yet this proposal will again do the opposite.\nTransport for London (TfL) estimates that £15 billion more road and rail investment will be needed to accommodate the third runway. But there are no plans on how this will funded. The Mayor should make it absolutely clear to Government that not a penny will be forthcoming from TfL or Londoners.\nClimate change is the greatest threat to our economy and all aspects of our lives and tackling this should be the Government’s priority. I have urged the Mayor to show climate leadership by calling for a suspension of all aviation expansion and calling on his C40 counterparts to join him.",

And Londoners were promised a ‘paradise for cycling’.\nI visited the Olympic Park with Simon Munk from London Cycling Campaign, to check up on its cycling legacy and to see beyond the velodrome, what’s available for people making every day journeys by bike on and through the Park?\nWhat I saw was shockingly bad – I saw a lot of hostile roads and dual carriageways which were hard to cross and unpleasant to cycle on. It seems the Park is being opened up to more cars and vehicle traffic and closed off to everyday journeys by people walking and cycling.\nThe LLDC are in the process of ripping out a pedestrian and cycle route for the new north south highway, and new roads always bring new traffic.\nThis road will become actively hostile as the planned cycle lane will only be advisory – ie a dotted line painted on the road rather than a proper, segregated route. A slap in the face to the people who used to use this space to walk and cycle.\nThe Park is also incoherent by bike, with cycle lanes disappearing at junctions or even in the middle of the road.\nOn Montfichet Road – which runs along to the tube entrance at Stratford Westfield – a bidirectional cycle track has had cycle hire racks built on top of it. Yes, you read that right, cycle hire racks build OVER the cycle lane – rendering it unuseable.\nThis comedy of errors continued as I toured around the Park, Westfield Avenue (near Montfichet Road junction) has a new development with a two-bay carpark. To pass along the public footway you have to stop twice, and wait for a green man, twice, so as not to impede traffic accessing this miniscule carpark.\nThis is not putting pedestrians first – something I found particularly frustrating as it was pouring down during my tour and I timed waiting for the green man – nearly a whole minute of being drenched.\nMike Brown, TfL commissioner, confirmed that people should be top of the food chain when it comes to designing streetscapes so how has this happened?\nLast week I asked Lyn Garner – the new chief exec of the LLDC about these issues – and what could be done about them.\nI specifically asked about:\n-\nThe North-South route for East Wick and Sweetwater – could LLDC look again at the route and cycling provision as there is just an advisory cycle lane at present?\n-\nAre Healthy Streets in the LLDC design standards? Are the LLDC giving guidance to developers in line with Healthy Street objectives – and can they share that guidance with me?\n-\nAn audit of what has been built for aligning with aspirations of Healthy Streets/audit of what’s already been installed and what your aspirations are?\nLyn seemed open to these plans – and as the new CEO of the LLDC is positioned to lead it in a much more cycle-friendly direction, that is in line with the Mayor’s transport strategy. From our exchange it was also clear she is building stronger links with the boroughs.",

From 2005-2020, 2,140 lives were violently cut short in London. That’s 2,140 families living without a loved one, and 2,140 more homicides than there should have been.\n“I believe these deaths should be neither inevitable, nor acceptable, and could have been prevented.\n“Setting a bold target will inspire bold action. If the Mayor and the police have a goal to reduce murders to zero, they will look at all aspects of their work with this focus.\n“Every action, every policy, and every decision would have to contribute to the overall vision of zero murders.\n“There is simply no other acceptable target.”\nCaroline’s report ‘Zero murders: a vision to end homicide in London’, explores who are the victims of homicide, and the work being done to understand these murders both London-wide, and at borough level [2].\nWhen the target of zero murders was raised with Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, she was lost for words and did not agree that zero is the only acceptable target number\nfor homicides in London. [3]\nThe Mayor already has a similar goal: Vision Zero is an ambition to eliminate all death and serious injuries from London’s streets by 2041. [4]\nCaroline is calling for Londoners to respond to the Plan before the consultation closes on 21 January, so their voices are heard by the Mayor and the Metropolitan Police Service.

Reducing air pollution can’t only rely on cleaner vehicles, and boosting active ways of getting around such as walking and cycling helps to promote better health in many other ways too. Helping employers to encourage people to travel at times outside the morning and evening peaks, and to work at home more often, also helps cut congestion on the roads and overcrowding on public transport.\nThese kinds of smart measures were used during the 2012 Olympic Games in London to great effect:\n- 20 per cent more cyclists on major roads and 8-9 per cent more pedestrians crossing the Thames\n- Around 57 per cent of freight operators made adaptations with most reducing their transport activity and re-timing deliveries\n- Nearly two thirds of London travellers altered their usual behaviour during the Olympics by choosing not to make at least one journey they would usually make.\n- Thames Clippers carried 44 per cent more passengers during the Olympics compared to the same period in 2011\nFollowing up on initial meetings with experts, the Mayor has written to Caroline thanking her and pledging to work further on reducing traffic in London – a significant step that will make a big difference if it’s followed up with effective, smart policies.\nCaroline says:\n“Smart travel measures allowed London to successfully host the London Olympics. This helped to take vehicles off the roads and reduced pollution levels. It also inspired Londoners towards more active forms of travel such as walking and cycling. Many worked from home or commuted outside of peak periods.”\n“Londoners want to breathe clean air, know how to change the way they travel and can do it now. The Mayor of London needs to apply the lessons from the Olympics.”",

I marched because I wanted to stand with other women for values that are utterly divorced from those of the new American President.\nIt was a truly exhilarating day, meeting women representing all ages and so many organisations, united in our stand for equality, dignity and justice as well as peace, cooperation and hope.\nI was at the front of the march carrying the banner and inventing chaotic chants with Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, Bonnie Greer and Sajeela Kershi. It was wild, joyous and utterly exuberant and at the same time deadly serious as we protested the inauguration of a dangerous, sexist, racist misogynist as President of the USA.\nI was proud to represent the Green Party and to speak in a packed Trafalgar Square, while my daughter was still making her way from Grosvenor Square at the back of the march.\nMy Speech for the Women’s March:\n“It is just amazing to see so many diverse and incredible organisations and people united in a stand for equality, dignity and justice.\nA hundred thousand people.\nThis feels genuinely unprecedented and historic.\nWe now live in a world, where a man who has repeatedly demeaned women and people with disabilities and who has gloated about sexual assault holds the most powerful position in the world.\nThat’s a truly frightening prospect\nWhat does it mean for the campaign to end violence against women and girls to have a misogynist president in the White House?\nWe know that one in four women here in the UK have been victims of domestic violence.\nThat every week two women are murdered by someone they are in a relationship with – or used to be.\nIt’s heartbreaking and it has to stop.\nSo in the face of Trump’s presidency, what can we do?\nThe answer is here today\nWe can, and we must, come together to stand up to the forces which seek to divide us.\nWe must renew our strength to push for a society in which all people are treated as equals – whatever their gender, race, faith or sexuality.\nEvery young girl deserves to grow up in a world where women feel safe, valued and respected.\nA world where they know violence against them is not acceptable and that it will not be tolerated.\nThat’s why on behalf of the Green Party of England and Wales I’m proud to stand here today in solidarity not just with all of you but also with the hundreds and thousands of others across the world who are making today a truly global protest.”",

The Green Party is selecting an ordered list of candidates to represent the party in the proportional part of the Assembly election in 2020. The list order matters. The two people at the very top of the list are likely to be elected and if we run an incredible campaign we might get a third seat.\nMy speeches below were made in the hope that London Greens will re-select me (and Sian) at the top of the Green Party list so I can continue my work in City Hall and contribute my work and experience as an Assembly Member to London Green Party’s election campaign.\nPlease don’t assume that Sian and I will be safely at the top of the Green Party list.

Now, I believe the congestion charge should apply to private hire, but should be paid by the operators and not by some of the most exploited workers in our city.\nBuilding on my background as a transport campaigner, I’ve focussed on traffic reduction, cleaning up our air and improving conditions for walking and cycling. I’ve concentrated on outer London as that is where we need so much more investment in our streets, so people have safe and healthy alternatives to driving and so they can trust the air they breathe.\nNo Londoner should be left out of the Ultra Low Emission Zone.\nI’m currently Chair of the Environment Committee, and last week it looked like I’d have to submit a minority report, as Chair, opposing aviation expansion in London.\nAfter a week of hard negotiation, against all the odds, Ukip, Tories and Labour are now on board with opposing all aviation expansion in London. That is a win that I’m proud of.\nI hope you can tell just how much this work matters to me.\nIf it matters to you, then I hope you will re-select me and place me at the top of your list when you cast your vote.\nAnd my closing speech\nClimate Change is the biggest issue facing us and tackling it needs to be a mission at the heart of all public policy objectives.\nOne of my proudest moments as an Assembly Member is getting the Mayor to declare a Climate Emergency and to update his plans first to make them 1.5 degrees compatible and just this week, at Mayor’s Question Time, getting him to commit to do the analysis to bring forward his timetable from 2050 to 2030, as Gulnar just called for.\nI was glad to speak this week in support of the Mayor’s call for withdrawal of Article 50 and a People’s Vote.\nI’m on the EU Exit Committee at City Hall and only too aware of the plight of EU citizens, our neighbours and colleagues who are facing Theresa May’s hostile environment and the threat that the shocking treatment of the Windrush generation may be extended to them.\nIt’s not all global or national catastrophe, on a really practical level my grass roots work as an Islington councillor has informed my work on the Assembly.\nResidents across my ward, like the woman Benali mentioned, trusted me to show me they suffer from cold, damp, mouldy homes, with condensation worsened by overcrowding, new plastic windows and fuel poverty.\nBased on that councillor experience and a visit to Thamesmead, I’m shortly publishing a London Assembly report looking at solutions that are affordable and could be rolled out widely.\nI’m so looking forward to working with a campaign team that represents all Londoners and today I am asking you to put me top of the candidate list.\nThe most important thing, for Londoners and London Green Party, is that we select a strong team and run the best campaign London Greens have ever run.\nA vital part of that is supporting local parties across London to develop the campaign infrastructure and skills to ensure we elect more councillors across our city in 2022.\nA larger Green group on the London Assembly will mean a London Assembly that\n- Listens to Londoners\n- Works with Londoners and\n- Stands up for Londoners\nSian and I have proved by the way we work, the impact that a small group of Greens can have on the London Assembly and that’s why I hope you’ll reselect me at the head of our list of candidates representing the Green Party in this election.\nMy closing speech",

Sadiq Khan‘s river crossings review will be a sham if he lets plans for this major crossing reach an advanced stage.\n“New roads bring new traffic and pollution.

This needs the imagination to see beyond car use as the main way to get around.\nWe know diesel and petrol are poisoning our air but switching to electric cars is just not going to make the difference needed to clean up our air and let people trust the air we breathe.

One of the most concerning aspects was the fact that relatively little is yet understood about the health impact of tube dust.\nWorryingly, we heard from the National Union of Rail Maritime and Transport workers (RMT) representative that the health of cleaners working on the tube, who have a high exposure to tube dust, is not monitored. This is because cleaners are not employed directly by Transport for London and so that is something I have called on TfL to commit to.\nOn 11 July the London Assembly environment committee visited the tube during the night while it was being cleaned. People were cleaning every nook and cranny with small brushes. It was incredibly detailed work and it was clear that TfL are concerned to clean up as much dust as possible.\nClearly we need more medical evidence about the effect of underground air pollution on tube workers and passengers, and Transport for London need to act with a greater sense of urgency in trying to understand this issue.\nTfL maintain that they are meeting the standards for air quality set by the Health and Safety Executive, but these standards are considerably lower than those set by the World Health Organisation.\nIt is not acceptable that Londoners remain largely in the dark on the risks to their health of regular exposure to tube dust.\nI will continue to push TfL to take this issue seriously and ensure that Londoners who work and travel on the tube feel confident about the safety of the air they breathe.\nRead my press release for more details.\nRead my letter to the Mayor.",

I will be a submitting a question to the Mayor asking him call on the NLWA to pause and review their incineration plans.\nYou can find the video link to my speech here, just scroll back to the beginning to hear the meeting from the start. This is what I said:\nI’m Caroline Russell, Green Party London Assembly Member and an Islington councillor. I am speaking today in my capacity as London-wide Assembly member to request that the North London Waste Authority board pause and review the incinerator plans so that North London benefits from a more sustainable waste solution.\nI was the only councillor to speak out against this incinerator when it went through Full Council in Islington. As an Assembly Member I have consistently opposed Energy from Waste on the basis incinerators undermine recycling and the circular economy, contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and that London already has more incinerator capacity than it needs.\nI’m going to look at recycling rates, the circular economy and overall waste arisings as I make the case for you to pause and review.\nRecycling Rates\nLondon has the highest incineration rate across the UK, at 59.6 per cent. The Mayor of London’s Environment Strategy makes it clear that London should be a zero-waste city. I quote: “By 2026 no biodegradable or recyclable waste will be sent to landfill, and by 2030 65 per cent of London’s municipal waste will be recycled.”\nNorth London is a long way off meeting this recycling target. In the last five years North London’s recycling rate has actually decreased from 33 per cent to 30 per cent. That’s against recycling targets of 45% by 2015 and 50% by 2020.\nWe’ve seen the negative impact of increased incinerator capacity on recycling rates in the Western Riverside Waste Authority Boroughs (Lambeth, Wandsworth, Hammersmith & Fulham and Kensington & Chelsea) where recycling has fallen each year since the Belvedere Energy from Waste plant in Bexley went into operation in 2012. On average these four councils recycling rates went down by nearly 4 per cent from 2010 to 2016, making three of them in the worst six councils for recycling in England.\nCircular economy\nNot only does increased incineration capacity not support the Mayor’s target for London to be a zero-waste city, it also goes against the proposal (7.4.1.b) in his Environment Strategy that says: “The Mayor will support the development of new waste infrastructure supporting the circular economy outcomes of reuse, repair, and remanufacture.”\nThis is further emphasised in the Mayor’s new London Plan, specifically Policy SI 8(B): “Development Plans should identify how waste will be reduced, in line with the principles of the Circular Economy”.\nEven the NWLA’s Residual Waste Reduction Plan 2020-22 says that its objective is “To reduce local authority collected waste arisings in north London, promote resource efficiency and the circular economy, minimise climate impacts and improve the local environment.” Your own aims literally back the case that you pause and review.\nReducing overall arisings\nIf you go back a step in the waste management process, what we actually need to be doing is help boroughs to reduce their arisings and cut the overall turnover of stuff. The London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB) appointed Arup in 2016 to investigate the effect of applying circular economy initiatives to waste arisings across London. It focused entirely on achieving waste prevention, as opposed to managing waste. It found that even with a moderate take-up, the result would be a 30 per cent fall in overall London waste – the greater part of this by 2035ish, the life of the North London Waste Plan.\nThe decision to increase incineration capacity was based on predictions back in 2009 of an increase in the total generation of waste (arisings) for North London due to increasing population figures. In reality the seven boroughs actual arisings did not rise as expected and have been declining since 2015/16. By 2018/19, the seven boroughs were actually producing about 150,000 tonnes less waste than the NLWA had predicted and therefore about 75,000 tonnes less residual waste than predicted. This calls into question the initial rationale for building more incineration capacity in the region.\nIf extra waste has to be shipped in this will produce additional carbon emissions and road congestion, adding to the air pollution emitted by the facility itself and there will be no incentive for the boroughs to contribute to the circular economy, or to increase the proportion of waste recycled and reduce their overall arisings.\nI’ve focused on the way that the increased incinerator capacity is incompatible with the need to increase recycling rates, boost the circular economy and reduce overall waste arisings. I know others will be looking at this through a climate crisis lens which reinforces the points I’ve raised and the case to pause and review.\nFinally, from the perspective of dealing with the coronavirus crisis and its as yet unquantified impact on our economy, it is only prudent to pause and reassess all the modelling and assumptions that led you to a solution that commits north London to producing increased levels of residual waste to keep this proposed incinerator running.",

Below is my response to Stop Killing Cyclists that sets out answers based on the Green Party manifesto to a wide ranging set of ten questions that affect people who ride bikes in London.\nThe Green Party’s transport policy set out in our manifesto takes account of London’s difficult current circumstances, both the urgency of the climate emergency and one year into the on-going pandemic the dire consequences of Transport for London’s finances being utterly broken by dependence on income from bus and tube fare payers.\nDear Donnachadh and Stop Killing Cyclists campaigners,\nSian has asked me to reply to your election questionnaire. Before answering your specific questions I want to set some overall context based on our Green Party manifesto that will underpin the work of Transport for London (TfL) under a Green Mayor.\nA Green Mayor would set the right targets to achieve zero carbon transport by 2030 and we believe this can be done working within existing mayoral powers.\nWe have a goal to reduce traffic by 40 percent by 2026 and 60 per cent by 2030. We will bring forward the current Mayor’s target for 80% of journeys to be made by walking, cycling and public transport by eleven years from 2041 to 2030.\nWe would replace the current Mayor’s proposed ULEZ scheme that stops short at the north and south circular with a smart, fair, privacy friendly road pricing scheme that would reduce miles driven as well as cleaning up vehicle emissions all across our city. This would be consulted in 2021 and implemented by 2023 and would mean that people driving, not just people paying to catch the bus or a tube are funding TfL.\nThe pandemic has broken TfL’s finances and exposed the lack of resilience in a model with the majority of income coming from fare payers. Our plans to get drivers to pay per mile for using the roads will broaden the base of income and start to return TfL’s budget to pre pandemic levels. Without a TfL government funding deal in place it is very difficult to make specific commitments on funding as we don’t know what level of funding TfL will end up with after the election, but we’ve answered your questions as best we can with the information currently available.\nI hope the answers below are helpful and we look forward if re-elected to continuing the discussion on making London a city fit for walking and cycling. Do please read our manifesto it has lots more detail than I’ve included below.\nBest wishes,\nCaroline\nCaroline Russell AM\nGreen Party London-wide and NE Constituency candidate for the London Assembly\n1. 20% BY 2026\nWill you commit to investing 20% of TfL budget on cycling & walking infrastructure by 2025 (roughly £2 billion per year), as recommended by the UN? This equates to £125/person per year and would raise modal share by about 5% per annum.\nUnder a Green Mayor, all TfL’s work would be focussed on the mission of achieving net zero carbon transport by 2030, reducing traffic, cleaning up the air and increasing trips walked and cycled. In terms of specific walking and cycling schemes we would treble current investment in walking and cycling to £45 per head per year (£400m). Previous Mayors have repeatedly underspent their budgets particularly on cycling and then rushed investment at the end of their term. Instead we would move to a regular, pipeline of consistent, high level investment in our streets that would enable walking and cycling to be an everyday choice for far more journeys in inner and outer London.2. MINI-HOLLANDS FOR ALL\nWill you provide a £50 million Liveable Neighbourhood Fund for each London Borough to fund LTNs for all residential areas & protected cycle-networks where needed?\nOur manifesto commits to increase the rate and pace of delivery in Low Traffic Neighbourhoods and Liveable Neighbourhoods programmes, with a focus on enabling every borough to match the ambition of the successful Waltham Forest mini-Holland scheme. With bidding every quarter and regular development of bids by boroughs, the rate of change throughout London will speed up.3. PHYSICALLY PROTECTED CYCLE-LANES\nWill you commit to having completed the planned protected cycleway network outline in the Cycling Commissioners proposed programme by the end of 2026? Will you proceed with installation of protected cycleways along the TERN network within ULEZ that you already control?\nAssuming TERN is typo for TRLN.\nWorking across the whole of London, not just inside the ULEZ boundary, a Green Mayor will develop a coherent network of safe cycling routes using both temporary measures to roll out protected bike lanes at pace and tackling the difficult hostile junctions that need a full redesign to work safely for people walking and cycling. This will cover both the TLRN and borough roads and we will use the Mayor’s convening powers to ensure routes are coherent and connected.\nMain roads will also get new design standards – our investment plans to improve main roads will make sure they include frequent opportunities to cross the road, side roads with continuous footways across the junction, protection at junctions for cycling and protected bike lanes with accessibility friendly bus stop bypasses.4. LONDON 20 MPH ZONE\nWill you extend the 20mph speed limit out from the congestion zone across London (excluding motorways)? And reduce speed limit within CCzone to 15 mph?\nA Green Mayor will set a 20 mph default speed limit on Transport for London roads everywhere there is a pavement, to protect people where they live, work, shop and walk, requiring a special case to be made for any increase on specific roads. Our call to get the current Mayor to consider this was rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in the London Assembly.\nWe love your suggestion of 15 miles an hour in central London and will work on this, but our policy making process is democratic and we cannot simply commit to this without going through proper party processes.5. IDAHO LAW\nWill you support the introduction of the Idaho law, allowing cyclists to turn left when traffic is free at junctions, with full legal priority for pedestrians, when doing so?\nWe support the turning the corner campaign and advocated that the Mayor take this up with the government as a recommendation of my Hostile Streets report for the Assembly Transport Committee in 2017. A Green mayor will work with the Department for Transport to address gaps in road design rules that would help make safer conditions for walking and cycling.6. CONGESTION CHARGE FOR CAB-USERS\nWill you introduce a £5 congestion charge for all cab-users (other than disabled), along the lines introduced by New York last year, to help fund the Mini-Holland and Cycleway programme and to tackle the single biggest source of congestion in central London?\nUber and other Private Hire vehicles currently pay the congestion charge. Taxi drivers have a separate licencing scheme and any change would need to be negotiated with Taxi representatives.\nGiven the pandemic and the collapse in the cab trade, we feel it would be more constructive to focus on helping taxi drivers to play their part in a green recovery with electric cabs providing a service for Londoners who will be giving up on car ownership.7. PEDICAB PROMOTION\nWill you support the introduction of a fair regulatory regime for pedicabs, promote their use and install pedicab stands across central London, including at train-stations?\nWe support companies like pedal me who have set up a bike taxi and delivery service. We are calling for delivery hubs on high streets and toilets and rest facilities for delivery riders. We would consult and work with bike delivery and taxi firms to establish a fair regulatory regime in London that allows bike powered taxi and delivery services to thrive and operate safely in London.8. LEFT HAND TURN EMERGENCY PROGRAMME\nWill you support an emergency programme of installing safe protected left-hand turns at a minimum at the 500 junctions that were originally promised to be reviewed by Boris Johnson? (NB These were subsequently cut to 33!)\nThe programme of 500 junctions has been dropped by TfL and the current government funding freeze due to the pandemic means TfL is currently doing nothing outside the emergency Streetspace measures. A Green Mayor will be committed to achieving zero road deaths and serious injuries and tackling dangerous junctions is a crucial part of this so it would be a priority as funds become available.9. END THE BOROUGH VETO ON CYCLEWAY INSTALLATIONS\nWill you support and lobby the Department for Transport for the legal powers, to over-rule Borough and Crown Estate Paving Commission vetoes on strategic cycleways across London, but retaining Borough veto on their removal?\nThe Mayor of London already has the power to take borough roads into TfL control, however the current Mayor has been too timid to use the powers he already has. Greens on the Assembly proposed a motion in 2018 calling on the Mayor to take over Oxford St after Westminster Council vetoed the current Mayor’s plans. A Green Mayor would use those powers for example in the case of Kensington High Street. Although it should be noted that the borough blocking safe cycling is conservative controlled and the Mayor may be overruled by the (conservative) government.\nOur manifesto commits that a Green Mayor would lobby the Crown Estate Paving Commission working with campaign groups and NGOs working on active travel, accessibility and health to build the case for traffic removal from Royal Parks.10. CAR-FREE LONDON SQUARES AND STREETS FIT FOR HUMANS\nWill you support a programme of making major squares, shopping streets and whole areas of central London fit for humans, by making them car and cab-free (other than for the disabled) & closing them to through motorised transport, including Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Parliament Square, Bank Junction etc\nOur manifesto commits that a central London zone, some residential areas and key town centres across London, will be set to be permanently free of all private car journeys by 2030, and a programme of car free streets, days and weeks will begin immediately to demonstrate the benefits and the best areas for these zones.",

The London Mayor and Assembly elections are just a week away now and streets and cycling are hot topics.\nSome world-class sections of cycle superhighway have now been built in central London\nBut the majority of the capital is still an overwhelmingly hostile place for people who want to get around on bike or on foot.\nThe Olympic Park could have been designed with people friendly infrastructure that did not assume the default transport was by car. Rather we got huge car parks, roads where it is unclear where you should be on a bike and horrible muddled shared surface pavements that are miserable for people on bikes and on foot. Car-dominated fast flowing noisy polluted roads predominate and the school drop-off was all about cars not walking and cycling. With every passing day there are more Olympic Park stakeholders to negotiate with over any change and the missed opportunity becomes more apparent.\nThere is clearly much work to be done to make London’s streets more inviting. But by electing Greens like Sian Berry and me to the London Assembly on 5th May, you can make sure there is someone standing up for walking and cycling in City Hall over the next four years.\nJenny Jones, pictured on the left above with me at Brent Cross, and her Green colleague Darren Johnson got Transport for London to do the research needed to get London’s cycle superhighways, Mini Hollands and cycle hire projects off the ground. They fought cuts to the cycling budget and argued successfully for more money for cycling.\nAs a longtime walking and cycling advocate, I understand how well-designed, people friendly streets should work for everyone whether they are young, old, blind, sighted or mobility impaired. Londoners deserve inclusive streets that prioritise people over fossil-fuelled vehicles and provide safe convenient space for everyone to get around.\nMore trips made by bike and on foot will benefit all Londoners not just those that currently ride bikes. If London is going to really gain from a cycling revolution then all Londoners need to see how that will benefit them and that means making sure that bike lanes are designed to work for everyone without pitching pedestrians against cyclists.\nSo what would I do for cycling in London if I’m elected to the London Assembly?\n1) Bring cycle campaigners and Transport for London together for better schemes\nLondon’s cycle campaigners have years of experience of riding the capital’s roads. They know what needs to be done to make the roads safer and create a network of routes, but all too often TfL are making the wrong choices.\nAt Camberwell Green junction there is a once-in-a-generation chance to overhaul a vehicle-dominated swathe of south London. TfL and Southwark Council have failed to draw on the expertise of local cycling and walking groups and risk missing all the possible benefits because TfL doesn’t want to reallocate road space claiming it risks causing delay to vehicles.\nLikewise at Elephant and Castle a huge redesign has still got a “highway” passing through designed for 30mph speed, not 20mph as it should be, and with central barriers preventing pedestrians reaching the buses on the other side of the road.\nI am committed to reinstating the road user hierarchy putting the needs of pedestrians and cyclists first and would bring campaigners and local residents into City Hall to meet with TfL’s engineers, suggest improvements to inadequate schemes and make streets that work for all Londoners not just those in motorised vehicles.\n2) Press Transport for London and London boroughs to work with residents and walking and cycling advocates from day one on plans for people-friendly streets\nCommunities must be at the centre of the plans for area-wide schemes such as the Mini Hollands and they must be designed for area improvement not simply as cycling schemes. That way the whole community may understand what is in it for them and engage with getting the design as good as possible for everyone.\nOn recent visits to Walthamstow I’ve heard from residents who love the new public corners being created by filtering side streets and who enjoy hearing birdsong near their homes since rat-running traffic has been removed from their street.\nThe Walthamstow Mini Holland shows the potential for improving main roads across our city with Copenhagen crossings that give pedestrians a continuous right of way across side roads. These crossings emphasise rule 170 of the Highway Code and encourage car drivers to give way to pedestrians.\nCopenhagen crossings work best combined with filtering of side roads to reduce traffic flows and cut out any rat-running journeys. This is increasingly important as sat nav and apps like Waze give every driver passing through an area the knowledge to cut through on side streets.\nIf we are keeping the side roads free of through traffic then the main roads need particular attention to make them less traffic dominated and more pleasant for the many people who live above the shops. This means using lots of design tools: Copenhagen crossings, filtered side roads, protected bike tracks, 20mph speed limits and new pedestrian crossings where people need to cross the road.\nI met some people unhappy about elements of the Mini Holland design. One woman described feeling stranded on a narrow island with her toddlers waiting for the bus between fast flowing motor traffic and speedy bikes.\nWell designed bus stop by-passes make streets better for cycling and are safe and convenient for people on foot there are some great examples on CS6 on Blackfriars Road. However I can see why people with small children and disabled people are wary of some bus stop bypass design implementation.\nThe other issue that came up was the way people had been asked for their views on changes to their local area. Greens would put Mini Holland levels of investment into every borough so that we can sort out London’s congestion, public transport capacity and pollution crises but TfL must get better at explaining the benefits to communities and at making sure local people are fully involved in redesigning their neighbourhoods as people-friendly places.\n3) Push for a bigger cycling budget\nThe capital’s cycling budget is set to fall off a cliff – from £166m in 2016/17 to just £68m in 2020/21. That means there won’t be enough money to pay for the planned superhighways or the fledging quietways.\nThe need for these is acute. I visited Hounslow recently, where the stalled Cycle Superhighway 9 should be providing a safe route to Heathrow and to central London while connecting the town centres in Brentford, Chiswick and Hounslow. We cycled around in the shadow of enormous multi-lane roads where there is patchy provision for cycling which in many places dissolves to leave no obvious place for cyclists to be on the road at all. Side turnings off the main roads providing particular dangers from fast-flowing left-turning vehicles.\nWith a Green Mayor we’ll keep this funding going, and on the Assembly we’ll will fight for a bigger share of London’s transport budget to be allocated to cycling so that projects like CS9 can go ahead. I will make sure TfL properly explains how successful the first superhighways have been so that the benefits of investing in more are plain to see.\n4) Stand up for people who want to cycle in outer London\nOuter London is the key to the capital’s cycling revolution – almost two thirds of all London trips that could be cycled are made by residents of the car-dependent outer boroughs. However, Boris Johnson spent just a fifth of London’s cycling budget in the suburbs.\nConditions for cyclists are dire, as I found when I visited Barnet and Brent cyclists last week. Jenny Jones and I were advised there was almost no point in bringing our bikes as there was almost nowhere safe to cycle!\nWe saw fast-flowing highways with two storey houses perched alongside and with side streets used as rat runs, by those in the know, to avoid hold ups at traffic lights. Getting to the shops on the other side of the road means navigating a major underpass or getting in a car and driving round. Away from the main roads we cycled along a path through a green space with allotments on one side – a breath of fresh air but disrupted by the presence of kissing gates that involved lifting bikes to get past. Luckily none of us had a cargo bike or trailer as it would have been impassable.\nIt’s little surprise so many get in the car as the alternative is noisy, dangerous and polluted. Taking some of that road-space to make decent provision for cycling so that local journeys by bike are a real alternative would be transformatory for the communities divided by roads like the north circular.\nI would press the Mayor to get on with rolling out big-ticket cycling projects connecting every London borough with a convenient network of routes so that cycling isn’t just safe and appealing for those who happen to live or work in inner or central London.\n5) Make sure the wheels don’t fall off the cycling revolution\nThe main impression from my cycling tour has been that Londoners need serious champions for cycling in City Hall. With the two ‘leading’ candidates for Mayor demonstrating no real passion for cycling and even threatening to rip up schemes if they deem them not to be working. The sense of momentum that has started to build behind cycling in London, with decent infrastructure where people on bikes have their place on the road, could be stopped in its tracks very suddenly.\nWe can’t take it for granted that cycling will continue to get easier and safer in London over the next few years. There are plenty of people who don’t yet see an alternative to using road space primarily for motorised vehicles. Greens at City Hall will use our real understanding of the importance of walking and cycling to shape TfL’s decisions about the design of London’s streets.\nThat’s why I hope that as well as voting first choice for Sian Berry as Mayor, that you will vote Green on the orange ballot paper which elects London Assembly members by proportional representation and is the way Londoners have elected Greens like Jenny Jones and Darren Johnson to City Hall over the last sixteen years.",

He is calling for Euro 6 standard to apply to these vehicles from 26 October 2020.\n- Inner London Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) for cars, vans and motorbikes, from central London to inner London up to, but not including, the North and South Circular roads from 25 October 2021.\nWorryingly neither of these next phases will be brought in before the next Mayoral election in 2020. These delayed proposals mean that the Mayor will not be able to deliver on his manifesto promise of providing legal and safe air during his term of office.\nHe risks making the North and South Circulars even more polluted and congested as people try to avoid paying and skirt around the ULEZ. Outer Londoners will still be left out as many of them will still be exposed to dangerously filthy air.\nThe key things I’ll be asking from the Mayor in my consultation response:\n- Make the ULEZ London-wide\n- Apply the ULEZ standards to all vehicles not just lorries, buses and coaches\n- Introduce the ULEZ by 2020 in this term of office.\nYou can tell him too. This doesn’t need to take long. Just say where you live and why this matters to you. Whether you live in inner or outer London on a main road or a quiet side road, it’s crucial the Mayor knows that you care about breathing clean healthy air.\nHow to tell the Mayor what you think:\n- by filling in the online survey\n- or you can also write to respond to his plans at FREEPOST TFL CONSULTATIONS\n- read my full response to his consultation here\nAt the launch of my report, Left Out Londoners, in City Hall last year, the conclusion was clear – whether people live in the centre or the outskirts – dirty air is affecting their daily lives and we need quicker action from the Mayor to tackle this public health crisis.\nEvery Londoner should be able to trust the air they breathe.",

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2020_07_2303-2/content_67.html": "My speech to the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership annual conference\nOn Wednesday 15th July, I gave a speech to the online Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership Annual Conference 2020 – RESET: 2020 Driving the Green Economy. The Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership is a public-private partnership that aims to accelerate a sustainable shift to lower carbon, cleaner vehicles and fuels and create opportunities for UK businesses.\nI was asked to put forward ‘Visionary Prescriptions for Road Transport Decarbonisation’, so I took the opportunity to call for 15-minute neighbourhoods, emissions-based road charging and greener infrastructure, which delegates then vote on. Here is a screenshot of the questions and the results of the polling, with the full text of my speech below:\nWe have been living through a massive and ongoing public health crisis since earlier this year, which has kept us all at home for months, stopped us meeting in person today and drastically changed all our every day activities with the need to keep physically apart to protect our health. This period has catapulted us further into a future, where there is more homeworking, more videoconferencing – but also some things we didn’t expect like more home schooling and a crisis in the distribution of flour.\nThe Climate Emergency. It’s not even waiting down the road, it’s at the door. We have to tackle it right now. We need a government agenda that puts removing the emissions of carbon at the heart of everything we do. Not just announcing pockets of money: a green announcement one day and a bunch of new roads the next. Decarbonisation is an opportunity to address injustice. In the last few months we’ve seen powerful protests across the world by Black Lives Matter prompted by the terrible death of George Floyd, and the inequality exposed by coronavirus. Inequality in society has affected many in this crisis – BAME communities, disabled people and those shielded or in care homes. We must think inclusively, justly and fairly as we decarbonise and rebuild our economy after the massive shock of coronavirus. Climate campaigners have said for years that business as usual is not an option as we fight climate change, now coronavirus has forced our hand. Cities will have to change.\nFares income has collapsed since lockdown. Public transport operators, including Transport for London despite having sizeable reserves, have needed government support. The ongoing need for physical distancing with reduced capacity on public transport and lift capacity limiting access to buildings means the whole model of daily flows of workers into city centres is broken. It also means massively reduced footfall for city centre businesses – I cycled through the City of London last week, it was extraordinarily quiet and most of the sandwich shops, dentists, barbers and hairdressers that depend on the daily influx of office workers were still closed.\nWe have adapted. Although home schooling isn’t that easy when you’re on a call with your office. And working a job from the same room you sleep in isn’t what any of us had planned. We have found ways through and by travelling less many of us are living more local, slightly less frantic lives. The months of lockdown left us with cleaner air and quieter skies – you could wake up to birdsong even in the heart of a city. Maybe we can keep some of that?\nOf course the streets haven’t been empty. Small businesses have adapted and kept trading, serving their local communities – queueing safely, two metres apart – throughout the crisis. And home delivery services have been flourishing. Both conventional vans, and cycle couriers. And in the quietest days of lockdown the streets were filled with people of all ages from babies to grandparents on bikes.\nInterestingly, the government has shown it is possible to react quickly on local transport. They took money already allocated to walking and cycling, suggesting it be used for temporary measures. Many councils have taken this opportunity to create:\n- low traffic neighbourhoods to prevent traffic cutting through,\n- school streets removing traffic outside schools when they open and close\n- pop-up bike lanes on main roads providing missing links in cycle networks, and\n- space for physical distancing on high streets – this started with space for queueing outside shops and is now turning into space outside for seating for cafes and bars.\nIf done well the Streetspace measures in London will support 15-minute neighbourhoods, my main policy proposal. That’s places you can live where all you need for daily life is accessible within a 15-minute walk of your home. And with less traffic dominated streets there’s more space for things like planters and parklets in parking bays – a real boost to biodiversity where people don’t have a garden to unwind. The way we use cities is going to fundamentally change. Rather than seeing flows of people into the centre of London every day, we’re going to see much more life and activity in the more dormitory-like villages pepper-potted through London – places where until recently many people only expected to live and not to work.\nFor 15-minute neighbourhoods to work well, our streets need to be less traffic dominated and more inclusive. It should be easy to get around in a wheelchair or to reach the park on a mobility scooter. And enabling everyone to be more active should be a public health priority. This means rethinking car use. A move away from car ownership, and towards access to a car only for the journeys it is really needed for. And as we decarbonise we shouldn’t assume that every existing internal combustion engine car will be replaced with an EV. Many should be replaced by ebikes along with access to shared car use and public transport.\nWith public transport capacity reduced for the foreseeable future to a fraction of normal capacity, it’s vital our streets work for walking and cycling to avoid a car led recovery, bringing worsened congestion, air pollution and road danger to our city. Which brings me to another key policy to making future transport resilient, low carbon and liveable, which is smart, fair, privacy-friendly road pricing – where people pay a fee related to their distance travelled and emissions produced. It is high time that we move to this modern and sophisticated approach to traffic reduction across London. Business, think-tanks, councils all know this needs to happen.\nAnd, as TfL repairs its finances and builds a new budget it’s important that we review every planned investment. Which brings me to my third linked policy. We should conduct a strict review of all infrastructure investment, with cancellation of any projects that don’t reduce carbon emissions – like the Lower Thames Crossing and Silvertown Tunnel. The problem for emissions is mainly what is on the roads, not how many roads there are. We should be speeding up measures to reduce traffic, change remaining vehicles and to provide routes that enable walking and cycling.\nSo I want to close by bringing some threads back together. This has been a hugely disruptive period, but we can’t go back to where we were in January. We are going to see change to society and to our own lives on a scale many of us haven’t seen before. And that change must improve the quality of everyone’s lives, safeguard the environment and keep us all safer in a challenging world. We’ve sampled some change, lets grasp it properly and make the changes work for us, and the planet.",

I used compelling evidence from young people and academics that this was making London’s knife crime problem worse, not better.\nAs Chair of the Assembly Health Committee last year, I delivered reports on health issues that affect some of the most vulnerable people in our communities – on drug harm reduction, access to everyday healthcare for trans and gender diverse people, and the woeful state of toilet provision in London.\nMy work at City Hall is informed by my local perspective as a councillor in Highbury, where I’ve been elected three times since 2014.\nI’m proud that every committee report I’ve chaired and motion I have brought this term has been agreed unanimously as a result of working to build cross-party consensus.\nBy building effective relationships with the other Group Leaders I ensure that the voice of the Green Party, and our inclusive values, have a real influence on decisions in City Hall.\nPlease vote to place me at the top of the Assembly list so that I can continue working on the Green Assembly team with Londoners, campaigners and Green councillors to make this a fairer, safer and greener city.\nPromoted and produced by Caroline Russell as part of their campaign for election to the post of London Assembly List candidate.

Do you want to know how polluted your air is?\nAlmost 10,000 Londoners die prematurely each year as a result of long term exposure to nitrogen dioxide, mainly from diesel vehicle emissions. Many more Londoners find their existing heart and lung conditions are worsened by this pollution, and by breathing health damaging levels of diesel particulates.\nThe Mayor of London is planning an Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) to reduce the number of polluting vehicles. He is proposing to start it in central London in 2019. In 2020 he proposes to extend the boundaries to the North and South Circular roads for cars, vans and motorbikes, and Londonwide for lorries, coaches and buses.\nCaroline Russell AM is visiting communities around London to talk about how they can measure the polluted air on their streets. She wants to help people find out for themselves how much pollution they are regularly exposed to, particularly communities living on main roads in boroughs that are outside of the North and South Circular.\nCaroline says: “I am looking for individuals and community groups living on the boundaries or outside of the North and South Circulars that are willing to get involved in measuring air pollution on their local polluted streets over the summer. It won’t take long and is easy to do.”\nIf you are interested in taking part, find out more on the London Assembly website.\nYou can also read Caroline’s response to the Mayor’s initial consultation on his air pollution plans.",

The motion and my speech are set out below:\nMY SPEECH\n“The freedom to just be a child without a care in the world, I’m sure we all agree, is a special thing because we remember what it was like to be children ourselves.\nThat freedom from harm at a young age allows us to learn and grow and experience life without limits; limits that we must all eventually face later on when we are more developed and ready to cope with life’s hardships.\nThe childhood years, from being a toddler to a teenager, are the building block years that help set the stage for adult relationships, behaviours, health, and social outcomes.\nSafe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments are essential to children’s health and wellbeing.\nHowever, there are children who, due to circumstances beyond their control, are not given access to a safe and happy childhood.\nAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are sadly too common and have a huge impact on health and social outcomes.\nThey can include childhood abuse, neglect, and parental substance use. As such, they present a clear public health challenge with implications for a child’s entire life.\nThis motion to recognise ACE’s, brought forward by Emma Best, presents a critical opportunity for prevention.\nRecognising and tackling ACEs will prevent a host of negative physical, behavioural, and mental health outcomes that follow.\nAll children, irrespective of their background, deserve the right to a safe childhood and a real chance at a healthy, happy future.\nI’m proud to formally second this motion because I believe it is a step towards helping all children reach their full potential and creating a London in which every child has a chance to thrive.”\nFULL MOTION\n“This Assembly believes that all children, irrespective of their background, deserve the right to a happy and safe childhood and that it is incumbent upon the mayor to ensure that the existing policies of his administration are designed to facilitate such an aim.\nTherefore, this Assembly notes, with concern, the growing evidence based around Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), recognises the correlation between such experiences and issues such as adult incarceration, unemployment, substance addiction or/and homelessness and suggests that a strong and dedicated focus, by the Mayor and his administration, upon addressing the former would go a significant way to preventing the latter. In support of said focus, this Assembly calls on the Mayor to:\nExplore options to pilot a Pioneer Community approach and an Adverse Childhood Experiences HUB within London.\nTo personally meet with a representative of the WAVE Trust who are campaigning for a 70% reduction to the existing levels of children who undergo Multiple Adverse Childhood experiences by 2030.”\nProposed by Emma Best AM / Seconded by Caroline Russell AM",

Whether that is a pensioner popping out for a pint of milk who is at the mercy of infrequent green pedestrian lights, to Sunday leisure cyclists battling against heavy traffic or children on scooters who are bumping over uneven pavements.\nCaroline says:\n“For so many Londoners our city’s streets are just not working, the Mayor has committed to a ‘healthy streets’ approach but if he’s going to deliver a better city for all Londoners we need roads that enable walking and cycling.\n“Travelling on foot and by bike should be convenient for Londoners. It is an efficient, pleasurable and healthy way to get around but years of pro-car policies have made life hard for people who want to walk or cycle.\n“For bikes, pedestrians, prams and wheelchairs we need roads that are easy and enjoyable to use, with crossings that don’t trap people on islands surrounded by dangerous fumes and junctions that protect people on bikes from left-turning traffic.\n“The Mayor must change the culture at TfL to make sure people are the priority when designing streets and allocate sufficient resources to make his healthy streets more than a pipe dream.\n“Waltham Forest’s Mini Holland scheme has been a huge success with much less traffic passing through, and the area is now beautiful and user-friendly. This level of funding should be available for walking and cycling schemes for every borough.”\nRead the report here\nIn her five point plan, Caroline calls on the Mayor to:\n1. Build a sense of common purpose\nThe Mayor must throw his energy into bringing Londoners and the boroughs along with him on this journey towards healthy streets.\n2. Test it for real\n‘Cheap and cheerful’ live trials should be the default approach to consultation on neighbourhood schemes. Live trials are temporary and give people a chance to experience any real positives and negatives without getting bogged down in fears about what ‘might’ happen.\n3. Commit more money and resources\nMayor should commit to invest £1.55 billion in cycling and walking, equivalent to 15 per cent of the total expected investment in capital transport projects.\n4. Abandon ‘computer says no’ thinking\nTfL’s decision-making processes will need to be overhauled if the Mayor is to make London’s streets much better for walking and cycling.\n5. Be smarter with data\nIt must become normal practice for TfL to gather data about how people navigate temporary road closures to learn about how Londoners alter routes and ‘lock in’ traffic reduction.",

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2020_06_grant-shapps-refuses-to-bring-in-lower-national-speed-limits/content_85.html": "Grant Shapps refuses to bring in lower national speed limits\nAcross London we have seen a huge reduction in the number of vehicles on our roads as we stayed at home due to the coronavirus lockdown. Many of us have enjoyed the quiet that’s come with it as well as the welcome fall in toxic air pollution. Worryingly, however, this fall in congestion has given rise to people driving dangerously, thoughtlessly reaching reckless speeds, lured by an empty stretch of tarmac.\nBut, that supposedly deserted road is all too likely to have people walking on it, as they try to keep two metres apart from people queuing for shops, walking, jogging or cycling. Or, maybe there’s someone on a bicycle, just round the bend, travelling to work or taking exercise.\nI recently met (virtually) with Detective Superintendent Andy Cox, lead officer for Vision Zero at the Metropolitan Police, to hear more about this problem. He has been raising the issue on social media, regularly tweeting stats on the outrageous speeds recorded, next to the actual speed limit. In one week alone, there were 1,379 speeding offences in London, compared to 297 the same week in 2019. Police recorded people driving at 80mph on 30mph roads and 36 others driving over 100mph. So, while I welcome the police’s new nationwide campaign – “Slow down and save lives” – reminding motorists to keep within the speed limit, we need to go further and reduce the national default speed limits.\nI wrote to the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps about bringing down the national default speed limit from 60mph to 50mph, and from 30mph to 20mph on urban roads as an emergency coronavirus measure. If all urban roads with street lighting were to automatically have 20mph limits with a change to the default limit, there would be no need to change signage or road markings and it would be cheaper and quicker for councils to make the roads they control safer. Without a national policy, people crossing boroughs in London drive through constantly changing limits. Adding to the inconsistency, not all TfL-managed roads are 20mph, although, it has just made the limit on Park Lane 20mph to accompany its temporary cycle lane. Meanwhile, Wandsworth and Islington Councils have called on TfL to make all roads it controls in their boroughs 20mph to match their own speed limits. An emergency national speed limit would consolidate the patchwork of limits currently existing.\nThe Department of Transport response was extremely disappointing, point blank refusing to cut default speed limits across England to minimise road danger. While the Minister appears to support a 20mph speed limit, he misses the point that setting it as the default decreases the likelihood of collisions and lessens the severity of those that do happen, thereby reducing pressure on NHS acute services. Lessening demand on the NHS is the key ask from the group of medics and healthcare professionals Lower The Baseline, and stopping crashes assists with this.\nThe lockdown response to the coronavirus crisis has hugely reduced the number of journeys people are making, as we live more locally based lives. Since the current restrictions came in, there has been a notable increase in the numbers of people walking and cycling. This is not just people taking daily exercise but also includes a growing number of people travelling by bike or on foot to work in key sectors, including the NHS. With public transport capacity reduced by the need for social distancing, we will have gridlock and polluted air unless people are enabled to walk and cycle safely as we gradually return to work and other activities. It is crucial that speeding is taken seriously by the community and the police, and it is a real shame that Grant Shapps didn’t take up my suggestion to help councils swiftly bring in lower speeds.\nI’ve just seen that Playing Out, the community movement for safer streets for children, have launched a petition to ‘Make Our Streets Safe for Social Distancing’. Do sign if you support the calls for 20mph speed limits for residential roads.",

A city that shares its success with every citizen.\nAll of that is possible – but it needs political will, and a team with Green vision and Green values in City Hall.\nI’m asking for your support to be the Green Party’s candidate for London Mayor because I think I’m the person to lead that team.\nSince May 2014, I’ve been the sole opposition councillor on Islington Council. I’m a transport campaigner and the Green Party’s National Spokesperson on Local Transport. Beyond politics, I’ve been an artist, I’m a trained Civil Engineer and I’ve brought up three children.\nAs Mayor, I will set out a vision of a London where shared economic prosperity goes hand in hand with a Green revolution that radically improves:\n* the homes we live in\n* the streets we use and\n* the air we breathe\nI believe that with a strong organisation and the right values, anything is possible.\nThe 2016 London Assembly Elections are a chance for London to really shine: to lead the way as it has in the past.\nBut leading the way today means more than simply boasting about ever-increasing GDP. There’s so much more to life than that, as the million people who voted for the Green Party in the General Election understand.\nIf London is to be a great city in the future, it must be great in terms of the things that really matter to Londoners. London’s Mayor must be the servant of the people of London, not the representative of special interests.\nIf we decide that we want London to be the greenest city in the world, we can make it so. In twenty years’ time, people could be coming here and asking how we did it.\nPolitics is about possibility. It’s about making things happen. That’s why I’m asking you to help me – Caroline Russell – to become the Green Party’s Mayoral candidate for 2016 and no 1 on the list for the London Assembly.\nImage: © Chris King / [Chris King Photography](http://www.chriskingphotography.com/)\nHi Caroline,\nyou will be one of the Speakers at the Wednesday 15 July 2020\nOnline event , and the conference will focus on how the UK can seize the opportunity for an investment-led green recovery in road transport as we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic.

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2020_05_protecting-bus-workers-from-coronavirus/content_153.html": "Protecting bus workers from coronavirus\nBus drivers in London have been at the forefront of keeping our transport running to make sure key workers can get to their jobs during lockdown. Very sadly, to date 33 London bus workers have died from Covid-19, including 29 drivers. It seems that, as a result of being on the frontline, bus drivers have higher death rates from Covid-19. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that male bus and coach drivers have a rate of 26.4 deaths per 100,000 compared to 19.8 for sales assistants. I welcome the news that Transport for London (TfL) has commissioned a study looking at coronavirus infections and deaths among London’s bus workers.\nSince early April, I have been in regular contact with Deputy Mayor Heidi Alexander asking what action the Mayor and TfL are taking to protect bus workers. From getting the basics supported, such as soap for hand washing, to covering over the holes in the Perspex screens shielding drivers and blocking off the seats nearest them, I have pushed for these steps to be carried out quickly across all bus operators. I was an early supporter of Unions’ calls to move to middle door boarding, which the Mayor was slow to introduce, but did so after successful trials. I also requested Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for bus workers, but current World Health Organisation, Public Health England and Department for Transport advice doesn’t recommend it in non-care settings.\nAt the end of May, as one of the Government’s conditions for funding TfL buses have brought back touch-in payments, which require front-door boarding on most routes. Drivers have been further protected with the hatches where cash used to be taken and gaps around Oyster readers being sealed off. TfL has also now supplied drivers with face masks, although many had been forced to provide their own at the peak of the pandemic. And, while the Mayor has called for passengers to wear face coverings, which protect other people, Government guidance on masks is not clear so only some people are putting them on.\nFor those employees who have contracted Covid-19 or are self-isolating for up to 14 days, I pressed the Mayor to ensure that all bus workers, whichever operator they are employed by, get company sick pay from day one of their absence. This is to ensure that no person feels forced to go to work for financial reasons when they are ill or someone in their home has symptoms.\nFinally, I have raised the issue of the risks of fatigue from changed timetables and fewer rest places open. TfL’s response was to put in ‘staff rest buses’ at stands and open up other facilities where possible. With bus services operating at 85 per cent of normal services and going up to 100 per cent as soon as possible, the Mayor needs to keep a really strong eye on the number of Covid-19 cases among bus drivers and limit their exposure to the virus as much as possible.",

A further £1.6 million has been leveraged through six Creative Enterprise Zones to protect 1,000 jobs and 300 businesses.\nThis is a drop in the ocean for a sector in London that was worth £58 billion before the pandemic and provides over 600,000 jobs, that’s 11.9 per cent of all jobs in London, compared to 4.9 per cent in the rest of the UK.\nI was also told that the Culture Secretary has yet to respond to the Mayor’s letter about the impact of the lack of freedom of movement or a visa waiver for creative workers. Justine Simons pointed out that tours are collapsing with, as an example, the National Theatre not mounting a European tour while both broadcast rights and Intellectual Property rights are unresolved. So we all need to keep raising our voices.\nI have been pushing the Mayor to do all he can to support musicians left out by the freedom of movement restrictions which came into force with the UK’s recent EU exit deal.\nMusicians were already facing severe fallout from the pandemic, with live performances around the world cancelled. The Withdrawal Agreement means musicians will now need working visas for each country they visit. If left unresolved the issue will create a huge extra and unnecessary pressure on their livelihoods and options for work. The Mayor needs to push government to help musicians and creative industries by making performing across Europe as easy as possible once venues start to reopen as the pandemic eases.\nApart from the bureaucratic hurdle created by leaving the EU, there is a financial one: musicians now have to pay social security in each country they visit and perform in. This is on top of the National Insurance they already pay in the UK and Northern Ireland. These new barriers threaten the livelihoods of UK musicians, whose work is part of £2.9billion export industry.\nAt the EU Exit Working Group committee meeting on January 25 I asked the Assistant Director of the Institute for Government, Maddy Thimont-Jack about the impact of the loss of freedom of movement on musicians and whether there was anything the government could do to rectify the situation and if there was anything in particular musicians should be campaigning for.\nMaddy replied that ultimately the issue was that the government didn’t want to include a standard mobility chapter in the Free Trade Agreement like the one the EU has with other countries. Apparently the UK government proposed a bespoke arrangement and neither side was willing to move during the negotiations. Maddy explained there is a way, government could sign a separate agreement covering these sectors, but in the end it clearly comes down to political pressure and the government is clearly under pressure from brilliant campaigning by musicians and creative workers so there is a glimmer of hope.\nLater in the meeting speaking with Deputy Mayor for Fire & Resilience Fiona Twycross, I was assured that she would look into the issue with Justine Simons, Deputy Mayor for Culture and the Creative Industries and Amy Lame, London’s Night Czar.\nSince then, the EU Exit Working Group has written to the Mayor to ask him to advocate for musicians on this, so it was disappointing to hear from Justine Simons just last week that the Mayor has heard nothing from government.\nCurrently the government is showing no desire to use its powers to renegotiate a simple deal with the EU to provide a lifeline to musicians and the cultural economy.\nI will keep speaking up for musicians and other arts and culture workers who have lost their freedom to work across European Union countries and I’ll keep lobbying the Mayor to push government to help them too. This is not just about asking for support for musicians and creative workers but about understanding that their creativity will help us all as the economy starts to recover.",

Social media shouldn’t be plastered with images of terrifying knives – especially from the police.\nPatrick Green CEO, The Ben Kinsella Trust:\nWhile adults will see pictures of knives particularly when they have been taken off the street by the police as a reassuring message that these knives are in custody, children view them differently. It is a success story for the police, hard working police officers doing their job and doing it really well, I want to acknowledge that.\nBut it is how it is presented to young people, they will see ‘Goodness me, near where I live this big knife was found’.

However data from the Mayor’s ULEZ consultation show that even in 2019 all Londoners will be exposed to at least 14 µg/m3 – well above WHO guidelines.\nAfter the first phase of the ULEZ is brought in only one borough – Waltham Forest – will benefit from a reduction in exposure from 15 µg/m3 to 14 µg/m3.\nThere are no known safe levels for theses lethal particles produced by diesel vehicles – they are associated with more people having to be admitted into hospital and premature deaths during pollution spikes.\nThe current ULEZ proposals don’t go far enough as they only covers the congestion charge area, the Mayor’s own data shows the most dangerous particles are untouched by his clean air plans.\nI have been listening to outer Londoners who have told me worrying stories of high levels of childhood asthma and health crises brought on by pollution – they want more action from the Mayor to protect their health.\nThe Mayor needs to make the ULEZ London-wide so all Londoners can trust the air they breathe, invest in alternatives to driving and he must pressure the government for the promised help with a diesel scrappage scheme without delay.",

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2018_12_you-cant-flush-this/content_37.html": "You can’t flush this!\nPublic awareness about the environmental damage caused by single-use plastics, such as disposable water bottles, coffee cups and stirrers may be growing, but what about other every day single use plastic items, like wet wipes, nappies and period products? My first report as Chair of the Environment Committee at City Hall, looked at these single use unflushable plastics in our bathrooms.\nWe found that across the UK, over 11 billion wet wipes, nearly 2.5 billion period products, nearly 4 billion nappies and over a billion incontinence products are purchased every year. The use of these items is increasing – wipes by over a quarter, and incontinence products by nearly half, compared with five years ago.\nSurprisingly, there is no legal requirement for manufacturers to list materials on the packaging of products. Wet wipes contain 50 per cent plastic, period pads 90 per cent plastic and nappies an estimated 50 per cent plastic and similar materials.\nWet wipes, tampons and period pads are often flushed down the toilet. Londoners are not aware that these items contain plastic and, combined with fat and oil, create fatbergs and sewage blockages, which cost Thames Water and ultimately Londoners £12 million a year. Waste authorities collect more than 100,000 tonnes of nappy waste a year, the majority of which is incinerated, adding to London’s carbon emissions and polluting the air. Shockingly any nappy sent to landfill takes around 400 years to disintegrate. Kate Metcalf from the Women’s Environment Network told us that if Henry VIII had been buried in a nappy it would still be intact today.\nWe’ve suggested the Mayor and Thames Water introduce a ‘block buster borough’ initiative, to get councils to pledge that unflushables don’t enter the sewage system and reusables are promoted where possible. We also said that ‘Bin it, don’t block it’ signage could be displayed on the backs of public toilet doors as a reminder.\nDespite increasing public focus on period poverty, awareness of reusable period products that can save their users money, is low. Mandu Reid of the Cup Effect told the Committee, once you’ve purchased a menstrual cup you won’t need to buy another one for another ten years – a challenging consumer business model compared to the absorbent hygiene product manufacturers selling repeated single use items.\nWe recommended the Mayor’s London Healthy Schools initiative should ask schools to show they are period positive, by reducing stigma about periods and talking with children about binning not flushing and the availability of reusable period products as an alternative to single use plastic products.\nWe also asked that health visitors alert new parents to reusable options for managing periods and babies continence, However we fully recognise that while reusable products may work for some people experiencing period or nappy poverty, clearly there will be people without access to convenient washing facilities for whom reusable period products or washable nappies may not be a practical solution.\nWe were also alerted to the lack of bins in men’s toilets and recommended that the Greater London Authority (GLA) Group should provide bins in men’s toilets for incontinence and other single-use unflushables.\nWorking on this report emphasised the scale of the job to get single use plastics out of our rivers, seas and sewer systems. I recently wrote to Environment Minister Michael Gove in response to the Government’s consultation on proposals to ban the distribution and sale of plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds. I said that while the Assembly Environment Committee broadly agrees with the ban, we urge the Government to address labelling of unflushable period pads and wetwipes and go much further with a ban on unflushable single-use wet wipes which contain plastic.",

I want to see space reclaimed from traffic like this throughout London, with strong support from the Mayor.\nI’ve picked out the highlights from the agenda and linked to the key presentations and resources. Prof. Peter Kraftl and Dr. Sophie Hadfield-Hill presented their work on sustainable mobility for young people. They have studied in detail how young people navigate and explore new communities. Independent mobility is so important for children because it gives them both the freedom to play but also to learn and become part of society. They have produced a resource pack for engaging children and young people in planning and design.\nAllison DuToit of Gehl architects gave us her insight into how the way we build and design spaces affects how we, as humans, behave. Her presentation was a vivid and visual guide to the principles Jan Gehl has brought into urban design for decades that are central to the pleasant spaces of Copenhagen.\nDr Rachel Aldred talked us through the modelling of the Propensity to Cycle Tool. This tool allows anyone to use real data to examine not only how people cycle in England today, but how many people might be able to cycle in future, if we invest in more cycleways and open up streets to cycling.\nWe rounded off with group discussions for everyone who came along. We had a wide range of campaigners and practitioners exchanging lessons learnt from successful projects.\nLondon’s streets are at the core of our communities. They aren’t just routes taken to school or how we pass our neighbours. We need to change London so that you can sit in your street, know your neighbours and kids are safe to play. I look forward to further discussions where we can turn these ideas into actions to bring healthier, quieter and greener communities to all of London.",

You can read the council strategy here.\nThe overview pulls out some key points and if you are really interested there’s point by point detail below that on the Council’s vision, three priorities and the action plans set out in appendix 4 .\nIslington Green Party Air Quality Consultation response 2019-2023\nCllr Caroline Russell\nOverview\nIslington Green Party welcomes Councillor Webbe’s recognition that air pollution is worsening residents’ health and that the most deprived communities are bearing the brunt of the air pollution crisis.\nWe note the NO2 annual mean is still stubbornly 60g/m3 and has barely reduced since 2007. There is no data for 2017 or 2018 in the report, but the lack of progress in bringing down these NO2 levels between 2007 and 2016 is very worrying and suggests a step change in action is required across the borough.\nWe wonder why the council stopped reporting PM10 particle pollution at the sites in Foxham Gardens and Duncan Terrace. These both showed worryingly high levels of particle pollution and it would be helpful to understand if this is an ongoing issue.\nThere is no PM2.5 data. PM2.5 particles are the most damaging to health and the omission of this data is a concern.\nThere is no mention of reducing parking to make the roads more pedestrian friendly. We would expect to see parking spaces removed to enable people to cross the road safely and see and be seen by oncoming traffic.\nWe would also like to see the removal of parking spaces recently introduced close to junctions. These reduce sight lines for drivers and for people crossing and contribute to road danger.\nThere is no mention of parking fees as a means to deter car use and ownership. It should not be more expensive to park a bike than a car. EVs should pay a parking fee.\nThere is no mention of the council’s Roamer parking scheme. This specifically enables short car trips within the borough and is enabling and encouraging car use. If the council is serious about traffic reduction and reducing carbon emissions, the Roamer parking scheme should be ditched.\nIslington needs to set modal share targets for staff as Hackney Council does. This will reduce car commuting to the borough.\nIslington could transform the borough with a programme of Liveable neighbourhoods (filtered side roads) and borough main roads transformed into Healthy Streets with measures like extra zebra crossings and continuous footways across side roads (Copenhagen crossings) to improve the experience of crossing and walking along main roads.\nWe like the sound of the Canal side eco zone. Reducing coal, charcoal and wood burning has a huge impact on health as PM2.5 particles are very damaging and there is no safe exposure limit. This Ecozone should extend to all parks and open spaces. Further, temporary events and film crews should not be allowed to use diesel generators.\nThe list of abbreviations at the beginning of the strategy is helpful. It makes the document accessible to a non-specialist audience. It is also helpful to have the list of supporting policies and strategies and the contextual information set out on pages 6-9. Thank you.\nWe have set out our response to the vision, the three priorities set out on pages 12 – 21 and to particular points in appendix 4 in the following pages.\nOUR VISION FOR ISLINGTON\nThe vision is right to prioritise reducing emissions, decreasing exposure and influencing change. The most important is reducing emissions as that automatically helps reduce exposure of all residents to harm from breathing the air in Islington.\nPRIORITY 1 – Protecting the vulnerable\nairTEXT is a good mitigation service. It is important that people with lung and heart health conditions know when pollution is high so they can take avoiding action on those days. But information isn’t protection its an alert to get residents to use asthma relievers and avoid main roads but doesn’t reduce the pollution at source.\nIt would be good to see the airTEXT service more widely promoted. This need not be expensive and is something the council could do more extensively than at present.\nAwareness raising is helpful but could be far more extensive. There are huge networks of parents and pensioners in the borough and the council should be engaging with them more and harnessing their energy to spread the word about the need to drive less and never to idle an engine.\nIt is good to see the council working with schools. But it is unclear how projects are assessed for impact. There is no data showing levels of active travel to school by year. It would be useful to see this to assess whether interventions work or not. In particular, as part of STARS, hands up survey data of how children get to school should be made publicly available. Parents, teachers and pupils could then compare their school with others and see how their efforts are helping.\nAnti-idling initiatives are helpful but could be far more widely publicised.\nWe welcome the implementation of School Streets. It is essential the council develops a strategy for schools on main roads and these should be tackled first as pupils at these schools suffer the worst exposure to air pollution. Some schools see cars double and triple parked and the council should clamp down on this with targeted camera or officer action.\nIt is good to encourage people to be more active as this will reduce pollution if fewer people drive. However there needs to be a lot of council action to make streets safer for walking and cycling.\nIt is helpful to measure pollution at the borough’s schools but that data needs to be used to target action to cut car use.\nPRIORITY 2 – Keeping Islington moving healthily\nIt is good to see that the council thinks it is important to reduce car use, but this is not clear in the title of priority 2 which should include “healthily” as “keeping Islington moving” implies business as usual car use rather than a reduction in traffic.\nWhile some of Islington’s main roads are the responsibility of TFL many of the most polluted main roads are the responsibility of the council. The council must urgently develop a strategy to filter side roads creating low traffic neighbourhoods to stop rat-running enabled by Waze and Sat Nav and introduce measures on main roads to make them into healthy streets. This may include new zebra crossings, continuous pavements across side roads possibly zebra striped, protected bike lanes, bus stop bypasses and removal of parking spaces especially near junctions.\nCar clubs should be pushed to be electric as fast as possible and more car club cars should be introduced to give people confidence to give up on car ownership.\nThe availability of Bikeability training is positive, however it is unlikely to get people thinking about cycling to start with. They already have to be most of the way there, or indeed have got on their bike and been scared by the traffic already. Actively making cycling easier and safer is needed.\nWhat is the evidence that 20mph has reduced PM particle pollution?\nElectric Vehicles are not a magic bullet but one part of the solution. The strategy over emphasises the difference that EVs will make. EVs contribute significantly to PM particle pollution so this needs to be taken in to consideration. It would be unhelpful if the mistakes made when everyone was encouraged to swap from petrol to diesel vehicles were replicated with a shift to EVs.\nElectric bikes, cargo bikes, bikes, walking and public transport must be safe and convenient, so residents choose more active ways to travel.\nWhile keeping Islington moving is important it is also crucial that people are able to easily stop along routes and use the shopping and leisure facilities Islington has to offer on foot and by bike. Areas like the Nags Head are currently suffering from decline with plenty of empty retail units depressing the area. Recent research from Living Streets shows that pedestrians and cyclists are more likely to stop and shop than people driving past. So TfL should be pushed to make Holloway Rd less traffic dominated, easier to cross and safe to cycle along.\nWe fully support the ULEZ extension to the North and South Circular, we would prefer it to cover the whole of London (to M25) for cars and vans as it will does for buses and lorries. We support any move by the council to push the Mayor to bring forward the implementation date and would like to see it brought in with a smart road pricing scheme.\nPRIORITY 3 – Better air, better health, better environment\nWe welcome tree planting to improve the built environment but have questions regarding tree management. Is the effect on air pollution taken in to account when planning tree works, especially around schools and on major routes? Is the impact on air pollution levels considered when the council allows insurance companies to cut down mature trees in subsidence cases.\nWhy is only City Fringe mentioned for developing schemes to prioritise walking and cycling. This should be done across the borough.\nCould cargo bikes be added to the ZEN initiative? good way to get businesses thinking about using them as an alternative and being able to try them out risk free.\nThe eco zone for Regents Canal should be extended to all parks and open spaces. No events should use diesel generators and no wood, coal or charcoal fires should be allowed.\nAPPENDICES\nAppendix 4 (helpfully) lists all the actions that the council is going to take but there is no evidence base to indicate that they have been effective in the past or that they will be effective in the future. Projected costs are not shown (whereas they are in the LIP). Value for money is also not assessed. Even if the money comes via a grant, there’s no point in continuing with activities that have insignificant results.\nThere is data to show that the Mayor’s T-toxicity charge has been effective. The council has tiered parking charges (item 15 in appendix 4). There is no analysis available about the efficacy of this measure. As an example, parking data could be analysed by registration number to check if diesel ownership is going down.\nAppendix 4 detailed comments\n1 – Good to see attention paid to school run traffic. The council should focus enforcement of parking on yellow zigzags and idling and ensure parents know that car use for trips to school should be an exception not routine.\n2 – Audit all schools and prioritise the worst polluted for action.\n3 – Low pollution walking maps – this is a great idea. Would be great to see one Islington map with all clean air walking routes on the Islington website. Perhaps with links to Islington Museum with local history stories to get people curious about exploring the borough.\n4 – Good active travel measures but need to measure and report on progress.\n5 – Important to link walking and cycling to health outcomes. Reducing car use and making our streets healthier will improve resident’s health.\n6 – STARS, as above – important to track effectiveness.\n7 – Let’s focus on making it web accessible. Multi function displays that show walking, bike-use, car-use modal shares and other information as well as air pollution could be good.\n8 – airTEXT is useful and should be promoted much more. People do not know about it widely.\n9 – Anti idling, would be good to see this campaign give focus on people either using their phones while idling e.g. to insert their destination in satnav/google maps especially at the start of a journey or idling simply to charge their phones, keep the heating/cooling on because they are worried that they might flatten the very large vehicle battery.\n10 – Islington should participate in Carfree day in September every year.\n11 – Involving community and enabling people to run idling or walk to school campaigns should be a priority and needs constant review on progress and efficacy.\n12 – Not just research. We need an assessment of what works and then do lots of it.\n13 – Excellent to replace gas boilers this reduces green house gases as well as cleaning the air.\n14 – Please report on progress on energy saving advice so residents can see what the council is achieving.\n15 – Residents parking permits are far too cheap. Bike storage is far too expensive. Residents’ cars block key cycle routes, parking needs to be removed (as per Gillespie Road trial). The Council has to tackle the parking issue head on. It must never be cheaper to park a car than a bike. Car parking that reduces sight lines for pedestrians trying to cross the road (at junctions) must be removed.\n16 – Assess whether vehicle use is necessary. Could services be delivered differently. Do surveyors and repairs teams need a car or a cargo bike? Maximise cargo bike use by the council and cut car use.\n17 – Good to see traffic reduction as a target. The best way to achieve this is to divide Islington into traffic cells bounded by main roads and filter all the side roads so all homes can be accessed but it is not possible to cut through residential streets from one main road to another. For this to be fair, the main roads must be healthy streets with Copenhagen crossing (continuous footway) across side roads, extra zebra crossings and protected cycling facilities.\n18 – fully support FORS. This is essential for reducing road danger and adhering to Vision Zero. It must be a condition of procurement and should be a planning permission condition too.\n19 – Fully support freight consolidation\n20 – install bike hangars, drop the price and install more Sheffield stands.\n21 – ‘Review all one way roads’. No need to do this. Extensive review completed around 2009. What’s far more important is to actually make some one-way roads two way for cycling.\n22 – Good for the council to stand up for residents and check TfL are improving public transport. Good to see a commitment to reallocate road space buried in this bullet point.\n23 – EV chargers must not diminish the public realm. They should ideally be placed on a build out in a parking space not on the footway.\n24 – Fully support more car club cars and vans. This is a good tool to help people give up on car use.\n25 – The ULEZ expansion should be brought forward and extended to the M25 so no Londoners are left out of the clean air zone.\n26 – Fully support diesel free London by 2025 so long as vehicles are available for all transport sectors.\n27 – This should read ENABLE active travel not “promote”. The way to do this is through low traffic neighbourhoods and healthy street main roads.\n28 – To focus minds, Islington needs to set modal share targets for staff like Hackney.\n29 – Eco driving is a good idea. Insurance companies already monitor new drivers using black boxes. Many drivers don’t realise how poorly they drive in terms of fuel use. Suggest that the council encourages employees to drive with a mobile phone app (or equivalent) that measures acceleration and braking for their journeys and immediately provides vocal feedback directly back to the drivers e.g. ‘you accelerate quite quickly, you change speed quite often’ as well as uploading the results aggregated for all journeys. I think it needs to be real and competitive for the drivers and reward the safest drivers who save the most fuel.\n31 – Highbury Corner to Archway. Active travellers will struggle to use side routes for this particular journey because they are longer and fragmented. They need to be improved e.g. by removing parking on Hornsey Road especially adjacent to the flats and made safe and direct.\n38 – Canal side eco zone sounds good. Reducing coal, charcoal and wood burning has a huge impact on health as PM2.5 particles are very damaging and there is no safe exposure. This Ecozone should extend to all parks and open spaces. Further, temporary events and film crews should not use diesel generators.\n54 – Help businesses move to cargo bike delivery and transport.\n57 – smoke free fuel should apply to BBQs in gardens and in parks. The council should supply electric shared use BBQs if it is considered essential to have the opportunity to cook while picnicking.\n62 – Internal teams should work closely with residents, TRAs, parents groups, pensioner groups etc to involve community in monitoring progress and spreading the word about the importance of cutting car use to clean up our air.",
  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2020_06_coronavirus-takes-its-toll-on-small-businesses/content_172.html": "Coronavirus takes its toll on small businesses\nWhen most of us think about the Square Mile, we see glass towers and banking behemoths. Yet, the reality is that 98 per cent of businesses in London’s financial district are small and medium enterprises such as tech firms, dentists, barbers, sandwich shops, nail bars and pubs, employing nearly half the people working there. These businesses, many of which depend on those skyscrapers being full of hungry, thirsty and time-poor employees, are at risk of going under because of the new coronavirus model of working from home or in socially distanced offices.\nA survey by the Guardians of the Arches and East End Trades Guild found that 77 per cent of their members will not be able to pay their next quarterly rent. This is partly due to the capital’s higher operating costs, which are penalising small and medium business owners more than those in other parts of the country.\nGovernment packages for small businesses have helped many businesses, but more assistance is needed. I have written to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak asking him to put into the place the measures laid out by the East End Trades Guild, Guardians of the Arches and New Economics Foundation. Their four key asks are:\n- Establish a London weighting for business support thresholds which reflects the capital’s higher rateable values;\n- Resource and then mandate landlords, including local authorities, to offer unconditional support on rents for all small business tenants severely affected by lockdown;\n- Resource and then mandate local authorities to ensure small businesses severely affected by lockdown do not miss out on intended government support; and\n- Expand government support offered to businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure industries to include small businesses wholly or mainly reliant upon these industries.\nI first raised in April the problems in the Chancellor’s coronavirus business package with Deputy Mayors Debbie Weekes-Bernard and Rajesh Agrawal. These include the 15,000 cap on London Rateable Values being too low; no support for light industry and manufacturing; boroughs relying on out-of-date and faulty data; and no independent route for businesses.\nThe management of the pandemic is now moving from immediate emergency response to a more long-term approach looking to the future with the establishment of the London Transition Board and the Recovery Board, which met for the first time last week. One of their biggest tasks will be to support small businesses as the furlough scheme tapers off and firms are expected to start paying their staff again.\nIf additional support is not made available to small businesses in the capital, hundreds of them may fail, which would have wider and ruinous impacts on the lives of many Londoners. The challenge for London as we emerge gradually from lockdown is to protect the small businesses that are the beating heart of our city and essential for a thriving local economy.",

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2019_02_written-hustings/content_95.html": "Written hustings\nLondon Greens have sent in questions for London Assembly candidates to answer. So I thought I’d post my responses here. The questions cover a range of issues covering the Night Time economy, voting systems, campaign messaging, positive discrimination, young people, housing, narrowing the gap between highest and lowest paid, Brexit and protecting green spaces. There was a strict limit of not more than 100 words per question on average. And here are my answers.\n1. Many music venues face closure in London due to business rates or noise abatement orders what will you do to support and protect grassroots music in the city? Sam Murray – Waltham Forest & Redbridge\nThe Economy Committee reportRewrite the Nightthat I lead on as Economy Chair last year, looks in detail at the issues faced by grass roots music (and other creative) venues. I really like the way the Mayor is supporting inclusive culture across the city including in outer boroughs and not just in the honeypot centre.\nI am making sure that this report recommendation is included in the London Plan: “The Mayor should require boroughs to consider the need for dedicated space to showcase the work of artists and musicians in Supplementary Planning Guidance”.\nIt is important that boroughs work with residents but there are plenty of examples of good practice that we quote in the report where boroughs are enabling grass roots music venues to thrive in partnership with local communities. (132 words)\n2. What are the cultural opportunities from closing London city airport? How can we use the space in an interesting way like Tempelhof park in Berlin? Sam Murray – Waltham Forest & Redbridge\nIn the last Mayoral election we proposed closing City Airport to make a new district of housing and small businesses, backed by a New Economics Foundation report. This proposal could certainly include Night Time Economy venues to support grass roots music and creativity. The model of making space available outside the centre of cities for night time culture is something London should definitely explore. (64 words)\n3. How will you support London’s vast night time economy? Sam Murray – Waltham Forest & Redbridge\nAs Chair of the Economy Committee last year, I lead a scrutiny into the future of Culture and the Night Time Economy. Our report Rewrite the Night made many recommendations to the Mayor. In particular that workers at night should be paid the Living Wage. I got the mayor to publish new data in to working conditions at night revealing that more people are working for less than Living Wage at night. I’ve questioned the Mayor on this and yesterday responded to a report from the Night Time Commission that failed to mention underpaid night time workers.\n4. What developments do you wish to see in London’s cultural strategy? Sam Murray – Waltham Forest & Redbridge\nI led the Economy Committee response to the Mayor’s draft Culture Strategy and made a Green Group response that focussed on good work standards and grass roots culture. You can also watch my questioning the Mayor on the Culture Strategy.\n5. Why in your view is The Green Party continuing to average around 1-2% in the polls and how will your approach as a candidate seek to address this? Scott Bartle – Brent\nFirst Past the Post (FPTP) elections are tough. They work on a binary choice between the two biggest parties in any election.\nThe Assembly election is different. The constituency vote is FPTP and we won’t win those seats. However we have come third in the Mayoral election in 2012 and 2016 and we have consistently won two seats on the Assembly via the proportional Party list vote.\nWhen people know their vote will count they will vote Green. Our job is to show elected Greens are effective, so Londoners vote for more of us.\n6. The nuances of the London electoral system means that the Greens normally do well on the London-wide list for the Assembly. Do you believe that this will affect your campaign messaging and, if so, how will you explain what this means for the voters and how they should cast their London-wide vote? Ben Hickey – Islington\nThe campaign messaging belongs to London Green Party and not to any one candidate. Having said that, I hope that we will build on the record of work that Sian and I have created so that Londoners have confidence in voting Green Party on the party vote ballot paper. I think we need to focus on voting for “the Green Party” and not the colour of a ballot paper as in previous years.\n7. As someone who is classifiable as a BME woman, but who does not see herself as representative of BME people and womankind, and who finds BME-only and female-only short lists, and BME and gender quotas, to be deeply problematic, I am interested to know what the candidates think of positive discrimination. Pippa Maslin – Merton\nI really like the formulation of “at least” one woman and “at least” one BAME person in our selection framework. It is not about quotas but it does ensure that our list of candidates in in 2020 is as representative of Londoners as possible. The most important thing about effective Green Party campaigners and elected people is that we are good listeners and that we bring Londoners voices in to our Town Halls and City Hall.\n8. In Merton, we are fortunate to have 67 parks and nature conservation areas, but unfortunate to have a Labour-led council who have: (a) outsourced the management of our green spaces to a distinctly mediocre company; and (b) started allowing unsuitable events to be held in our green spaces. They say that they want to ‘sweat our assets’ because of ‘austerity’. What do you make of this behaviour, and how might the London Assembly help Mertonians to defend their right to have access to good quality public green spaces? Pippa Maslin – Merton\nAssembly Members (AMs) are elected to scrutinise the work of the Mayor of London. However we can ensure the Mayor’s policies help campaigners standing up to protect green space in London boroughs.\nI will be giving evidence to the Examination in Public for the London Plan on greenspace and biodiversity amongst other matters.\nAs an Islington councillor Islington I’ve made sure greenspace workers are employed on proper contracts with rights to sick and holiday pay. I’ve also made sure that community use of parks is protected despite the impact of austerity meaning parks need to create some income.\n9. With young people feeling undervalued and often voiceless in both society and politics, what would you prioritize to support young people in London? Aaron Parr – Hackney\nAs Chair of the Assembly Economy Committee last year, I oversaw a scrutiny on the financial health of Londoners. After speaking with young people and seeing the work of organisations like MyBnk, we made several recommendations in our Shortchanged report to the Mayor about supporting the financial well-being of young people. On our recommendation, the Mayor held an event last Autumn bringing together the organisations supporting the financial health of young Londoners. You can read more about this work here.\nAnd obviously I am a huge fan of the Young Greens and the 30U30 scheme, enabling so many people to become such impressive campaigners.\n10. Given London’s chronic housing crisis, what are the candidates’ solutions, specifically in relation to renting, which disproportionately effects Londoners from a lower socio-economic background? Paul Valentine – Lambeth\nI am working on a scrutiny as Environment Chair looking at solutions for cold, damp and mouldy homes. As a councillor in Islington it has been shocking to see the way that a combination of factors like new plastic windows, overcrowding, lack of ventilation and structural design of flats has lead to an epidemic of condensation and black mould. It is shameful that public sector housing is left in this state and that residents are even made to feel guilty for breathing, cooking and washing their clothes through thoughtless advice to put lids on saucepans and avoid hanging clothes to dry indoors.\nWe have visited Thamesmead where Peabody have come up with effective multi measure affordable retrofit. I hope our report will help social housing providers to tackle mould and condensation making all homes fit to be lived in. If you have experience of mould and condensation contribute to our report via TalkLondon.\n11. Could the mayor and assembly narrow the wide distribution of income in London and the UK? Nick Barnett – Sutton & Croydon\nBroadly this is outside the Mayor’s powers. However…\nThe London Living Wage came out of work by the Assembly pushed by Jenny Jones and Darren Johnson.\nIn the Green Group budget amendment this year we propose that the Assembly explores whether a four day working week (on full pay) would help the productivity of the organisation and the well being of workers.\nMy work as Chair of the Economy Committee last year on financial health has at my request been followed up this year examining the impact of Universal Credit on small and micro businesses.\n12. What is your position on Brexit and would you push for a People’s Vote and then campaign for Remain if selected? Adele Ward – Barnet\nI campaigned hard to Remain and continue to campaign to expose the harms of leaving the EU. I sit on City Hall’s EU Exit Working Groupand have made sure that EU citizens’ voices have been heard and that the impact of leaving the EU on small businesses is understood and assistance given. Last week I raised with Nick Hurd, Minister for London the precarious situation of micro businesses preparing for EU exit.\nI’m proud that it was a Green Group motion that got the Mayor to speak out for a People’s Vote.\n13. Some candidates allude specifically to the unquestionable need for more housing, particularly social and affordable housing. My concerns is that, often, large-scale developments are in direct conflict with environmental objectives. Have you/will you consider improved legislation and regulation around planning and development in order to ensure that the much needed developments also maintain and prefereably increase our city’s green infrastructure and environmental credentials? Jessica Stocks – Wandsworth\nOvercrowding is increasing and it is unquestionable that we need more homes in London for social rent. However it is crucial we build on brownfield land first rather than using green spaces that are so important for our mental health and well being as well as for protecting biodiversity and providing resilience against climate change impacts like extreme rainfall and flooding. My recent report on Farming in the Green Belt found that farmers find it hard to get access to land for a decent period to enable sustainable farming practice, this is probably a consequence of land-banking for future development.",
  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2015_05_priorities-for-london-green-party/content_237.html": "Priorities for London Green Party\nThe Mayoral and Assembly elections in 2016 offer an amazing opportunity for London Greens to build on the Green membership surge and make the most of the talents and experience of members new and old.\nOur main priorities as a Party in this election should be to:\n* maximise our presence on the London Assembly\n* put a Green Mayor in City Hall and\n* get local parties ready for the next local elections in 2018.\nCurrently we have just four councillors elected in London, despite having come third in the mayoral election in 2012. If we are going to change this, we have to get better at contesting elections effectively. This election is a chance to try things out and for our local parties to build on their enthusiasms and fine tune the basics of electioneering.\nSince joining the Greens in 2009, I’ve stood as a target ward council candidate twice (2010 and 2014), a by election once (2011), on the Assembly list in 2012 and in the General Election in 2015. I’ve used each opportunity as a candidate to learn and grow the capacity of the Islington Green Party team. I’ve also been campaign manager in the Junction ward by election in 2013 where we came second in a ward we’d never worked in before.\nI was proud to stand in Islington North in the General election, coming third with 10.2% of the vote against a long standing and popular MP. It was the sixteenth best result in the country and achieved without national party target status. We did this by organising and engaging new teams across multiple wards, building on local enthusiasm and delivering targeted communications to more voters than ever before.\nMy election to Islington Council in 2014, in a breakthrough ward, was by just eight votes. I know very well that every vote counts and that we have to earn the trust of voters across London. This means appealing to Londoners across our city with a positive vision that can include voters who have voted for other parties in the past. Habitual Labour, Lib Dem and Tory voters contributed to my eight vote margin. If we are going to get a Green mayor for London we need to inspire voters of all backgrounds and previous political persuasions that Green Party leadership can make London a better City.",

Decriminalisation is unlikely to increase drug use, while criminalisation certainly does not reduce it.\n“The Mayor announced a Drugs Commission back in April 2021, saying he would bring together experts and leading figures from criminal justice and public health.\n“So far, we haven’t even seen any terms of reference for the Commission. The Mayor needs to end the delay so the Assembly has a chance to scrutinise his approach to reducing drug harm in London.”\n[1] Exclusive: Sadiq Khan to begin decriminalising drugs in London: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/01/03/sadiq-khan-begin-decriminalising-drugs-london/\n[2] Clarification from Mayor’s press office: “This limited trial is still in development & simply means that 18-24 year olds found with small amounts of cannabis would be diverted to receive help which is shown to reduce offending.

However, opponents reject suggestions that anticipated future reductions in air pollution from cleaner vehicles could allow an expanded Heathrow airport to emit more pollution than at present and stay within legal limits.\nIn May, Caroline questioned the Mayor on airport expansion. He said he was ‘not persuaded further expansion of airports within London would be compatible with (my) aim of achieving legal limits for air quality as soon as possible’.\nShe says today:\n“The decision to choose Heathrow as the preferred option, depending on the final vote next year, has offered temporary relief for the people living under the new flight paths but prolonged their anguish as they wait another twelve months to find out their fate.\n“Imagine a motorbike zooming outside your front door from morning to night – this will be the new reality for west Londoners who will be blighted by more air pollution and intrusive noise because of this miserable decision.\n“This is a two-pronged problem for west Londoners, as well as contending with noisy flights their local roads and public transport will be clogged with increased traffic, worsening their daily journeys and exacerbating air pollution.\n“There’s no way expansion should even be on the table when air pollution in Heathrow already exceeds legal limits. This is a bad decision that will accelerate climate change and makes a mockery of the Government’s announcement to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n“I am calling on the Mayor to influence the Government to make sure alternatives to yet more expansion are explored; annually there are around 10 million seats of unused capacity on the Eurostar and a frequent flyer levy could help use existing runways more efficiently.\n“The Mayor should, for example, convince the Government to renegotiate the current Eurotunnel fee structure that means both trains and passengers pay arbitrary fees and makes international train travel so expensive.\n“Transport for London estimates that £18 billion of investment will be needed to upgrade the transport infrastructure around an expanded Heathrow with just £1 billion coming from Heathrow.\n“The Mayor must explain how TfL’s finances will cope with the additional pressure if this does happen. He should also set out how he will ensure the clean air savings his Ultra Low Emission Zone might bring can be safeguarded against emissions from Heathrow expansion.”",

Now I’m not sure such a strategy has even been mooted, let alone discussed or agreed.\nHaving spent the last six years working with Islington Greens building our Party, campaigning on the doorstep and getting elected last year as sole opposition councillor to 47 Labour members, I care desperately that we get this right. 2016 could, and should, be a break-through election for the Green Party.\nThe London elections have huge potential for us because with a proportional voting element, voters don’t seem to feel compelled to stick to the comfort blanket of traditional party lines. It’s a great moment for Greens to step forward with a radical vision for dealing with mainstream problems.\nI absolutely support the idea that we need to work hard to take along those disenchanted with the political system (young people, ethnic minorities and those on lower incomes) but the Greens have the potential to go so much further than that. This is not in the cynical pursuit of electoral gain, but is the right thing to do. Green solutions to London’s problems have the potential to catch the imagination of people of very diverse backgrounds, circumstances and indeed voting histories.\nIdeas that seemed radical even ten years ago have hit a tipping point where huge parts of the London electorate are ready for big changes in the way that housing, transport and other services are organised. We’ve all seen the way that the former hostility to 20mph limits even on quiet side roads has all but evaporated with proposals for Transport for London main road trials receiving a positive welcome.\nMore importantly voters are looking for big ideas. They know something is profoundly wrong and they are looking for a party that can describe a paradigm shift in the way we do politics.\nOf course we are anti-austerity, but to focus just on that is to be trapped in a battleground created by the current Tory/Labour establishment. Our job as Greens is to paint an inspiring picture on the doorstep and in our communities that enables people to trust us to deliver a better city.\nGreens must beware the false dichotomy between popular and radical messaging. Both Sian and Jonathan are pointing to important issues but it is a needlessly polarised debate. We need to see beyond a linear ‘left-right’ spectrum, unite and build an ever bigger coalition of people able to think boldly and differently about solving the problems of London and beyond.\nHaving fought a General Election campaign in May in Islington North that trebled the Green share of the vote (against Jeremy Corbyn, no less), I have seen the evidence that London voters do not just vote in their own narrow financial interests. We should credit people with the understanding that a city run in the interests of the common good is better for everyone, and people will vote for that if we present a sincere, coherent, compelling vision.\nThe Greenness of the Green party is something whose time has come. We need to step up and paint an ambitious, optimistic picture of a radically Green London which shows you can run a great world city (and by extension, a whole country) in a way that reduces inequality, supports diversity, and is inclusive, fair and environmentally sustainable.",

Under this new plan many more residents who will be overflown by new and more concentrated flight paths. Furthermore, the proposals would see the current weekend respite period reduced, meaning Londoners are blighted by aircraft noise every day of the week and for longer hours.\nEven at current levels, many residents are suffering unacceptable levels of noise.\nThe World Health Organisation states that exposure to noise levels above 45 decibels is associated with negative health impacts. City Airport currently operates under a threshold of 57 decibels, although meter readings under overflown homes have been recorded at up to 75 decibels.\nIn addition to the misery these proposals would inflict on residents, the expansion of aviation during a climate emergency is entirely inappropriate.\nI will continue to demand that Londoners’ quality of life is prioritised over the commercial interests of City Airport.\nYou can read the full text of my letter.",

These funding plans proposed £10 million for a brand-new London toilets fund to give local councils access to money to refurbish, reopen and revitalise these essential local amenities.\nThe budget amendment also included £1.5 million on designs for new pedestrian crossings for 50 of the most dangerous signal controlled junctions that do not currently have a crossing facility for people walking.\nThe amendment was supported by Green London Assembly Members Caroline Russell, Zack Polanski and Sian Berry, and Liberal Democrat Assembly Members Caroline Pidgeon MBE and Hina Bokhari.\nCaroline Russell said:\n“More safe crossings and decent, free loos shouldn’t be a tough sell. The urgent need for more toilets and crossings is acute. We can see this for ourselves if we simply spend a day travelling around London with our family and friends.\n“Where we should be seeing increased funding for better roads and facilities, we are seeing further cuts and ‘managed decline’.\n“The Mayor and the Assembly had a powerful opportunity to stand up for a more accessible, and better, city by taking action to improve dangerous junctions littered across London and I am disappointed that it was voted down today.\n“Our roads should be safe for children, older and disabled people to walk along and cross without dodging traffic.\n“Nobody should be dehydrating themselves because they don’t know when they’ll find a loo. I will not stop raising these fundamental but often forgotten accessibilities that, if funded properly, make London a safe, connected and world leading city.”\nCaroline argued that this modest investment will mean that when TfL finances are stabilised, it will have shovel-ready schemes that both reduce road danger and support the Mayor’s manifesto commitment to ‘improve the safety of the most dangerous junctions’.\nOn the 26 January, at the Draft Budget Plenary, the Assembly supported two City Hall Green budget-related motions, calling on the Mayor to provide a broad estimate of the cost of cancelling the Silvertown Road Tunnel, and to provide more toilets and new pedestrian crossings in London.

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2019_02_good-green-ideas-in-city-hall/content_207.html": "Good Green ideas in City Hall\nWhat does London need and how can it be paid for? This is the question the Mayor tries to answer every year in his budget.\nAnd as part of the work we do at City Hall we put forward an amendment to the Mayor’s Budget with Green ideas.\nThis year we looked to expand some of the good policies already happening, to guarantee the future of good initiatives like the Young Londoners Fund, doing more to support charities to get ultra low emission zone suitable minibuses, investigate the four-day week, and pushed the Mayor to show leadership and do follow up work now that he has agreed with us and declared a climate emergency.\nHelping charities upgrade to the ULEZ\nSince we pressed the Mayor, in our previous amendment and in our questioning of him at the January plenary, to increase funds for vehicle scrappage, he announced new measures to help low-income car drivers upgrade to cleaner vehicles with the option to obtain green travel credit – something I have been pushing him to do for some time. He also shared plans to include charities in his existing £23m small businesses scrappage scheme.\nAll of this was welcome, but the Mayor’s plans still don’t recognise the difficulty some charities are going to face in upgrading – the grants for these groups are too low.\nI proposed increasing the scrappage fund to £30m, specifically to support charities, because when he announced that charities would be included in his £23m microbusinesses scrappage fund, he didn’t add any new money to this first-come-first-served fund – he just increased the competition.\nOur scheme proposes that charities crowdfund around £13,000 themselves to obtain double this in match funding from an increased scrappage fund. The more generous level of grant we would offer better reflects the financial reality for charities.\nClimate emergency\nAlthough the Mayor has – after a motion I put forward at the Assembly – declared a climate emergency his current position implies that anything to speed up progress on tackling the climate emergency will require Government action but this isn’t quite accurate.\nHis previously published carbon targets show he is still working to 2050, not 2030, as a deadline to make London carbon neutral.\nI want him to set out specific plans to do the work needed to update the ‘climate change and energy’ section of his environment strategy or update the adaptation measures that London will need to cope with extreme weather events associated with rapid global warming.\nThe thousands of London students who took part in climate strikes earlier this month would expect no less from a Mayor who has declared a climate emergency.\nSchools in areas of illegal levels of air pollution\nThe Mayor has kept air pollution at the top of his agenda, and last year funded air pollution audits for 50 of the worst-affected primary schools in London. There are another 150 schools sitting on roads and streets with bad air and I want to see him complete audits for these schools too.\nFour-day week\nI’ve talked about a four-day week before, and it’s an idea worth investigating so I urged the Mayor to fund a study of how a four-day week could work at the GLA would show the Mayor is at the forefront of thinking about the future of work.\nA study of an eight week pilot of a four-day working week at a New Zealand financial services firm, Perpetual Guardian, found a 20 per cent boost to productivity, increased profits and improved staff morale.\nPerpetual Guardian switched its 240 staff from a five day to a four day week and maintained their pay. Productivity increased in the four days they worked so there was no drop in the total amount of work done, a study of the trial showed.\nThe company has been deluged with requests for information, mostly from organisations in the UK, followed by Australia, the US and Germany.\nThese are just some of the ideas put forward in our Green amendment, you can read the document in full here:\nFeatured image by Chris King Photography",

Three motions affecting trans people were heard. E03 Self Determination of Gender and E05 Recognise Trans Parents both passed and one motion E01 Women’s sex based rights fell. The text for each motion is lower down this page.\nTrans and non binary friends and work colleagues have told me how much it means to them that motions E03 and E05 have passed. These motions have helpfully clarified that the Green Party of England and Wales is inclusive of trans and non binary people, that we support self identification and that we would remove the legal barriers to trans parents having their gender properly recognised on their child’s birth certificate.\nMotion E01 on women’s sex based rights as drafted, attempted to exclude trans people from participating in women’s sport, despite the fact that the Equality act 2010 already allows UK sporting bodies to do this, although the majority do not choose to. The motion as written created a situation where voting for it harmed the rights of trans people and voting against it led to accusations of not supporting women’s rights.\nI spoke against motion E01 and my speech is set out below. I have also included the live transcript of my speech with all its spelling confusions, so that it is clear what I actually said.\nI realise that there are Green Party members who may be upset that E01 has fallen. Some of the proposers of the motion are people who are my friends and colleagues. I disagree with their motion and I hope my speech makes clear why.\nI also hope that in future we can work together as proud inclusive feminists on issues affecting all women.\nSpeaking Notes on motion E01(as delivered)\nI’m Caroline Russell from Islington Green Party.\nA motion about rights of women sounds straightforward and we can all agree that “inequality and discrimination against women needs to end”.\nBut I cannot support this motion.\nThis is simply because it proposes policy that discriminates against trans people.\nThere are some specific things I’ll raise now:\nIt is untrue that Green Party of England and Wales has no policy on women’s rights. Our existing policies could be grouped together better and improved – but this motion does neither.\nSex is already referred to as one of the 14 named categories against which discrimination must not exist in RR207, in our record of policy statements.\nFurther, this motion frequently uses the phrase ‘sex-based rights’, a phrase that doesn’t actually have a specific legal meaning – I believe the implied meaning is rights which are based on physiological sex observed at birth – these rights already exist, and are set out in the Equality Act, 2010.\nAt the end of the motion it says that “it supports women’s rights to assert their own sexuality” – I support this idea, as I assume we all do, but it doesn’t make sense as a policy statement. Sexual orientation is already detailed in RR207, and making such a statement women-specific does imply that we don’t support the right of anybody else to assert their own sexuality.\nFinally, this motion attempts to imply that women’s sports must exclude trans people. Sporting bodies in the UK are already free to do so, under the Equality Act 2010. But the vast majority of sporting bodies do not consider this necessary.\nI am speaking now in solidarity with my trans friends and colleagues and with my friends who are parents of trans children and young people.\nI hope that Green Party colleagues will join me in voting against this motion today because it goes against our shared Green Party values of kindness and inclusion.\nPlease vote E01 down.\nThe text of the motion: E01 Women’s sex-based rights\nConference adds an additional paragraph to Our Rights and Responsibilities Policy, entitled “Women’s sex-based Rights.”\nThis is to include the protected characteristic of sex as currently our Record of Policy statements supports the other 8 characteristics (age, disability, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, race, maternity, religion/belief, marriage/civil partnership see RR207) but not that of sex discrimination – aimed primarily at women for all the reasons set out in the background below.\nInsert proposed paragraph:\n“RR540 The Green Party recognises: the wide range of discrimination against women in UK society; that women’s hard-won rights must be defended; and that inequality and discrimination against women needs to end. The Green Party is against all forms of discrimination (see RR207). It supports women’s sex-based rights, as set out in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 1979). It supports women’s rights to assert their own sexuality. Women continue to be subjected to discrimination based solely upon their biological sex. A person’s sex, as determined by their biology does not always correspond with their gender. Therefore, the terms sex and gender are not interchangeable and all gender identities are valid.\nThe Green Party supports women’s equality-based rights which recognise women as persons and include the right to vote and the right to equal pay for equal value work. The Green Party supports women’s diversity-based rights based upon the sex-biological characteristics unique to women which include menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, and physically diminutive stature and strength. Diversity based rights recognise women as women – e.g. women’s sports exist partly to give opportunity for women to play which would not be afforded if they played with physically larger, taller, stronger, and usually faster, men. The Green Party supports the celebration of International Women’s Day on 8th March each year.”\nLive transcript during E01\nI saved the chat so that I could check my speech against delivery.\n15:26:57 But I would like to call Caroline, Russell, please to speak against eo one.\n15:26:54 So when you’re already Caroline.\n15:26:58 Can I just sorry Caroline muscle (Russell) is into (Islington) Green Party Can I just clarify Do I have three minutes or one minute. You have three minutes to speak against the motion, all other speakers will have one minute.\n15:27:13 Oh, sorry.\n15:27:14 When you’re ready.\n15:27:17 Thank you very much chair. So Caroline Russell is LinkedIn (Islington) Green Party.\n15:27:23 Emotion (A motion) about rights of women sounds straightforward. And we can all agree that inequality and discrimination against women, needs to end.\n15:27:34 But I cannot support this motion.\n15:27:38 This is simply because it proposes policy that discriminates against trans people.\n15:27:45 I want to raise a few specific things. It is untrue the Green Party of England and Wales has no policy on women’s rights, our policies could be grouped together better and improved.\n15:27:57 But this motion does neither sex is already referred to as one of the 14 named categories against which discrimination must not exist in our 207 (RR207), in our record of policy statements.\n15:28:14 Further, the motion frequently uses the phrase sex based rights, a phrase that doesn’t actually have a specific legal meaning, I believe the implied meaning is rights which are based on physiological sex observed at birth.\n15:28:30 These rights already exist and are set out in the Equality Act of 2010.\n15:28:38 At the end of the motion.\n15:28:40 It says that it supports women’s rights to assert their own sexuality. Now, I support this idea as I assume we all do.\n15:28:49 But it doesn’t make sense as a policy statement, sexual orientation is already detailed in our 207 (RR207) and making such a statement women’s specific does imply that we don’t support the right of anybody else to assert their own sexuality.\n15:29:06 And finally this motion attempts to imply that women’s sports must exclude trans people, sporting bodies in the UK already free to do so under the Equality Act of 2010.\n15:29:19 But the vast majority of sporting bodies do not consider this necessary.\n15:29:26 Now I am speaking now in solidarity with my trans friends and colleagues, and with my friends who are parents of trans children and young people.\n15:29:39 I hope that Green Party colleagues will join me in voting against this motion today, because it goes against our shared Green Party values of kindness, and inclusion.\n15:29:54 Please vote, yo one (EO1) down. Thank you.\nMotion text: E03 Self determination of gender\nInsert new RR531 and renumber PSS accordingly:\n“RR531 The Green Party believes that trans, non-binary, genderqueer, third gender, and intersex people should have their gender legally recognised and be empowered to update their birth certificate and any other official documents, without medical or state encumbrance. We support the right for individuals to update their legally recognised gender by self-determination, the only requirement being a statutory declaration, to how they would describe their gender, including having the option to change their name on all documents.”\nMotion text: E05 Recognise trans parents\nInsert new RR537 and RR538 and renumber PSS accordingly:\n“RR537: The Green Party would remove the legal barriers to trans parents having their gender properly recognised on their child’s birth certificate. We would ensure parents could choose the right option for them (mother/father/parent) on a birth certificate.\nRR538: The Green Party would also investigate setting up a process, in consultation with the LGBTIQA+ community, to be able to correct birth certificates that were issued with an inappropriate description of a parent.”",
  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2017_12_taming-our-hostile-streets/content_230.html": "Taming our Hostile Streets\nEarlier this week I launched Hostile Streets: Walking and cycling at outer London junctions following my investigation on behalf of the Assembly’s Transport Committee.\nLondoners who want to walk to school, cycle to work, or pop out to the shops face hostile streets that don’t meet their needs – particularly in outer London. Main roads and busy junctions disrupt journeys, and make walking and cycling less enjoyable, less convenient and less safe.\nI started the study after talking to people who live near the North Circular who told me they would drive a few hundred yards from their homes on one side of this busy trunk road to the shops on the other, simply because there was no convenient walking route. This is clearly absurd, all Londoners should be able to walk and cycle around their neighbourhoods in safety.\nGetting the report out meant a battle over a recommendation about TfL doing more research on the changes set out in British Cycling’s Turning the Corner Campaign. The arguments against this are set out in the minority report however we had unequivocal support from Manchester’s walking and cycling commissioner.\nWe are one of only three countries in the world to manage our junctions this way. Studies show that by following the rest of the world and introducing a give way when turning rule, UK junctions can be made up to 40% more efficient, which can be used to cut waiting times for drivers or bus users depending on the priorities needed at a particular junction.\nChris Boardman, British Cycling policy adviser\nOn the evening I welcomed my dream panel to discuss the recommendations drawn from the report\n– Lucy Saunders, who has done so much to link public health with the public realm and get that into TfL’s DNA\n– Rachel Aldred, a cycling academic whose work has provided hard evidence on risk and conditions for cycling\n– Brian Deegan, a transport engineer who worked for TfL for many years and knows where the bodies are buried!\nAnd our fantastic chair, the director of Urban Movement John Dales, who deftly kept us and the audience in check.\nSome of the comments people left about the recommendations:\nWe had a lively debate in the room and on Twitter – you can follow the conversation below and add your own thoughts on our hostile streets and the recommendations in the report by leaving a comment at the bottom of this page.",

We were very disappointed at Labour initially trying to block the Greens from chairing the Transport Committee and we worked hard for a fair cross party agreement. Disappointingly Labour refused in the end to chair any committees when they did not have the votes to impose their preference.\nWe are grateful to the Lib Dem and Conservative groups for standing up at this meeting for a proportional distribution of scrutiny work amongst the four parties elected to the Assembly and we look forward to disagreeing sometimes on the many policy issues to come, including the Silvertown Road Tunnel, but the principle of democratic scrutiny is something we can agree on.\nHere is the press release we have issued today.\nStatement on allocation of committee chairs to the London Assembly for the year 2021-2022\nOn the 6th May Londoners elected a new London Assembly made up of eleven Labour members, down one; nine Conservative members, up one; three Green members, up one; and two Liberal Democrat members, up one.\nConservative, Green and Liberal Democrat Members have been working to secure a four party agreement for chairing the Assembly Committees, based around the proportion of seats each group has on the London Assembly. The proposal would have allowed Labour to chair five committees, the Conservatives four, Greens one and the Liberal Democrats one in the first year of this administration.\nAt the 11th hour, Labour decided to walk away from any agreement and refused to chair any Committees.\nCommenting on this:\nGreen Leader Caroline Russell AM said:\n“City Hall Greens are strong believers in proportional representation and have worked hard to achieve a fair, and proportional, arrangement for our cross-party scrutiny work on behalf of Londoners. We hope Labour will come back to the table and fully participate in Assembly work to serve the interests of Londoners.”\nLiberal Democrat Leader Caroline Pidgeon AM said:\n“It is with sadness and regret that a four-party agreement has not been reached on the allocation of Chairs of Committees based on Assembly seats.\n“Up to the eleventh hour every effort was made to reach such an agreement. I am only sorry that Labour have chosen not to join us.”\nConservative Leader Susan Hall AM said:\n“It’s disappointing that Labour Members on the London Assembly have abdicated their responsibility to hold the Mayor to account. Instead of agreeing to a fair deal on the Assembly’s committees, ensuring all Londoners’ views are represented, they’ve refused to chair a single one. It’s only been a week since the election, but they’ve already let Londoners down.”",

An added benefit would be a predicted 7.5 per cent drop in people entering the zone in cars incentivised by the higher charge.\nCaroline says:\n“The current transport charging system weighs more heavily on commuters using London trains, tubes and buses than those who use vehicles that increase air pollution and make our streets congested and unpleasant to use. This is clearly unfair.\n“In the long term, a smart road charging system would fix that and spread costs more fairly, which is why it’s so important to conduct a study looking at how it could work in London.\nCaroline Pidgeon says:\n“Cheaper fares for TfL Rail journeys that start before 7.30am will help the pockets of some of the lowest paid workers in London. It will directly help cleaners, security staff and other low paid workers who get to offices and places of work long before most other people, but can’t afford to buy upfront a monthly let alone a yearly travelcard.\n“This amendment will also help spread demand on the Tube and London Overground so reducing excessive overcrowding that is now faced by too many passengers every day.”\nWatch Caroline Russell proposing the motion here:",

If the Council is serious about tackling the climate emergency, then they should be working with residents, getting us all on board to help with the urgent work to reduce, reuse and recycle Islington’s waste.\nResponse by Cllr Caroline Russell on behalf of Islington Green Party to Islington Council’s Waste Reduction and Recycling Plan 2018 – 2022.\nIslington Green Party welcomes the opportunity to respond to this consultation.\nWe note that:\nThe Department for Food Environment & Rural Affairs released the borough recycling figures in December 2018, showing the Islington household recycling rate fell from 31.6% in 2016/17 to 29.5% in 2017/18.\nA 2004 Sustainability Review Committee report[i]shows that back in 2000, Islington recycling rates were just 3.5%. By 2004 the target was 10% with an 18% target in 2005/06 and looking further into the future the council predicted 35% by 2010 and 45% by 2015.\nIslington recycling rates have remained stubbornly stuck hovering around 30% over recent years and last year dipped below 30% again. The borough is not meeting its recycling targets, despite them being reset from the targets anticipated in 2004.\nTable to show Islington Recycling rates (assembled from multiple sources)\n| Year | Recycling rate | Target |\n| 2010/11 | 30.4% | |\n| 2014/15 | 32.8% | |\n| 2015/16 | 29.4% | 34.5% |\n| 2016/17 | 31.6% | 35.2% |\n| 2017/18 | 29.5% | 37% by 2020 |\n| 2018/19 | 36.09% |\nWe are concerned that measures outlined in the consultation are:\n- unlikely to close the gap between current recycling rates and the Mayor’s target for Islington.\n- unlikely to inspire Islington residents to reduce, reuse and recycle more\nThe consultation is 23 online pages, some of which are very long and wordy.\nThe questions asked do not lend themselves to simple agree/disagree responses.\nWe note that this consultation is running late for a plan that runs from 2018-2022 and many of the target dates, referred to in the consultation, have already passed.\nThe ‘Vision’ on page 1, makes no mention of the Climate Emergency or the important role of waste management in reducing our carbon footprint. With Islington shortly expected to declare a Climate Emergency, the importance of waste reduction and recycling in reducing carbon emissions should be acknowledged in the Vision for this Plan.\nThe report cites the need to get residents engaged with recycling, however many technical terms and jargon are used in the consultation that make the it inaccessible to residents. We recommend engaging residents with shorter more focused and plain language consultations in future. We have been contacted by highly engaged residents who have given up in despair after completing 5 or 6 pages of the online consultation.\nWe note the following technical terms/jargon which are included, without explanation, in the consultation text:\n- Circular economy p5\n- `Regulation 18’ p5\n- TriFocal p7\n- The food system p7\n- Acronyms: LWARB, RRC, NLWA, LACW p13\n- Arisings p18\n- Thermally treated (= burning?) p21\nThe following observations are based on the consultation and are ordered by Objective and referred to by page number (from the online consultation).\nObjective 1 – Drive resource efficiency to significantly reduce waste focusing on food waste and single use packaging\nPage 5. Objective 1: Drive resource efficiency to significantly reduce waste, focusing on food waste and single use packaging waste – Local policy or waste contract commitment\nThe objectives set out on page 5 seek to achieve things by a date in the past.\nThe 36.09% target for Islington for 2018/19 in support of the NLWA target of 50% recycling by 2020 is clearly unlikely to be met. There is a worrying lack of urgency about addressing the need to get our household recycling rate up from the last year’s worrying 29.5%. This should be a priority.\nThe Council needs to explain how the objectives set out on page 5 will be met and what the council will do differently from previous working practice to achieve each one.\nThe 2007 NWLA Waste Prevention Plan needs an urgent review as it has not delivered the reduction in waste that is required.\nThis page of the consultation refers to a variety of bodies, organisations, strategies and plans without adequate explanation. This purpose of this detail is unclear and makes the consultation less accessible.\nWe welcome the council developing a Circular Economy Action plan.\nQ12 asks for our views on food waste and single use packaging but neither of these are specifically mentioned in the accompanying text. Both are urgent issues and we look forward to seeing a specific plan to address these.\nFurther there is no text on the “waste contract commitment”. We are happy to respond to this once the council gives the details and we suggest that the consultation period is extended so that residents can give their views too.\nPage 6 Objective 1:Drive resource efficiency to significantly reduce waste, focusing on food waste and single use packaging waste – Core Service Provision\nIf the council is going to achieve better rates of recycling, food waste collection must be dramatically improved in all property types. Food waste recycling levels are low across the borough and there is no sense that the council wishes people to remove their food waste from the black bin collections.\nPage 7 Objective 1: Drive resource efficiency to significantly reduce waste, focusing on food waste and single use packaging waste – behaviour change activities\nWe are concerned that Islington states it is “proud of its record in reducing household waste” when targets are being consistently missed. It is essential the council recognises the poor performance in recycling over recent years in order to achieve the necessary step change in performance.\nSingle use plastic:We welcome the council’s support for the Mayor of London’s drinking water fountain scheme to reduce single use plastic bottle waste and hope to see it extended to all shopping centres and stations. It is disappointing to see no other examples where the council could be reducing single use plastics.\nWe welcome the Council’s efforts to eliminate single use plastic in council building catering. It is disappointing to see no mention of the extensive use of single use plastic items (cutlery, drinking cups etc) in the borough’s schools. If Islington is serious about plastic waste reduction, schools are a key area of focus.\nAnother area of single use plastic waste is unflushable single use nappies, wet-wipes, period products and incontinence products. There are several ways that the Council could be working to reduce this plastic waste set out in the “Unflushables”[ii]report of the London Assembly Environment Committee.\nFood waste: There is very little detail in this section.We would expect to see a comprehensive plan to engage with residents to waste less food and massively decrease the food going in black bin collection. This is crucial for reducing carbon emissions.\nReuse:Islington Council set up Bright Sparks in 2010 (not 2005 as stated). It was set up by former Cllr Katie Dawson to provide a repair service for small household electrical items (as the name, Bright Sparks, suggests!) – the kind so often discarded for want of a place to repair them. The scheme also offered training in electrical skills and employment opportunities for local young people. We are disappointed that the scheme has been significantly downgraded to a second-hand furniture service.\nWe are glad that Islington participates in the real nappy voucher scheme and would like to see it better promoted so that parents can save money and reduce their use of single use plastic disposable nappies. We would like to see figures for uptake of the scheme published annually (along with past figures) and ambitious targets set for the future.\nWe welcome reuse projects as a way for people to save money, reuse items and reduce waste going to landfill. There is no timetable for the (welcome) proposed new reuse projects on estates. This should be made available so that the council’s progress can be measured.\nCircular Economy: All the activities listed (Bright Sparks, Nappy Scheme, Composting) are things adopted by a tiny minority of the borough’s residents. What is the council proposing to do to increase take up?\nPage 8 Objective 1: Drive resource efficiency to significantly reduce waste, focusing on food waste and single use packaging waste – Expected impact towards achieving local targets\nAll three categories set targets against 2017/18 figures. ie a year when targets were missed. This is setting the bar low for 2022 and 2025 targets.\nObjective 2 – Maximise recycling rates\nPage 10 Objective 2:Maximise recycling rates –local policy or waste contract commitment\nThis page is densely written, and it is unclear what we are being asked to support/object to.\nThe inclusion of terms such as “Regulation 18” and “waste arisings” makes the consultation impenetrable for residents.\nPage 11 Objective 2:Maximise recycling rates – Core service provision\nExceeding the minimum requirements.There is no information about take up of services. Without this, it is meaningless to comment. We understand anecdotally that many schools are not recycling. Similarly, there is no information on recycling rates among faith organisations, and other groups in the borough or outreach work (if any) undertaken.\nCommercial waste recycling.\nTraders at Highbury Barn tell us that food waste recycling or even a compost bin would be a help along with a way to give usable but slightly damaged fruit or veg to people to cook with.\n“A recycling bin would be so useful as our shops put out so many cardboard and plastic boxes from our deliveries. The ones in Highbury Fields by the pool look rather nice, so shouldn’t get any complaints.”\nDisposal, treatment and waste sites.We wonder on what evidence the Council bases the statement that “Islington’s collection system maximises efficiency whilst encouraging the broadest participation in recycling”.\nIt is not clear what we are being asked to comment on in this section that sets out the waste disposal provision for the borough.\nPage 12 Objective 2: Maximise recycling rates – Behaviour change activities\nCommunicating with our residents. We welcome smart use of data to focus communications where needed. We welcome the aspiration to get residents, community groups and all council partners and staff such as caretakers involved in increasing the take up of recycling but there are no actions or dates set out. It would be useful to have a clear schedule of actions so that these can be monitored.\nPurpose built flats and Better Recycling Sites.Clearly making it easy for residents to recycle is good and its important there is regular communication about the Council’s expectations of residents. The only time related action for the council is to consult on bringing in a tenancy agreement clause about recycling by 2021. We would like to see more actions and ambitious targets with timescales for improving recycling in flats.\nAccessible recycling bins, reverse lid bins, the Trifocal food waste campaign, litter, leading by example and compulsory recycling. This section lists the Council’s recycling measures. We are not sure what we are being asked to support/object to? We welcome any measures to make recycling more accessible. We are unaware of the ways the council communicates its compulsory recycling programme to residents.\nSchools and children.We welcome that recycling is on the curriculum in schools, Children’s Centres and other settings such as Adventure Playgrounds. There is no information about performance and we would expect to see regular reporting of volumes or tonnages of recycling from these settings. In particular we would expect the school caterers to be reporting on food and non-food waste volumes and tonnages and to be reducing their use of single use plastic items. We are unsure what we are being asked to support/object to in this section.\nCommercial waste recycling. Why will it take over a year to develop new commercial waste business and communications plans?\nOverall, we are concerned at the lack of urgency to improve communications with residents to increase recycling levels. We would expect to see timed targets for actions so that progress can be monitored.\nPage 13. Objective 2: Maximise recycling rates – Expected impact towards achieving local targets\nIslington is missing its recycling targets. We should be achieving a 36% recycling rate, but rates are static at about 30%. We note the council sees resident uptake of recycling services as crucial to meeting the targets but there is no action that explains how the council will persuade residents to do this.\nWe note the council’s ambition to achieve 36% recycling by 2025 and an interim 33% in 2022. This is unambitious. We consider Islington should aim to achieve these rates faster so the borough plays its part in reducing London’s carbon emissions due to waste management.\nWe note that the borough plans to work with LWARB to set targets beyond 2025 but that there is no action towards this at present.\nWe note that the Mayor’s study suggests Islington’s recycling rate could be 41% if the council moved to weekly food waste and recycling collections with fortnightly residual (black bin) collections.\nIf the council’s efforts to improve communication with residents do not boost recycling rates significantly, then the council should move to weekly food waste and recycling collections with fortnightly collection for the few items that cannot be recycled.\nObjective 3: Reduce the environmental impact of waste activities\nPage 15 Objective 3 – Reduce the environmental impact of waste activities local policy or waste contract commitment\nCompliance with the Mayor’s Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) is essential. The consultation does not include detail of the vehicle procurement strategy, but this should include compliance with the ULEZ at the earliest possible time.\nPage 16 Objective 3: Reduce the environmental impact of waste activities – core service provision\nWe welcome plans to cut diesel use and electrify the waste fleets of Islington Council and the NWLA.\nWe hope that Islington will resist any plans at the NWLA Edmonton site, including building on the riverside wharf area, that would prevent water being used as means of transport in future.\nPage 17. Objective 3: Reduce the environmental impact of waste activities –Behaviour change activities\nEmissions Performance Standard\nWe welcome the use of Environmental Performance Standards (EPS) to measure carbon emissions alongside the weight-based targets for recycling. We also welcome the ways the council plans to reduce its EPS, but would like to see a baseline and target so progress can be measured.\nWe are, however, very concerned that the NWLA will be continuing to operate an incinerator and expect the council to aim to minimise waste from Islington that is burned.\nFleet\nWe note the council has achieved bronze FORS membership. We would expect a target date for Silver FORS membership to be achieved and for the council to look at behaviour change in driving style, not only to reduce road danger, but also to reduce fuel use with smooth steady driving.\nPage 18. Objective 3: Reduce the environmental impact of waste activities – Expected impact towards achieving local targets\nWe note that the EPS target will only be set once the commercial waste recycling rate has been set. We would like to see a date for this, to help with tracking progress.\nThe targets for 2021/22 relate to a baseline 2017/18 where targets were missed. This is unambitious.\nWe are unable to comment on the food waste tonnage increases as there is no baseline to compare to.\nThe targets for 2025/26 are unclear about whether the 700 tonne food waste increase is on top of the 700 tonne increase to 2021/22. This should be clear to aid tracking. There is insufficient information provided to say whether the percentage increases in materials collected are ambitious enough.\nObjective 4: Maximise local waste sites and ensure London has sufficient infrastructure to manage all the waste it produces\nPage 21 Objective 4: Maximise local waste sites and ensure London has sufficient infrastructure to manage all the waste it produces – Core service provision\nWe are concerned that there is no anaerobic digestion for food waste. We are also concerned that the incinerator capacity for burning waste is a disincentive to maximising recycling levels and risks materials that could be reused or recycled being burned unnecessarily.\nWe prefer to see plain language used in consultations. “thermal treating” in the first paragraph on page 21 presumably means “burning”. If we want residents and businesses to understand what is happening to our waste that does not get recycled, it is helpful to use plain language.\nPage 22 Objective 4: Maximise local waste sites and ensure London has sufficient infrastructure to manage all the waste it produces – behaviour change activities\nThe Wise Up to Waste website looks interesting but we are not sure how well known it is. Perhaps the Council could do more to make residents aware it exists?\nPage 23 Objective 4: Maximise local waste sites and ensure London has sufficient infrastructure to manage all the waste it produces – Expected impact towards achieving local targets\nThe only question in this section is about “RRC performance”. There is insufficient information to judge whether the RRC recycling rates are ambitious enough. We understand that this consultation is directed at residents. RRC is not an acronym that people use in everyday life. We suggest that acronyms are not used in future consultations.\n[i]https://democracy.islington.gov.uk/Data/Executive/200410071930/Agenda/$Recycling%20-%20Draft%204.doc.pdf\n[ii]https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/environment_committee_-_plastic_unflushables_0.pdf",

I’m a transport campaigner and the Green Party’s National Spokesperson on Local Transport. Beyond politics, I’ve been an artist, I’m a trained civil engineer and I’ve brought up three children.\nAs a transport campaigner I have a clear vision for the radical action that is needed to reduce danger on our streets, clean up our air and make London a more liveable and healthy city. Transport is one of the Mayor’s main powers and I would be well placed to hold whoever is Mayor to account.\nBoth as a councillor and as a national spokesperson for the Party, I’m used to speaking in public, getting our message out to the press and doing interviews for radio and television.\nAs an Assembly member I would draw directly on my work as sole opposition councillor in Islington where I’ve gained valuable experience at holding the lead group to account, bringing community into the Town Hall and making a difference to people’s lives.\nI’ve learnt to use the scrutiny process to stand up for residents, hearing concerns, identifying opportunities and getting positive outcomes. In the last year, I’ve supported Greenspace workers on agency contracts to get permanent status, stood up for residents facing unfair charging for communal heating systems and helped Islington Park St residents facing eviction by One Housing Group.\nI stood in Islington North in the General election, trebling our share of the vote to 10.2%. It was the sixteenth best result in the country and achieved without national party target status. We did this by organising and engaging new teams across multiple wards, building on local enthusiasm and community links and delivering targeted communications to more voters than ever before.\nMy election to Islington Council in 2014, in a breakthrough ward, was by just eight votes. I know that every vote counts and that we have to earn the trust of voters across London. This means appealing to Londoners across our city with a positive vision that can include voters who have voted for other parties in the past. If we are going to get Greens in to City Hall, we must inspire voters of all backgrounds that Green Party leadership can make London a better city.\nI believe I am ready and able to use all these skills at a London level. A new team in City Hall should build on the achievements of Jenny Jones and Darren Johnson over their 16 year tenure and find new ways to use our elected voices to champion local campaigns and concerns of people across London.",

These people include children unable to concentrate in school, residents whose sleep is routinely disturbed and who have to choose between sweltering with the windows closed or being deafened by aircraft noise in the hot summer months.\nA third runway at Heathrow would also mean London failing to meet its air pollution targets, both from increased aircraft movements and the associated congestion of more traffic around the airport.\nAnd besides all the good reasons above, the UK’s carbon emissions targets would also be seriously undermined by a third runway which would take us in the wrong direction on our carbon reduction journey.\nExpanding aviation is, without doubt, utterly incompatible with tackling the climate emergency.\nI will continue to resist Heathrow’s efforts to prioritise the interests of the airline industry over the health and wellbeing of Londoners and the well being of our planet.\nYou can read my official response on behalf of the Environment Committee and the London Assembly’s press release for further details.",

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2019_02_2114-2/content_76.html": "Respecting our right of way, why EV charging points need more thought\nThere’s a new tension in London between the future of vehicle travel and people on the pavements – as infrastructure for electric vehicles muscles in on space meant for pedestrians.\nCouncils excitedly preparing for e-vehicles are whacking up charging points without pausing to think. A number of Londoners have contacted me to express concerns over their pavements becoming a slalom, as new EV charging points and their electricity supply pillars are blocking wheelchairs, prams and putting new obstacles in the way of people with limited vision or mobility as trailing wires snake over the footway.\nIn my home borough of Islington lots of new charging points have popped up, including some that taper the pavement to an uncomfortably narrow squeeze. In one case the luridly bright green light on top of the charging post shone directly into someone’s home and the whole structure emitted a noisy electric hum. Ultimately the only fix was to take out the charging point completely.\nPlacing charging points on the pavement is much easier legally, and operationally, for councils than placing them on the road where they could more easily serve their purpose of charging cars. But why should people give up their public pavement space for infrastructure designed for fuelling private vehicles and run by private companies?\nCouncils just aren’t thinking about public purpose in their eagerness to grant permissions to companies installing EV charging points.\nI am concerned that a lack of standards and requirements from the Mayor of London, TfL and London boroughs has let companies and boroughs be too lax in the design of charging points.\nAfter I asked a series of questions in the Assembly last year, Transport for London committed to providing up-to-date guidance where presently there is effectively none. I am still waiting for this to be published, it was promised early this year, and I would like to remind Transport for London of what suitable guidance must do.\nFirstly, guidance needs to protect and respect existing users of pavements. The most straightforward way to do this is simply not to place charging points on the footway, but instead in space already designated for car use, on a pavement build out in a parking bay. This could even provide an informal crossing point where people can stand to see and be seen by on-coming traffic when crossing the road.\nSecondly, consideration has to be given to other impacts of charging points. There should be clear guidance that no noticeable noise or light should reach into people’s homes.\nAnd finally, it is important that there should be some form of compulsory consultation around the installation of charging points. At the moment this doesn’t exist which is wrong. Planning officers should respect the reality that installing chargers is changing where people live and work. It is important that they should have the ability to comment and suggest improvements or alternatives to planned charger installations.\nWhen the Mayor finally has some guidance on installing electric vehicle chargers, in ways that don’t disadvantage Londoners who walk, I will gladly support the roll out of a much wider and more comprehensive network of charging points.",

But there’s still so much more for him to do to reduce danger and improve the working conditions of people trusted with driving huge double decker buses along our city’s streets.\nWith yesterday’s report on bus driver fatigue from Loughborough University the Mayor now has ample evidence, that safety is affected by fatigue and that fatigue is a widespread problem for bus drivers. It can be caused by shift patterns, sleep quality, health, work culture and the stress and mental load of driving a bus in busy London streets.\nThe solutions are things we’ve all called for for years. Toilets and rest places for bus drivers – I’ve been pressing the Mayor and TfL to provide toilets for bus drivers and to do some decent research since I arrived here in City Hall in 2016.\nDrivers need good quality vehicles, that aren’t too hot to drive or ride in, a fair driver schedule, with a rota that recognises the pressures on drivers’ lives. If TfL and the bus operators can create an open work culture, where admitting to needing help with fatigue is not a weakness, but a strength then they will properly create conditions to support the overall health and well-being of bus drivers.\nSo, now we’ve got ample evidence, in this new research, of the scale of the issues bus drivers face that lead to fatigue and affect safety, the Mayor needs to get on with delivering. Delivering more toilets for bus drivers, making buses safe and comfortable environments for drivers even when it gets hot, providing spaces for rest, putting in place rotas that are fair, getting that open work culture and making it healthy. And all of that backed up by a wage that lets people earn a decent living for delivering a valued public service.\nI will keep pressing the Mayor on these important issues that affect the well-being of drivers and the safety of Londoners.",

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_what-does-social-distancing-mean-for-public-transport/content_159.html": "What does social distancing mean for public transport?\nI clearly remember my last unsettling Tube journey from City Hall in mid-March as we stopped working in the office and the country went into lockdown. I tried not to touch anything, kept my distance from people and immediately washed my hands when I got in the door.\nWhat huge changes we have all experienced since then, with many of us furloughed or setting up offices in our homes, while juggling home schooling and shopping for older or shielding relatives. This sudden localisation of our lives has resulted in passenger numbers plunging by 95 per cent on the Tube and by 85 per cent on buses, causing a catastrophic drop in Transport for London’s (TfL) income, bringing it to the verge of bankruptcy. TfL is the only transport body in the world that relies on fares income alone, as the Government stopped its £700m annual subsidy in 2018.\nSafe social distancing means London’s buses and Tube can only take about 15 per cent of the usual number of passengers, so the loss of income is a factor for the foreseeable future. In practice, this means double-decker buses carrying 20 customers and single-deckers between six and 10. In rush hour on the Tube just 50,000 people can board every 15 minutes instead of the usual 320,000. This means we need to reduce our need to travel and quickly rethink our streets so as many people as possible can get around safely by foot, bike, scooter or mobility aid.\nThe Government’s £1.6bn bailout for TfL included punitive charges for Londoners, particularly for older and younger people, by removing free travel for them during peak hours. It is entirely right that we all try not to travel during peak hours as these times should be prioritised for key workers. But as many supermarkets were offering special hours for older and disabled customers in the early morning, I wrote to Deputy Mayor Heidi Alexander raising my concerns around these changes. I am pleased to see that TfL is working with supermarkets to make it convenient for older people to shop outside the morning peak hours to coincide with access to free bus travel. Heidi Alexander has also told me she will push the NHS to give older people appointments at the same times.\nStopping free travel for under-18s is more complicated as the Government itself provides a range of free transport measures for that group depending on age, distance from school, income or special educational need. London council leaders have written to Grant Shapps asking him to rethink this decision, as they calculate it will cost them over £16million a year to provide the free travel instead of TfL. This extra cost is one that councils can ill afford as they already facing a huge drop in income as well as increased demand for their services due to coronavirus.\nWe cannot all start travelling again like we did before the lockdown. Our top priority must be reducing the need to travel in the first place, with those of us who are able working and staying at home to save lives and protect the NHS. Our high streets and local shops need to be reconfigured so our essential stores – chemist, newsagent, hardware and food – are within 15 minutes reach on foot. The limited road space available must be prioritised for walking and cycling, journeys by disabled people, NHS staff and key workers using buses and cars, as well as for deliveries of the goods on which we all depend.",
  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2015_08_10-for-2020-will-help-all-londoners/content_239.html": "10 by 2020 will help all Londoners\nThe [Ten Point Mayoral Safer Cycling Challenge](http://stopkillingcyclists.org/2015/08/03/press), launched today by campaign group Stop Killing Cyclists is a blueprint for making London a better city for all residents not just those who get about on a bike.\nI think it’s great and here are my responses to the ten points in the plan:\n1. 10% by 2020\n10% of the TfL budget on making streets more people friendly yes. Cycle infrastructure can make streets better for all residents and any cycle infrastructure improvements must include measures to make life better for people walking too.\n2. End HGV/bus blind spot\nTechnology is changing fast. If elected Mayor I would ensure that all high cab vehicles were fitted with the latest safety equipment to minimise blind spots and enable drivers to see people on bikes and on foot. I’d also insist on all TfL procured projects specifying low cab (like dustbin lorry) vehicles.\n3. Mini Hollands for all\nI would want every borough to benefit from more people friendly streets. Enabling all boroughs to bring in Mini-Holland thinking and principles would be an absolute priority. It’s not just about mini holland schemes, all road spending should ensure active travel is the most safe and convenient means to get around.\n4. Physically protected cycle lanes\nVisiting cities like Copenhagen, it is striking how people on bikes are not just the fit and the young. London needs to make cycling normal for everyone from 3 – 103 years old. And that means radically changing the way we use our street space, providing protected cycle routes that make journeys by bike easy, safe and a pleasure.\n5. London 20MPH zone\nI was part of the Living Streets London Action Group team that came up with the case for #Cityof20 – 20mph on main roads where people live, work and shop. I was proud to have influenced the decision to bring in 20mph on all main roads in Islington. 20mph is not going to redesign our streets but it will reduce danger and make our streets less traffic dominated. So, yes.\n6. Safer left hand turns: emergency programme + Idaho law\nAllowing people on bikes to turn left turn against a red light at junctions (Idaho law) when there are no pedestrians crossing would help cyclists to get away from the lights (and danger from other vehicles). However it relies on people being considerate to pedestrians. I’d prefer to prioritise the redesign of junctions to design out left hook danger, but recognise that we may need an Idaho law solution as an interim measure as TfL are working through the list of junctions quite slowly.\n7. End lethal time pressures on buses/tipper trucks.\nNo vehicle driven commercially in London should have a time penalty built in to the driver’s pay or the performance monitoring of the company that owns the vehicle. Further, all drivers should have access to Confidential Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS) which is standard across the railways and has been introduced to the London bus network today. This will help identify and eliminate systemic risk on our roads as has been done so effectively on the rail network.\n8. Squares and streets fit for humans\nRemoving traffic from some of London’s streets is essential to make London a great city to live in, to work in and to visit. I still remember the excitement of the major West End street closures for the art event the Sultan’s Elephant nine years ago. We can do street closures and the world doesn’t stop turning. Imagine Parliament Square with less traffic. Of course the Mayor of London should enable the creative use of streets with closures on both a temporary and a permanent basis. I would support traffic removal on the full list of streets: Oxford St, Trafalgar Sq, Piccadilly, Parliament Sq, and Bank Junction.\n9. Two TfL board places for cyclists\nI’d want to see people representing all transport areas on the TfL board. So advocates for walking and cycling should definitely by represented. I would not change the name of TfL to the “London Cycling, Walking and Transport Authority”. I might however change it to “Transport for Londoners” – but to be honest that would not be a priority, I’d prefer to get the wider representation on the board rather than spending money on changing the stationery.\n10. Tipper truck ban\nI fully support a rush hour ban on tipper trucks and HGVs. It is extraordinary that we allow massive delivery lorries in to central London on streets crowded with people making their way to work, school or the shops. I would definitely support freight consolidation, electric delivery trucks and cargo bike deliveries as these would reduce road danger and clean up our air making London a better place to live.\nThis ambitious plan is just what is needed to tackle some of the big issues facing our city. Congestion, pollution, road death, serious injury, obesity, lung and heart health problems, struggling high streets and lack of capacity on public transport are all issues that the Mayor of London can address effectively using mayoral power to set the strategic direction for transport planning through Transport for London. This plan will make London a better place to live whether we travel on foot, by bike, by public transport or in a car or van.\nIf selected as the Green’s Mayoral candidate or as a candidate for the London Assembly list, I will champion the points in this plan as a way to make London’s streets fit for all Londoners.\nNote 1. Title updated to “10 by 2020” from “10 for 2020” which was taken from a Stop Killing Cyclists Facebook post this morning.\nNote 2. Item 8 updated as it was apparently unclear that I fully support it. 4/8/15",

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2021_03_highbury-corner-investment-needs-to-count/content_78.html": "Highbury Corner investment needs to count\nHighbury Corner has been a building site for years as the bridge under the road was repaired and then the Mayor’s junction safety scheme was installed. The aim was to make a traffic heavy junction safer for people walking and cycling, which has mostly been achieved but there are still a lot of teething problems more than a year on.\nThe most visible problem is the Highbury Corner puddle also known as the boating lake or skating rink running the length of the pedestrianised arm of the junction. I’ve seen Torvill and Dean photoshopped on the frozen puddle on Twitter in winter and last week someone posted a radio operated boat buzzing busily across the water.\nI’ve gone back to check photos taken when I inspected the work site as Highbury Corner was being transformed and I’m now pretty certain that the new Sustainable Drainage System (or SUDs) that went in is not working – the puddle is directly above where it was installed.\nMy inbox has been full of concerns about the puddle. I’ve raised it at every level – with Transport for London (TfL), making a site visit with an engineer and even with the Mayor at Mayor’s Question-time – TfL insist this is some other drainage issue.\nThey have tried repeated jetting of the existing drain to make it work, but this has proved unsuccessful. TfL have now said:\n“We are to clear the drainage grates around the tree pits again and install a length of drain to try and increase the capability and capacity of the water to drain in to the SUDS. We are aiming to complete this before close of contract on 31 March. We will then have to monitor to see if that has rectified the issue, if not we of course continue our investigations.”\nThe drainage must work properly so that the new public space is fully available and so people don’t risk getting wet feet walking through the space or slipping on the ice when the puddle freezes.\nTraffic at Highbury Corner has remained stubbornly high. I am hopeful that wider measures across the area will reduce traffic in time, but I have asked TfL to look again at how they can prioritise buses and use enforcement to stop impatient drivers blocking the junction. All too often one drivers’ impatience can lead to queues that block the junction meaning it works less well for everyone. It’s not fair that people walking and cycling wait for safe passage only to have it blocked by a queuing vehicle, or even to have a driver moving across their green signal. Equally, it’s not fair to people on the bus or in cars to be waiting extra time to get through the junction because of the impatience of others.\nTfL have not been able to offer a solution to these issues, but they are looking at the potential for changes in road markings and examining the possibility of more enforcement activity.\nTfL needs to be much smarter about how they combine their work on junctions with the effects of apps like Waze or Google Maps. When observing the junction, I’ve noticed that traffic queues fluctuate between Upper Street and Canonbury Road, the arms from the south – and given the number of drivers who seem to be looking at phones I wonder how many are being redirected by a GPS in their car faster than the Scoot (smart) signals system at the junction can react to the changes in the queues.\nIn addition, if I use an app like CityMapper or Google Maps to get a cycle route from my home in Highbury to City Hall I am directed to cycle through the pedestrianised space. I told TfL about this issue months ago, and they say they will eventually update some signage, but I think they need to ensure data provided to these firms by TfL stops this from happening. I totally sympathise with the many older and disabled people who have contacted me about this, but until TfL tackle the mapping apps directing people to cycle through the pedestrian space, it is very hard to sort this out.\nHighbury Corner’s transformation has been years in the making. It represents a huge investment in making Highbury Corner a safer and more people focussed place – the Mayor and TfL are not looking after that investment or yet making it count. They need to show they care it works in practice.",

In particular there is an event in Parliament Square from 11.00 – 2.00.\nYou may have seen coverage in the national press over the weekend as schoolchildren prepare to take part in the first nationwide Youth Strike 4 Climate, with events planned in over 40 towns and cities across the country.\nThe strike is inspired by the actions of 16 year old Greta Thumberg in Sweden, which have resulted in up to 70,000 schoolchildren in 270 towns and cities worldwide taking part in ‘Fridays For Future’. Young people from Brisbane to Brussels are demanding that politicians take action to confront the Climate Emergency.\nThe United Nations IPCC report, late last year, made it clear that we have only 12 years left to limit global warming to a rise of only 1.5 degrees Celsius, the guardrail temperature after which catastrophic climate change impacts are inevitable. Here in London we will see the effects of climate change in increased flood risk, overheating of homes in summer along with the risk of wild fires like the fire on Wanstead Flats in 2018 which threatened to burn down a petrol station and was the biggest wildfire since the formation of the London Fire Brigade.\nI appreciate this action provides a dilemma for Head Teachers (set out in the Guardian over the weekend). I also anticipate schools will encounter young people asking about the Youth Strike 4 Climate, so I’m writing in the hope that the council can carefully consider any pupil absences as a result of their climate strike action and take into account the exceptional circumstances and the positive learning experience from their citizens’ action and political participation.\nThe front page of the Sunday Express (10.2.19) “Head Teachers Support Pupil Strike” quotes a spokesperson from the National Head Teachers Association (NAHT) as showing support for the strike, stating “When you get older pupils making an informed decision, that kind of thing needs to be applauded.

That’s the verdict from Caroline Russell AM following her questioning of the Mayor today.\nCaroline took the opportunity of the first Mayor’s Question Time to be held in the new City Hall to ask the Mayor about the lack of progress on his London Drugs Commission, initially announced in Spring last year in his manifesto.\nBut since that date there has been very little progress from the Mayor, with the mention of his drugs commission in the draft police and Crime plan, published for consultation in November, being taken word for word from his manifesto. [1]\nThe Mayor told Caroline today that he’d be “disappointed if I couldn’t give you more news about the drugs commission over the next couple of months”.\nGreen Party London Assembly Member Caroline Russell said:\n“The cannabis diversion trials that were reported in the media earlier this month are exactly the kind of evidence led approach London should be taking to policing drugs.\n“The macho crackdown policing comms we’ve seen such as the police stopping and swabbing people for drugs when entering clubs in Shoreditch, is not the approach London should be taking if we are serious about reducing drug harms. [2]\nDrugs policing in London needs a serious harm reduction plan and not flashy media stunts; the Mayor needs to launch his London Drugs Commission as soon as possible.”\n[1] The reference to the London Drugs Commission in the Draft Police and Crime plan is taken word for word from his manifesto.

  "http_www_caroline-russell_london_/http_www_caroline-russell_london_2019_07_green-victory-on-safer-streets-but-only-for-some/content_31.html": "20mph victory on safer streets – but only for some\nGreens and road safety campaigners, who have been fighting for lower speed limits for many years, have won a major victory with the announcement by Transport for London (TfL) of proposals that will see all roads under their control within the Congestion Charge zone designated as having a 20mph speed limit by May 2020. TfL are currently consulting on these plans. Make sure you have your say and tell the Mayor what you think.\nElected Greens on local councils were the first to convince their boroughs to adopt blanket 20mph speed limits – starting with Islington in 2009 – in a bid to save lives and make their streets more people-friendly.\nThis lead has since been followed by many other London councils. However, outer London has largely been excluded from these schemes and people in these areas still suffer some of the most dangerous, hostile and unpleasant roads in our city.\nMy report for the London Assembly Transport Committee, Hostile Streets: walking and cycling at outer London junctions, highlighted the plight of Londoners forced to pit themselves against thundering traffic in order to walk to the shops or cross the road to go to school. People, such as those who live along the A4 in Brentford, whose lives would be improved immeasurably by the simple act of slowing down the traffic.\nWith these very people in mind I brought a motion to the Assembly last year asking the Mayor to extend 20mph limits to outer London anywhere that there is a pavement and where people walk. Sadly, the Labour and Conservative groups chose not to support this motion, so our fight for Londoners who live in these areas to enjoy more people-friendly streets continues.\nIt is great news that TfL and the Mayor are finally accepting the benefits of 20mph streets for central London, but we need to look beyond the Congestion Charge zone to where most people live and where so many lives are blighted by fast, dangerous, polluting traffic.\nThe widespread misconception that 20 mph limits will slow down our city, has been rejected by TfL officers who have shown me clear evidence that 20mph limits do not increase journey time, and, by evening out the traffic, may actually improve the reliability of vehicle trips.\nThe Mayor’s ‘Vision Zero’ policy aims for zero casualties on our roads. That’s more than 2,000 fewer crashes that kill and injure Londoners in a typical year.\nIn addition, he is committed to cleaning up our air. If the Mayor is going to meet his target to get 80% of us walking, cycling or taking the bus every day, he will need a major shift away from car and private vehicle use. And that means making sure that roads across our city feel like places where it is safe and a pleasure to walk or cycle. Slower speeds and considerate driver behaviour will be fundamental to achieving that.\nThe Mayor has already committed in his transport strategy to introduce lower speed limits in London. Making 20mph the default speed limit on all TfL roads, including in outer London, where there is a pavement and people walk would transform our city.\nYou never stop grieving for a lost friend or family member and we should make sure that the way we manage speed on our roads is a tribute to every Londoner who has been killed or injured while walking or cycling in our city.",

In the last three years alone some 35 people have been killed or seriously injured on these roads, almost all of whom were pedestrians or cyclists.\nNew pedestrian crossings, upgraded junctions and a fully protected cycleway are some of the measures proposed by the scheme that will help reduce collisions and make this area safer and more pleasant for all road users.\nMore schemes like this, which can help decarbonise the transport system, are urgently needed if London is not only to create healthier, safer streets, but also to respond adequately to the climate emergency.\nThe consultation closes on 16 June 2019, so visit the TfL consultations website here to have your say.\nYou can see my response to the consultation below or here.\n“Dear Sadiq,\nI welcome the opportunity to respond to the consultation on your proposed improvements between Wood Lane and Notting Hill Gate.\nYour Healthy Streets and wider walking and cycling programmes are civilising London. Simple changes, like making it easier to cross the road with new crossings and providing safe space to cycle, allow more people to travel actively and improve their own health. The best solution to congested and polluted roads is to enable more people to walk and cycle.\nThe current layouts of Notting Hill Gate, Holland Park Avenue, Holland Park Roundabout, Shepherd’s Bush Green and Wood Lane pose a danger to people walking and cycling. In the last three years there have been 35 people killed or seriously injured on these streets, three quarters of whom were walking or cycling. I fully support your commitment to Vision Zero and am glad to see you tackling road danger with this scheme.\nThe proposed scheme reduces the risks of serious and fatal collisions throughout the area. Twelve upgraded junctions, 15 new pedestrian crossings, 19 upgraded crossings and a fully protected cycleway will keep people safe and make a real difference to Londoners everyday journeys in west London.\nThe death of Eilidh Cairns in 2009 at Notting Hill Gate, was one of the avoidable tragedies that has stayed with me as I’ve campaigned to reduce danger on London’s streets. It was Kate Cairns, Eilidh’s sister, who along with Roadpeace, led the campaigning to bring about the Direct Vision Standard in HGVs, a measure you have rightly prioritised.\nIt is important as the road layout is reworked that you do find an appropriate new location for the white bike memorial to Eilidh Cairns, in discussions with her family. I am happy to help facilitate any contact to assist in that.\nThe evidence on the gains to business from enabling more walking and cycling are striking. Living Streets’ pioneering work with the Pedestrian Pound report and TfL’s work since have highlighted the untapped and underestimated potential of healthy streets schemes for local business. I can see from the plans that you have helpfully retained loading and parking for local businesses. It would be great to see as much cycle parking, for cycles of all sizes, including cargo bikes for families and businesses to get the greatest gains from these proposals.\nI have heard the concerns of residents on the loss of trees and have discussed the changes with your walking and cycling commissioner, Will Norman. I understand that when making space for safe walking and cycling there can be a need to remove, replace and sometimes re-site trees. There are trees in the central reservation that will be removed, these are not given much space and don’t provide much useful shelter given their position. It is important for the new trees added with the scheme to be in greater number, and to be of a diverse range of appropriate species that can grow to the same size as the valued London Planes nearby.\nI appreciate the concerns about losing two mature plane trees where Ladbroke Grove meets Holland Park Avenue. This is a section where the road is wider for a junction, so perhaps a banned turn could save these trees. Any reallocation of road space to prioritise people walking and cycling involves trade-offs. I expect residents will be clear whether they would prefer to retain the two mature trees or retain the right turn.\nIt is disappointing that at the eastern end there will not be continuity into central London with a protected cycle route on main roads. I hope that the success of this scheme will encourage support from others for a fuller network.\nI am pleased to support these proposals and encourage you to go further and faster in providing healthy streets across London, tackling the hostile streets and dangerous junctions that Londoners face in their daily journeys. This work is particularly urgent as London responds to the climate emergency and decarbonises the transport system.\nYours sincerely,\nCaroline Russell\nGreen Party Member of the London Assembly”"
