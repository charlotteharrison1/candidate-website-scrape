All in order to elevate and progress as a nation.\nI support values based Conservative leadership and base all my policy ideas through this lens. It starts with the premise that in order to develop as a nation we must first have a system of order in which we can live our lives which has a basic set of rules, otherwise anarchy persists (Rule of Law). Within this, in in order to feel a complete sense of wellbeing, and to lift ourselves and others we must strive to contribute outside our own wants (Public Service) for the benefit of others (Society & Family). Our country is shaped by us and we are shaped by what our country provides for us in terms of resources, support and guidance; persistent, reliable organisations who outlast temporal governments achieve this – providing stability (Institutions). Uniquely, at the national level we are a team, allowing a breath of diversity that creates a drive to progress (The Union). Underpinning it all is a sense of belonging and buy in to the direction of the country. A shared sense of purpose and participation (Democracy). All this shaped by common backgrounds, language, culture and experience (History). Only with a values based system do we shake of the temporary nature of our politics where quick wins lead to quick losses and ideology rules supreme – for a short time. Values equal long lasting success, elevating the condition of the people and leaving no one behind.",

  "https_www_edmcguinness_org_uk_/https_www_edmcguinness_org_uk_about-ed/content_12.html": "Ed McGuinness grew up in Belfast in the 1990s and early 2000s during the transition from the Troubles to a lasting, but vulnerable peace. It was during this time he realised the value politicians can make to a country and community. When he was young, Conservative values of hard work and public service were instilled in him notably by his mother and father; a teacher and an accountant respectively, who gave a strong sense of family and community.\nEd studied Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, in Scotland and he commissioned into the Territorial Army (now known as the Reserves) in 2010. Following graduation, Ed was selected to attend the prestigious Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and commissioned as a regular British Army officer, in August 2012.\nDuring his six years in the Royal Artillery, Ed deployed to Afghanistan in 2014, running intelligence gathering operations to secure the withdrawal of British Forces from Helmand. Following this he went on to lead teams in Kenya and Canada. Ed finished his regular military service in 2018 as a Forward Air Controller, leading a team of specialist soldiers to co-ordinate the airspace in a highly pressured environment – a role he considers a highlight of his career. Speaking of his military career Ed says, “leading the fine men and women of the British Army was a true privilege, I learned so much from them and their capacity for selflessness is astonishing. It has shaped who I am today.”\nIn February 2018 Ed began to work for a leading, global financial services company. Ed also became active in his local Conservative Federation. Quickly taking on the role of Deputy Chair (Political), Ed also ran elections and became a Chairman of his local Conservative Association. During this tenure Ed was a passionate advocate of his local area and was a school governor.\nIn June 2024 Ed was selected as the Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Surrey Heath. Ed is a director of Conservative Friends of the Armed Forces (championing Armed Forces and service in the Party) and was, until very recently, Chairman of the International Cultural Youth Exchange - UK charity (bringing volunteers from all over the world to experience the values and culture of the UK).\nIn his spare time Ed likes SCUBA diving, running and making models of aircraft (when he is allowed to by his less than enthusiastic fiancé!)",

To have played a small part in securing its future is amazing but YOU have secured your own future healthcare moving forward.\nI will be closing the petition in due course and collating the results of the survey but can I just say THANK YOU once again to you all for your support.\nSpecial thanks to BBC Surrey & Surrey Live for letting me speak about the petition at length, as well as councillors who supported (especially Trefor Hogg in his role chairing the Joint Health and Overview Scrutiny Committee (Frimley Park Hospital)) and Surrey MPs.",

  "https_www_edmcguinness_org_uk_/https_www_edmcguinness_org_uk_news_my-letter-chancellor-urging-her-reverse-vat-imposition-independent-schools/content_7.html": "Rt Hon Rachel Reeves MP\nChancellor of the Exchequer\nHM Treasury\n1 Horse Guards Rd\nLONDON\nSW1A 2HQ\nCopy: Rt Hon Bridget Phillipson MP, Secretary of State for Education, Rt Hon John Healey MP, Secretary of State for Defence\n24 September 2024\nRECONSIDER IMPOSING VAT ON INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS\nDear Chancellor,\nI am writing to urge you to reconsider your proposals to impose Value Added Tax (VAT) on Independent Schools.\nI understand this is a cornerstone of the Labour Party manifesto and government – as outlined in your Conference Speech on 23 September 2024. I seek not to rehash arguments about class warfare, whether the funding raised will be enough to spend on your commitments or discussions about school standards. All of your which, incidentally, I find myself in opposition to the Labour Government on.\nInstead, I write with a specific and targeted argument about the impact on children and families of Service Personnel. As you will be aware, Military Families can claim the Continuity of Education Allowance (CEA - an allowance for their children to attend Independent Schools at a subsidised rate). This enables children to have high quality, undisrupted education as their parent(s) can be deployed overseas or posted across the country.\nThe imposition of VAT on Independent Schools without an exemption for children of Service Personnel could make the CEA unfit for purpose, damage children’s education and put undue financial pressure on Military Families. In Surrey Heath we have a proud military tradition with numerous families taking advantage of the CEA and therefore this is of utmost priority to our constituents who make many sacrifices for this country.\nThere will be a number of special interest groups writing to you for specific carve outs – another that I support is for SEN schools and children to be exempt from this punitive policy. Broadly I believe this is illustrative of the abject failure and unfairness of this policy, before it is even implemented. As a result I believe the only fair way to proceed is to scrap the policy entirely.\nI urge you, and colleagues, to reassess, reconsider and reverse this damaging policy which is will have an outsized impact on those who sacrifice so much for the UK already.\nYours sincerely,\nEd McGuinness\nCampaigner",

Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data.

Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA).

Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10.

Any third parties that we may share your data with are obliged to keep your details securely, and to use them only for the basis upon which they were originally intended.\nWe may need to share your data with a third party, such as the police, if required to do so by law.\nUnless otherwise specified, data may also be shared with entities of Political Party associations, federations, branches, groups and affiliates in order to assist you or maintain contact with you in support of democratic engagement.\nCasework and other submissions from the Contact form are sent directly to their destination. The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11.
