Our community has a proud heritage, built on hard work and resilience, and I will strive to give us a future we can be just as proud of. That means rejuvenating our local economy, protecting our children in an increasingly online world, supporting families who care for loved ones with Special Education Needs and Disabilities, and ensuring everyone has access to the services they deserve.\nService has defined my life. For over two decades, I’ve worked to tackle poverty and lead in international crises. I’ve never shied away from tough fights. Today, I bring that tenacity to Westminster, driven by the stories of the people I represent. Real change isn’t just a promise; it’s the work we’re doing now, together, to build a better future.\nContact me:\nIf you are a constituent and want to get in touch about a problem I may be able to help you with, or have a question about a policy issue, please feel free to get in touch by email at [email protected] or send a message on Facebook.",
