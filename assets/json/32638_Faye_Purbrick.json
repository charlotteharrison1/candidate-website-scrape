One that is causing much concern is the closure of recycling centres. Castle Cary (Dimmer) Recycling Centre is on the chopping block and local Conservative MP candidate Faye Purbrick is arguing against the cut.\n“Closure of such a key facility for the community seems madness. If residents can’t take their waste to their local centre, more and more things that could easily be recycled are bound to end up in black bins. The council will need to dispose of that waste which will cost more, alongside more trips by rubbish lorries as they fill more quickly with items that should be recycled, not scrapped.”\n“This is before you even start thinking about the inevitable increase in fly-tipping, which will disproportionately effect our rural communities and cost the council more to clear and dispose of”.\nLocal councillor, representing the Wincanton and Bruton ward, Tom Power added: “I have never been contacted by so many residents about the same issue. Many are concerned, some are angry. I hear comments like, ‘we are encouraged to recycle our rubbish and garden waste and now we having to possibly drive miles across Somerset to do so, it’s completely shameful.’ Tom continues, “fly-tipping is a real concern, people are worried that it will just be left and not a priority for the council, I really hope they see sense and reverse this cut.”\nFaye has launched a local survey. Tell her your concerns, are you against the closure and Lib Dem cuts? Have your say so we can deliver the message that this cut is the wrong choice.",

  "https_www_fayepurbrick_uk_/https_www_fayepurbrick_uk_news_positive-reforms-support-small-businesses-and-apprenticeships/content_21.html": "Faye Purbrick, MP Candidate for the new Glastonbury and Somerton constituency, has today (19/03/24) welcomed the major set of reforms announced by the Prime Minister yesterday (18/03/24) that will help drive growth across Somerset.\nOn Monday, the Prime Minister announced that the Conservative Government will fully fund apprenticeships for young people in small businesses from 1 April 2024 and increase the amount of funding that large employers who are paying the Apprenticeship Levy can pass onto other businesses from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.\nThis will benefit businesses across Somerset and see more apprentices being trained at Strode College. This will in turn support smaller business, skilled trades like plumbers, electricians, hairdressers and construction, and much more. Larger local businesses like Wessex Water, Thales, Clarks, or Leonardo- who build helicopters such as the Lynx and the AW101, will also benefit in building their skilled workforce.\nFaye Purbrick, MP Candidate for Glastonbury and Somerton, said:\n“Since the Conservatives came into office in 2010, we have already seen nearly 10,000 new apprentices in Glastonbury and Somerton, driving growth and helping to build-up a considerable high-skill manufacturing base locally.\n“Yesterday’s announcement will build on that progress to support even more young people to fulfil their potential, while also helping small businesses make the most of our fantastic local talent and grow the economy.\n“I grew up in an apprentice focused household, my dad running the apprenticeship training programme at aerospace firm Normalair Garrett and later at Agusta Westland (now Leonardo Helicopters). At its peak, the young people training on the job reached around 300. I witnessed their successes and the pride of their parents and have been a committed advocate of vocational training and apprenticeships ever since.\n“If I am elected as the next MP for Glastonbury and Somerton, I will work tirelessly to ensure both smaller businesses as well as larger firms like Thales, Wessex Water, and Leonardo, all have the skilled work force available to them to grow and thrive.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak added:\n“Growing up in my mum’s pharmacy, I know first-hand how important small businesses are. Not just for the economy, but as a driver for innovation and aspiration, and as the key to building a society where hard work is always recognised and rewarded.\n“Whether it’s breaking down barriers and red tape for small businesses, helping businesses hire more young people into apprenticeships and skilled jobs or empowering women to start up their own businesses – this government is sticking to the plan and leaving no stone unturned to make the UK the best place to do business.\n“Taken together, these measures will unlock a tidal wave of opportunity and make a real difference to businesses and entrepreneurs across the country.”\nCommenting, Education Secretary Gillian Keegan also said:\n“This Government has built a world-leading apprenticeship system from the ground-up – with apprenticeship opportunities in almost 70 per cent of all occupations across the whole country.\n“Apprenticeships are a fantastic way for businesses to develop the skills they need, and for young people to access exciting career opportunities .\n“Our plan to deliver a high-growth, high-skilled economy is working, with more opportunities available to young people than ever before.”",

Therefore this site has been designed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA, but also satisfies many other checkpoints laid out in the Guidelines for level AAA.\nThese guidelines are intended to make website content accessible to people with disabilities. They also help to ensure that slower devices and Internet connections do not impede substantially on navigating the website.\nTherefore, you should be able to:-\n- Zoom in up to 300% without test spilling off the screen using your web browser settings. For example, in Chrome, hold down the ctrl key and press the + and - keys. In Safari, hold down the cmd key and press the + and - keys.\n- Navigate most of the website using a keyboard\n- Navigate most of the website using speech recognition software\n- Listen to most of the website with a screen reader\n- Read most of the website with a Braille device\nAbilityNet has advice on making your device easier to use if you have additional access needs.\nWhat we do to improve accessibility\nThe website administrator is responsible for the accessibility of this website. However, the developers regularly review design and functionality accessibility on the website platform, including:-\n- Improving layouts and colours to enhance simplicity and contrast\n- Ensuring that text appears in a legible font size\n- Ensuring that tap targets are an accessible size and not too small or close together\n- Considering accessibility in all design and functionality decisions\n- Publishing best practice for website administrators relating to content accessibility\nHow accessible is the website platform?\nDue to the devolved nature of the administration of a website platform, the responsibility for accessibility of content rests with the content creators. The developers are aware of the potential to add or modify content that is not as accessible as it could be, including:-\n- Images used as links\n- Broken links\n- Text as images in some locations, such as infographics and logos, without supportive descriptions\n- Non-optimal images and pdfs, such as scanned letters\n- Some historic images lack alternative text (prior to August 2016, when alt text became mandatory on the platform)\n- Not all videos feature subtitles and/or descriptive text\nThe developers of the website platform have no control over nor can take any responsibility for the content added to the website, but strive to resolve these where possible through aspects of the functionality as well as integral and disseminated best practice. It is entirely possible for all of these accessibility issues to be resolved by content creators themselves.\nBrowser accessibility\nThis website has been optimised for the latest versions of the following browsers:-\n- Google Chrome\n- Mozilla Firefox\n- Apple Safari\n- Microsoft Edge\nIf the website does not display correctly, please update to the latest version of your browser.\nHow to request information in an accessible format\nThis website has its own administrator and if you need information in a different format, please contact that individual using the form or details on the Contact page in the menu.
