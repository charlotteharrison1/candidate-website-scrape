Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition.

Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Some service providers are located outside of the EEA and therefore it may be necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA. Where the transfer of your data outside of the EEA takes place we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if the data was inside the EEA, and it only occurs with your consent.\nWe will use one of the following safeguards to ensure this:\n• Where the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision determining that a non-EEA country or organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection.\n• A contract is put in place with the recipient of the data obliging them to protect the data to the same standards as the EEA.\nLegally it is not permitted to transfer certain types of data, such as Electoral Register Data, outside of the EEA, and we honour that obligation.\n8. Data retention policy\nPersonal data will be held for no longer than necessary. Some types of data may be held for longer than others. Typically the maximum retention is two election cycles. Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10.

  "https_www_rebeccapaul_uk_/https_www_rebeccapaul_uk_about-rebecca-paul-mp/content_2.html": "Rebecca was elected as the Member for Parliament for the Reigate constituency in the July 2024 General Election.\nRebecca has lived in Tadworth since 2015 with her husband and three children. She has been a county councillor since May 2021 and is very much part of her community. She held the position of Deputy Cabinet Member to the Leader of Surrey County Council from 2021 to 2023 with Cabinet responsibility for 'levelling up'.\nRebecca has been an active campaigner on issues that matter to residents. In 2022, she launched a 'fairer road funding' campaign to fix Surrey's roads - presenting a petition signed by nearly 6000 residents to No10 Downing Street. She is fiercely opposed to ULEZ expansion across outer London and more recently launched a campaign to address excessive noise from the concrete road surface between J8-9 on the M25.\nBefore her political career, Rebecca was a Chartered Accountant and Charted Tax Adviser for 20 years. She held the role of Head of UK Tax at Diageo Plc, along with other senior tax roles at PepsiCo, Jigsaw and Ernst & Young. She also founded and ran her own loose leaf tea business, Silver Lantern Tea.\nDuring the pandemic, Rebecca volunteered with National Emergencies Trust (NET). In this role, she set up their finance function, including a new accounting system and oversaw receipt and distribution of nearly £100m of donations.\nIn her spare time, Rebecca enjoys walking in the many beautiful green spaces within Reigate & Banstead, but her absolute favourite thing is a strong cup of tea and a slice of cake!",
  "https_www_rebeccapaul_uk_/https_www_rebeccapaul_uk_news_rebecca-welcomes-supreme-court-ruling-legal-definition-woman-based-biological-sex/content_7.html": "Rebecca has welcomed the Supreme Court Ruling that the legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex.\nThe case was brought about following the Scottish Government’s inclusion of transgender women in quotas to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. Campaign group For Women Scotland contended that sex-based protections should only be applicable to women born female.\nThe Supreme Court judges were tasked with ruling on the correct interpretation of “sex” and “woman” in the legislation setting out sex-based legal protections.\nFollowing the Court’s ruling, Rebecca said:\n“I’m somewhat in disbelief that it’s taken a court to confirm what we all know to be true. That a woman is born, not made. I want to thank all the brave women and men out there who have fearlessly told the truth in the face of accusations of bigotry and transphobia. Common sense has prevailed. Sex is real, it’s biological and it matters in certain situations, like that of sport, healthcare and changing/toilet facilities.\n“It’s now vitally important that local authorities, the NHS, schools, prisons and sporting groups ensure their approach is in line with this recent judgement and single sex provision is truly that.”\nRebecca has been a strong advocate of sex-based women’s rights and last month spoke from the front bench in Parliament against the inclusion of men competing against women in female sports. During a debate last month on access to sport and PE in schools, Rebecca said:\n“I cannot speak about the importance of sport without touching on the subject of sex. The concerning trend of gender ideology threatens to undermine efforts to promote sport among young women and girls. Let me be clear: it is bodies that play sport, not feelings. In women and girls’ sports, participants must be separated by sex, not only for safety reasons but for fundamental fairness. Former Olympic swimmer Sharron Davies MBE has been warning about the negative impact of this issue on women’s sport for many years, and it is important that she and other advocates for women are listened to.”",

  "https_www_rebeccapaul_uk_/https_www_rebeccapaul_uk_news_rebecca-commends-safer-redhill-initiative-and-east-surrey-ymca-parliament/content_4.html": "During a debate in Parliament, Reigate MP Rebecca Paul took the opportunity to thank Surrey Police and to commend the Safer Redhill initiative and the work of East Surrey YMCA, highlighting their achievements in reducing crime and anti-social behaviour in the town.\nDuring a debate in Parliament, Reigate MP Rebecca Paul took the opportunity to thank Surrey Police and to commend the Safer Redhill initiative and the work of East Surrey YMCA, highlighting their achievements in reducing crime and anti-social behaviour in the town.\nHighlighting Redhill’s status as the cultural epicentre for the local area, and promoting all that the town has to offer, Rebecca outlined the considerable successes of the Safer Redhill initiative and the crucial support of the East Surrey YMCA in reducing crime and anti-social behaviour, which has been increasing in the town in recent years.\nDescribing Safer Redhill’s successes, Rebecca said:\n“To address the real issues faced, the Safer Redhill initiative was established. That is a partnership between Surrey police, the office of the police and crime commissioner, Reigate and Banstead borough council and East Surrey YMCA to cut crime and foster pride in the town. The project adopts the College of Policing’s “Clear, hold, build” framework, which is a three-stage approach where offenders are cleared from the area, and then partners work together to put in place interventions to keep it that way.\n“From drug operations at Redhill train station to plain-clothes officers out at night looking for suspicious behaviour, huge amounts have been achieved as part of the Safer Redhill initiative. There have been 155 arrests, with a combined prison time of 25 years for local offenders, 86 drug seizures—including 10 kg of suspected cocaine—£89,000 of cash recovered and weapons taken off the streets. I take this opportunity to thank Surrey police, especially Jon Vale, the borough commander, and Lisa Townsend, the police and crime commissioner, for ensuring that Redhill got the additional police focus it needed at the right time.”\nHighlighting the work of East Surrey YMCA, Rebecca proceeded to say:\n“However, making Redhill safer is not all about police action; it is also about prevention, and that is where East Surrey YMCA has come in. With its qualified youth workers, it has been supporting local young people at risk of offending or becoming NEET—not in education, employment or training—by giving them the support they need and helping them to thrive and flourish. With their Y bus, the YMCA has been getting out and about in Redhill to engage with the young people, and I thank it for the important part it has played in making Redhill safer and ensuring a more positive future for the next generation.”\nPaying tribute to the police, the local council and to the charity sector, Rebecca said:\n“Safer Redhill is an inspiring example of what can be achieved by the police, the local council and the charity sector working hand in hand, with all partners bringing different skills and expertise to the table, but with the same ultimate goal. I thank and pay tribute to everyone involved. It is wonderful to see the local community starting to feel safer in the town centre and businesses feeling more confident about their future in Redhill.”",
