It was the first time in more than 18 months that a local fundraiser had been held and guests enjoyed a wonderful evening of food and an interesting talk from guest speaker Sir Geoffrey Cox QC MP. The neighbouring MP joined our own MP Mel Stride for the dinner, which was nearly sold out.\nSpeaking after the dinner Mel said:\n\"It was great to see everyone and I hope this is the first of many events we will be able to hold over the next year as we return to relative normality after the disruptions of Covid-19. It was especially good to see a number of young faces in the room, a good sign for our Association going forward.\"",

Data Controller\nThe Data Controller is Central Devon Conservatives\n2. Contact\nIf you have any questions about this policy or for more information about how we use your data or would like to exercise any of your rights contact Central Devon Conservatives.\n3. Lawful basis for processing\nAll processing is carried out by consent or either under the legitimate interest of Central Devon Conservatives, or public interest. These cover processing to conduct casework, campaigning and communication. Where processed under the lawful basis of a task carried out in the public interest, it is to support or promote democratic engagement. This includes fundraising activity in order to support democratic engagement.\n4. Data sources\nData held is that provided by you when you contact us and correspondence with third parties in response to cases taken up on your behalf. We may also hold data that you provide when we contact you – for instance, if we ask you to participate in a survey or petition. If you do not wish for us to contact you by telephone please do not provide this information. We perform a database lookup automatically upon any form submission to include electoral boundary data. The Register of Electors that councils provide to authorised persons under the Representation of the People Act is also used for electoral purposes.\n5. Data Security\nPersonal data is stored electronically and securely. We ensure that our service providers comply with the same high standard that we do, and we store our data on the Bluetree servers in the UK.\n6. Special category data\nSpecial category data will be processed under the lawful basis indicated in section 3, as is permitted in clauses 22, 23 and 24 of schedule 1 of the Data Protection Act, covering political parties and elected representatives.\n7. Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area\nThe EU GDPR adequacy decision means that data can continue to flow between the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Some service providers are located outside of the EEA and therefore it may be necessary to transfer your personal data outside of the EEA. Where the transfer of your data outside of the EEA takes place we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if the data was inside the EEA, and it only occurs with your consent.\nWe will use one of the following safeguards to ensure this:\n• Where the European Commission has issued an adequacy decision determining that a non-EEA country or organisation ensures an adequate level of data protection.\n• A contract is put in place with the recipient of the data obliging them to protect the data to the same standards as the EEA.\nLegally it is not permitted to transfer certain types of data, such as Electoral Register Data, outside of the EEA, and we honour that obligation.\n8. Data retention policy\nPersonal data will be held for no longer than necessary. Some types of data may be held for longer than others. Typically the maximum retention is two election cycles. Review of the data held will occur in each election cycle to determine whether it should be maintained or put beyond use. We also comply with the ICO's expectation guidelines relating to petitions.\n9. Subject Access Requests\nWe will request verification of the identity of any individual making a request, ask for further clarification and details if needed and respond within one calendar month once we have confirmed it is a legitimate request. In accordance with ICO guidelines, we keep a log of Subject Access Requests that contains details of the request, including that which can identify you personally, indefinitely.\nData subjects have the right to the following:\n• To be told whether any personal data is being processed\n• To be given a description of the personal data, the reasons it is being processed and whether it will be given to another organisations or people.\n• To be given a copy of the information comprising the data, and given details of the source of the data where this is available.\n10.

The nature of casework and other enquiries are not retained on the website, but this information is available for a limited period on the Bluetree servers in the UK for access only in the event of a police investigation. Your name and contact details submitted via the Contact form are only retained on the website if you grant consent to join the email subscriptions list. Anonymised data from the Contact form is retained for benchmarking purposes.\nYour personal data is only used as outlined here and within your reasonable expectations based on the nature of the communication, and recognising the need of politically related engagement in wider support of democratic engagement.\n11.

The developers are aware of the potential to add or modify content that is not as accessible as it could be, including:-\n- Images used as links\n- Broken links\n- Text as images in some locations, such as infographics and logos, without supportive descriptions\n- Non-optimal images and pdfs, such as scanned letters\n- Some historic images lack alternative text (prior to August 2016, when alt text became mandatory on the platform)\n- Not all videos feature subtitles and/or descriptive text\nThe developers of the website platform have no control over nor can take any responsibility for the content added to the website, but strive to resolve these where possible through aspects of the functionality as well as integral and disseminated best practice. It is entirely possible for all of these accessibility issues to be resolved by content creators themselves.\nBrowser accessibility\nThis website has been optimised for the latest versions of the following browsers:-\n- Google Chrome\n- Mozilla Firefox\n- Apple Safari\n- Microsoft Edge\nIf the website does not display correctly, please update to the latest version of your browser.\nHow to request information in an accessible format\nThis website has its own administrator and if you need information in a different format, please contact that individual using the form or details on the Contact page in the menu. Alternatively, you can write to the address in the footer if one appears.\nReporting accessibility problems\nThis website has its own administrator and if you find any problems that are not listed on this page or if you think the website is not meeting accessibility requirements, please contact the administrator using the form or details on the Contact page in the menu. Alternatively, you can write to the address in the footer if one appears. If necessary, information about structural or design accessibility issues will be passed to the developers to include in the development roadmap.\nIf you contact us with a complaint about accessibility and you are not happy with our response, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS).\nFrom time to time, other website developers copy this Accessibility statement for use on their own websites.

It extends from Okehampton and Hatherleigh in the West to Lapford and Chawleigh in the North, to Silverton and Bradninch in the East and Buckfastleigh in the South. It includes around half of Dartmoor National Park, including three of its biggest towns – Ashburton, Moretonhampstead and Chagford. While most parliamentary constituencies cover one or two local authorities Central Devon has parts of four – West Devon, Mid Devon, East Devon and Teignbridge. We might be the only constituency in the country that does this!\nCentral Devon was a new constituency which was created at the 2010 General Election as the result of an independent boundary review and was won by the Conservatives at the 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 General Elections. You can visit the parliamentary website of our MP Mel Stride at www.melstridemp.com. Our councillors represent various communities across our huge constituency.\nCentral Devon Conservative Association Membership\nOur Association is made up of Conservative Party members across this vast constituency. Many play an active role within the party by standing to become councillors, helping to deliver leaflets or knocking on doors at election time, serving on local branch committees or serving on our constituency-wide management and executive committees. Others simply pay their annual subs to support their party and have a vote in national leadership contests and in local candidate selections.\nWhatever your level of interest, if you support the aims of the Conservative Party you are welcome to join us. Our annual subscription is £39. Reduced subscriptions are available for young people and members of our armed forces.\nYou can find information about joining the Conservatives here.
