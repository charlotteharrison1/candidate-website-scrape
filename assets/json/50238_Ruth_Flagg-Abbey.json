Given the financial mismanagement of the Police Authority it seems the money would be better spent on better administration of the public money entrusted to them, rather than on a big salary for a Labour Party appointee.\n“The £65 million of debts that were not accounted for in the policing budget could have a serious knock on effect on policing in South Yorkshire. We have all seen the increasingly difficult issues that frontline police have had to deal with locally and they need the reassurance and certainty that they will not lose the resources they need to do their very difficult job.\n“Rectifying this serious financial situation in the medium term will mean spreading out the cost of this error over several years. What we can’t risk with all the additional ramifications that would entail.\n“It is clear that financial management in the office of the Police and Crime Commissioner was under-resourced, making mistakes much more likely. Giving a choice of a potential £50-70k to a new politician or someone to ensure the financial controls are more robust, I know which I would choose.”",

Rob Murphy’s motion called instead for closer links and devolution for Yorkshirebut that a final decision on Yorkshire devolution should only be made after a Yorkshire-wide referendum.\nRob asked the Council, “do we go into future devolution negotiations with a white rose or a white flag?”\nThe LibDems had the first motion on the agenda and chose the second of these options. Their motion supported attempts to keep the SCR devolution on life support even after it has died a death. Naturally, the Labour group opposed both motions and substituted their own, somewhat rambling, amendment hoping that it would all work out all right somehow. Cllr Jack Scott was clear that he thought Yorkshire devolution was “the wrong thing for Sheffield.” Labour ‘noted’ – without challenge – that the Government minister said he did not want Yorkshire devolution and that the mayoral election was due to go ahead anyway.\nAs Rob said, only the Greens were the real party of opposition.\nAs our motion came after the Labour and LibDem motions, there was still no time to debate it, despite the arguments over new arrangements for council meetings.\nLabour also managed to avoid any questions from Opposition councillors by filibustering to the 8pm deadline by asking for repeated recorded votes. Each of these took the form of a roll-call since the electronic voting system was not working. Our proposal to replace the system with one fit for broadcasting would have solved that.\nOne small success was the Council’s agreement to restore the order of motions on the agenda. Labour’s changes at the previous meeting meant that they would always get to choose the first two debates. This has now been replaced with a fairer system similar to the one on place previously. This formula allows a Green motion to be debated first at the December meeting but stops us putting any motions at all in November.\nHowever, I had filed an amendment,\nto delete the words “(as revised on 6th September 2017)” which have the effect of restricting opposition parties from submitting motions, in breach of the constitution, which the Monitoring Officer advises has not changed.\nAs the Labour group refused to agree to this, I had to raise it in the meeting. I spoke briefly to note our discontent at Labour’s “gerrymandering the constitution.” Unfortunately, what I hoped to be a short speech was interrupted not only by the Lord Mayor but also by the Leader of the council and the Labour Whip, who appeared unhappy with what I was saying.\nRules of procedure are important because they lay the ground-rules for debate and decision-making. Unfortunately, the Administration’s official view is that the constitution has not changed; it is just different to what it was before because it was suspended.\nBack on the main motions, we discussed cuts to policing and the impact of austerity on life expectancy. As Greens, we are strongly critical of the austerity favoured to greater or lesser degree by Conservatives, Labour and LibDems. Bizarrely, whilst stating that police forces are reaching a breaking point, the Labour group praised extra resources for their top policing priority – tackling off-road biking. I appreciate it is genuinely a serious annoyance in some neighbourhoods and was the personal experience of the proposer but, personally, I would have thought the recent spate of stabbings in the city centre merited some extra police input.\nWe supported Labour’s motion on the impact of austerity on life expectancy. The LibDems disagreed that austerity was the biggest factor. Labour’s motion – unusually – proposed a course of preventative action on “adverse childhood experiences.” We therefore proposed an amendment to get the council to recognise it had itself closed Surestart centres and community nurseries in the most disadvantaged areas of Sheffield.\nBack at the beginning of the meeting, there were tributes to the late Bill Michie, the former councillor (1970-83) and MP for Sheffield Heeley (1983-2001). He was credited with campaigning for policies such as opening Red Tape Studios (kick-starting the Cultural Industries Quarter) and the cheap bus fares policy.\nThere were petitions asking the council to tackle anti-social behaviour in Firth Park and safety at Victoria Quays after two tragic deaths. A further petition accused Cllr Bryan Lodge of giving “categorically false” information over health and safety breaches after Amey and one of their contractors (Acorn) had been served notices of contravention by the Health and Safety Executive.\nThere were questions on devolution, fracking and child abuse. Further questions were about trees and the mileage of roads yet to be resurfaced. Part of the delay was explained by Cllr Lodge as being that Amey’s contact with Aggregate Industries “had reached an end” and that a new company was taking over.\nThe petitioner at September’s meeting about the Rohingya asked why there had been no action by the council to remove the Freedom of the city from Aung San Suu Kyi. This is apparently to come to November’s meeting.\nOne interesting question came from Russell Johnson. Noting that the council had not yet congratulated Cllr Alison Teal and Cllr Magid Magid for their recent nominations for national awards, he asked whether the council would do so specifically. The Leader of the Council replied that “of course, she would congratulate any councillor … in general … for their contribution in public life.”\nSo that was a “no” then.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

These, however, are outweighed by some very strong misgivings.\nWe feel the structure and decision making processes are lacking in democracy; there is little room for any person or organisation outside the MCA to have any influence in what decisions are made, decisions which nevertheless may influence their lives. The funding arrangements are dependant on Central Government, who have imposed a sole focus of business and economic growth, with vital factors such as inclusivity and the region’s response to climate change as side issues. Given the climate crisis, we urge the MCA to try strenuously to persuade Central Government that the agreement between the two should be reframed to give greater priority to action to tackle the climate emergency and less priority to growth.\nThe focus on business and economic growth misses the point of the Paris Agreement entirely. The Government and all four local authorities within the SCR have declared a Climate Emergency; there is very little in this document to reassure us that it will receive the attention we all need it to receive. We believe it should be the focus of this devolution agreement, and indeed all devolution agreements; and that funding should be available and certain. If it were so, the amount of employment available in the region would skyrocket. Work on housing, to deliver near zero-carbon homes that are cheap to run; work on transport, perhaps making use of the Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation strand, to develop cheaper and more efficient electric buses and cars, as well as building the active transport infrastructure we so desperately need; work in renewable power generation, installing solar panels, on-shore windfarms and a wide range of other renewables, including developing wave and tidal generators; work in agriculture, to maximise food production within the region; work on flood defences; work in the education sector to provide the training for all this.\nWhere we can give some cautious approval is in the bus franchising. The region is crying out for an integrated network that offers people affordability, timeliness and reliability. We don’t, however, believe that HS2 is in the interests of the people of Sheffield City Region, and neither is the existence of the Doncaster/Sheffield Airport.\nWe also have concerns about the integration of Adult Skills provision across the region, connected as it is with the DWP in delivering “future employment support”. This sounds like Universal Credit, which has been thoroughly discredited.\nGiven the focus on business and economic growth, we cannot support the powers of the MCA in planning. If the proposed National Institute for Infrastructure in Doncaster were to be the National Institute for Climate Friendly Infrastructure, the proposal would be much more attractive.\nTo sum up, we find the proposed workings of the SCRMCA to lack regional accountability and to be focused on aims incompatible with the Paris Agreement and the declared Climate Emergency. Whilst we welcome the bus franchising, it cannot by itself solve the considerable transport problems faced by the region. The focus very much needs to be on priority for local buses, with none of the spending being diverted to road-widening schemes to benefit private motoring. Spending on transport should be significant but only spent on sustainable modes of travel. Our objections would be lifted if funding was to be definite, not conditional; and if the focus was to be on the Climate Emergency, informing the planning function, the Advanced Manufacturing and Innovation function, and the National Institute for Infrastructure.\nDownload the Sheffield Green Party response (pdf)\nFind out more about the devolution consultation on the Sheffield City Region website.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Government has promised extra billions. It’s what @TheGreenParty has campaigned for, for many years. So how is it looking in #Sheffield?\nTo set the scene … since the 1960s, Sheffield had been developed to encourage the private car. Politicians competed for the motorist’s vote.\nThe £2 billion, 25-year #PFI contract with #Amey failed to enhance safe pedestrian crossings or walking routes, safe cycling facilities, safe dropped kerbs for wheelchair users, safe routes to school. It was a contract to keep roads just as they had been 25 years previously.\nThe Inner Ring Road widening was to get more cars into the city centre, driven by outdated economic ideas: growth = more cars. The Council admitted to @RuthMersereau it had not even looked at the business case for walking or cycling.\nBut in the coronavirus #lockdown, far fewer cars on the road meant those people not in work could get out on bikes and on foot for their daily exercise. Cycling and walking took off, as air pollution from cars fell away.\nEven the Government seems to have fallen behind the Green transport agenda: “making streets safe for walking and cycling is good for retailers, business and the economy,” said Grant Shapps, announcing £2billion funding.\n“The first stage, worth £250 million, is a series of swift, emergency interventions to make cycling and walking safer.\nPop-up bike lanes. Wider pavements. Cycle and bus-only streets. All examples of what people will start to see more of.\nAccompanying the new money, we are today publishing fast-tracked statutory guidance, effective immediately, requiring councils in England to cater for significantly-increased numbers of cyclists and pedestrians, and making it easier for them to create safer streets.”\nBrilliant! As a Green councillor in Sheffield, I have long campaigned for better walking and cycling facilities (along with #publictransport) so people can choose to leave their cars at home.\nWe campaigned for cleaner and safer streets. Every year, the Labour Council would vote against our budget proposals to promote cycling and walking, like £1 million extra for segregated cycle lanes.\nEven installing simple #bike stands became prohibitively expensive where Amey has first rights over any job. 4 stands in the Peace Gardens cost £905. But #Amey charges a whopping £4,687 for 4 stands on the public highway.\nSo what did Sheffield Council decide to do with all the extra money and encouragement and a public willing to take up the challenge? Well, not a lot …\nFirst, an explanation of how Sheffield Council makes decisions. Basically, the council DOESN’T make decisions. Under the “Strong Leader” model, all the decision-making powers are handed over to a single leader, who offers them around her chosen cabinet and officers.\nThe Strong Leader model means other #councillors don’t get a say about most decisions and don’t even get to know about them until they read about them in the @SheffieldStar.\nUnder emergency powers, the Council Leader has extended her “scheme of delegation” and given all decision-making powers to officers. Now every decision is considered to be “urgent” and this makes it exempt from any scrutiny process.\n(Source: http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ecSDDisplayClassic.aspx?NAME=SD1216&id=1216&sch=doc)\n#CityWard councillors had a briefing with senior transport officers last Monday (11/5). We were told that options were being worked up; they wanted quality schemes, not quick ones. We awaited further developments.\nWe asked about a repeat of the successful trial closure of Division St in the city centre, like the one that Cycle Sheffield had initiated and which took place last October.\nSo it’s with some surprise we see the Labour cabinet member “announcing” the council decision for lots of transport improvements the next morning on a #LabourParty Facebook account. No council publication; no formal decision published; no info for elected councillors.\nThe day after that, the Council’s Comms team publishes a press release with the same claims. But there’s still no recorded council decision. Who authorises this major new public spending?\nTemporary footpath widening measures will start to be installed over the coming days in the following locations:\n– Chesterfield Road – between Haughton Road and Asda/Iceland Service Road\n– Rowlands Pharmacy – on Dykes Hall Road\n– Lloyds Pharmacy – on Far Lane/Wadsley Lane\n– Fulwood Road – on Glossop Rd to Nile St. Broomhill centre\n– Charles Street and Union St – from above Q-Park\n– Five Weirs Walk – the diversion currently in place will be widened where the main footway is inaccessible due to construction work\n(Source: https://sheffieldnewsroom.co.uk/news/pop-up-travel-measures/)\nLet’s go through these new locations in order. First up: #Woodseats … wait, what the hell is this?\nSeriously??? One single parking bay closed off outside a hairdresser that’s shut in the #lockdown anyway? With 2 lumps of tarmac as a crude token to #wheelchair users.\nWhat is the point? How does this help anyone?\nNext one: Dykes Hall Road. Any idea what is going on here? No, me neither. And if you thought you were going to push your pram down this new 25m stretch of road, the white barrier will soon put paid to that.\n@RuthMersereau witnessed a Mum with a pram attempting to use it and the pram ended up getting a bump big enough to jolt the baby’s bottle onto the ground.\nNext… another pharmacy in Wadsley. Could almost be useful if it were connected to anything else. Pity the temporary dropped kerb is blocked by the sign heralding the parking restriction.\nNext … over to Broomhill shopping centre. Absolutely no sign of any improvements there.\nBack into town now, where high footfall can really be improved. But this collection of barriers on some double yellows outside the council office is more baffling than anything. It might help staff walk from the side door to the main entrance … if the building were open.\nNo sign of any real changes on the Five Weirs Walk, Shalesmoor roundabout or – the one we’d really like to see – the pedestrianisation of Division St.\n(credit @CycleSheffield)\nWhat do we make of this? A token effort? A cheap publicity stunt? A council with very limited vision? Business as usual? Maybe all of the above.\nWe need a #vision for the future where city centres are easy, safe and pleasant to get about on foot, in #wheelchairs, with #prams and on #bikes bikes. Where streets aren’t just used for car storage. Where people’s well-being is prized above all else.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Doncaster (57%) and Rotherham (59%) are ahead of the national average (51%) and Barnsley has paid out 77% of its grants.\nLeeds has managed to pay out 62% of its grants, through nearly 8,000 payments, compared to Sheffield’s 3,223 awards.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Green Party councillor for City Ward, said,\n“Small businesses are really struggling now and timing is critical. It is absolutely vital for Sheffield City Council to get these payments out to small and, independent businesses and social enterprises, particularly small shops and cafes, at the very earliest they possibly can.\nThe Government promised that local authorities would simply contact eligible businesses and pay them. However, the Council now says the government is requiring extra checks on businesses and that businesses must apply first. The council says over a third of businesses have still not applied so it is really important that business-owners make their claims so they can get the money they are owed.\nI hope the Council has now resolved these problems. They must now be able to pay out the remaining grants very soon.”\nRhys Davies, who owns the Copper Pot café on Division St, applied for the grant on 30th March, after originally being told the council would write to businesses automatically about the grants. The payment was received on 20th April. He said,\n“Although I am most relieved to have received my 25k business grant from Sheffield City Council, it concerned me how long it took. Friends of mine with businesses in other cities received theirs weeks before me.\nAs we were unable to trade, cash flow was a major concern. The department dealing with the grant did nothing to reassure us that we were getting the money so the stress on mental health could have easily been avoided by being open and honest.\nLet’s hope they speed up for the companies still waiting and learn from this in future.”\nBusinesses that have not yet received grants can enquire at business.rates@sheffield.gov.uk or apply online at https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/utilities/form/business/apply-for-business-support-grant\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Thanks to the tremendous work of “It’s our City”, who secured a referendum to change how our city is governed, there is no longer a cabinet or a strong leader model in the Council. A committee system has replaced it. All councillors, from all parties, represented on the council, now take responsibility for decision-making as members of citywide Policy Committees. The Council is currently made up of 39 Labour, 29 Liberal Democrat, 14 Green, 1 Conservative and 1 Independent Councillor. Each committee is made up of Councillors in roughly the same proportion as the totals. As no party has more than half the seats, the Councillors need to work together to pass new policies.\nSo, much as Green Party Councillors would love to introduce Active Travel Schemes throughout the city, they are only able to with the support of other parties. Funding for these comes from central Government grants, so, it is not paid out of Council Tax. Active Travel Schemes are successful in encouraging more people to walk and cycle and leave their cars at home, reducing air pollution and emissions. The Council have declared a climate emergency and has committed to net zero by 2030. We have to get serious about this and Active Travel schemes are one tool the Council has to move things in the right direction.\nMeanwhile, the Government’s austerity continues. Between 2010 and 2020 Government cuts have resulted in the Council’s spending being reduced by £211m (29%) representing a fall of £828 for every household in Sheffield.

The October changeover in many areas created extra confusion and street mess in hot spots like the streets off Ecclesall Rd adjacent to the General Cemetery. I have had to ask Veolia to “decontaminate” bins with the wrong contents across the whole of these areas in my ward and remove the blue boxes which are just sitting on the street attracting various contents.\nThis changeover has created a lot of work but credit is due to James Merryclough, Sustainability & Communications Manager at the University Of Sheffield. James has worked with the council and Veolia to supply large bin stickers to help students understand the new system. House number stickers have also been supplied – the wonderful community groups Harcourt Community Action, Moor Oaks Triangle and Botanical Gate Community Association are numbering all student house bins in the areas they cover.\nJames is also constantly working with all stakeholders to improve the red bag scheme and minimise the impact of the mass student departure each June. This year “Donate Don’t Waste” saw 58 tonnes recycled, valued at £101,654, with another 35 tonnes recycled via council and university banks. The period from late June to mid July will always be difficult for communities with large student populations but significant progress has been made over the last few years.\nAnother request I have made to Veolia is to change green bin collections so they start at the beginning of March and finish at the end of November. The last collections for most people who pay for this service were in October this year. There are clear additional benefits in reducing the impact on other council services if green bin collections cover the increasingly unpredictable start of the growing season to the end of significant leaf fall. It will also reduce the need to put green waste into black bins and increase recycling rates.\nCllr Kaltum Rivers\nGreen Party, Broomhill & Sharrow Vale ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The vision sets out changes that could be made across trams, buses, walking & cycling , tackling congestion, improving road safety and putting people first. Local artists and designers have visualised what these changes might look like in practice.\nBex Whyman, Green Party candidate for the South Yorkshire mayoral election, said “We’ve had too many people in power saying ‘it can’t be done.’ We need to have the vision to change transport in Sheffield and the region for the better. These are realistic ideas to make getting around South Yorkshire easier. It would take action and funding from the government, local councils, the mayor, businesses and communities to turn our vision into a reality, but ideas like these have been achieved elsewhere in the UK and beyond. There’s good reason to repeat those successes in South Yorkshire. We’re putting these ideas forward to show what kind of places we could live and work in, and how we could get around, if we had the ambition to make this vision a reality.”\nSheffield Greens are calling on the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority and the local councils to unite and demand the funding to expand Supertram and bus services into a metro system fit for the 21st Century. Greens are also calling for a range of other measures, from bringing buses back under public control to tackling congestion, to making our neighbourhoods people friendly.\nSheffield Councillor Douglas Johnson, Executive Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport, said “In Sheffield, the Greens have already secured a Clean Air Zone, walking and cycling travel improvements and a plan to ban pavement parking in the city centre, but there’s a lot more we can do. Our vision for transport reimagines our local places, neighbourhoods and high streets for people. Places with less traffic, where people can get around easily, and where air is clean and safe to breathe.”\n“We want to see a city where all trips, but especially commutes and journeys up to two miles, should be safe, convenient and pleasant by either walking or cycling. Sheffield had buses that were cheap and convenient before and there’s no reason we can’t have that level of service again. Of course, some people will still need to make journeys by car, but making other ways to move around the city more accessible will make it more affordable and convenient for everyone”\nSee more at the GET SHEFFIELD MOVING website",

However, here are a few points of perspective I would note:\n- These schemes have been entirely drawn up based on what residents in the area have requested through the public consultation. This was a completely open engagement exercise with no original proposal at all being put forward by transport planners: it was a blank sheet for residents.\n- Secondly, this is a scheme based on an “experimental” traffic regulation order which means there is now a 6 month period for further consultation. In reality, people can often focus on commenting constructively once they see a scheme in place. It is always helpful if people can give comments so that it can lead to a better scheme whilst there is funding available to make improvements.\n- Thirdly, whilst any low-traffic scheme inconveniences those who own cars to some extent, the scheme overall is to cater for everyone, including those who don’t have cars. Many people are both inconvenienced and put at risk by the number, movements, speeds and parking of cars around these roads and it is important that the needs of people who don’t own cars are also taken into account, including children. The enquirer made an interesting point about cycling to school in the past – surely we should be aiming to restore the ability of school children to cycle (and walk) safely now.\n- Fourthly, this is indeed the point of the scheme overall. Such schemes are based on the evidence that bringing in minor interventions like this doesn’t just re-route traffic but actually leads to a drop in overall traffic volumes. This benefits everyone, drivers and non-drivers.\n- Finally the “devious plan” that the original enquirer referred to, that prevented resurfacing of the street, was the outsourcing of the council’s street repair functions to private contractors (Amey) under the previous Labour administration. This massive deal has been (and still is) enormously costly to the city but has also missed any opportunity for safety improvements to be made because of the like-for-like replacement specified in the 25-year contract. It is a prime example of the sort of backward-thinking that we as Greens have campaigned strongly against.",

Douglas Johnson, leader of the Green Group in Sheffield Council and Executive Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport, looks under the headline:\n“It’s pleasing to see Sheffield rated as the most sustainable city in the UK and there is certainly a lot to be happy about in our home city: there are plenty of trees and parks, despite the notorious street tree-felling.\nThere is a reasonably good public transport network, even if buses are being squeezed with the national driver shortage and it is still too cheap and easy to drive a car along a bus route. The network of cycling and walking routes is growing. There is still a reasonable stock of council housing, which is gradually being insulated. There is a lot more to do, though, and it needs to be done more urgently than ever to reduce carbon emissions.\nOne thing that helps make Sheffield sustainable is a good community of people willing to help each other out, in the business sector and in the voluntary and community sectors. Collaboration and innovation are going to be really important to tackle climate change and to continue making the city more sustainable.\nHowever, there is no single measure that describes how sustainable a city is. It is a complexity of lots of parts. That means everyone can play their part and also that we need to focus on the big plans for the city to bring about major reductions in the amount of energy we use. Supporting the Green Party’s work in Council, as we look to make our transport and buildings more sustainable, really helps, as do community initiatives from cutting waste food to offering mutual support, as do individual actions and choices.”",

This would give people cheaper fuel bills with less carbon emissions.\nThe motion to Sheffield’s July Council meeting highlighted the proximity of other regional airports. Greens said supporting airport expansion would lead to more flights and more carbon emissions. (1)\nA paper on the UK’s Net Zero Aviation ambitions, produced by the Royal Society in February 2023, said that there was,\n“no single, clear, sustainable alternative to jet fuel able to support flying on a scale equivalent to present day use” (2)\nGreen Councillors called on the Prime Minister to support policies to lift the implicit subsidy to the aviation industry. They asked for aviation fuel to be taxed fairly so the funding raised could support long-distance rail travel.\nCouncillor Paul Turpin said\n“Using public funding to support the expansion of aviation is incompatible with our local, regional and national climate goals. Sustainable Aviation Fuels are simply not possible in the quantities needed to maintain the existing level of flights we have today, that is very clear from the evidence.\n“The millions Labour plan to use to subsidise a reopened Doncaster Sheffield Airport would be better spent investing in insulating local peoples homes. Many people are not able to afford to jet off on a foreign holiday.\n“We are requesting that the Leader of Sheffield City Council tells Mayor Coppard our view that Doncaster Sheffield Airport should not reopen. We believe that the £5.3 million funding should be reallocated from supporting airport expansion to a scheme to make homes warmer.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson, who was the Green Party’s candidate for mayor of South Yorkshire, added,\n“The wasted £138 million for promoting an airport could instead go to clean, green, safe public transport.\n“In a climate emergency, promoting air travel is irresponsible towards our children’s generation. They will have to live with more unpredictable and dangerous climate change. We all know aviation is a major contributor to global climate change.”\n“Public transport is the priority, especially buses. We need an expanded transport network. Walking, cycling, bus and tram should be the first choices for travel for everyone.”\nReferences\n(1) Airports near Sheffield. https://www.amrc.co.uk/files/wp_images/Travel-to-Sheffield.pdf\n(2) Royal Society Report on Net Zero Aviation.

The Administration argues that the decision will result ‘in a fairer, more equitable charge between current and future Council Tax payers.’\nBut, Cllr Murphy says,\n“Aside from the fact future generations have no say on this extra burden, it also assumes the lifetime of the road assets will be 40 years, despite complaints by residents that road surfaces are already breaking up.”\nNow, Green councillors have called the decision in for further scrutiny.\nSpeaker for the Green Group, Rob Murphy said\n“Not content with making our children pay for their mistakes, this Labour Administration is now getting our grandchildren to pay too. Labour leaders should apologise for signing a deal we cannot afford, as they will be long gone by the time it is paid off.”\nHe added,\n“The council is still paying off World Student Games infrastructure costs, despite Don Valley Stadium being demolished. Rather than clearing its debts before spending more, this Labour-run council has again decided to burden future generations with the pain from their poor decision making.”\nSheffield Greens were the only party on the council that argued against signing the PFI contract in 2012.\nNotes\n- The decision record is available at: http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?ID=1941\n- Figures in the report indicate the decision will cost around £40 million extra over the next 39 years.\n- The Highways PFI runs to 2037 and this extends the payments further to 2057.\n- Council borrowing to build sports facilities for the World Student Games in 1990 has crippled the council’s finances for decades and last year the city still owed over £100 million.\n- The outstanding liability arising from Major Sporting Facilities from the time of the World Student Games was £103.3m at 31 March 2017, (£114.7m as at 31 March 2016)”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

He described how food banks in Sheffield are working with each other to make sure those people who need food are getting access to it.\nThe impact of the pandemic on our community is devastating, but the compassion and kindness of Sheffield’s residents is evident in the actions of the many volunteers and in the generous donations made at food bank collections.\nHow can we give or get help?\nGleadless Valley Foodbank gratefully accepts donations – at a safe distance – of food and essential supplies every weekday from 10am until 12pm.

The claimed loss of £95,000 in revenue for just 7 days delay is clearly down to their failings.\nWe still have just 9 Cabinet members under the same leader making all the decisions despite open revolt among Labour members, many of whom voted for me on May 2nd.

I have been actively engaged in campaigning to elect Green councillors in the neighbouring Hillsborough ward in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nAs a teacher and contractor in Countryside Management, I understand the value that nature brings to people. We should all be proud of the incredible green and blue spaces in our constituency such as the River Don, parts of the Peak District, and a wealth of reservoirs. A key aim is to improve community access to these, especially for those who don’t drive, who can be the most isolated in any community. I would fully utilise schemes such as the Green Infrastructure Framework to reinvigorate and reconnect fragmented habitats.\nToo often, agriculture is viewed as opposed to nature and farmers need winning round to the Green Party. I see the value that local farmers bring to the area and would work with them to cultivate nature without cutting income. I want to see closer ties between the agricultural community and environmental groups and have the understanding and experience to make this happen.\nWe must campaign to halt the downward spiral of service cuts and price hikes which simply lead to fewer customers and further cuts. Bus services are vital in rural communities, and these essential public services must be taken back under public control. We need to increase the frequency of bus services within the constituency, to Sheffield, Barnsley, and the Peak District.\nI support the campaign to re-open the Don Valley Railway to deliver Stocksbridge residents to Sheffield quickly and regularly, alongside the Upper Don Trail for an ‘active travel’ route. These projects would remove cars from our roads, improving safety and air quality; bringing innumerable benefits to the health, well-being, economy and happiness of our population.\nI believe local decisions should be taken by local people; I would push for more powers to local councils and regions, and would work closely with the Sheffield City Region mayor to further increase the devolution of powers. I hope never again to see the sheer arrogance that led to Sheffield’s tree-felling scandal.\nThankfully we now have a greater chance of eradicating this thinking after the successful citywide referendum delivering a new governance system in Sheffield City Council with 14 Green councillors working hard towards these aims. Similarly, I support efforts to investigate decision-making and spending within the £24 million Stocksbridge Town Deal to improve transparency and accountability.\nAs the Green candidate for Penistone and Stocksbridge, I pledge to focus on bringing nature into the heart of our community, improving ties within the community, and delivering better public transport and increased devolution of powers.\nTo help Andy’s campaign please donate to the Crowdfunder, join the Green Party and Get Involved.\nTo contact Andy’s team email penistone.stocksbridge@votegreen.uk",

In Southern Europe, there were wildfires near Athens in Greece and in Rhodes, Switzerland, Croatia and the Spanish Canary Island of La Palma with temperatures in some places in the mid-40s.\nWhile global temperatures soar and the UN Secretary-General has said we are in an era of “global boiling”, Rishi Sunak has just approved hundreds of new gas and oil licences.\nYou might think that Labour, the official opposition, would oppose this and the Tory race to “cut the green crap”. It seems an obvious position to take, given the deteriorating state of the climate, that building onshore wind is the cheapest way to generate electricity and that mass insulation is the best way to lower heating bills and reduce household emissions – but you would be wrong.\nLabour have said they will not revoke the gas and oil licences. They’ve also said they can’t commit to their already-too-small green investment plans, as they need to stick to their fiscal rules. Never mind that the cost of inaction on the climate emergency comes with staggering environmental, human and financial costs.\nIt’s not just nationally that Labour is siding with the Tories on fuelling the climate crisis. Here in Sheffield, Labour is well known for the tree-felling saga when thousands of healthy street trees were felled unnecessarily and against residents’ wishes by a Labour majority council.\nWhat Sheffield Labour may not be as well known for is their politicking on transport. Labour say they want better public transport, walking and cycling. But when it comes to it, they tried to axe schemes that improve bus times and reliability. They campaigned against low-traffic neighbourhoods and red routes. At a South Yorkshire level, they failed to attract funding for bus improvement plans that were so unambitious they aimed for a reduction in passengers even if successful. And Labour repeatedly voted against investigating a workplace parking levy that would fund millions of pounds for public and active transport each year.\nWhether it’s in Sheffield or Westminster, it’s clear that only the Green Party will act on the climate emergency.\nMartin Phipps, Green councillor for City ward\nSheffield Green Party",

The number of multiple tooth extractions from children’s mouths has been increasing over the last five years to nearly 43,000 in 2016-17. The cost of tooth extractions for under-18s in hospitals now tops £90 million a year.\nThe Local Government Association calls it an “oral health crisis.”\nA recent report to Sheffield’s Health Scrutiny Committee, which I am a member of, said poor oral health leads to “pain, discomfort, time off work and school, self-consciousness and low self-esteem.”\nThe main reason I asked the Scrutiny Committee to look at dental health was because it is strongly linked with inequality. Children living in the most deprived areas of Sheffield have tooth decay four times worse than those in the least deprived areas. This is something we need to address in our city.\nIt is too late by the time the child needs teeth extracting. Our committee felt there should be more work to prevent tooth decay in the first place. Many schools are now teaching about healthy teeth and diets and the damage done by soft drinks. Some schools offer “tooth-brushing clubs.” Other schools and people working with children also need to pay attention as serious neglect of children’s teeth can indicate other forms of hidden child abuse. Get the teeth right and it can really help children get a better start in life.\nCllr Douglas Johnson,\nGreen Party, City Ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

People using wheelchairs and prams are often most affected.”\n“This proposed ban will help to make sure that people can get where they want to go safely and easily. We need to make sure that our city centre is inclusive and accessible for everyone who visits and we’re taking this step to stop people parking selfishly and hindering others.”\nThe introduction of a Traffic Regulation Order in the New Year would allow parking enforcement officers to clamp down on drivers who park on the pavement. Fines for £70 (£35 if paid within 14 days) will apply under the new rules. The ban will be enforced across the city centre in phases and will include some of the busiest streets such as West Street and Arundel Gate, where off road parking is generally available. Signs will inform drivers of the ban. The police can still fine drivers for obstructing the footway.\nCllr Johnson said “We receive a high number of complaints about pavement parking and I’m pleased that we’re now able to take this action which will hopefully act as a deterrent to those who choose to break the rules. There are plenty of on-street and off-street cark parks in the city centre that are available to use, and I want it to be clear that parking on the pavement is not an option.”\nParking enforcement officers can currently fine drivers for parking on the pavement or grass verges if they have parked on a street with waiting restrictions i.e. yellow lines. Under the new plans, fines can also be issued to vehicles parked on a footpath next to:\n- Controlled crossing zigzags\n- Bus stop clearways\n- Parking bays\n- Unrestricted roads\nResidents and business affected by the proposals will be contacted directly to inform them of the plans with the opportunity to provide feedback. They will be able to flag up any real difficulties that the proposals could cause them, which will be considered by the council.",

The motion follows on from detailed research by the Green Party into best practice on retrofitting homes to stop wasting energy.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“With energy bills rising fast and the growing threat of the climate crisis, we need to take effective action to radically reduce emissions and ensure homes are affordable to heat.”\n“Green Party councillors are proposing a scheme that has been trialled in Nottingham, Exeter and a number of London Boroughs. Under this radical approach, whole new insulated wall sections, complete with energy efficient windows, and insulated roof sections, complete with solar panels, are constructed in modern factory units. They are then installed much more quickly. This means far less disruption for tenants to get to warmer homes that look good too. than having insulation, windows and heating fitted separately.”\n“The system is called Energiesprong after it was pioneered successfully in the Netherlands.\n“As well as being a good technical solution to tackling cold homes, it also makes sense financially for both tenants and the Council as a Landlord. Instead of paying high fuel bills, tenants pay a “comfort charge” with a guarantee they will pay no more than what their bills would have cost without improvements.”\nFigures from Energiesprong who have already helped a number of Councils with this type of scheme say that the typical energy bill after installation is around £500/year with a comfort charge of a similar amount. So roughly a guaranteed total cost per household of around £1000/yr.\nCouncillor Johnson pointed out some of the other economic benefits of the proposal.\n“Another key benefit of the scheme is the very real possibility of establishing a modern manufacturing facility in Sheffield to construct the roof and wall modules which will be tailor made for each property. This would provide new skilled, worthwhile jobs in the green economy.”",

They spoke about their recent trip to Palestine and sang for us.\nThe meeting unanimously passed two motions. The first committed Sheffield Green Party to support the Sheffield Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid. This is a coalition of organisations and individuals united to promote a city-wide response to Israel’s apartheid regime as happened in the 1980s when the people of Sheffield proudly joined the struggle against South African Apartheid.\nThe crime of apartheid involves creating and maintaining the systematic domination of one racial or ethnic group over another. Palestinian and international human rights organisations are agreed that apartheid is what is in evidence in the whole of historic Palestine. We support the Palestinian struggle against it and are campaigning for all Sheffield-based institutions and companies to sever any connection that gives support to Israel’s system of apartheid.\nThe second motion commits Sheffield Green Party to encourage Sheffield City Council to proceed with the town twinning arrangement with Nablus.\nGreen Party member and Tadhamon singer Heather Hunt said:\n“The recently elected right-wing government in Israel has made explicit its intentions to extend the illegal settlements throughout Palestine and is stepping up its flagrant use of force to intimidate, hurt and kill Palestinians.\nThe Green Party has strong policies based on international law ensuring human rights for Palestinian and Israeli citizens. This includes support for the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions campaign.\nMembers of the Tadhamon choir shared their first-hand accounts illustrated with images and a few songs, from their recent visit to the West Bank. This vivid account stimulated discussion on ways Sheffield Green Party can go further in putting policies into practice in support of justice for Palestinians.”\nMore information about their visit is at https://socialistchoir.org. uk/tadhamon-singers/\nNotes\nHere are the resolutions.\nResolution 1: Proposed by Heather Hunt. Seconded by Cllr Alexi Dimond\nSheffield Green Party agrees to pledge support for the aims of the Sheffield Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid. The aims are as follows:\n- Oppose all forms of racism. eg.racism against Black and minority ethnic groups, antisemitism and Islamophobia\n- Raise Sheffield citizen’s awareness of the Palestinian people’s struggle against injustice imposed by Israeli apartheid, settler colonisation and occupation.\n- Make Sheffield into an Israeli Apartheid Free Zone by campaigning for business, local governmental, educational, sporting and cultural institutions to renounce all ties that support the Israeli apartheid system in line with the Palestinian BDS campaign.\n- Oppose the arm trade and all forms of military collaboration with Israel and call for the end of Israeli occupation and the siege of the Gaza Strip.\n- Call for sanctions against Israel until it abides by all international laws and UN resolutions affecting the rights of Palestinians including the refugees’ right of return.\n- Supports Palestinian grassroots organisations which promote equality for women, workers’ rights and the improvement of conditions for children.\n- Encourage Palestinian cultural activity in Sheffield\n- Oppose measures aimed at shutting down public criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.\nResolution 2. Proposed by Heather Hunt. Seconded by Cllr Alexi Dimond\nFurther to the invitation from the Mayor of Nablus to the Mayor of Sheffield in 2019, Sheffield Green Party will encourage and support further twinning arrangements with Nablus; be that formally with SCC and also through informal linking with educational and cultural organisations in both cities.",

It also creates a new role for an elected councillor to become the Council’s “Migrant Champion,” who will be a point of contact for migrants, community groups and organisations to raise concerns and will work to ensure council services are open and available to migrants who need them. You can see their speeches here.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Cllr Dimond said,\nI’m delighted that Sheffield Council voted unanimously to reaffirm Sheffield as a City of Sanctuary. We sent a clear message to the government that we stand in solidarity with people seeking sanctuary, that we reject the anti-refugee laws, and that we support the right to work for asylum seekers. We voted to have an elected member who will be a Migrant Champion and ensure that we remain a welcoming city, the UK’s first City of Sanctuary.”\nThe debate came after another one on the cost-of-living crisis, where Cllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“We need to recognise that not everyone comes to the cost-of-living crisis equally. There are many people in entrenched poverty in the city, whether they have migrated to Sheffield or were born here. But being a migrant or having English as a second language is an additional barrier.”\nHowever, the meeting was not without controversy. Campaigners had originally hoped the motion would be cross-party but this was not taken up by other political groups and had to be proposed solely as a Green Party motion.\nCllr Douglas Johnson commented,\n“It was very disappointing that campaigners had to wait for nearly 3 hours because Labour and LibDem councillors voted against holding the debate when the public gallery was full. It was also sad to see Labour and LibDems vote together and delete the record of the local organisations that have signed the pledge to fight the anti-refugee laws.\n“Some of these groups helped to develop what we all hoped would be a cross-party motion. Removing their names was a further snub to the work of City of Sanctuary Sheffield, ASSIST Sheffield, Development and Empowerment of Womens Advancement (DEWA), South Yorkshire Migration and Asylum Action Group (SYMAAG) and Sheffield Association for the Voluntary Teaching of English (SAVTE)”\nFor more information, please contact Douglas Johnson at douglas.johnson@councillor.sheffield.gov.uk\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nThe Migrant Champion is an unpaid role.\n14% of people living in Sheffield were born outside the UK.\nThe text of the motion is on the Council agenda at https://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=154&MId=8830\nMore detail on the motion is at: https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2023/06/28/greens-call-on-council-to-recommit-to-its-support-for-migrants/",

There is a long established 11.30pm planning curfew that operates in the Ecclesall Rd and Sharrow Vale area. This was originally agreed for the area by the Planning Inspectorate in February 2014.\nAll three Broomhill and Sharrow Vale Green Councillors welcome this site being brought back into use, but we have strong concerns over late night noise and disturbance in this established residential area. We really welcome that Founders and Co have brought this building back into use but they need to balance their business priorities with being a good neighbour to the surrounding community. To try and avoid creating worry for residents we encourage licensing officers to make it clear to future applicants that 11.30pm closure is a minimum licensing condition in and around the area.”",

Green Councillors got the Council to commit to doing Newfield Block and Callow Towers first as they had no CCTV installed in the first place.\nIt’s been reported that there have been at least 14 arson attacks in the block prior to the murder in April including one to a wheelie bin inside the communal area of the block and another in the laundry room.\nGleadless Valley Green Party Cllr Alexi Dimond said:\n“I have been working with residents to demand CCTV be installed in the Callow Blocks for two years since I was elected in May 2021.\n“The Callow Tower blocks were to my knowledge the only high rise blocks in the city not to have CCTV and were subject to numerous arson attacks over the last few years.\n“Sadly the CCTV was not installed earlier as it may have prevented the tragic murder of Abdullah Hassan.\n“I hope these measures will help people in the Callow Blocks feel more secure and reduce the risk of further incidents in the future.”",

Bolton Conservative MP Chris Green, for example, recently claimed it would be “legitimate” to do so.\nThis seems perverse, given that we are in a race to prevent catastrophic climate warming and coal produces more carbon dioxide than any other fossil fuel.\nNot to mention the pollution that coal produces, including mercury, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide, which causes acid rain.\nWorld leaders must agree on 2030 emissions reductions targets to have any hope of reaching net zero carbon by 2050. With November’s COP 27 international climate change conference on the horizon, the UK will appear hypocritical if it announces plans to open coal mines while trying to persuade other nations to abandon coal power.\nSome see controversial carbon capture technology as the solution to the energy crisis and the climate emergency. This includes supporters of the Drax Power Station in Selby, Yorkshire, which claims to be ‘a source of renewable energy’.\nIn fact, Drax is the UK’s biggest carbon emitter, releasing over 13 million tonnes of CO2 from burning wood in 2020. Drax uses about 7 million tonnes of wood pellets a year, equivalent to about 25 million trees. A recent Panorama investigation found that Drax was sourcing wood pellets from cutting down ancient forest in Canada, not waste wood and sawdust as it claims.\nInstead of trying to boost the UK’s energy security by extracting more fossil fuels, the Government should be helping us reduce energy use by insulating our houses which will cut our spiralling fuel bills.\nA fast, cheap and sustainable way to secure UK energy security would be to adopt clean renewable forms of energy. Sheffield Green Party has produced proposals for Sheffield Council to increase the amount of energy produced in the city from renewable technologies such as solar, wind and heat pumps.\nCouncillor Ruth Mersereau, City Ward, Sheffield Green Party",

Hundreds were left stranded as public transport was cut off and roads flooded. These floods have harmed those with the least capacity to rebuild their homes and have left many of us worse off.\nUnfortunately, these “once in a blue moon” events are becoming more and more frequent. As the climate crisis escalates, extreme weather events are becoming more common. The recent floods were prompted when the average rainfall for the entire month of November fell in South Yorkshire and North Derbyshire in 24 hours.\nThe opportunity of the climate crisis is to invest in measures to bring communities together, such as the community building around flood resilience in Kelham Island, where residents spent time helping each other prevent local flooding. By contrast, the current government’s response to this month’s floods has been deeply inadequate. It has refused to acknowledge that flood prevention schemes are underfunded and often protect one community at the expense of another, as Doncaster knows.\nTo stop extreme weather’s devastating effect in the future, we need urgent action on the climate crisis and a new approach to flood prevention. We need Green Party MPs in the north to help deliver that.\nThe Green Party have pledged to protect the floodplains, farmland and national parks of this country. In doing so, we protect our communities. We will campaign to maintain, enhance and restore our forests through rewilding, mitigating floods and improving our air and soil. Green MPs will push for funding of innovative research on flood prevention, working with local authorities to update them on new techniques. We will push for water-sensitive design in new homes.\nIf you want to be represented by a party that has climate action and protection of communities at its core, vote Green on December 12th.\nCllr Alison Teal, Green Party candidate for Sheffield Central\nWritten for ‘Voices’ in the Sheffield Telegraph.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

This would reduce congestion for all road users while improving dangerous air pollution and road safety.”\nResponding to the current plans, Emily Brooke-Davies, of Sheffield Green Party, said,\n“The inner ring road and junction scheme is a costly plan, that will serve to increase traffic and air pollution through Kelham Island without bringing any noticeable benefits.\n“As someone who walks through this area, I’m familiar with how difficult it is to cross here and, having looked at the plans, I hold no hope for it being any easier.\n“I feel the money spent on this could be better spent to make it easier to use other forms of transport.”\nCampaigner Ruth Mersereau, added,\n“The reaction from both Kelham Island Community Association and from CycleSheffield was to oppose the widening, as it will increase traffic and air pollution and just make it much harder to cross the road, whilst bringing no benefits to residents there.\nWidening the inner ring road is the wrong answer. It will just lead to more traffic, more air pollution and more congestion.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“This is a short-term and short-sighted scheme and demonstrates everything that is wrong about Sheffield’s transport strategy. If this scheme is all about the 5,000 new jobs to be created as the West Bar area develops, it is a backward look to the past where everyone is expecting to drive to work and park outside their office.\nIt is very disappointing to be told there is no business case for cycling and walking infrastructure.

They also call for any new council housing to be built with a high standard of thermal efficiency, protecting residents from fuel poverty.\nIn a major step towards addressing the climate emergency, the Green councillors propose a new team of six environmental sustainability officers to ensure that Sheffield is able to tackle the climate emergency.\nSheffield Greens have tabled an amendment calling for a work-place parking levy on larger employers. This work-place parking levy will generate income for the city that will be reinvested into public and active transport.\nThe amendments also provide for the protection of segregated cycleways and the running of free public transport in the run-up to Christmas. It is also proposed that the Electric FreeBee bus service is reintroduced in the city centre, with the service running every ten minutes.\nThe amendments pave the way for a fairer, greener city, in which all are safe, warm and able to enjoy the wonders that Sheffield has to offer. Sheffield Greens are committed to improving the lives of all residents by taking radical action to clean our air, support a strong local economy, provide excellent public transport, local energy production and increasing public amenities and green spaces.\nGreen Group leader Councillor Douglas Johnson:\n“I am very proud to be part of the Green group of councillors, who have produced an impressive and comprehensive package of investments for real change.\n“We are proposing major investments in warmer homes, better public transport, walking and cycling, and a better designed city to live in. We will promote healthy lifestyle choices, improve air quality, and drive changes in public transport policy. The Green Party budget proposals also offer real help for people living in fuel poverty, poor quality housing and on low incomes. Our budget will also provide 34 permanent jobs directly employed by the Council, in addition to the increased employment in the voluntary sector and from capital investment . Our proposals will put sustainable and affordable choices within reach of all Sheffielders.”\nUpdate\nRead the budget speeches from Green councillors Douglas Johnson and Paul Turpin:\n- Douglas Johnson budget speech – 4th March 2020 (pdf)\n- Paul Turpin budget speech – 4th March 2020 (pdf)\nNotes\n- The Council budget will be set at its meeting on Wednesday 4th March at 2pm\n- Agenda http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=7340\n- Read the full amendment (pdf)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Low emission vehicles and private cars would be exempt.\nThe Green Party has always campaigned on the dangers of vehicle emissions which contain nitrogen oxides and particulates which have been proved to worsen the risk of asthma, lung and heart diseases, strokes and Alzheimer’s and cause 500 early deaths in Sheffield alone\nWe are really pleased the council are proposing this, but have several concerns:\n- The council is asking the government for £40 million to set up the scheme and support vehicle conversion. We are in favour of the scheme, but only if it receives sufficient government funding: an unfunded CAZ which ends up increasing bus and taxi fares would be a disaster for hard-pressed travellers and for the future of our ailing public transport. Above all, it could reduce public support for measures to make our environment more healthy.\n- Any funds created by the zone must be ring-fenced and publicly accounted to show they are being put to good use to improve public transport.\n- The scheme must be accompanied by the Council continuing its programme to introduce cleaner engines in public service vehicles. Support should also be provided for the replacement of vans and taxis which small businesses often rely on.\n- The bottom line is that there are too many vehicles on our roads, and queuing is a big waste of time and petrol money. The only long-term solution is to make it cheaper and easier for people to use public transport instead and clear the roads. This would add the benefit of making the streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians and encourage active travel. More Park and Ride schemes on the outskirts of the city would reduce air pollution still further.\n- If the CAZ doesn’t bring sufficient air quality improvements, the council might be forced to consider further measures such as inclusion of private vehicles in the scheme, higher parking charges, a workplace parking levy, supermarket and shopping mall charges for parking or the extension of the supertram network. Those measures would be justified if they are what it takes to make the city centre’s air fit to breathe. But, whilst measures to help the public would hopefully be put in place, they would cause more cost and personal inconvenience to many drivers.\nTo reduce the need for all this, we really need to get travellers back on the buses and to encourage this, we need a properly integrated transport system with cheaper, cleaner, faster bus services reaching all parts of the city.\nPlease be sure to have your say on the Clean Air Zone consultation when it comes out. This will not for a while as the council will wait for government approval of the plans before consulting, probably in spring next year.\nTo support online petition for better bus services in our region, please go to: bit.ly/savesybus\nRoy Morris,\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments. We do reserve the right not to publish comments that may cause offence.\nOne thought on “Green comments on Clean Air Zone”",
  "https_sheffieldgreenparty_org_uk_council-election-and-referendum-2021_ruth-flagg-abbey_/https_sheffieldgreenparty_org_uk_2023_02_27_clean-air-zone-starts-today/content_246.html": "The Clean Air Zone became operational this morning. Here Cllr Douglas Johnson explains 20 important things you need to know about it.\n1. The Clean Air Zone charges for buses, HGVs and vans come into force on Monday 27th February. The CAZ has been several years in the making and was formally approved in principle by the (Labour & Green) Co-operative Executive in October 2021.\n2. Sheffield Green Party has campaigned for action on air pollution for many years. Air pollution contributes to premature deaths and chronic respiratory illness every year in Sheffield. We often quoted the figure of 500 early deaths a year. Due to progress in vehicle emissions over several years, this is more likely to be in the region of about 360 early deaths every year in Sheffield. It is still a public health issue. It especially affects children, whose lungs are still developing.\n3. The CAZ is a legal requirement because of the government’s failure to address illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide. It is not about carbon emissions or pollution from particulate matter but is in line with reducing these too.\n4. The aim of the CAZ is to incentivise upgrading polluting vehicles. There is a carrot – millions of pounds in grants for businesses – and a stick – charges for vehicles which pollute.\n5. The CAZ does not include charging private cars, motorbikes or SUVs. Sheffield Green Party argued that the council should at least have included a proposal to charge cars when consulting on it in 2018. There is no prospect now of charging cars under the CAZ.\n6. You can check online if your vehicle is liable to the CAZ charge. The vehicle checker is at https://www.gov.uk/clean-air-zones.\n7. Most buses have been retrofitted and will not be subject to the charge. The council obtained grants to upgrade 292 buses and there was enough left over to do another 16. This means fares will not increase because of the CAZ.\n8. Many HGVs and vans will not have to pay the charge. All Diesel vehicles manufactured since September 2016 will be Euro 6 standard and will comply. All petrol vehicles manufactured since 2006 will also comply.\n9. Black taxis (Hackney carriages) will not be charged until June.\n10. Drivers of older, polluting vans or private-hire taxis can apply for an exemption until June. This is at no cost, so it makes sense to do.\n11. There are millions of pounds available in grants for businesses to upgrade vehicles. grants to contribute towards the cost are typically £4,500 towards a van, £6,000 towards a hackney cab and £3,500 towards a private-hire taxi.\n12. So far, over 2,500 grant applications are being processed. Drivers will be exempt from any charges until their application is decided. So, it makes sense to apply.\n13. There is going to be a scheme for retrospective grants. This will help anyone who upgraded their vehicle since October 2021. This isn’t live yet but is worth being aware of.\n14. If you have to pay charges, you have to go online to the government website. You can pay the charge 6 days before or after your date of travel. Part of the reason is another incentive for businesses to upgrade to less polluting vehicles.\n15. Enforcement is by cameras on the inner ring road. This will be with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR).\n16. The Inner Ring road has been chosen because Sheffield’s geography means it controls the city’s road system. This is important so that the benefits of the scheme are felt in all areas of the city, not just the centre. Tackling air pollution is an equality issue. Without the ring road being included, the air pollution would not be brought back within legal limits soon enough.\n17. There is a risk of van drivers trying to rat-run through residential streets to avoid charges. However, these may not be economical for businesses in terms of extra fuel or time taken. The Star published an article promoting all the rat-runs they could find but this just makes it clear they aren’t going to be very effective except for a very small number of destinations.\n18. There are bound to be some teething issues as the system goes live.\n19. The CAZ won’t be making a profit. The charges from the CAZ will pay for the cost of operating the system – it creates several new jobs for people – and any surplus will go back into more air pollution measures.\n20. Full details of the CAZ scheme are available at www.sheffield.gov.uk/cleanair",

This mobility route is to pass through the City ward, so I’m keen that the route is unimpeded, and that the safety of people on bikes or foot is not compromised.\nEven if this proposed cycle route doesn’t proceed as planned yet, siting telecom equipment on pavements reduces the width of the footpath available to pedestrians. The siting of the equipment here would compromise the safety and mobility of pedestrians.\nAny alternative proposals by the telecoms company to site the equipment on footpaths elsewhere are unacceptable for the same reason. The telecoms company should negotiate with private landowners to site the telecoms equipment, instead of obstructing the public highway, pedestrian and cycle routes.”\nA similar objection by Green Councillors to a proposed mast and cabinets on Jessop Street in City Ward was successful. An appeal by the developer against refusal to the Planning Inspectorate failed. The Planning Inspector concluded that the siting of the equipment would compromise the safety and mobility of pedestrians and cycles due to the decreased width of the shared pedestrian cycleway and the resultant increase in the potential for conflict as a result.\nCllr Mersereau commented:\n“Phone companies should not look at public pavements for land grabs and assume they are there for the taking.”\nENDS\n1 – Link to the Planning Application – 23/01685/TEL | Installation oF 15m high slim-line monopole, supporting 6no. antennas, 3no. equipment cabinets and ancillary development (Application for determination if approval required for siting and appearance) | Telecomunications Equipment Land Opposite 53 East Bank Road Sheffield S2 3PP",

This is despite its own transport strategy stating that it wants to make cycling, walking and public transport the number one choices.\nWith 33% of Sheffield residents having no access to a car, this unimaginative scheme also reinforces inequality, yet again putting car drivers first.\nOn all counts, this is a missed chance for Sheffield City Council to catch up with other leading cities by offering cleaner, healthier and more efficient transport options.\nRuth Mersereau\nSheffield Green Party\nCandidate, City Ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It’s a triple success for Green councillors.\nSheffield Green Party have long called for the adoption of Joined Up Heritage Sheffield’s Heritage Strategy, our city’s very own grass-roots, inclusive strategy for buildings, people and culture. This will now become a core aspect of the City Council’s future policies and procedures.\nTwo other long-term Green Party initiatives were also agreed by the Strategy and Resources committee – the creation of a Sheffield City Council Heritage Officer post, and enhanced support and funding for our city’s many Conservation Areas.\nBroomhill and Sharrow Vale Green Party Councillor Brian Holmshaw, a founder member of Joined Up Heritage Sheffield said,\n“As a long term supporter of the city’s heritage, I’m overjoyed to see that we’ve finally recognised the central economic and social role that heritage plays in the city. I hope that placing it at the centre of city policies will help to stop some of the terrible decision-making that the council has made over the years. The recent debacle over the Market Tavern in the projected Castlegate Conservation Area, demonstrates this.\n“Retrofitting old buildings to a high environmental and conservation standard should always be the default position, so that we can continue to celebrate Sheffield’s buildings, its people and its stories into the future.\n“I look forward to the city council working more closely with the city’s key heritage stakeholders, with climate change-minded architects and with heritage professionals to improve how Sheffield looks and feels, both to its residents, and to visitors to the city.”\nCllr Henry Nottage, Green Party spokesperson on the Economic Development and Skills Committee said:\n“Historic England estimated that, in 2022, England’s heritage sector directly contributed between £15.8 and £17.5 billion to the national economy. Sheffield needs to be building on that success and getting its fair share of the heritage bonus. Putting in place a ‘dedicated heritage officer post in the city will help to do just that.\n“Investing in the preservation, refitting and ongoing use of heritage buildings and other historic places has huge economic benefits for individuals and communities. Protecting conservation areas can lead to increased tax revenues, more jobs, revitalised neighbourhoods and district shopping areas and a more vibrant local economy.”\nNotes\n1 – The heritage report to Strategy and Resources Committee on 21 February 2024 is here\n2 – Green councillors proposed the specific post of a heritage officer in their costed budget proposals in 2019. Prior to that, in 2018, they had called for action on protecting Castlegate’s heritage through conservation area status is here\n3 – Sheffield Green Party policy on Conservation and heritage practice is here",

It is an important area of heritage, situated opposite a cementation furnace and with the Holy Trinity Church, Aizlewood’s Mill and the remarkable Royal Exchange Buildings nearby.\nSo I made personal contact with the developer. We talked business and he agreed to withdraw his demolition notice and make use of the pre-application planning service to work up a suitable design.\nWhen the Planning Committee was faced this week with a disappointing plan to demolish this historic building and replace it with an uninspiring design of tiny bedsits, it is not surprising they were unimpressed.\nThe committee wanted to know why officers had rejected designs that would have allowed the original building to be retained.\nSo I was very pleased that many of the councillors took the unusual step of rejecting the planning officers’ recommendation that would allow this bland redevelopment to replace the existing building.\nThe sensible thing now would be for the developer and planning officers to look again at earlier designs that retain and restore the fabric of the historic building.\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It is clear that Cllr Lodge had profoundly mishandled the tree felling by private contractor Amey, and entirely lost the confidence of the people of the city of Sheffield. The swing from Labour to Greens and the Lib Dems in the May 3rd council elections showed clear dissatisfaction with how Labour is running the city.\nIt is disappointing that the departing Cllr Lodge was still trying to defend to the BBC the contract and private contractor. What both the council and Amey should do is listen to the people of Sheffield, who have come to profoundly distrust both.\nWe have already lost more than 5,000 mature, healthy trees that could still be cleaning up our air, improving our wellbeing and catering to our wildlife. They can’t be returned. We can only hope that Cllr Lewis Dagnall, Cllr Lodge’s replacement, will actually listen to the experts who have unanimously declared the felling programme to be environmentally disastrous.\nWe need a innovative, sustainable, holistic approach which takes account of the vital importance of maintaining canopy cover across the city.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Whilst local authorities such as Birmingham have “successfully” or “partially successfully” responded to 37.5% of freedom of information requests since late March, and [Green led] Lewes District Council responding positively to 75%, Sheffield City Council bottoms out with barely more than 12%.\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has posed enormous challenges to public bodies up and down the country. Local authorities are receiving lacklustre support from central Government despite facing unprecedented challenges. In light of this it is understandable that during the peak of the crisis normal rules and procedures did not apply in the way they ordinarily would.\nEven if we assume that Sheffield City Council (SCC) is acting in good faith and that there are legitimate reasons for these failings, it can’t be denied that there is also a pattern of behaviour prior to the pandemic which makes us question that good faith. Once hard won civil rights have been put on hold, those in power will be reluctant to give them back, and those whose authoritarian tendencies are already well documented will be the most reluctant of all. Following the Street Tree scandal, the rejection of a committee governance model and criticism from the information commissioner’s office, no council in Britain has quite such an autocratic reputation as the Labour controlled SCC.\nAs a Sheffield Green Party councillor candidate I will do my best to hold SCC accountable and ensure it does not use the pandemic to hide its faults. The council must deliver for the people of Sheffield through openness and transparency. That is why Sheffield Green Party is supporting the ‘It’s Our City’ campaign who have secured a referendum to run alongside Sheffield’s May 2021 local elections.\nBrian Holmshaw\nGreen Party Candidate, Broomhill and Sharrowvale ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It’s flown by! We have achieved a lot in this time but there is so much more we want to do. It’s also been nine months since my last “quarterly” blog so I’ll quickly catch up.\nOur work was interrupted in November when a general election was called. Personally, I wasn’t pleased with the decision made by the government and have never been less enthusiastic about an election. It all seemed to be on a hiding to nothing, but it ended up being much worse than that.\nThere was a lot of macho strutting about from the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems, all claiming they were about to go out and win the election. This of course was utter nonsense and I feel like it added to the lack of trust the public holds for these parties. Labour cannot outright win a general election now the SNP has so many seats, and Wales is not the solid red it used to be either. The best outcome anyone could have hoped for was an anti-Tory majority. Of course there was already an anti-Tory majority in parliament, but Labour weren’t interested in uniting.\nThe Fixed Terms Parliament act requires a two thirds majority to call a general election early, and if Labour had held off backing an election until we had two things, the UK today would have a very different look. Firstly, they should have insisted on a people’s vote on EU membership and secondly, a vote on electoral reform to a proportional system. By backing an election on the Tories’ terms, they essentially gave us a Tory government with a sizable majority.\nI had the honour of being selected as the Green candidate for Heeley. It was the first time I’ve been a candidate in a general election and I was shocked at the amount of work it involved. Aside from writing literature, film scripts and various other pieces for Sheffield Greens, I received about 600 emails in three weeks from members of the public and organisations asking me to support their particular cause.\nWe doubled our vote share from the previous general election and moved forwards to Christmas and New Year with a Tory PM, just as we’d had for the previous 10 years. Work started in earnest on winning some new seats in the local election before everything stopped as the Pandemic arrived in the UK. Rather than having another group of Green councillors to work with and having a successful referendum to change the way the council works, we were locked down.\nWith the lockdown came the democratic lock out. Council decision making was opaque before but with emergency rules now in place, all scrutiny has been blocked and decisions are being made behind closed doors.Reports are published afterwards, if at all, and without any option or possibility of scrutiny.\nSince the lockdown my work has largely been in supporting the community; something I am able and equipped to do, being embedded in the community I represent. I have continued to work with the Gleadless Valley foodbank; I have worked with them over the last year to expand the building and we finished the £20,000 project in March, thanks to several businesses giving their services at reduced costs, or even for free. I help with delivering food parcels and with the upkeep of their facilities. I also provide support in raising funds for the foodbank.\nI helped set up a project to raise funds for Faunagraphic to paint a mural at Meersbrook Park Pavilion, with Meersbrook Park After School Club and Playcentre. While the lockdown prevented the project from being completed within the planned time-frame, we are looking forward to seeing it completed once it’s safe to go ahead.\nI helped coordinate a poster campaign around Gleadless sharing information on how to get support during the pandemic, and I continue to participate in several mutual aid groups around Heeley and Meersbrook. I have been delivering activity packs and jigsaws to sheltered accommodation sites and generally fighting the residents’ corner when they have otherwise been isolated by care staff absences.\nI have supported the community with a public campaign to discourage people from having bonfires in gardens and allotments, continued the fight against showering our streets with glyphosate and spoken to Police about the increase in motorbikes in Cat Lane woods, encouraging them to make several arrests.\nMore recently I have asked the council and SYPTE to apply for government funding to reopen Heeley train station. This would be a game changer for the area and would open up the possibilities for introducing tram-trains to the south of the city.\nIn these difficult times we are trying to place ourselves between the useless and chilling Tory government and the people who will be affected most by their political and dangerous policy decisions. We are calling for the council to keep schools safe for staff and students by refusing to follow government guidance on partial reopening on 1st June.\nGreen councillors have always felt a great responsibility to the people we represent and carry the weight of expectation. Rest assured that we are always working hard and looking for the best way to do right by the people of Sheffield.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

There needs to be proper scrutiny of its work by a range of elected councillors.\n“I wanted to give the Health and Adult Social Care Scrutiny Committee a chance to ask for a formal role in looking at decisions made in the name of the ‘Accountable Care Partnership.’ It is the only cross-party committee that could scrutinise decisions. Unfortunately, the Cabinet member’s decision only allows the single-party Health and Well-being Board to have formal oversight of the decisions.”\n“I am very pleased this call-in has cross-party support. The role of scrutiny committees of elected councillors, who meet in public, is very important on a highly contentious issue like this.”\n“Scrutiny is essential where, so often, the word “transformation” means cuts to public services.\nNotes\n- The Individual Cabinet Member decision is at http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=1908\n- Cllr Douglas Johnson is the lead signatory to the call-in, which is supported by other councillors from the Green, LibDem and Labour groups\n- The reason given for the call-in is “because formal scrutiny arrangements for this highly contentious issue have been agreed only for the Health and Wellbeing Board but not for the Healthier Communities and Adult Social Care Scrutiny Committee, which is the only cross-party scrutiny available to the local authority.\n- A date for the scrutiny committee has yet to be set.\n- The decision being called in refers to the “Sheffield Place-Based Plan.” A draft of this plan was considered but not approved by the Scrutiny Committee in 2017.\n- The Sheffield Accountable Care Partnership is made up of senior executives of the hospitals, health trusts and clinical commissioning group (CCG) as well as Sheffield City Council.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The ongoing climate crisis is reason enough to invest in renewable energy over expensive, slow to deliver and risky nuclear energy. Statements by the new Prime Minister Liz Truss about reintroducing fracking and expanding domestic fossil fuels is dangerous folly. It will have no impact on energy bills and UK greenhouse gases are just as dangerous as those from overseas. Renewable Energy with Energy Storage offers the best option to produce clean energy with stable prices.”\nThe Green motion calls on the Council to assess which of its land and buildings has the most potential to generate energy from solar and wind, to incorporate solar during construction of all Council new build projects and to adopt planning policies that encourage developers to incorporate renewable energy production in their developments.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“The Renewable Energy Strategy, proposed by the Green Group will help people and businesses reduce their fuel bills and use renewable energy in their own homes and buildings. Another benefit is that it will help create secure skilled jobs for local people. We want all new council housing to incorporate solar panels but we also want the Council to establish an offer for private householders where they can install solar panels at no upfront cost by releasing some of the equity they have in their property, as has been done by other Councils .”\nMotion to Sheffield City Council – (This motion will no longer be heard on 14/9/22 and will go forward to a future Council meeting after the Queens Funeral)\nA Renewable Energy Strategy for Sheffield\nProposed by Cllr Christine Gilligan Kubo; seconded by Cllr Douglas Johnson\nThis Council believes\na. That, if Sheffield is to play its part in achieving the Paris Climate targets, meet its net zero target by 2030 and address the cost of living crisis, we need to reduce energy demand through energy efficiency measures such as retrofitting homes and other buildings; and to significantly raise the amount of energy we produce from renewable sources.\nb. Having more of our energy produced from renewable sources helps us control costs by having secure forms of energy generated locally. Energy security means that the UK is less at the mercy of dubious and undemocratic regimes with poor human rights records that are often the suppliers of fossil fuels.\nThis Council resolves\nc. to ask the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Change Policy Committee to:\ni) Conduct an audit of the potential for renewable energy installations and energy efficiency measures on all Council land and property, draw up a priority list for installations based on the most potential to save energy and generate clean energy, and present it to the committee within 6 months.\nii) Install solar photovoltaics on all new build Council owned buildings where technically feasible, recognising that integrated roof systems are cheaper to install than retrofitting solar systems after construction.\niii) Create a Local Area Energy Plan for Sheffield that has the buy-in of the wider community and lead a local area energy planning process that involves both the network operators and other key stakeholders, including developers, energy experts and community energy groups\niv) Investigate establishing strategic partnerships with renewable and energy efficiency installers to help ensure certainty on cost and delivery of measures and report back to the Strategy and Resources Committee within 6 months.\nv) Encourage the establishment of partnerships with local Community Renewables organisations to enable low cost/no cost installations funded through citizens’ investments.\nvi) Maximise external funding to finance installations using Government, SYMCA and any ethical sources.\nvii) Use funding available for solar installations from Cooperatives on Council Buildings and encourage take up of this funding by large commercial organisations.\nviii) Encourage wider community investment in local renewable energy projects through a range of measures including but not limited to Community Share Offers and Municipal Bonds.\nix) Develop a compelling offer for private householders and Landlords to support the installation of solar photovoltaics and high cost energy efficiency measures.\nx) Encourage best practice in Planning to support renewable energy installations by developers and to create a low carbon energy supply;\nxi) Encourage renewable and energy efficiency skills by establishing links and relationships between our partners in the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency sectors with appropriate local training and education providers.\nxii) Ensure training opportunities and new skills are included in all projects and contracts related to energy efficiency and renewables should include commitments from contractors on providing training opportunities and new skills for local people.\nxiii) The Council should require new energy generation projects of 5MW or above to have at least 5% local ownership.",

Sheffield is the only major city to receive none of the £7 billion the government announced today.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, who leads the Green group on Sheffield City Council and is the Executive Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport, said,\n“I am acutely disappointed and frustrated that Sheffield and South Yorkshire have lost out on this major investment in bus services. This can only be bad news for the travelling public trying to get to jobs, homes and friends right across South Yorkshire. Improved bus services are better for people on the buses and also better for those who still have to use other forms of transport.\n“The Government said it would not fund areas that did not show sufficient ambition, including for improvements to bus priority. Sadly, the Bus Service Improvement Plan put forward under the Labour mayor Dan Jarvis’ leadership had so little ambition in it that – if fully successful – it would have meant fewer people using buses in the future.\n“That is why I refused to vote to endorse it at the Transport and the Environment Board of the Mayoral Combined Authority. I argued there needed to be much greater input from the public and interested parties to draw up the plan. The plan was approved by the Labour-controlled South Yorkshire Combined Authority.”\nBex Whyman, the Green Party candidate to be the next South Yorkshire Mayor, commented,\n“Dan Jarvis and the Labour leaders have really let South Yorkshire down at a time when people are crying out for better bus services and bus company employees for better pay and working conditions.\nIt’s clear to me that the only way forward is to elect a full time Green Mayor, I will disrupt the status quo and fight for the bus services that South Yorkshire deserves.\n“Climate change and air pollution both demand that we get as many people as possible to switch from private cars to public transport. As long as councils across South Yorkshire continue to undermine bus services by subsidising low-cost parking, the public will suffer.”\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n- The government announcement on the new £7 billion funding is here: https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cheaper-and-better-buses-in-7-billion-package-to-level-up-transport-outside-london/\n- Other regions won funds of £90m (Manchester), £160m (Newcastle) and £70m (West Yorkshire)\n- The South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority’s Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP) is published here: https://southyorkshire-ca.gov.uk/Explore_Transport.

More locally, it would lead to an increase in car and HGV journeys across the Peak District and worsen the almost permanent congestion in Glossop. But now the Government has given it the green light. Sheffield Green Party submitted an objection before it was granted planning consent by the Government. Please support CPRE Peak District and South Yorkshire‘s legal challenge to this scheme –\n“Heavy traffic through Mottram, on the Sheffield to Manchester route, has been a long-term issue. But rather than more road-building and private car mileage, we would prefer to see the money spent on better public transport links between the two cities. There must be an incentive for more people to travel by rail and not by private car.”\nSheffield Green Party has responded to the consultation on the Mottram by-pass, saying increased road capacity will increase congestion in Sheffield’s road hotspots\nThe consultation by Highways England, asked for views on road building to increase traffic capacity on the A57 Snake Pass route between Sheffield and Manchester. Sheffield Council, along with High Peak Borough Council and Tameside Council, has already declared a climate emergency.\nSheffield Greens are concerned that improving the attractiveness of the Snake Pass will mean more cars squeezing through Broomhill and Malin Bridge to reach the A57.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“Heavy traffic through Mottram, on the Sheffield to Manchester route, has been a long-term issue. But rather than more road-building and private car mileage, we would prefer to see the money spent on better public transport links between the two cities. There must be an incentive for more people to travel by rail and not by private car.”\nChristine Gilligan Kubo, Hillsborough Green Party commented:\n“This council must prioritise public transport, walking and cycling; and stop nodding through damaging planning applications that bring many more car journeys to blight local communities. Coming soon to this area are a new Lidl at the bottom of Stannington Rd and a retail park with an Aldi opposite the Wednesday ground on Penistone Rd. All these direct more traffic through an already clogged and polluted Malin Bridge gyratory. Malin Bridge and Hillsborough Corner face gridlock and the trams are also delayed by this congestion which needs to be addressed urgently.”\nRoy Morris, of Sheffield Green Party, said,\n“I frequently shop in Broomhill and am very aware of the bad smell and the effect the poor air quality is having on our health. Therefore, I am strongly opposed to anything that would increase the volume of traffic through the neighbourhood. So, if this Mottram by-pass is going to get more people giving up on the train and going by car, and driving through Broomhill, then I’d be against it. as well as the train, there is the SnakeX57 bus they’ve just started, that comes through here empty. But more traffic through here? No thank you.”\nSheffield Green Party’s response to Highways England states:\nI am writing to respond to the consultation. I am the leader of the Green Party group of councillors on Sheffield City Council. This response includes some expert views of our local members which we trust is helpful in explaining why we oppose this road expansion.\nWe believe that a reduction in road transport and radical moves towards a transport network, based to a much greater extent on public transport, are essential to meet the challenges of air pollution and climate change. Therefore, all new road expansion proposals need to be examined especially carefully at a time when travel habits and policy are rapidly changing.\nHeavy traffic through Mottram, as a route from Sheffield to Manchester, has been a long-term issue. The link roads are designed partly to relieve this but would push the most serious congestion further east. Tintwistle and Glossop, particularly Dinting Vale, already have serious, almost continuous, day-time congestion which, to a large degree, is independent of the Mottram congestion. It is, however, worsened by the latter. Given that new roads attract greater volumes of traffic, we should assume those areas will suffer even more. It is naïve – negligent even – to assume otherwise. The tranquillity of the Peak District National Park in between them would also be clearly harmed.\nYet, there is a much more serious and wider issue that is not being addressed. This is to urgently reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the climate emergency that Parliament and numerous local authorities across the country, including Sheffield City Council, have recognised.\nIn October 2019, High Peak Council also declared a Climate Emergency and “pledged to work towards a carbon neutral High Peak by 2030.” In November 2019, Derbyshire County Council pledged to become carbon neutral by 2032. In February 2020, Tameside Council declared a Climate Emergency and is now committed to become ‘carbon neutral’ by 2042 target with 13.1% year on year reductions in climate emissions.\nThe link road proposals should be assessed against these ambitions. Yet Highways England’s Preliminary Environmental Information Report (PEIR) Vol 1 dismissively states: –\n“14.3.11 There is no accepted technical or policy guidance on how to determine the significance of a project’s effects on climate. “\nHowever, the Government’s own official Climate Change Committee has repeatedly warned that current policies will not put the UK on a path towards meeting the legally binding Climate Change Act. Its recent recommendations for more rapid emissions reductions (by 68% rather than 61% by 2030) have been accepted. The Government clearly accepts the need for more rapid action but there still a wide gap between the targets and the policies designed to meet them.\nWe therefore believe it appropriate to compare the stated impacts of the scheme to The Tameside Council climate ambitions, which are supported by recent robust evidence. Some of the scheme would be in High Peak so, in practice, the impacts would be divided between the two Local Authority areas. [https://carbonbudget.manchester.ac.uk/reports/E08000008/ ]\nThis Tyndall Centre report shows that Tameside has a carbon budget of 4.57 MtCO2e for the period 2025-2032 [this figure is derived from Figure 1]. If the proportion of this for surface transport is 27%, as it is nationally [PEIR 14.4.1], this would be 1.23 MtCO2e.\nThe emissions attributable to the scheme over this period are given in Section 14.6 of the PEIR. If the construction emissions are accounted for evenly between 2025 and 2032 and in the transport sector, total emissions from the scheme up to the end of 2032 (the end of the national Fifth Carbon Budget period) would be 110757t. This represents 9% of Tameside’s notional transport carbon budget. For just two link roads, that is clearly a disproportionate share of the total emissions targets for an entire Local Authority area (or more accurately, a smaller share spread across two).\nThe various authorities in the area need to develop a coherent transport strategy which recognises how quickly greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced. It would also bring air quality within legal limits. These new link roads cannot reasonably fit with any such plan. New road building will have to be minimised, in common with everywhere else in the UK.\nAuthorities and their partners in both Manchester and Sheffield are developing transport strategies that involve reductions in road traffic. These involve a much greater emphasis on providing facilities local to where people live, active travel and public transport. These plans would be hampered by increased road traffic between the two cities.\nPublic subsidy for this road-building scheme would tilt the attractiveness of the choice between road and rail travel between Sheffield and Manchester in favour of more private motors. This would inevitably worsen air pollution and climate change at all points along the route overall. It would also increase the knock-on effects of congestion in the Sheffield districts of Malin Bridge and Broomhill at the entrances to the A57 route.\nWe urge that this scheme be withdrawn because of the wider climate change issue and also because of the local impact on Sheffield residents.",

He has contacted South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) and Sheffield City Council to urge them to apply for this funding with a view to reopen Heeley Train Station.\nSouth Sheffield is an area not served by the city’s tram network and has a reputation for unreliable bus services. Air pollution due to traffic congestion is among the highest in the city at the location of Heeley Train Station.\nPaul says, “The Government is releasing £20 million to reopen old railway stations in it’s New Station Fund and we want the Council to apply for some of this money for Heeley Station. The people of my ward, and neighbouring wards, would love to see Heeley Station reopen. It is an excellent location for a station and would provide a reliable and quick transport option for people to travel between Sheffield and Manchester.\n“The original subway entrances are still there, just the station infrastructure needs putting back in place. People are proud of the built heritage in this area and reopening Heeley station would undoubtedly be celebrated by locals.”\nCllr Alison Teal, Green councillor for Nether Edge and Sharrow, said, “Sheffield Green Party has long supported alternative transport solutions, including reopening now valuable rail stations as part of the battle to reduce air pollution and combat the climate crisis. As a councillor, Olivia Blake MP, who is now calling for a local station to be reopened, voted against this when Greens suggested it, in 2017.”\nNotes\n- New stations RailFuture Briefing on the ‘Restoring Your Railway Fund’\n- Sheffield Green Party rail franchise consultation response\n- Better facilities and a vision for the future of rail\n- Sheffield City Council Agenda item – Notice of Green Party Motion Regarding “Transport Funding” – Given By Councillor Robert Murphy and to be Seconded by Councillor Douglas Johnson\n- Restoring Your Railway Fund – GOV.UK\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

In fact, he has already made his decision if the consultation questionnaire is anything to go by.\nThe reality is that Labour’s Administration already controls 85% of the spending centrally but doesn’t spend it according to deprivation measures. It now wants to impose its top-down control on the remaining 15%.\nWhat Cllr Steinke also fails to explain is why the Labour Administration has held up this process for 3½ years and whether this is anything to do with the fact there is a Green Party majority in City Ward, where a lot of the money has been generated. Residents have been negatively affected by years of building work and loss of amenities. They rightly expect they will receive the intended compensation to the community, whether that is upgrading of children’s parks or sorting out traffic problems in the city centre.\nLabour’s proposals are to centralise control of the money and switch it to areas where Labour have more councillors.

But the number of people who are severely affected by these changes is growing. Though many of the policy solutions to the current crisis are the responsibility of national government that does not mean that we should do nothing locally and that is why we are calling for a Cost of Living crisis action plan so the Council can lead along with our other public and voluntary sector partners in agreeing effective action at a local level to address this crisis.”\nThe second area the Greens proposed was to be the first Council in the country to introduce a Corporate Opportunities Register,\nCouncillor Argenzio said,\n“All Councils are required to have a Corporate Risk Register where senior officers of the Councils demonstrate that we are properly prepared for things like changes in legislation that impact on the Council, emergency situations, things like cyber attacks and natural disasters. What we don’t have is a Corporate Opportunities Register where our senior officers are reporting on new funding streams from Government and other sources to help us achieve the council’s objectives and on partnerships we can develop with the private and voluntary sectors to help us to work together effectively. We have a structured approach to dealing with risk and we need one to identify the opportunities we can take.”\nThe third area that Councillor Argenzio identified was the need to improve the service that people receive from Sheffield City Council,\n“As Councillors, we are all on the front line when it comes to helping people with their everyday problems and issues. We know when the system is failing because people come to us if they can’t get through to the right officer, if they don’t get a response to a concern they have raised or if the Council’s web-based services do not work for them because they don’t have online access. This is why we are asking the Council to produce a Customer Services Action Plan so we can drive improvement in the service we offer to the people of Sheffield”.\nCllr Argenzio concluded by saying\n“I recommend these policy initiatives as ones that we can call our own across the party political boundaries. Let us work on delivering them together and build a new way of working that demonstrates that while differences exist that we have common cause in wanting a better future for Sheffield.”",

The report called on the council to “no longer issue new, or renew existing, green parking permits from 31st July 2025”. This will mean that the scheme will be phased out by July 2026.\nGreen Permits were originally introduced in Sheffield in 2005, when there were only a handful of electric vehicles in Sheffield, as an incentive to switch from petrol or Diesel to electric. Since then, sales of electric vehicles have rocketed, with over 9,300 new Ultra Low Emission Vehicles registered in Sheffield in 2024. There are now 5802 Green Permits, but there are fewer than 1800 Council-operated parking spaces in the city centre.\nGreen Party Councillor Alexi Dimond, who is Deputy Chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Committee, said,\n“I am glad that the Council has finally agreed to phase out unfair free parking for certain private vehicles. The Green Party has long called for an end to ‘Green Permits.’. This has been a proposal we have pursued in our budget amendments in previous years. We are glad the Council has now seen the strength of our argument for their removal.\n“While electric and ultra-low emissions vehicles are preferable to more polluting ones, the council should be encouraging people to come into the City Centre by public transport and by active travel – not by private car. Subsidising people who will generally have higher incomes is not fair and reduces funds to pay for other services. With so many ‘Green Permit’ holders being commuters who stay in their parking spaces all day, there are fewer spaces for people who pay for their parking spaces, fewer spaces for blue badge holders, and fewer spaces for those who genuinely need to bring a vehicle into the city centre. This also means increased congestion, air pollution and road danger, as people drive around looking for a space.”\nThe council will continue to support the take up of electric vehicles by investing £125,000 for the installation of Electric Vehicle Charging points and by accessing further funding from the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority to support this.",

The Lib Dem Lord Mayor, supposedly neutrally chairing the meeting, could have interjected and controlled this behaviour but rather than do this, she commended it and encouraged it. Repeatedly cutting off Cllr Douglas Johnson while he was answering questions posed by the public, and publicly shaming Cllr Alison Teal for asking her to remind petitioners that aggressive language and shouting at councillors will not be tolerated. To my horror Lord Mayor Gail Smith claimed that it wasn’t abusive, but passionate! I saw Green councillors speak clearly, coherently and passionately without having to shout or be aggressive.\nThe public disengage when they see this type of behaviour and are discouraged from standing for election. The impact on councillors’ mental health must be awful, this sort of behaviour would not be tolerated in most workplaces and shouldn’t be tolerated in the council.\nThe Local Government Association says, “There are growing concerns about the impact an increasing level of public intimidation and toxicity of debate is having on our country’s democratic processes, particularly at a local level.”\nThis attitude is exactly what leads to physical violence towards elected representatives; with Barnsley councillor – Pauline Markham – recently attacked in a park for simply being a councillor, the Labour leader – Sir Kier Starmer – needing to be rescued by police and we need no reminders of the murders of Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\nThe culture of political discourse has delved many depths but those of us who still hope for a better future were optimistic these days were behind us in Sheffield. By behaving in the manner they do, they are damaging our democracy and endangering all who enter public service by standing for election. The sight of the Lord Mayor cheerleading this behaviour was more than disappointing, it was depressing.",

Failure to respond quickly combined with a series of disastrous decisions led to more daily deaths here than in the rest of Europe combined by early June.\nSheffield health professionals have responded quickly and effectively to the Coronavirus crisis. Sheffield Teaching Hospitals Trust decided to test all symptomatic NHS workers 11 days before most other areas. They got the tests done quickly so anyone testing negative could return to work. Sheffield’s Director of Public Health, Greg Fell, has shown consistent leadership during the crisis, including on reopening schools only when it is safe to do so.\nSheffield Green Party commends Sheffield Community Contact Tracers – a groundbreaking volunteer project started by current and former health professionals. Many were exasperated by the government ending “track and trace” on March 12th when cases were at manageable levels. Until a vaccine is found and can be distributed worldwide, track and trace is the only way to manage and restrict the spread of the virus. SCCT’s pilot report shows the importance of creating local teams with a clear understanding of the local area to track and trace and offer support through self-isolation.\nThe lack of a contact tracing system from mid-March to late May has cost lives. Local council and health leaders haven’t been given sufficient time, powers, data or financial resources to prepare for the volume of cases and outbreaks expected to be identified by the government’s “NHS Test and Trace”, launched on May 27th.\nHowever, ongoing legitimate concerns about government Covid 19 actions must be put to one side for the common good. Health professionals, councils and the general public all need to co-operate to help make NHS Test and Trace work effectively as quickly as possible. A vaccine remains a long way off so many more lives are at stake.\nIf identified and contacted by NHS Test and Trace, we all need to self-isolate for 14 days to prevent the spread of the virus. In return, urgent government financial support must be provided to those asked to isolate who need it.\nBrian Holmshaw\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

His argument is that driving at slower speeds uses more fuel so driving faster is better for everyone’s health.\nThe argument is wrong because cars only run most efficiently at steady speeds. In town, drivers can’t maintain those higher speeds because they have to slow down or stop a lot.\nDriving in the city centre at 20mph or less means less accelerating and braking. This will save fuel, improve air pollution and – most significantly – save lives through safer roads. As the 20’s Plenty campaign points out, statistics show you are seven times less likely to die if hit at 20mph than at 30mph.\nWe still need far more friendly streets for pedestrians, cyclists and bus users but a city centre 20mph zone is a step in the right direction.\nDouglas Johnson,\nSheffield Green Party\nCouncillor for City Ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It has been common for people asking me in the street what we are supposed to do and too often I have had to shrug my shoulders and admit that I am just as confused as they are!\nThe struggle with mental health has been experienced across the board, with nobody immune from the pressures of lockdown. The anxiety and fear of the virus compounded by the isolation we have all had to endure, unable to see our friends and loved ones. There have also been rising cases of domestic abuse. Existing systems are straining under the weight. We must remember that everyone is in the same boat and those working to help others are just as vulnerable to the stresses of lockdown as those they are trying to help.\nI think one of the worst things right now is that there seems to be no end in sight, and after six months of lockdown we appear to be in no better position than we were in February. I lay significant blame at the feet of the government. We have an incompetent and ideologically far right government and it is of great concern that they are in charge in this most dire of situations.\nOn a more positive note there is hope the future will be brighter than the past. We have seen that some things are more important than more money and more possessions. Like family, home and quality of life. Simple things like walking around your neighbourhood are uplifting and the many mutual aid groups that have set up have brought neighbours together, often when they have never spoken before. These new connections people have made with their surroundings, nature and community will last longer than the lockdown. We must focus on what is good and try our best to do more of that, especially now our energy and patience is waning.\nI have been very busy in my role as a councillor throughout lockdown. For the councillors who like to sit in the town hall talking in committees, work stopped at the beginning of March, but for those of us who are embedded in our communities, work didn’t even slow down. I was helping to make sure everyone was supported and that there was someone doing something everywhere, finding any gaps and making sure they were filled.\nI pressed for action to be taken at the Blackstock Road household waste site to deal with traffic and kept the pressure on even after yellow lines were painted. I drew attention to the devastation taking place in care homes and met with the managing director of a local home to discuss their problems. I have been helping constituents with housing problems and homelessness. Particularly difficult given the suspension of several council departments, including the Sheffield Property Shop and the Repairs & Maintenance department. I kept the pressure on to make sure people got the help they needed.\nAs council meetings slowly began to re-emerge from the dark and dusty back rooms, where Labour had been making (bad) decisions, Green councillors tackled the council’s huge £16 million subsidy to Sheffield City Trust. Demanding better services for the public and greater transparency of how the money was being spent. I defended jobs in Sheffield, highlighted the money being sent to subsidise venues in North Yorkshire and I continue to hold the establishment to account.\nGreen councillors demanded greater democratic accountability from the Labour administration when they reneged on an agreement to reinstate motions at council meetings. They want to stifle debate and remove opposition ideas. Ideas that are vital to a strong and credible democracy, attempting to block any suggestion of there being an alternate way to their own.\nI have been pushing for better school dinners and making sure that the provider of them is held to account, despite an eagerness by some council officers to defend them. Something I will not give up on!\nI also had the honour of appearing in the Green Party political broadcast in October which was broadcast on BBC1 and ITV across the nation. Highlighting the difficulties of workers and how we don’t want to go back to how things were before, that they weren’t so great, and better is possible.\nAll in all, it’s been a tough six months but with hard work and determination I feel I have achieved something positive for my constituents and the city of Sheffield. I am still grateful for the opportunity to make a difference and do not take the responsibility lightly. I will keep trying my best and sincerely hope we have a future worth having together.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

To balance the finances, officers are advising that the Council raises the Service Charge to ensure their costs are covered. Sheffield City Council has not recovered its costs, for things like energy, water, maintenance and repairs, with a gap of £263k in the last financial year. Options were put to the Committee of recovering the costs within 1 to 8 years. Green Councillors proposed greater investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy to help reduce energy demand, energy costs and carbon emissions.\nCouncillor Alexi Dimond said,\n“Energy costs for the Crystal Peaks Shopping Centre in 2022/23 have risen by 50%, to £116k, in the last financial year and represent a significant proportion of the service charge. The Council does need to ensure it recovers its costs but it also has a responsibility to reduce carbon emissions, energy demand and therefore energy costs.\n“We need to help traders by taking action to improve the energy performance of our buildings. That means investment in renewable technology such as solar panels on the roof and investigating how the energy efficiency of the building can be improved to help reduce energy costs. This is the way that we can ensure costs are kept under control in the long term, by providing certainty on energy costs for Crystal Peaks traders.”\nReferences\n(Public Pack)Agenda Document for Waste & Street Scene Policy Committee, 15/11/2023 10:00 (sheffield.gov.uk)",

We see every day the impact of rising carbon emissions on our local and global environment. We know if these emissions aren’t addressed it will only get worse. Airport expansion cannot be part of any serious plans to address climate change.\n“According to the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government’s official advisers on averting catastrophic climate breakdown, in a 2023 report “there should be no net airport expansion unless the carbon-intensity of aviation is outperforming the Government’s emissions reduction pathway and can accommodate the additional demand.\n“On 17th January, the Met Office reported that ‘Following the fastest annual rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration in the Mauna Loa record between 2023 and 2024, the increase between 2024 and 2025 is forecast to remain faster than that required to limit global warming to 1.5°C.’ (3)\n“It makes no sense at all for the South Yorkshire Mayor, Oliver Coppard to support the re-opening of Doncaster Sheffield Airport. Does he really think it is a good idea to provide £105.2 million worth of loans over the next ten years, at a low interest rate, in effect a public subsidy. This is in addition to the £138 million of SMCA gainshare funding that has already been allocated. The private sector isn’t willing to put their money into the airport. They can see it is a white elephant, and a flying one at that! Following the Energy Secretary’s statement perhaps it is a dead duck as well.\n“Surely it would be more cost effective, economically beneficial and contribute to the region’s climate change goals, if this money was made available to provide more public transport options which would allow people to travel around easily and reduce their reliance on the car. More people would benefit, enabling them to go about their everyday lives commuting, shopping and visiting friends.”",

Cllr Angela Argenzio said the Planning Committee ignored the Neighbourhood Plan, its own planning policies and the environment in recommending approval of the planning application\nGreen Party Councillor Angela Argenzio for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale who spoke against the proposal at the Planning and Housing Committee meeting said,\n“The application to build the 13 apartments in the Broomhill Conservation Area was clearly in conflict with the Broomhill, Broomfield, Endcliffe, Summerfield and Tapton Neighbourhood Plan (BBEST) (1) which said that 50% of developments should be 3 bedroom homes to meet local needs. In this development only 2 of the 11 properties are 3 bedrooms. So a plan which has been developed by the local community and approved by the Council is simply not being taken into account.\nThe other concern is that the local community had not been notified that this plan was coming to committee. The planning application was submitted in Summer 2021 and so when we found out, a few days ago. that it was coming to the Planning Committee, it took many people in the community by surprise.\nThe loss of woodland due to this development is a loss to nature and to the local community. Local residents who lack gardens can currently look out on trees. Now with this development they will have that replaced with flats, which totally ignores the importance of green spaces on people’s mental health .\nThe Council’s planning officer advising the committee said that the trees were in poor condition because they were covered in ivy, but the Royal Horticulture Society are quite clear that ivy is not harmful to trees :\n‘ivy is not directly harmful to trees and is beneficial to wildlife, control is not usually necessary’ (2)\nThe lessons from the Report into the Street Tree scandal by Sir Mark Lowcock, have still not been learned. When the views of ecologists are ignored in favour of development it diminishes biodiversity and our local environment. Local people are not being made aware of a planning application that will impact on their local environment. This shows that the recommendations from the report still need to be properly considered and embedded into the Council’s working practices and procedures.\nIt is clear that in this Planning Application that the Council has not properly considered nature, the impact on the Broomhill Conservation area or the community and I am very disappointed that this application has been passed.”\nThe meeting voted for the development with 2 against and 8 in favour. Cllr Bernard Little, the only Green in the Planning Committee meeting was against.\nReferences\n1 – BBEST Neighbourhood Plan – BBEST Neighbourhood Plan – Promoting the social, economic and environmental wellbeing of Broomhill, Broomfield, Endcliffe, Summerfield and Tapton\n2 – Royal Horticulture Society – Ivy on trees – Ivy on trees and as a ground cover weed / RHS Gardening",

Governments and industry have tried to ignore and deny the science that has alerted us to the dangers for decades. We have 12 short years, if we are lucky, to adapt our way of life. That’s why we are calling on Sheffield City Council, and Parliament, to declare a Climate Emergency.”\nCouncillor Martin Phipps, who is seconding the motion, said,\n“Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet and to our species. The recent IPCC special report on climate change warns us that we only have 12 years to avoid the worst of it. In line with this, we’re calling upon the council to make a definite commitment to become a carbon neutral city ASAP by bringing forward the council’s current target of 2050 to at latest 2030.\n“We need to act urgently, now, and I hope the council supports our motion which calls for a timetable to be drawn up on actions we need to take to achieve our target, and as a first step swapping to a 100% renewable electricity supply.”\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson added,\n“Electricity produced by wind, solar and tidal power is absolutely critical to the country’s energy security and survival and the decision where to purchase the Council’s electricity can make a significant difference to this industry.”\nNotes\n- The Council agenda for Wednesday 6th February 2019 is at http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=154&MId=7007\n- Sheffield Council’s existing Green City Strategy states, “By 2050, Sheffield will be a zero carbon city.”\n- The Strategy also states “by 2018, we will produce a ‘Sustainable Energy Action Plan and sign-up to a recognised carbon reporting framework.”\n- The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its major report in October 2018, which can be found at: http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/\n- The Green Party motion is:\nA Climate Emergency\nProposed by Cllr Martin Phipps; seconded by Cllr Alison TealThat this Council:\n1. Notes the IPCC’s Special Report, published in October 2018, which describes the enormous harm that a 2°C rise in observed global mean surface temperatures above pre-industrial levels is likely to cause, but also tells us that a limit of 1.5°C may still be possible with ambitious action from national and local government, the private sector and local communities;\n2. Notes that carbon emissions result from both production and consumption.\n3. Notes that many cities around the world, including Bristol, Nottingham, Brighton, Bradford, Manchester and London, are responding by declaring a ‘Climate Emergency’ and committing resources to address this.\n4. Notes that this Council has already published a Green City Strategy, which aims to set out a course of ensuring Sheffield is a zero-carbon city by 2050.\n5. Believes that cities are uniquely placed to lead the world in reducing carbon emissions, as they are in many ways easier to decarbonise than rural areas – for example because of their capacity for heat networks and mass transit systems.\n6. Believes that local governments are well placed to make the case for climate action to national governments but also believes that local governments should not wait for their national governments to change their policies.\n7. Therefore, declares a ‘Climate Emergency’\n8. Pledges to bring forward the Council’s existing target to be a zero carbon city from 2050 to 2030.\n9. Asks this Administration to make a decisive contribution towards this vital target by ensuring that the forthcoming procurement of the council’s electricity supply is drawn from renewable sources.\n10. Directs the Chief Executive to produce a report to Council within six months on the actions the Council needs to take to meet this revised target.\n11. Resolves to send a copy of this motion to all Sheffield MPs and the Secretary of State for the Environment.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The full text of these are on the council website.\nFelling trees and Streets Ahead\nQ: Given that the Streets Ahead contract states that Amey is liable for any losses caused through trespass and protest, why did the Council, and not Amey, take legal proceedings against campaigners?\nA: The Council took legal action as it has a duty to maintain the highway under Section 41 Highways Act 1980.\nQ: How much have the legal proceedings cost the Council?\nA: The total legal charges to date in the injunction litigation are £150,472 made up of\n- £24,275.41 Legal Internal recharge\n- External costs (as of 14/08/17) for injunction:\n- Counsel’s fees: £94,005.70 (£112,780.24 inc VAT)\n- Process server and investigations: £12,634.75\n- Court fee: £783.00.\nQ: Who is the data controller for the recently-hired “evidence collectors”?\nA: Evidence is provided to the Councils legal department.\nQ: Are they all SIA registered and DBS checked and does the Council hold verification of this?\nA: SIA registration is irrelevant and the roles do not carry a requirement for DBS checks.\nQ: Are they permitted to take pictures of children?\nA: Those taking photographs have been instructed to avoid taking photographs of children if at all possible. However, if protesters choose to include their children in protests then they are creating a risk that their images might be recorded.\nQ: Given that the only two expert reports commissioned by the Council on the Chelsea Elm advise the problems with the tree are “minor but rectifiable” by crown reduction to leave a “reasonably balanced and aesthetically pleasing specimen,” is it not wrong and disingenuous for the Council to make completely unsubstantiated claims that decay is “significant and extensive” and work would “dramatically alter the look of the tree.”\nA: The reasons for the planned replacement of the trees are detailed on the Council’s web site. The report from the independent tree inspector carried out aerially on 25 th October 2016, states “All the topping points have decay ranging from 100 millimetres to 150 millimetres in depth. The topping points have a profusion of new growth between three and five metres in length. It was noted that a number of the topping points had died. Of particular note is a large scaffold limb 340 millimetres in diameter with a significant cavity on the south eastern canopy. The cavity was examined with a probe and found to extend beyond 600 millimetres into the limb. The limb’s residual wall is found to be particularly thin and within current scientific observations for potential failure, though there were no features in the bark to indicate the beginnings of such.” Both Council and Amey tree specialists categorise such a situation as substantial decay and they expect to have to carry out significant pruning to deal with the decay and that will in their opinion have a dramatic effect on the form of the tree. It should be noted that in order to end up with a balanced (safe) tree (as the independent inspector noted) further pruning of healthy material will be required in addition to that of the decayed material. The categorisation made by the inspector is from British Standards and it should be noted that on other trees with similar categorisation the same inspector actually recommended felling.\nQ: On 1st February this year, you determined to set the record straight about street trees: http://www.sheffieldnewsroom.co.uk/street-trees-myth/. The so called Myth #2 is “It’s cheaper to remove a tree than it is to retain it.” However, you go on to explain the truth of the matter is that, “The costs associated with removing an existing tree followed by sourcing, planting and maintaining a replacement are greater than those associated with maintenance of a mature tree,” and you go on to explain a number of variables to consider. Given the huge expense of tree replacement, would it not be more prudent to retain all healthy street trees that are marked for felling due to minimal kerb and/or carriageway damage?\nA: Your proposal would mean the Council would not comply with its legal duties.\nQ: Will the Council quantify the overall cost of delays to the Streets Ahead works caused by the ITP process, in addition to the operating costs of the ITP? Will the costs be made available to the public?\nA: Contractual matters are complex and allocating responsibility for issues depends on the circumstances. As we have stated the costs of delays to Streets Ahead works are difficult to quantify at this stage because we are still in the Core Investment Period.\nFire Safety\nQ: How many organisations have been written to [about fire safety in private tower blocks] and how many replies have been received?\nA: Overall, the Director of Housing has contacted over 100 organisations that we understand have properties deemed as high rise. Additional addresses have been provided by SYFRS recently. Approximately 40 organisations have responded to date and follow up letters are being sent.\nQ: How many of these blocks does the Council consider to be safe against fire?\nA: Most private high rise blocks in the city have been built within the past 10-15 years, so they must meet current Planning and Building Regulations and have been inspected by South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.\nQ: How many have failed fire safety inspections?\nA: Currently SYFRS have notified us that four private sector blocks have failed the DCLG cladding test undertaken by the BRE. SYFRS have advised that appropriate mitigations are in place and three of these are actively removing cladding as part of the fire safety mitigation activity.\nRecycling\nQ: What is the latest estimate of the number of Sheffield residents – typically, those in blocks of flats – who do not yet have facilities for recycling (a) glass, (b) plastics, (c) paper and card, (d) metal cans, to a level broadly commensurate with blue bins for kerbside recycling?\nA: There are approximately 15,000 flat and maisonette properties that do not receive a recycling service broadly commensurate with blue bins for kerbside recycling. As per the policy agreed by Cabinet in November 2009, where a recycling container is shared by more than one property then residents are restricted to recycling cans and glass bottles, along with paper and card. In January, 2017 Cabinet approved changing the kerbside recycling service, exchanging the blue box for a 240 litre brown bin. When this change is implemented those flats and maisonettes that don’t currently receive a recycling service commensurate with the kerbside recycling service will be provided with one that is, including the opportunity to recycle plastics.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The council were clearly responding to information and concerns outlined by investigative journalists in an Asia Times article published on October 14th. Questions were raised about some of Mr Wang’s business deals and those of other businesses he has links to. You can read this article at www.atimes.com/article/another-uk-china-deal-ice-amid-secrecy-confusion/\nMore questions about the 60-year deal with Sichuan Guodong Construction Group do need answering. Originally the council claimed the deal was signed with a company listed on the Shanghai stock market with the protections that offers. Now we are told the deal is with a very similar private company owned by Wang Chunming. It’s not the same company but it has the same name.\nIt’s now clear that Amey ran rings round the council in negotiating Streets Ahead, signed in 2012. Today, a cash-strapped council is still desperate to attract investment from outside the city. You have to question whether councils have the capability to negotiate deals the way a commercial company can. Budgets have shrunk and many experienced staff have been shed. Councils can become blind to the risks, and it’s become clear there are significant risks associated with this deal.\nWe have 20 long years of the 25 year Amey contract to endure. We also have the 35 year waste contract with Veolia until 2036. The council recently indicated they want to get out of that contract because it is not flexible enough to give them the savings they now want to make.\nOpposition councillors need to keep asking questions as the council’s “what’s not to like?” response offers no reassurance. Why would any organisation knowingly commit to a 60 year contract given the huge changes in society, environment and technology that will take place in that time?\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nSheffield Green Party\nThis is a letter to the Sheffield Star response to: http://www.thestar.co.uk/business/good-progress-in-sheffield-s-1bn-china-property-deal-1-8810413\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

They also welcomed the remaining traffic calming in Walkley and Crookes being confirmed.\nCllr Ruth Mersereau, a member of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Policy Committee said, on the Sheaf Valley Cycle Route,\n“Schemes like the Sheaf Valley Cycle Route provide long-term benefits to all road users by providing real choices. Routes like this help people who are fearful of travelling on a hostile road network, and those who have no access to a vehicle – between 20-75% of residents in the vicinity. It’s fantastic to learn that the scheme has been so successful in meeting its aims to increase walking and cycling, with cycling increasing by 66%, showing the latent demand for cycling. There have also been other benefits, like a reduction in crime.”\nHowever, only Green Party councillors voted in favour of the continued closure of the Archer Lane rat-run, meaning that road safety measures will now have to be removed.\nCllr Christine Gilligan, Deputy Chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Policy Committee said\n“The community in Nether Edge has been let down by the Council today. The changes were a step in the right direction towards safe, quiet and liveable streets. Now they will have rat-running and speeding cars again. There is no way that this can be regarded as progress .”\nCllr Ruth Mersereau added,\n“The vast majority of people from Nether Edge who contacted me, were in support of the Active Travel Neighbourhood. They have been ignored by those Lib Dem and Labour councillors who have voted to re-open these roads to motor vehicles today. This decision does nothing to improve Sheffield’s appalling statistics on road safety. This is a huge step backwards for walking, cycling, for public health, for road safety and for better, more liveable neighbourhoods\n“Archer Lane is used by large numbers of children walking to school – Mercia, Carterknowle and Holt House. Children don’t generally get consulted on transport schemes or rat runs, but they are the ones who have lost their play space, lost their freedom to walk/pedal to school safely and their chance to socialise safely with friends.”\nCllr Maroof Raouf, who represents Nether Edge and Sharrow ward, said,\n“As the local Councillor for the Nether Edge area I am dismayed at this decision. This choice not only goes against the data that has been collected but also fails to prioritise the well-being of my constituents. It’s very disheartening to see a decision that disregards the long-term consequences for residents of Nether Edge and I hope that in the future, different elected Members can make more responsible choices that prioritise the well-being of my constituents\nReferences\nThe decisions on the Sheaf Valley Cycle Route, Crookes / Walkley and Nether Edge active travel neighbourhoods were taken at the meeting of the Transport, regeneration and Climate Committee on Wednesday 20th September 2023.\nAgenda for Transport, Regeneration and Climate Policy Committee on Wednesday 20 September 2023, 2.00 pm | Sheffield City Council\nEach of the traffic-calming measures had been established under an Experimental Traffic Regulation order which must be confirmed or removed after 18 months of a trial.\nThe proposal to reopen Archer Lane to motor traffic was made in a pre-prepared amendment by Cllr Andrew Sangar (LibDem) and seconded by Cllr David Barker (Labour).",

Sheffield Green party members who were at the conference, along with Sheffield councillor Bernard Little, reflect on what they think should happen next.\nSheffield City Council member for Walkley, Councillor Bernard Little, said “It is infuriating but unsurprising that COP-26 has ended with a whimper. Declarations that countries, such as the US and China, ‘keep global warming limited to 1.5C’ ring hollow. Countries continue to chase growth and consumption. Governments, including the UK, are entranced by fossil-fuel profits, even as the reality of extreme weather events press more and more urgently on us.”\nSheffield Green Party members have been at the COP-26 conference, attending as protestors and being part of the conference itself.\nSheffield Green Party member Logan Robin was an observer at the conference on behalf of the climate charity Hope for the Future and said, “COP26, like the many UN climate summits which have come before, has shown some of the very best and some of the very worst of what humanity has to offer. We’ve seen agreement on a number of core issues which could lead to slowing the speed of climate change. But at the same time the summit began against a backdrop of failure and broken promises. It’s not too late to save the world and limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. But to do that we need to achieve and surpass our promise to deliver $100 billion in climate finance per year. Only if we put our money where our mouth is can we secure our future and our planet.”\nThe climate crisis is a threat that needs changes in what we value and what we aspire to. It demands urgent action. Sheffield Green Party argue world leaders need to make room for a more visionary and compassionate leadership brave enough to make the truly bold choices that are needed to rescue the future of humanity. Sheffield Green Party member LH travelled to Glasgow to demand global climate justice. He reflected that “In the absence of real political leadership on the climate and ecological emergency from our government, it’s up to individuals, civil society and communities to make their voices heard, and show the way. We must rise up, not just to demand change at the government level, but also to make change happen in our lives and in our communities.”\nTime is no longer on our side. Sheffield Green Party ask the people of Sheffield and the wider world to join us in demanding immediate and radical action at both local and global levels. We ask for fossil fuels to be kept in the ground, for homes that need little or no heating or air-conditioning, for low-emissions public transport to have urgent priority over polluting cars and planes. Government needs to help make this happen, but every one of us can reduce our impact by cutting excessive consumption and waste.\nCouncillor Bernard Little concluded: “The failure of COP-26 to address the climate crisis is not a surprise. Our national leaders are in denial about what the climate crisis really means. We ourselves have to face up to what we are doing. The better-off residents of Sheffield are consuming far more than what our world can sustain. We have to give up some of our luxuries, like flying, for the sake of our children. Our children already face greater risk of the fire and floods that have destroyed many communities. We need to act now to give them a future.”\nSheffield Green Party are in co-operative administration in Sheffield Council and pressing hard for meaningful climate action locally, including working for better public transport, better home insulation, and a food strategy. We provide leadership in the city to act on the climate crisis now and encourage people to join us.",

Most of this need relates to minor illness, rather than minor injuries, and is provided in primary care, i.e. by a doctor, nurse or pharmacist based in your local General Practice. As appointments with overstretched GPs are hard to get, people turn to hospital services which were intended for accidents (injuries) and emergencies. The Walk-in Centre on Broad Lane in the city centre was supposed to prevent this by providing GP-style urgent care for minor illness.\nAs a Councillor for City ward, I am worried about closing the Walk-in Centre. It sees 60,000 patients a year, many of whom live in or near the city centre. Under the CCG’s proposals, rather than going straight to the Walk-in Centre, people will be encouraged to phone 111 for an urgent appointment with their GP. GP surgeries will be clustered into “Neighbourhoods” so that if your own GP is too busy, you will be offered an appointment in a linked practice. There are only two small practices in the city centre: Devonshire Green and the Clover City Practice at Mulberry Street. If they can’t cope, people will have to travel to Sharrow, Walkley or Crookes. Some residents of Neepsend and Kelham Island are registered with GPs in Burngreave. That Neighbourhood runs all the way north to Shiregreen! The proposed new Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC) at the Northern General with its poor public transport and inadequate, expensive parking will be the only other option.\nWhen the Walk-in Centre was proposed in 2009, the Green Party argued that the money would be better spent on boosting GP surgeries which are local and know their patients. The CCG now say they want people to go to their GP for urgent care, but will spend all the money from closing the Walk-in Centre on the UTC at the NGH.

Labour later extended the contract by 5 years to 2036 in return for service changes. In early 2017 the Labour Cabinet voted to terminate the contract but then renegotiated it later that year. The cost of the brown bin roll out is £6.6 million repayable over 18 years not £2 million stated in the article. That’s 9 long years before £750,000 annual savings kick in.\nGreens warned in 2001 that an incineration based contract offered no flexibility or incentive to accommodate new recycling initiatives. Our streets are now cluttered with bins while, inexplicably, those who need extra bins will be offered them 6 months or more after the roll out. In a late January briefing Green councillors were told the only plastic recycled in Sheffield is bottles while all the rest is burnt in the incinerator.\nThere is real momentum in the battle to reduce plastic waste. But in Sheffield we require enough of it to feed the incinerator the minimum tonnages stipulated in the contract. For a mass movement sparked into action by David Attenborough it’s a thoroughly depressing situation with no happy endings in sight. It’s 18 years of missed opportunities so far with 17 long years still to go on this contract.\nAngela Argenzio\nSheffield Green Party candidate\nBroomhill & Sharrow Vale council ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

However, the Council has decided not to disclose the reasons for this use of public money.\nCllr Ruth Mersereau, councillor for City Ward, said,\n“Sheffield has some excellent facilities, such as the only double ice rink outside London, which hosts international standard competitions. However, its potential appears to be lost through SIV being very badly run, with inadequate staffing in its catering functions, poor impressions of cleanliness, and little publicity for events that Sheffield ought to be proud of.\n“We have a world-class facility on our doorstep that is not being used to the best of its potential.”\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, leader of the Green group of councillors, added,\n“An urgent request for a £1 million, which will have to be diverted away from other council spending, should be open to public scrutiny.\n“It is important that these facilities are run better.

While we look to national and local government to tackle climate change, small businesses and householders can play their part in reducing their own carbon footprint. As a step towards supporting people to do this, Sheffield Green Party are proposing the Council should employ a Sustainability Officer to develop and oversee a range of vital projects, including supporting businesses to avoid single use plastics, and providing community organisations, schools, and residents with advice on how households can make helpful changes in response to the climate change emergency.\nThis new worker could potentially have a broad remit, helping to reduce food wastage and encouraging Sheffielders to eat less meat and dairy. They could also assist in promoting opportunities for learning new skills to help reduce carbon emissions. For example, helping more people to learn how to grow their own fruit and vegetables.\nA Sheffield focused Climate Emergency website should be created by the Council to provide a forum for information about local businesses and schemes that support carbon reduction, while providing a place to share good ideas and practices.\nThe United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has examined the scientific evidence and has urged governments to take immediate action. Our Council has a vital role to play in helping residents to adapt to the changes required to reach zero carbon emissions by 2030.

It is important to recognise this council remains in an incredibly challenging financial position and that things are hard.\n“There is some welcome money from the government, but it is still so hard to plan ahead when it is stop-gap funds for one year only.\n“We still have 22% less spending power than we did in 2010, even after shifting a lot more of the burden of raising money onto local council taxpayers.\n“Continued austerity is a political choice. I hardly need say the government has big choices to make – and funding the huge range of important local services delivered by councils is one of them.\nThe Green Party would like government to tax the super-wealthy and tax exiles and to stop making cuts to the poorest. I need hardly mention winter fuel payments – and today the government is introducing a further cut of billions of pounds of welfare benefits going to the poorest in society.\n“This will have an impact in Sheffield where we estimate £230 million of entitlement is already going unclaimed every year. If we could bring in that money, it would be a significant boost to our local shops and businesses.\nThe Green Group submitted a textual amendment to the Council’s budget which set out priorities and initiatives to pursue in the forthcoming municipal year,\nProposing the Green Group Amendment, Councillor Angela Argenzio, Chair of the Adult Haelth and Social Care Committee said,\n“Our biggest concern is the rise in demand for Adults and Children’s Services, the rising costs of delivering them and no prospect of reform, from the Government, on Adult Social Care for at least 3 years. The crisis in Adult Social Care is now, and with the rise in Employers National Insurance costs that crisis has been made much worse.\n“National Government told us that they would help the public sector cover the costs of the rise in Employers National Insurance but in fact have left us £3 million short. That is £3 million less for the public services that many Sheffielders rely on.\n“The Government has chosen to tax work rather than the wealthy and this will drive inflationary pressure on the Council’s partners and contractors.\n“The Committee System offers all Councillors input in developing the Councils policies and shaping Sheffield’s future, well before the theatre of a budget meeting.That is why we have indicated in our amendment the areas we would like to see progress in and to provide the impetus needed to deliver real progress for our city.\n“We want to explore using South Yorkshire Pension Authority funding to support the installation of renewables on our schools and other public buildings.\n“We have agreed as a Council that we want to be a Pedestrian Friendly City now we need to develop an implementation plan to make that a reality,\n“I am pleased that the Green Party Administration of Bristol City Council is now seeking to introduce an Employers Workplace Parking Levy. Sheffield should do the same. This could bring millions into Sheffield to improve and extend public transport, improve provision for pedestrians\n“Municipal Climate Bonds were a Green Group proposal to mobilise investment from local people and businesses to fund the installation of renewable technology, like solar panels, on Council Buildings like schools and offices. The Council has accepted this initiative and we want to ensure it is properly promoted so we can attract significant investment at a lower cost than funding from the Public Works Loan Board.\n“Following a demonstration of infrared graphene heating by the Green Group the Council has now installed this technology in one council depot and one council house. We want to see how this alternative air sourced heat pumps works in real life situations. It offers the prospect of helping us reach our net zero target at a much lower capital cost.\nLabour, Liberal Democrats and Sheffield Community Councillors all voted against the Green Party amendment.

Since the community became aware of this proposal, lots of local people have contacted us with their concerns.\nOne big concern is for the health of pupils at nearby Lowfield School, which has the worst rates of air pollution of any school in Sheffield. London Road is already a difficult route for people walking, wheeling or cycling – including to the school – and the increased traffic going to the drive-through would make this worse.

We have a lot of good local restaurants and takeaways in our area which might lose customers, costing jobs and livelihoods and taking money out of the local economy.

However, they have found that the wording of the motion has been altered by Council Officers without their permission. The edited version of the motion removes reference to the Administration’s attempt to incarcerate Alison Teal.\nAt November’s Sheffield council meeting the Green Party group also attempted to submit this as an emergency motion, but it was was blocked on the advice of officers. This represents a pattern of recent efforts to shut down debate and marginalise opposition voices – including suspending the constitution to restrict the ability of opposition parties to present motions.\nSpeaking on the motion and its alteration, Councillor Rob Murphy said,\n“We are shocked and alarmed at the Council’s efforts to silence opposition voices. A strong opposition is vital to good democracy, and without proper scrutiny the Council runs the real risk of becoming unaccountable for its actions.\n“Their most outrageous attempt to shut down their opponents was the failed attempt to commit Cllr Teal to prison. The reputational damage that this attempt to jail an opposition Councillor has done to the city is huge, and cannot go ignored.\n“My motion is intended to shine a light on the culture of secrecy amongst the small group of councillors and officers running Sheffield Council. That this motion has itself been edited without my consent, in an attempt to hide the truth, is unacceptable.\n“Further, the Council continues to attempt to avoid scrutiny by restricting the number of motions we are able to submit to Council, and continually debating national issues of which they have no control over. This attempt to deflect criticism and avoid talking about local issues shows a lack of responsibility.\n“The case against Cllr Teal was rejected by the High Court judge without her even having to take to the witness stand. With costs running into the hundreds of thousands of pounds, this pointless and outrageous attempt to send an opposition Councillor to prison was an enormous waste of taxpayers’ money.\n“Cllr Teal is an exemplary Councillor and a great representative for her community: this year, she has been nominated for the National Local Government Association’s ‘Community Champion of the Year’ award, and won the National Green Party ‘Impressive Councillor Achievement’ award.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The investment would lead to savings with fewer cases where housing and social services staff have to step in.\nIf accepted, Sheffield would join over 60 local authorities which have already taken this step, recognising this vulnerable group.\nCouncillor Alison Teal said\n“Getting into Council Tax arrears can mean fines, court summons and bailiffs. Young people who have left foster care or care homes need time and space to gain skills around managing money. They might not have the same support from family as many other people the same age but that’s where the Council can help. Exempting young care leavers from Council Tax is just giving a bit more support where it’s really needed.”\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson added,\n“This is an investment in a particularly vulnerable group where poor outcomes in future would mean council and social health services having to step in at far greater expense. The exemption would also underline the corporate parental responsibility that Sheffield City Council has for care leavers, giving them a fairer start in life.”\nNotes\n- The award-winning Children’s Society campaign begun in 2016, with 1 in 6 councils now putting the exemption in place https://www.childrenssociety.orguk/what-you-can-do/campaign-for-change/a-fairer-start-for-care-leavers/\n- There are around 440 young people between the ages of 18 and 25 who have left the care of Sheffield City Council and have to pay Council Tax. The exemption might lead to lost revenue of around £75,000, though the actual amount is likely to be lower, given the difficulty some care leavers have with paying.\n- The numbers of care leavers in Sheffield has been estimated following the Children’s Society method: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/children-looked-after-in-england-including-adoption-2016-to-2017/\n- The local authority has legal corporate parental responsibility for care leavers\n- The submitted motion is as follows:\nProposed by Cllr Alison Teal; Seconded by Cllr Douglas Johnson\nThat this Council: –\n(a) Notes that last year around 75 young people (aged 16 or over) left the care of Sheffield City Council and began the difficult transition out of care and into adulthood;\n(b) Further notes that a 2016 report by The Children’s Society found that when care leavers move into independent accommodation they begin to manage their own budget fully for the first time and can find this extremely challenging, often with no family to support them and insufficient financial education;\n(c) Further notes research from The Centre for Social Justice, which found that over half (57%) of young people leaving care have difficulty managing their money and avoiding debt when leaving care;\n(d) believes that as national welfare cuts are removing financial support and the national strategy on Care Leavers is inadequate, Care Leavers are a particularly vulnerable group for council tax debt\n(e) notes that Sheffield City Council has statutory corporate parenting responsibilities towards young people up to the age of 25 who have left care;\n(f) further notes that there are around 440 care leavers in Sheffield liable to pay Council Tax at any one time;\n(g) believes that, to ensure that the transition from care to adult life is as smooth as possible, and to mitigate the chances of care leavers falling into debt as they begin to manage their own finances, they should be exempt from paying council tax until they are 25.\n(h) believes that the lost revenue of around £75,000 in council tax receipts is excellent value given the positive impact that exemption will have for this vulnerable group, the duty the Council has under its corporate parenting responsibilities and the savings in reduced instances of housing and social care staff input;\n(i) therefore requests officers to take steps to exempt all care leavers from council tax up to the age of 25.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

At present, the Council’s constitution allows any councillors to put forward motions but the effect of the new proposals is to stop the Green councillors putting any motions at all to the September council meeting.\nUpholding the rules in the constitution, the Greens have put forward two motions – one of them about upholding the constitution.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“The council is being asked to vote on limiting motions to no more than four. Two of these are reserved for Labour – originally they wanted three – so this stops all opposition groups from being able to put forward their own motions.\n“This has a far bigger impact on opposition groups who have much less opportunity to set out their alternative ideas for how the council should run.\n“Although there will be more discussions before the constitution is formally changed, we think the Administration has a duty to be open and clear about the effect of their proposals.\n“Opposition councillors have a crucial role in scrutinising the ruling Administration and must object to attempts to close this down.”\nCllr Alison Teal added,\n“I am concerned the new meeting format will limit the councillors’ and public’s opportunities for exploring alternative visions for Sheffield.\n“A far better way to increase public engagement in council meetings is to support the Greens’ long-standing call to broadcast meetings online so that everyone can see what is being said in the name of the people of Sheffield.”\nNotes\n1.

The full text of these are on the council website.\nFelling trees and Streets Ahead\nQ: Given that the Streets Ahead contract states that Amey is liable for any losses caused through trespass and protest, why did the Council, and not Amey, take legal proceedings against campaigners?\nA: The Council took legal action as it has a duty to maintain the highway under Section 41 Highways Act 1980.\nQ: How much have the legal proceedings cost the Council?\nA: The total legal charges to date in the injunction litigation are £150,472 made up of\n- £24,275.41 Legal Internal recharge\n- External costs (as of 14/08/17) for injunction:\n- Counsel’s fees: £94,005.70 (£112,780.24 inc VAT)\n- Process server and investigations: £12,634.75\n- Court fee: £783.00.\nQ: Who is the data controller for the recently-hired “evidence collectors”?\nA: Evidence is provided to the Councils legal department.\nQ: Are they all SIA registered and DBS checked and does the Council hold verification of this?\nA: SIA registration is irrelevant and the roles do not carry a requirement for DBS checks.\nQ: Are they permitted to take pictures of children?\nA: Those taking photographs have been instructed to avoid taking photographs of children if at all possible. However, if protesters choose to include their children in protests then they are creating a risk that their images might be recorded.\nQ: Given that the only two expert reports commissioned by the Council on the Chelsea Elm advise the problems with the tree are “minor but rectifiable” by crown reduction to leave a “reasonably balanced and aesthetically pleasing specimen,” is it not wrong and disingenuous for the Council to make completely unsubstantiated claims that decay is “significant and extensive” and work would “dramatically alter the look of the tree.”\nA: The reasons for the planned replacement of the trees are detailed on the Council’s web site. The report from the independent tree inspector carried out aerially on 25 th October 2016, states “All the topping points have decay ranging from 100 millimetres to 150 millimetres in depth. The topping points have a profusion of new growth between three and five metres in length. It was noted that a number of the topping points had died. Of particular note is a large scaffold limb 340 millimetres in diameter with a significant cavity on the south eastern canopy. The cavity was examined with a probe and found to extend beyond 600 millimetres into the limb. The limb’s residual wall is found to be particularly thin and within current scientific observations for potential failure, though there were no features in the bark to indicate the beginnings of such.” Both Council and Amey tree specialists categorise such a situation as substantial decay and they expect to have to carry out significant pruning to deal with the decay and that will in their opinion have a dramatic effect on the form of the tree. It should be noted that in order to end up with a balanced (safe) tree (as the independent inspector noted) further pruning of healthy material will be required in addition to that of the decayed material. The categorisation made by the inspector is from British Standards and it should be noted that on other trees with similar categorisation the same inspector actually recommended felling.\nQ: On 1st February this year, you determined to set the record straight about street trees: http://www.sheffieldnewsroom.co.uk/street-trees-myth/. The so called Myth #2 is “It’s cheaper to remove a tree than it is to retain it.” However, you go on to explain the truth of the matter is that, “The costs associated with removing an existing tree followed by sourcing, planting and maintaining a replacement are greater than those associated with maintenance of a mature tree,” and you go on to explain a number of variables to consider. Given the huge expense of tree replacement, would it not be more prudent to retain all healthy street trees that are marked for felling due to minimal kerb and/or carriageway damage?\nA: Your proposal would mean the Council would not comply with its legal duties.\nQ: Will the Council quantify the overall cost of delays to the Streets Ahead works caused by the ITP process, in addition to the operating costs of the ITP? Will the costs be made available to the public?\nA: Contractual matters are complex and allocating responsibility for issues depends on the circumstances. As we have stated the costs of delays to Streets Ahead works are difficult to quantify at this stage because we are still in the Core Investment Period.\nFire Safety\nQ: How many organisations have been written to [about fire safety in private tower blocks] and how many replies have been received?\nA: Overall, the Director of Housing has contacted over 100 organisations that we understand have properties deemed as high rise. Additional addresses have been provided by SYFRS recently. Approximately 40 organisations have responded to date and follow up letters are being sent.\nQ: How many of these blocks does the Council consider to be safe against fire?\nA: Most private high rise blocks in the city have been built within the past 10-15 years, so they must meet current Planning and Building Regulations and have been inspected by South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.\nQ: How many have failed fire safety inspections?\nA: Currently SYFRS have notified us that four private sector blocks have failed the DCLG cladding test undertaken by the BRE. SYFRS have advised that appropriate mitigations are in place and three of these are actively removing cladding as part of the fire safety mitigation activity.\nRecycling\nQ: What is the latest estimate of the number of Sheffield residents – typically, those in blocks of flats – who do not yet have facilities for recycling (a) glass, (b) plastics, (c) paper and card, (d) metal cans, to a level broadly commensurate with blue bins for kerbside recycling?\nA: There are approximately 15,000 flat and maisonette properties that do not receive a recycling service broadly commensurate with blue bins for kerbside recycling. As per the policy agreed by Cabinet in November 2009, where a recycling container is shared by more than one property then residents are restricted to recycling cans and glass bottles, along with paper and card. In January, 2017 Cabinet approved changing the kerbside recycling service, exchanging the blue box for a 240 litre brown bin. When this change is implemented those flats and maisonettes that don’t currently receive a recycling service commensurate with the kerbside recycling service will be provided with one that is, including the opportunity to recycle plastics.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Reports of customers questioning, ignoring and breaking the rules that keep everyone safe in pubs are deeply troubling; The Closed Shop in Commonside released a “public service announcement” just 10 days after reopening detailing 11 different serious issues they were having to deal with.\nResidential renters have some Covid-19 eviction protection with court cases on hold until at least August 23rd but commercial landlords are forcing struggling small businesses to close.

They should be inclusive for all, affordable for all, accessible to all, and minimise harm to the environment, for the health and wellbeing of all.\nThis response focusses on the Sheffield perspective, including management of Sheffield Midland station, which is part of the franchise.\nWe also strongly believe that Sheffield and the North of England needs and deserves a similar level of investment in rail infrastructure as the South East and London has received.\n2. Ticket barriers\nWe wish to see the DfT’s requirement for ticket barriers to be removed from the franchise.\nSheffield Green Party consistently opposed installing ticket barriers at Sheffield station and was pleased to be part of the successful campaign to show they were a bad idea. The station footbridge is a major public access route between the city centre and the Norfolk Park area, paid for by public and EU money. Ticket barriers also have a disproportionate effect on disabled people.\nWe are pleased to hear the assurances given at the consultation meetings that no further ticket barriers are proposed.\n3. Electrification\nWe strong support the move to rail electrification across as much of the network as possible and wish to see a timetable for action.\nWe recognise that air pollution is a serious national issues resulting in an estimated 40,000 premature deaths each year and that the UK is already seriously in breach of minimum international legal standards of protection. Air pollution monitoring at Sheffield station has recorded NO2 concentrations at over seven times the maximum legal limit of 40µg/m3.\nWe consider that a priority for programme of electrification may be to include regional lines serving Sheffield, Doncaster and Leeds where an improvement in local services could have a greater impact than further enhancements to the Sheffield-London route.\n4. Air pollution\nWe would like to see a commitment to the franchisee reducing air pollution from trains (and other machinery or processes at the station) by a firm air quality action plan for all stations it manages. This should drive towards reducing idling of stationary engines as far as possible.\nThe franchisee should also have a clear system of management of all taxi ranks at its stations using its powers of license or sub-franchise. For instance, at Sheffield station where NO2 levels have been recorded at over seven times the legal maximum, there are problems with continual taxi engine emissions because of the way the taxi system operates. This could be tackled through use of station permit fees. We would like to see the franchisee required to impose effective air pollution reduction conditions. These could include no-idling conditions or giving discounts to low-emission vehicles.\nThere should be a comprehensive system of regular air pollution monitoring at all stations and this data should be publicised so that improvements and trends over time can be seen. Locations for air quality monitoring should include taxi ranks. This data should be made publicly available online.\n5. Waste and recycling\nA lot of passenger waste is generated both on trains and at stations. We would like to see big improvements in firstly, minimising packaging and, secondly, effective recycling of paper, glass and plastic bottles.\nReusable (china) crockery and cutlery should be used as far as possible in first class catering.\nSales from refreshment trolleys should aim to reduce packaging and the reuse of plastic bottles. This may include requiring price differentials for passengers who use their own cups.\nThere should be separate bins on stations and separated collection of waste materials (especially newspapers and magazines) on trains, which are currently all put into general waste.\nThe franchisee should have regular customer information (such as notices in carriages) that promotes the need to reduce waste and to separate recyclable material.\nIf possible, the franchisee should be required to report the volumes of recycled waste as a proportion of all waste removed from each station. This data should be made publicly available online.\n6. Integration with local travel\nSheffield station is currently not served by any buses. Although a limited number of buses are available at the bus station, which is relatively nearby, the franchise should encourage the development of bus stops and services at the station itself and should require co-operation with the Passenger Transport Executive.\nThere should be better sharing of real-time information on rail services in Sheffield bus station and at the tram stop serving the station. There should also be a commitment to provide accurate and real-time information on local bus and tram services at the train station.\nThe franchise arrangements should ensure that the franchisee is required to fully engage and cooperate with the forthcoming tram-train provision in Sheffield and Rotherham.\nThere should be a guarantee for the continued provision of cycle hubs and for support for independent enterprises such as the successful “Russell’s Bike Shed” at Sheffield station.\nThe franchisee should provide enough cycle parking to make it clear that cycling to the station is encouraged; that is, meeting not just current demand but anticipated higher demand in future. This means providing cycle stands at the front of the station so that it is only a step or two from parking a bike to buying a ticket. It also means providing cycle stands at the back of the station so that cycling from the Norfolk Park area to catch a train is more convenient.\nAll stands should be the classic “Sheffield stand” kind as recommended by the Department for Transport, the CTC and the National Cycling Strategy for short-stay cycle parking.\n7. New stations\nThe franchise should incorporate provision for the potential expansion of suburban travel in Sheffield and the reopening of existing stations at Heeley, Millhouses and Totley Brook.\n8. Late-night travel\nThe latest weekday train from Sheffield to London departs at 2049; the latest from London to Sheffield departs at 2225. Saturday and Sunday times are earlier.\nAt least one late-night train each way would improve the service for off-peak travellers and better reflect the increasingly irregular and 24-hour lifestyles of many people.\n9. Wireless and accessible information\nFree public wireless should be reinstated at all stations.\nFree wireless used to be available at Sheffield station but this is now paid-for subscription only. Reinstating free wireless would help ensure fair access to information as those people most affected are likely to be poorer or less frequent travellers or those who do not want to have to sign up to over-the-phone payments. Free wireless would assist passengers with finding and checking travel information, updates to running times or about their intended destinations, thus contributing to the efficient running of the railway. Free wireless would also make the station environment more convenient, welcoming and modern.\nFree wireless should also be provided on trains. It should be seen as an integral part of a modern service rather than something to charge extra for. It would greatly help passengers plan ahead their actions at their next station.\nWhen planning information services, franchisees should be required to disregard the view that members of the travelling public may have good access to 4G networks. Such assumptions may well be true of those who can afford to pay first-class or peak-travel fares but will exclude people with access requirements or with only a basic phone. Many people do not have good access to information and they are the ones for whom public information facilities are most important. Such a requirement would help the DfT meet its legal duties under the public sector equality duty.\n10. Toilets\nThe franchisee should provide toilets at each station that are expected to be open and accessible to the general public, ideally 24 hours a day. Toilets should be fully accessible and ideally should meet “changing places” standards. This is a critical service for disabled passengers but also important for all members of the public at a time when fewer public toilets are otherwise provided.\n11. Equality considerations\nSheffield Green Party notes with concern that there are no explicit proposals to build equality and environmental considerations into the heart of the franchise. We believe that these issues must be built into the structure of the franchise and not regarded as an additional nicety.\nIn particular, we are concerned at the possible lack of understanding of equality issues in that we note the consultation asks whether the franchisee should take equality into account. It is also a legal duty to comply, as a minimum with the duties in the Equality Act 2010, whether as a provider of services or under the public sector equality duty.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

A consultation has opened, finally asking the people of South Yorkshire their opinion on what is best for their bus network, but it does not mention public ownership.\nWhile public control via franchising is a needed step, we encourage people to push for full public ownership, cutting out the middle-men and instead running our own services, as we did prior to 1986, when our buses were the envy of Europe.\nWe urge residents from across South Yorkshire, and those from outside South Yorkshire who use buses in South Yorkshire to fill out the consultation in full: www.southyorkshire-ca.gov.uk/bus-reform Alternatively, if you don’t have access to a computer, you can call 0800 9520002 for more information.\nGreen Councillor for Ecclesall ward, Peter Gilbert said,\n“I welcome the long overdue movement towards public control of our buses, and the success of the Better Buses for South Yorkshire campaign. This consultation, much like franchising, is a stop on the journey to better public transport, and I ask all residents to fill it out. However, franchising isn’t the final destination, and so I would urge the Councils, the Mayor and the people of South Yorkshire to push to follow London in investigating using new powers from Central Government to set up an authority-owned operator, to return to full public ownership of our buses.”\nDisappointingly, at the same time as this badly needed step towards better buses is taken, the Labour government has decided to raise the bus fare cap by 50%, from £2 to £3, a decision that working people, mainly those less well-off, will have to bear the brunt of. Approximately 160,000 people in Sheffield don’t have access to a vehicle, mainly in less wealthy areas.\nSheffield Green Party demands the government reverse its course, pledge to reinstate the £2 bus fare cap and extend funding of it for the foreseeable future, instead of raising it. Greater London and Greater Manchester have their own fare caps and would become the only parts of England with a £2 cap on single bus fares.\nThomas Atkin-Withers, a Green campaigner on public transport from Jordanthorpe said,\n“For a government that says it doesn’t want to increase costs for working people, it’s unbelievable that they are raising the bus fare cap to £3. As someone who comes from an extremely deprived area, where 46% of households don’t have access to a car, it’s clear who this is going to affect the most, and it isn’t the wealthy. We are in a situation where a government supposedly for working people would rather increase a basic living cost, rather than tax their wealthy friends. This shortsighted choice is only going to prevent people from using public transport.”",

A priority must be to rebuild public confidence in the safety of bus, tram and train travel so we don’t return to commuter gridlock.\nServices must improve as well.

This would provide more protection for the interesting heritage buildings in the area.\nHowever, property developers now want to demolish the Old Coroner’s Court on Nursery Street before a conservation area comes into force.\nCllr Douglas Johnson said,\n“An Article 4 Direction could help by giving some protection until the Conservation Area has been decided. It would mean that developers would have to apply for planning permission if they want to demolish historic buildings. Each case could then be considered on its own merits.”\n“The Old Coroner’s Court is an attractive but unlisted historic building. It would be very sad to see it destroyed for a small commercial gain to a developer. It would also damage the long-term regeneration of the area.”\nBrian Holmshaw, a key heritage campaigner, said,\n“The area around Castlegate, Nursery Street and the Wicker contains some of the oldest, most historically important C19th and early C20th buildings in the city and the consultation about their future status is still ongoing. Sensitive and appropriate re-use is far preferable to the developers’ ‘level and re-build’ approach. The demolition is a cynical move that undermines local democracy and wrecks the hard work that has already gone into creating a Conservation Area here. ”\nBen McGarry, chair of Kelham Island Community Alliance, said\n“Heritage buildings are a vital part of Kelham Island and the surrounding area. They don’t have to be listed buildings to make up an important and unique part of the character of the area.\n“The challenge for Kelham Island is to make sure it doesn’t lose what is irreplaceable and the same goes for the Old Coroner’s Court in its setting opposite Nursery St Pocket Park.”\nNotes\n- The Old Coroner’s Court was built in 1913 on Nursery St and was designed by Sheffield’s first City Architect, F E P Philips. It was later used as a Youth Court and more recently as small office accommodation. It stands opposite the Nursery St Pocket Park, providing a pleasant amenity setting.\n- Surrey-based Firestone Developments has submitted a “demolition notice” to Sheffield City Council saying it wants to demolish it and clear the land for a block of flats.

What we might not have expected is that only one place in England was found with a higher level!\nResearch on the effects of the tiny particles given off by vehicle emissions is in its infancy, but we already know that they worsen heart diseases, cancers, strokes, dementia and Alzheimer’s, inhibit infant lung development and cause 500 early deaths just in Sheffield. The latest research is even suggesting that they help cause obesity and carry the Covid-19 droplets!\nProbably the situation at the station will have been less severe during lockdown, but we cannot let it slip again as things get back to “normal”. Between them, East Midlands Rail and Sheffield City Council need to take serious measures to improve the problem:\n- they might look at moving to a licencing scheme where only electric or hybrid taxis are allowed at the station,\n- they might charge for access permits with reduced rates for electric or hybrid vehicles,\n- they might look at enforcing a ‘no-idling’ policy,\n- they might limit access so taxis are only allowed in the pick-up area when there are actual customers waiting,\n- they could look at using disused space for taxis to wait with engines turned off.\nEven with such measures, the problem would not be solved. Vehicle emissions are a big problem throughout the whole of society: wherever the emissions happen, everyone’s health is put at risk, especially car users themselves.\nWe need to travel in different ways: walking and cycling are much better for our health. Many people rely on public transport and, with controlled risks, more of us will need to get back on public transport to avoid gridlock.\nThese measures will have a cost: if we want to carry on driving, we will have to spend on new vehicles, but we will live longer and more healthily, we’ll save on health care and on days lost at work through illness.\nIf the government goes through with the Clean Air Zone that Sheffield has had to plan, the Council, East Midlands Rail and the regional mayor need to push the Government to provide more funds to help taxi drivers to buy less-polluting taxis. We also need to push for more appropriate facilities for walking and cycling and better public transport.

Anyone can come and hear what is being said and done by our elected representatives.\nBut how many people ever do this?\nLots turn out for the big issues but sometimes it’s only five or ten in the public gallery for the monthly full council. Other meetings like Cabinet, scrutiny committees and planning and licensing meetings sometimes have very few or no members of the public to observe proceedings.\nI can’t blame the public for this. It is difficult to give up a whole morning or afternoon to wait for five minutes of something you want to hear. It is more difficult if you have a regular job, a disability or young children. And the conduct of meetings can make them pretty awful to sit through.\nThe Green Party councillors have campaigned for greater openness. In 2012, Cllr Rob Murphy proposed broadcasting of council meetings, and to allow people to make their own recordings. Both ideas were rejected by the ruling Administration. All other South Yorkshire authorities now have a proper, official online record. The advantages are many.\nYou can watch at home or work whilst waiting for the bit you are interested in to come up. You can check it online later, as there is a permanent record. It ends complaints that minutes don’t reflect what was said or leave out difficult questions altogether.\nIt also improves councillors’ behaviour. Green Party councillors always encourage respect for debate instead of the bickering and rudeness between the two big parties. From the council’s point of view, it shows a commitment to openness. It can also reduce the work of answering Freedom of Information requests one by one.\nThe cost is now fairly low and is something the Green Party has repeatedly included in budget amendment proposals.\nRight now, a new working group is looking at making council meetings more accessible.

As councillors, we sometimes find it hard to put our finger on simple successes because of the new regime of co-operative working. But, make no mistake, the current functioning of the city council is so much better now that Greens are one of the three parties in the Administration.\nIn May 2022, we increased our councillor number to 14 and were the only party in Sheffield to have an increase. We then negotiated two seats on each of the committees that are now the main decision-making bodies of the council.\nIt’s worth remembering this new committee system came about from the successful It’s Our City campaign and referendum that many Green Party members worked on.\nEvery issue that comes through these committees now has Green influence in the decision-making. Whether it is a major issue like getting the Sheffield local plan progressed through cross-party working or smaller wins like getting free transport to school for a child, a Green presence makes a real difference to people’s lives.\nThis is what changes the city – and the world.\nThe Sheffield Street Tree Inquiry is underway as a direct result of it being negotiated by Green councillors. We expect this report to be published in the spring.\nA Clean Air Zone is finally to be implemented, after years of rear-guard opposition by Labour and LibDem politicians. We welcomed the chance to unlock millions of pounds of grants to small businesses – money which had been sitting in the council’s bank account for years.\nWe have worked on equality issues – through the Race Equality Commission and by promoting the provision of free period products in public buildings.\nBetween us, we have worked continually to promote walking and cycling, bus services, heritage campaigns, human rights and the cost of living crisis.\nNow the councillor group is big enough, we have been able to employ Andrew Cooper, an absolute star, to work with us as our policy adviser. Andrew has 20 years’ experience of being a councillor in Kirklees as well as unparalleled knowledge of energy issues. Andrew has steered us through getting a renewable energy strategy proposed and accepted by the full council. The implementation of this strategy is something we will be following up in 2023.\nNationally, we have worked with other Green councillors on issues such as Investment Zones and the Government’s enforced cap on social rents, which would mean substantial cuts in investment in social housing. Green councillors made representations to government which changed their proposals for the better. We estimate this change by government will result in an extra £3.1 million for council housing in Sheffield.\nWe will continue to do this work as long as we have a strong Green group on Sheffield City Council – this is where we need everyone’s help.\nBecause of our electoral success in 2019, we are defending four seats in May’s elections and we aim to win some more. This will come with many challenges now we are part of the Administration taking responsibility for running the city.\nSo we need you to help us maintain the Green presence and keep the council in No Overall Control.\n2023 is going to be an exciting year. I’m looking forward to seeing you on the election campaign trail where we can all make the difference to put Green policies into practice in our city.\nThank you for all your support\nDouglas Johnson\non behalf of the Green councillor group",

They have also secured reduced water bills for those who are eligible and helped people to manage payments and complete forms.\nThe Strategy and Resources Committee on Wednesday agreed to,\n“Endorse the proposal to increase targeted support for benefits uptake, building on the learning from the South LAC Pilot, and to continue this work across the City as part of the Cost-of-Living Partnership, for 12 months.”\nGleadless Valley Green Party Councillor Paul Turpin said,\n“It is great news, for local people, that the Council has agreed to extend the income maximisation pilot, that I originally proposed, across the whole of Sheffield.\n“Millions of pounds of benefits that people are entitled to, go unclaimed each year. Helping, often vunerable, people navigate our complex and confusing benefits system helps ensure more people are able to make successful claims. The South LAC Income Maximisation Pilot alone, resulted in an additional £171,905 income for local people. Extending the scheme across Sheffield could bring in millions more.\n“There are lots of positives from this initiative. As well as tackling poverty it also means more money is spent in local shops, helping to sustain them and support local employment. Many local people are likely to qualify for Pension Credit. If they do they will also be able to still qualify for the Winter Fuel Allowance, boosting their income by up to a further £300/year.”",

I want to leave a planet where future generations can thrive.\nAn increase in global temperatures of 3 degrees Centigrade is what climate scientists say we are facing unless we make radical changes now.\nMelting ice sheets will lead to global sea level rises. There will be more extreme heat and drought, more intense storms, more flooding, widespread damage to infrastructure and destruction of crops and food supplies.\nBut it doesn’t have to be like this. We can reduce this harm to our planet if there is the political will to do so.\nThe current government does not care about the future of our planet or the future of our children.\nUnfortunately, the Labour opposition is also already cutting back on its environmental commitments and reducing its investment in the green agenda that we need for a sustainable future.\nReplacing fossil fuels with renewable energy and insulating our homes will reduce our emissions and could cut household energy bills by up to £1400 a year. It could also save businesses £53 billion in energy bills, Taking control of our energy could also save businesses £53bn in energy bills, which would be a real boost for manufacturing in the UK.\nShell made £32 billion and BP £23 billion in profit last year while energy bills rose and people found it difficult to heat their homes. The top 20 fossil fuel firms are responsible for one-third of all emissions. They are raking in billions while many households across the UK are struggling to keep warm this winter.\nThe fossil fuel millionaires and billionaires have tried to block investment in renewable energy at COP28, but it is the richest who most need to stand up and take responsibility. The richest 1% of the population produce as much carbon as the poorest 5 billion people on Earth.\nThis must change now. We need Climate Justice now.

It will impact people visiting Sheffield Children’s and Weston Park Hospitals, commuters, shoppers, schoolchildren and parents, plus university and college students of all ages and abilities.\nStagecoach don’t have to listen and respond as they (and First Group) are commercial services. Publicly-run services can deliver the routes and timetables communities actually need, including early morning, late night and in more rural areas. A Joseph Rowntree Foundation Report has just highlighted that a lot of low-skilled manual work is now in manufacturing or warehouses on the edge of towns and cities underserved by public transport.\nStagecoach and First will maximise profits by just running full buses at peak times on popular routes, with lower demand services gradually disappearing. It forces people to use cars, adding to congestion and air pollution, while cutting off those who can’t afford a car.\nWe need clean, safe, accessible, public transport and safer cycling and walking options so people can choose to leave their cars at home. This would reduce congestion for all road users while improving dangerous air pollution and road safety. To achieve this we urgently need to get public transport back under public control with increased investment to improve local bus, rail and tram services.\nBernard Little\nWalkley ward Green Party\nLetter in response to https://www.thestar.co.uk/news/changes-to-one-of-sheffield-s-busiest-bus-routes-remain-despite-protests-1-9303813\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

If this is followed through to the actual development we will have missed a great opportunity to rediscover the river that named our city and we will not gain the many benefits that come from having open water running through an urban environment.\n“The positive impact on people’s well-being and on local biodiversity of being close to a flowing river are well known. We should really be giving a stronger steer to the Council that we need to be improving the local environment when we develop somewhere as important to our heritage as the site of the former Sheffield Castle. That is why I am calling for this matter to be raised by the Council’s Transport, Regeneration and Climate Committee so they can give a strong steer to the Council that we want to see greater de-culverting of large sections of the river and making it accessible to the public in line with proposals from Sheaf and Porter River Trust”",

This is causing pollution from idling engines and serious danger from overtaking vehicles heading into oncoming traffic. Many people have contacted me asking for help and the local Tenants and Residents Association has started a petition calling for the problem to be dealt with.\nI have spoken to the police, waste management and traffic enforcement officers in the council, and have finally been told about the impending “emergency measure” to paint double yellow lines on the road. Double yellow lines won’t have any effect on cars that are queuing, not parking.\nWe need the waste sites open, incidents of fly-tipping and garden fires shot up when they closed, however, this problem isn’t new and isn’t caused by the pandemic. This level of traffic is normal for Blackstock Road and the other household waste sites in Sheffield, largely situated in inappropriate residential areas.\nThe problem of high demand is not caused by the people of Sheffield wanting to responsibly dispose of their waste. It is caused by the expensive, impractical and failing waste management contract with Veolia.\nOther cities of a similar size to Sheffield have more household waste sites and, unlike in our city, they are open full time; 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. Doncaster has more sites than Sheffield despite being half its size!\nIt is about time the Labour-run council found the courage to admit that they are wrong about this contract, stop defending it and challenge Veolia to provide a service that works for Sheffield!\nPaul Turpin\nGreen Party Councillor for Gleadless Valley Ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Is this really the voice of a re-animated and radical Labour party facing the realities of our increasingly unstable world?\nSweden (which Cllr Price claims is a country at the forefront of tackling environmental issues via “heat recovery”) is importing ever larger quantities of waste from across Europe to feed its incinerators. Incineration is not recycling or beneficial for the environment. (see https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/sweden-recycling-rates-revolutionary-dark-truth-behind-uk-wales-incineration-a7471861.html)\nSheffield has a lamentable recycling and composting record – 314th out of 350 local authorities. So called “Improved” recycling via brown and blue bins does not guarantee that the contents will be recycled and collections will now be monthly. This was a missed opportunity to take the waste contract back in-house and recycling rates are now unlikely to improve until the Veolia contract ends in 2036.\nExtracting raw materials from the environment causes great damage to habitats, wildlife and people. More than two thirds of the city waste is incinerated, emitting large quantities of carbon dioxide. Yet we have just been warned by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that, to prevent catastrophic climate change, we must start to cut greenhouse gas emissions immediately.\nThe district heating and energy network was conceived by the Labour-run council without looking at the wider, future consequences. The Lib Dem Council ignored Green Party demands to adopt a Zero Waste Strategy before giving the go ahead to a new incinerator in 2001, linked to a 30 year waste contract with Veolia. Labour then extended the waste contract by 5 years as the only way to get Veolia to agree to make service changes. A Zero Waste Strategy would have created at least 1000 local skilled jobs that would last many lifetimes. It would have helped kick-start a 21st century Industrial policy for our region.\nMethods of heating and insulation using very low or no fossil fuel energy are improving at a huge pace. Rather than burn valuable materials we must waste less and recycle more. If a zero waste strategy were adopted without delay, it would offer a secure, healthy, and thriving future. We have the research skills to draw on in our two universities to lead a Green revolution.\nAn increasingly switched-on, plastic-averse, Sheffield population wants to be able to put all recyclable materials in bins knowing that they will actually be recycled.

The Council had allocated £3 million towards delivering food waste collections but this is regarded as insufficient to deliver the service costs.\nCouncillor Alexi Dimond said,\n“In the Sheffield context, the environmental benefits of the Government’s Food Waste collection legislation are highly dubious with high costs and low carbon savings. In part this is due to the private contract with Veolia which the Lib Dems and Labour supported and which runs until 2038. Thanks to the committee’s decision – although opposed by the Lib Dems – £3 million the Council had allocated for this scheme can now be more effectively used on other carbon reduction projects.\n“We have a highly effective Sustainability Team in the Council who help us draw in external funding for projects that help to reduce carbon emissions and energy costs for the Council. Ensuring they have a long term future in the Council has to be a priority.\n“The committee voted to consider more effective alternatives to food waste collection such as supporting home and community composting of food waste, provision of wormeries, hot bins and bokashi composters.\n“It is important that funding for carbon reduction measures is not wasted and that high impact, cost effective proposals are what the Council backs, not the greenwashing, food waste collections being proposed by the Government and supported by Lib Dems for the purposes of political point scoring”.\nReferences\n(Public Pack)Agenda Document for Waste & Street Scene Policy Committee, 15/11/2023 10:00 (sheffield.gov.uk)",

It is consistent with Green Party policy and so it is easy for our group to support it.\n“During the General Election the Green Party were clear that we wanted to scrap the 2 Child benefit cap as we know that this would immediately take 250,000 children out of poverty. We challenged the Labour Party to make that same commitment but they wouldn’t.\n“The cost of scrapping the cap is around £3.4 Billion per year or about 3% of the total national benefit budget. The benefit of the policy is that it helps the families concerned but also that money generally gets spent in the local economy helping make communities more sustainable.”\n“What is disappointing, since the General Election, is that not a single Labour MP from Sheffield voted to support an amendment to the recent King’s Speech which would have removed the two-child benefit limit to Universal Credit. If Labour are not about addressing poverty then what is their purpose? They used to be a progressive party that represented people on lower incomes. Not any longer it seems.”\nReferences\n- Agenda for Sheffield City Full Council 4/9/24 Agenda Template (sheffield.gov.uk)",

Residents of Stanley Road have been putting on regular socially-distanced bake sales since March 2020, and the Bunanza has grown ever more popular with people living locally. The final bake sale of 2020 attracted queues of people, of all ages, all hoping to get their hands on the delicious produce.\nGetting help to those who need it\nThe Bunanza has raised considerable funds for local charities including foodbanks, which have seen a huge rise in demand since the start of the pandemic. To date, the Bunanza has raised a remarkable £12,542 to support those facing the biggest challenges brought on by the crisis.\nThe charities that have been supported by the Bunanza are:\nLocal Foodbanks: Gleadless Valley Foodbank; Salvation Army (Duke Street, Park Hill) Foodbank; Burngreave Foodbank\nThe proceeds from the sales have made a big difference, as Louise Hutchings from Baby Basics underlines: “Since April, the bun sale has helped us to directly support so many families in need of help”. Referring to the work done by Family Voice, Kate West adds, “The Stanley Road donations have helped us to support many more families during the pandemic”. At a time when increasing numbers of people are facing hardships, these groups and the support they are given by the wider community are more essential than ever.\nCouncillor Paul Turpin shared his fears about the ongoing level of need in Gleadless Valley ward, and the essential work of local organisations to limit the impact: “Sadly, I feel the rise of the foodbanks is not yet over and 2021 will continue to see an increase of people in need and places such as our foodbanks rising to the challenge of helping those people”.\nBringing the community together\nAs well as supporting vital charitable organisations, the Bunanza has allowed local residents to come together, renew and make new friendships, and take positive action at a time when things can feel hopeless. Anne Baber, who lives on the street and bakes for the Bunanza said “the bun sales have really brought our street and community together”. New ways of connecting with each other have been born out of the bake sales, including new WhatsApp groups forming and neighbours knocking on each others’ doors to say ‘hello’. Sarah Deakin, a key organiser of the project, put it that the Bunanza has “created valuable networks of support” – support that we all need during these extraordinary times.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Over the years, this playground and the adjacent area has been used by drug users and drug dealers, who leave discarded needles and other paraphernalia scattered around an area wholly accessible to the public and – most concerningly – to children.\n“This illicit activity has resulted in a reduction in use of the park by local families and residents. So that they could start to use it again, I was keen for the council and Amey to open up and clean the space and to repair damaged fencing.\n“The decision to remove the overgrown hedgerow was reached only after consultation with the council’s ecology team who undertook a survey to ensure that wildlife was not put at risk. This also meant that the work had to be done quickly before the nesting season.\n“The work to remove the hedgerow will open the space to wider views. The adjacent verge is to be seeded with wildflowers to encourage insects and other wildlife and to present a more attractive space for users of the park and drivers passing on the Hanover Way.\n“This vibrant community includes students whose academic years have been affected by criminal activities on their doorstep. I have received many complaints and discussed the issues with South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield City council and Amey. I held many community walks to gather information with our local PCSO and I had conversations with concerned parents, teachers, local shops and volunteers, who wanted this community supported.\n“I hope this work now goes some way to address the needs for improvement in Broomhall.”\nNotes\n- The council’s press release is available at https://sheffieldnewsroom.co.uk/news/hanoverwayverge/\n- More information about Sheffield Green Party is available at: www.sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We provide services of tenancy management, repairs and estate maintenance. We invest in planned maintenance and extensive major repairs such as roof replacements and insulation schemes. We also build new homes. We supply a panoply of other services to a huge number of tenants, some of whom are highly disadvantaged in this city.\n“We should be proud of providing this public service of over 38,000 households. Many local authorities sold off their housing stock; Sheffield did not – although it dabbled with outsourcing of its repairs service until it was finally brought back in house.\n“Housing should be seen as a basic human right and, as I say, one we should be proud to deliver.\n“So, I want to thank all our hundreds of staff who make this mammoth undertaking happen. I know they don’t always get the respect they deserve for doing their best to look after people’s homes.\n“I also know we don’t always get it right. But let’s face it – cases of disrepair in council homes still make the news. It is easy to overlook the fact that hundreds of repairs are carried out successfully every day.\n“In the Housing Committee’s climate statement, we note that 82% of all our council homes have energy performance certificates in bands A, B and C. I know EPCs aren’t the only or best measure but how favourably this contrasts with the vast bulk of the city’s private rented sector. The shocking equivalent for Sheffield’s private rented homes is only 23%.\n“In this budget, we are asking the council to increase council rents by the standards amount permitted by government. To do otherwise would be to vote for cuts in jobs and services to tenants.\n“I therefore commend this Housing Revenue account to the council.”",

Speaking after the October Council meeting, Councillor Gilbert said,\n“I am disappointed that Labour is backing dangerous and expensive nuclear energy when there are so many cheaper and more benign alternatives.\n“The waste produced by nuclear energy remains radioactive for thousands of years and storage of this waste is an expensive issue with no long term solution. There are ongoing issues with storage at the Sellafield site which are just one example of the difficulties in managing this toxic waste. (2)\n“Nuclear is the most expensive way of generating electricity in the UK, and we will be paying for this in our energy bills for years to come. Both the International Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency have confirmed this. Hinckley C is going to cost £24.5 Billion with a further 10 nuclear sites planned (3). A much better use of these funds would be to invest in super insulating people’s homes so they are warm and cheap to heat. We need a plan to invest significantly in retrofitting our homes to make them more energy efficient and reduce carbon emissions and our energy bills.\n“We know climate change is happening now, but nuclear energy plants are far too slow to get on line. Hinckley C was announced in 2010 but won’t come on line till 2027 at the earliest (4). By contrast renewables and insulation schemes can be up and running relatively quickly.\n“Those who argue that renewable energy isn’t a solution because it only works when the sun shines or when the wind blows are behind the times. Energy storage has come on leaps and bounds and is used on a small scale in people’s own homes and linked to large wind and solar farms.\n“If we want a safer world we need to ditch nuclear energy. The technology used to process enriched uranium is the same as that used to make nuclear weapons. The strong links between the nuclear industry and the production of nuclear weapons is well documented. If we want to end the nuclear proliferation that ends in a nightmare like ‘Threads’ we need to work towards a nuclear free world.” (5)\nReferences\n1 – News – South Yorkshire MCA (southyorkshire-ca.gov.uk)\n2 – Revealed: Sellafield nuclear site has leak that could pose risk to public | Energy industry | The Guardian\n3 – New nuclear power in UK would be the world’s most costly, says report – Carbon Brief\n4 – New nuclear power in UK would be the world’s most costly, says report – Carbon Brief\n5 – The links between nuclear power and nuclear weapons – CND (cnduk.org)",

This is as true about how Labour has approached the issue of red routes and bus lanes as it was about the Street Trees scandal.”\nIn a recent interview on BBC Radio Sheffield, Labour Councillor Mazher Iqbal, Co-Chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Committee claimed that Green Councillor Douglas Johnson had “ signed off these schemes without consultation”.\nThis was untrue. Cllr Johnson had not in fact “signed off” anything to do with this scheme. And there has been a substantial consultation on initial proposals that had received 3,680 responses. Further consultation will take place on any specific proposals.\nCouncillor Christine Gilligan, deputy chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Change Committee, said,\n“When untrue claims are made to the public in pursuit of votes, it undermines people’s faith in the Council. It should be a simple ask to expect politicians to tell the truth.\n“There have been many incorrect stories being put out there by Labour and Lib Dem councillors and it is clear that it is about manipulating local people in advance of the local elections on Thursday 4th of May. Sheffield deserves better and that is why we are making sure that the facts are made available to people so they can make up their own minds.\n“Councillor Iqbal has said that he personally is taking red routes “off the table”. This is not something he can do. Whether you agree with red routes or not, no single councillor has decision-making power alone. Under the new committee system all councillors have to be involved in decision-making and the final decision has to be taken by one of the formally constituted committees, based on proper reports, officer advice and evidence.\n“That is what the ‘It’s our City’ campaign was all about. In the 2021 referendum, 65% of Sheffielders voted for a Modern Committee System to replace the undemocratic ‘Strong Leader’ model favoured by Labour. Most people in Sheffield wanted to stop a small group of councillors unilaterally making decisions with no reference to other democratically elected councillors. Ignoring the will of the people of Sheffield has to stop.”\nENDS\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n- Connecting Sheffield is part of the long term vision for the future of travel in Sheffield. Over time it aims to transform travel in Sheffield by creating high-quality, convenient and safer routes into and around the city for cycling, walking and public transport.\n- The Transport, Regeneration and Climate Change Committee is made up of 4 Labour, 3 LibDem and 2 Green councillors.\n- The mythbuster can be found at www.sheffieldgreenparty.org",

A brisk 10-minute daily walk has lots of health benefits and counts towards your 150 minutes of weekly exercise, as recommended in the physical activity guidelines for adults aged 19 to 64.\n“Walking in the outdoors is also good for your mental health and Sheffield prides itself on being the Outdoor City. To get outdoors you have to leave your house, get off the bus or get out or your car so if Sheffield is truly to be the Outdoor City it must be a Pedestrian Friendly City too. If we want people to visit and enjoy our beautiful outdoor spaces it is important we make it easy and safe for them to get around our city.\n“But the benefits of this proposal are not just for visitors. We all want to be able to get around our city and our neighbourhoods, safely and easily, whether we are walking, cycling or scooting. I want to see well maintained foot ways that are not obstructed by advertising hoardings or parked cars. It is not acceptable to expect pedestrians or cyclists to have to move into often busy roads in order to continue their journeys.\n“I also want to see safer streets so that our children can walk to school. Most parent should be able to enjoy a short walk to their local school with their children on streets that are safe, and not congested with polluting vehicles and dirty air. This will improve the health of our younger generation and encourage healthy habits for their future.\n“There are 357 deaths and injuries each year on Sheffield’s roads. The fact that His Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services has identified a lack of effective road safety strategies is a major cause of concern.\n“I welcome the development of the Walking, Wheeling and Cycling Investment Plan by the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Committee. This is a positive step but we need a holistic approach across the council and working our partners to ensure obstructions such as bins, parked cars and digital advertising displays do not impede our footways. Pavements are for people not parked cars, vans or lorries. Our streets should be easy to navigate for everyone, including people using wheelchairs or mobility aids, blind or partially sighted people, and residents with young children.”\nIn seconding the motion City Ward Cllr Ruth Mersereau said,\n“The way that people in Sheffield are able to travel about our city is massively unfair.\n“Many residents are excluded from jobs, from leisure and social activities because they cannot get about safely or easily. Remember that nearly a third of Sheffield’s residents don’t have access to a vehicle.\n“Making it easier to walk and wheel (for example, use a wheelchair or mobility scooter) is good for our mental and physical well-being and reduces isolation. But currently it’s often difficult, unsafe and unpleasant.\n“At last week’s Transport Committee, we passed a Walking, Wheeling and Cycling Investment plan and we heard about the things that stop people from walking and wheeling. Top of the list was vehicles parked on pavements. Obstructive parking stops people from getting about safely, or even from getting about at all. We urgently need to deal with this and send a clear message that obstructive parking is illegal and socially unacceptable.\n“The poor state of pavements and paths also stops people getting about. Our current maintenance schedule means that most of the city’s pavements are left with leaves, snow and ice uncleared. Slippery pavements make it risky to get about, particularly on hilly streets. And when pavements haven’t been gritted, people are forced to walk in the roads, at risk from motor vehicles.\n“Uncleared pavements and insufficient enforcement against obstructive parking very visibly transmits the message that people wheeling and walking are at the bottom of the transport hierarchy – when our Transport Vision, and the Highway code, say that they should be our top priority.\n“People are also prevented from walking and wheeling because of very valid concerns about road danger. Someone is killed or seriously injured almost every single day on Sheffield’s roads. Think about that statistic for a moment and its appalling effect on loved ones and others.\n“We must do more to reduce road danger.\n“We must do better. We urgently need to work across the Council’s committees and with South Yorkshire Police and SYMCA.\n“If we enable people to walk and wheel, we can have a city that’s cleaner, fairer, safer and healthier – and better for everyone.”",

I asked officers about it a few months ago, so I’m really pleased to see it come into being.\n“The idea came from talking to a resident about dangerous parking from a cyclist’s point of view and the obstacles caused to pedestrians and cyclists. It shows how you see dangers on the road differently depending on how you travel – so it seemed logical to provide parking officers with bikes instead of cars.\n“It is also another small step towards reducing air pollution and tackling the climate emergency.\n“Not only does it help them get round the city faster and more healthily, it is a reminder that the purpose of parking enforcement is road safety.\n“Illegal parking is not just selfish but causes danger on the roads, especially to pedestrians, cyclists and disabled people with mobility scooters.\n“Councillors all get lots of complaints about dangerous parking.\n“In the 10 years to 2018, road safety improvements meant there was a drop of around a third in car occupants being injured in collisions. However, the figures also show that the same dangers to cyclists actually got worse in the same 10 years.”\nNotes\n- Douglas Johnson is one of the 3 Green Party councillors in City Ward, which includes the city centre.\n- In 2018, there were 93,979 casualties recorded in road accidents, who were occupants of cars at the time, compared to 149,188 in 2008, a drop of 37%. However, for pedestrian injuries, casualties only fell from 28,482 in 2008 to 22,432 in 2018, a 21% drop. Cyclist casualties rose by 8%, from 16,297 in 2008 to 17,550 in 2018.\n- Source: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/833949/ras30001.ods\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We will have 3 big bins per household, further cluttering up our streets. Brown and blue recycling bins will only be collected separately on alternate fortnights. Sheffield is miles behind other South Yorkshire councils at the bottom end of the national recycling league tables – that won’t improve after these changes.\nWe’re told that a public consultation failed to back proposals to replace individual bins with larger communal dumpster bins in parts of the city. Actually only 24 roads meeting certain criteria were consulted. 13 of them are in my ward and, with a significant number of student houses, most of those failed to get the 30% response rate required. That was hardly surprising as the consultation finished days before lease periods ended and most students will be living in different areas when the bin changes happen this Autumn.\nWe’ve been speaking to local residents and I know this consultation has been frustrating for Harcourt Community Action, representing residents on Harcourt Rd in Crookesmoor. It’s a model for good relations between students, mainly living on one side, and longer term residents, mainly living on the other. They have been trying to get a communal bin solution piloted on the road since 2016. Only the student side of the road was included in the consultation so just 3 responses were received. They now face the prospect of managing 450 bins for 483 residents and approximately 174 bins will have to be left on the pavement. This will further exacerbate their current issues of blocked pavements, fly tipping, and nuisance to wheelchairs and buggies.\nCommunal bins are a serious option to consider on cluttered pavements on densely populated roads, especially where there are no front gardens or steps down that prevent off street bin storage.

The Council anticipated receiving around £100,000 from the sale. The land is within the Birkendale Conservation area and the proposed sale of the land received 6 written objections from local residents.\nOne objector, referred to in the report, said\n“To go ahead with this disposal after the designation of the Conservation Area would be reckless, unwise, inconsistent and inappropriate with the Council’s previous actions and would form a significant error of judgement”\nCity Ward Green Party Cllr Martin Phipps, who is a member of the Council’s Finance Committee said,\n“Walkley residents had highlighted the value the open space has for nature and as a green space for the community. I strongly agreed with the objectors view that green spaces are important for our health and wellbeing, and the mature trees on the site, which are of particular value to the local wildlife.\n“Officers and other councillors suggested that concerns raised could be addressed in the planning process, but once the open space is disposed of it will be too late. Housing will be built there and the open space lost.\n“As the Green group spokesperson for the committee I voted against the proposal as the site benefits residents and the city more as open space instead of accommodating two extra private houses.\n“What is frustrating is that the Council had previously acknowledged the site as an ‘important open space’ in a conservation report. Clearly we need greater commitment by local politicians to protecting our valued urban green spaces ”\nLabour and Liberal Democrat councillors voted for the disposal of the open space, and for the space to be developed as housing. Both Cllr Phipps and Cllr Terry Fox from the Sheffield Community Councillors voted against.",

Is it any wonder then that residents in my ward of Gleadless Valley feel compelled to contact me so frequently with pleas for help to tackle the constant smoke in their neighbourhoods from bonfires at local allotment sites?\nTo minimise air pollution, health experts say toxic air particle levels need to be close to zero. But Clean Air Sheffield (CAS), in conjunction with the University of Sheffield, has three sensors around Carfield Primary School, which sit between Meersbrook and Norton Lees allotment sites. They measured toxic particle densities that were often at dangerously high levels.\nFor the last 18 months I have been speaking and meeting with local residents, allotment holders and CAS about air quality in Heeley and Meersbrook. I have many photos of huge smoke plumes that residents frequently send to me. That’s many fires a day making life difficult for those living within a mile of the allotments. Despite many discussions with council officers, they are still unwilling to do anything to reduce the smoke from bonfires. The allotment fires don’t just annoy local residents either; many of the people who contact me are holders themselves and say it is impossible to spend time there when the smoke takes over.\nI have tried many routes to solve the problem of smoke around the allotment sites but my latest request was to ask the officers to gather the evidence of air pollution by testing around them. I hope, with evidence, a change to the bonfire policy will be forthcoming. With a change to the policy there should also be access to chippers and education on composting for plot holders, to replace the need for burning.\nI love allotments and the communities they create and nurture. I would have one myself if I had the time. I have found great support from allotmenteers and, on environmental and ecological matters, we are often on the same page. Let’s make sure that green waste is the nutrition for next year’s champion organic tomatoes and is not the cause of increasing illness and bad feeling in the community.\nCllr Paul Turpin\nGleadless Valley Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Constant battles are being fought in Fulwood as First and Stagecoach make profit motivated decisions to change routes and services. People here should have access to bus services to take them to the two big hospitals – the council should be in control of the buses.”",

They have also secured reduced water bills for those who are eligible and helped people to manage payments and complete forms.\nThe idea came from Gleadless Valley Councillor Paul Turpin and was championed by all Councillors on the Committee and supported by the South LAC team.\nThe new service has helped people save £76,757.44 in 6 months, across 4 wards* in the South Sheffield area. It cost £40,426 to fund the post for 1 year.\nAt full council on 4th September, councillors will vote to determine whether the council should consider making the service available throughout the city.\nCllr Turpin said:\n“All LACs had a budget to spend on cost of living and in the South LAC we all shared the view that a council-run advice service would be the best use of the money available.”\nGleadless Valley colleague, Councillor Marieanne Elliot commented:\n“Face-to-face advice from a trained professional provides people with immediate help with living costs and can also help to bring about positive longer term changes. In the South LAC we have trialled this and it has proved to be very effective. I hope this approach can be adopted by the Council as part of an anti-poverty strategy so that everyone in Sheffield can access face-to-face advice in their communities.”\nCllr Turpin added\n“This is a service that for every £1 spent in one year, £4 will be returned that year, and then another £4 the next and the next. It should be an easy choice for the Council to make.”\nReferences\n*Beauchief & Greenhill, Gleadless Valley, Graves Park and Nether Edge & Sharrow are the 4 wards in the South LAC.",

If you want to watch\nthe full council meeting and look at the Agenda here is the link\nPetitions\nA petition was presented by Sheffield TUC calling for Divestment by South Yorkshire Pension Fund from companies that support Israeli settlement on Palestinian land. Points were also made about Government attempts to interfere with the ability of Pension Funds to divest as they see fit.\nPublic Questions\nThere was an interesting question by Kate Stott asking SCC to put pressure on South Yorkshire Pension Authority to divest the £230million it invests in fossil fuels and also a call to invest it in local carbon free investments.\nKate said, “We ask Sheffield City Council to deliver on their climate emergency declaration by applying pressure on SYPA to disinvest their holdings in fossil fuel companies”\nThe response from Labour’s Cllr Julie Grocutt defended continued investment in fossil fuels saying it was a decision for fund managers what they invested in and they could not be directed to invest in local schemes. However, other organisations have funds that are fossil fuel free and are working to completely divest from fossil fuels.\nThere was a question about what the council was doing to address the Cost of Living crisis from a resident in Stradbroke who spoke passionately about the impact of rising prices on her community. Greens at the previous meeting successfully called for a Cost of Living Action Plan and this has now been produced and is now being acted upon.\nSam Wakeling asked a question regarding Councillor Fox’s inconsistency regarding dealing with the climate crisis and his support for expanding Doncaster-Sheffield Airport. Cllr Fox says “we have to take people with us” and defended Labour’s record but didn’t address the issue of support for airport expansion.It is fair to say that he decided to take offence at Sam Wakeling’s question rather than to address it.\nLib Dem leader, Cllr Shaffaq Mohammed, asked the Labour Leader Cllr Terry Fox about what he was doing to secure the future of Doncaster Airport? He responded saying he was doing all he can to save Doncaster Airport because it was about the economic regeneration of the area. There was no reference by either of them to the impact of air travel emissions on climate change.\nLabour Cllr Tony Damms asked the council to send a letter to the Fire Authority thanking them for their work during the major incident declared during the heatwave. This was seconded by Green Councillor Paul Turpin, also a member of the Fire Authority, who made the links between high temperatures and accelerating Climate Change. The huge resources required to tackle moorland fires make climate change a significant risk factor for South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue.\nCllr Douglas Johnson asked Terry Fox if he had any recognition that the support for private car ownership and use from South Yorkshire councils has undermined public transport. Terry Fox responded by saying the Greens were against people parking outside their own homes. They aren’t and Cllr Fox later retracted this claim.\nCllr Turpin asked why Sheffield Renewables‘ free solar panel installations that they had offered were rejected by the Council. Cllr Terry Fox said he would ask the relevant committee to look into the matter. This is an ongoing frustration for the Green Group.\nCllr Turpin pointed out to Cllr Terry Fox that some Councils like Lewes DC alternate their Council Leaders every 6 months and asked if this could be considered for Sheffield. He didn’t get a positive response. Cllr Fox said that because Sheffield was a big city that this wasn’t viable without explaining why.\nMotions – Public Transport, LGBTIQA+ rights and Electric Vehicles on the agenda.\nNo Green motions on this Agenda this time due to Council rules. The Green Group will next have a chance to submit a motion at the Council meeting in September.\nThe Lib Dems produced a motion on public transport on the possible 30% cuts to bus services in October and increased fares. Their motion had no credible proposals to address the problem. Cllr Douglas Johnson made the link between promotion by the Council of car ownership through cheaper parking and less patronage of public transport and it is not fair on those people who can’t afford a car. Cllr Bernard Little highlighted the point that there were no serious initiatives in the Lib Dem motion that would reduce fares or improve services.\nLabour also brought a motion on bus services and crime which were weaved together with no links made between the 2 issues. Again there were no real suggestions about how we can improve things locally. Greens put an amendment to the 2 motions both promoting policies such as the Employers Workplace Parking Levy, which raises £9 million/year in Nottingham to support public transport and active travel, and also increasing parking charges to help fund alternatives to transport alternatives to the car. Cllr Tina Gilligan pointed out there are too many cars on the road, which have a negative impact on health and that we need well funded alternatives. Cllr Douglas Johnson said that the 2 motions by Labour and the Lib Dems in not providing solutions was just ‘hand wringing’.\nAs the allotted time for the meeting had elapsed, the motions on LGBTIQA+ rights and Electric vehicles were passed without debate. A Green amendment was passed that pointed out that Electric Vehicles were only an option for wealthier households and that they should not take precedence over investment in public transport and active travel. EVs still have particulate emissions associated with braking and issues like congestion and illegal parking would remain a concern whether vehicles are powered by electricity or fossil fuels.",

Drinking fountains will reduce single-use plastics; steps towards reopening the Don Valley Railway, measuring air pollution, funding the FreeBee bus and improved cycle-ways will change the way we travel to work. Planting fruit trees and employing a sustainability officer to support business and residents will help us adapt to carbon-reduced living. Larger-scale energy efficiency schemes in schools and solar panels on social housing will address fuel poverty and carbon reduction.\nDouglas Johnson, Green Councillor for City Ward, added,\n“This is a chance to create new jobs and to look to the future with a range of Green proposals.”\nNotes\n- The Council budget will be set at its meeting on Wednesday 6th March at 2pm\n- Sheffield Green Party’s full budget amendment will be published later today.\n- Earlier Green Party proposals include:\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

As this report outlines, the management of the moors for driven grouse shooting increases the flooding risk.\n“It also explains how there’s a slaughter happening on our uplands. That includes the illegal killing of magnificent birds of prey, but also the legal slaughter of beautiful, iconic mountain hares, of stoats and weasels, and many other species. I think the people of Sheffield should know that is happening, and I’m sure many will have strong objections.”\nNatalie Bennett, former Green Party leader and Sheffield Green Party member, who spoke at Sheffield Hen Harrier Day on August 4, and will be speaking at similar events in the South East and Midlands at the weekend, said: “Not everyone is able to get up on the moors, but Bob’s pictures and clear account provide an explanation of what’s happening there has an impact on all of us: through the loss of biodiversity and bioabundance, reduced storage of greenhouse gases, and increased flood risk.\n“Campaigners have been doing great work documenting what’s happening there, and public awareness is growing. That provides a degree of protection for raptors like the hen harrier, and I hope soon for the beautiful, innocent mountain hares and other animals, which die to maximise the number of grouse available to be shot on the Inglorious Twelfth of August when the grouse shooting season starts.”\nThe report is supported by Sheffield Green Party, of which Bob is a member.\nDownload Report From the Front Line: What’s happening on moors near Sheffield (pdf)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

My Freedom of Information requests show that 3025 people have had their Blue Badge application rejected in Sheffield in the last 32 months. The proportion of rejections has risen from 6% in 2015 to 10% so far this year.\nFollowing a court case, which the Government lost, people with hidden disabilities such as autism may now get a Blue Badge.This is good news. However people with ME (myalgic encephalomyelitis) for instance are unlikely to succeed. This is because ME is not considered to be a permanent disability because approximately 5% of sufferers make a recovery.\nME is a serious, disabling and chronic organic (ie physical not mental) disorder. It has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a neurological illness. Approximately 25pc of those affected go on to develop severe ME which is extremely debilitating, often rendering the sufferer completely dependent upon carers for their everyday needs.\nThe chance of recovery for long term sufferers is negligible, but they can still be refused a Blue Badge by Sheffield City Council.\nThe exact cause of ME is uncertain and to date there is no known specific medical diagnostic test to determine or confirm a correct diagnosis nor is there any specific treatment. In the UK it is believed that about 250,000 suffer from the disorder.\nSheffield City Council should change its approach, assist people with ME and make it easier for them and their carers to park in the city.\nGraham Wroe\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The meeting starts at 4:30pm with some time to chat, with tea and cake! Speakers and discussion are from 5pm to 6:45pm, with opportunity for questions and answers.\nOur main speaker is Sheffield Race Equality Commissioner Kaltum Rivers, former Green Party councillor, who will be reflecting on the commission, wider experiences and what needs to change. Sheffield Green Party councillors Maroof Raouf and Maleiki Haybe will also respond to the Commission and reflect on what is needed to build an anti-racist city. Alongside a Q&A session with our panellists will be an opportunity for all those attending to discuss how we can take the recommendations into our workplaces, communities, and day-to-day life.\nIn 2020, after nationwide protests about the blight of racism and racial inequality, the Sheffield Race Equality Commission was set up as an independent investigation. Alongside the chair, professor Kevin Hylton, 24 Sheffielders with diverse backgrounds and experiences were appointed to the commission. Together, they held many conversations with people and groups from across the city, receiving evidence and putting together recommendations for how the city could become anti-racist. This means changes to culture, leadership, better support and information, and more transparency. It means changes to how Sheffield deals with health, education, employment, crime and the economy.\nHowever, there are still concerns over whether the report will lead to real action.\nCllr Maroof Raouf said: “The findings of the REC report are nothing new, they are things that I knew of twenty years ago. When will institutions in this city take direct action to challenge the inequities that are present within their ranks?”\nAll welcome to our discussion.

It was organised by the Safe Streets Now and included placards, banners, and a visit from a resident dressed as a zebra, to show the need for safe crossings.\nGreen Party Councillor for Broomhill and Sharrow Vale Brian Holmshaw, who lives nearby said:\n“ Sheffield has the highest child pedestrian killed and seriously injured rate of all core UK cities by a significant margin. It is one of the most dangerous places in the country to be a child pedestrian.\nI live locally and see young people and families crossing here all the time – going to the nursery at Park Hill, heading up to Manor Lodge Primary and the nursery there, to the bus stop to go elsewhere or being dropped off while a parent goes to work. They are taking their lives into their own hands.\nWe urgently need a controlled crossing, with pedestrian lights, both here, and at several other junctions in the city. I shall ask the council questions why this has not been put in place.”\nGreen Party candidate Ruth Flagg-Abbey, who is standing in the Manor Castle ward where the Bernard Street/Talbot Street junction is located said:\n“It is great that we’re getting such good support from car drivers coming past today. They drive past, see our signs and show their support. They recognise that it’s not a them and us situation, this is us together, making roads safer for all.\nWe need more traffic cameras at junctions like this one, to catch the dangerous and unsafe drivers who risk their and other people’s lives when they run red lights.\nWe need more “School Streets” that restrict access near our schools at important times of the day. This will allow pupils and families to walk and cycle safely each day to and from school.\nWe need better monitoring of bad parking where vehicles just screech to a halt next to pedestrians or pull in and block junctions. I support an increase in parking enforcement officers to improve our quality of living.”\nGreen Party members also supported a second protest in Walkley where Upperthorpe resident Cllr Bernard Little spoke on the theme of road safety.",

We welcome this, as the Greens have continually pushed for greater openness, including webcasting of council meetings, for several years. This is by far the best way of letting the public see what goes on in the council chamber. Our full list of proposals is on the website.\nSeptember’s full council meeting was the first to start at the new time of 5pm, with shorter meetings, shorter debates and shorter speeches. Although we had worked hard to achieve agreement in the working group, the council meeting was characterised by the points of disagreement. We objected to Labour’s proposal to limit the number of motions (pdf) we could put forward.\nAt the moment, the council’s constitution allows councillors to put forward motions without a limit on their number. In the last 6 ordinary meetings, we have put forward 8 motions, on air pollution, the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) in higher education, fossil fuel divestment, diversity in the theatres, funding for buses, HS2, trees, safety and a motion of no confidence in the council leadership.\nUnder Labour’s proposal, we would only be able to put four motions a year and none at all this month. Labour’s proposal was also to change the order so their own motions would always be debated first.\nWe challenged Labour’s power-grab by putting forward two motions anyway, one of them on the importance of upholding the constitution. The Chief Executive grudgingly admitted he had “no basis for rejecting the two Green motions.”\nOne of the recommendations from the working group was to be more open by being clear about who was proposing and seconding them so it was ironic that Labour’s proposal was put anonymously on the agenda paper. We said that if Labour wants to use their majority to change the constitution, they must do it openly.\nThere were petitions and public questions. Petitions included a request to withdraw the Freedom of the City from Aung San Suu Kyi in protest at the treatment of the Rohingya by the Burmese authorities. Although there was sympathy, this issue had to be deferred to another day.\nThen there was a petition by Anthony Cunningham, with 7,538 signatures, asking to be provided with a “night-café.” This was very similar to his previous petition asking for a night-shelter. After a minor drama involving shouting and being asked to leave the council chamber, the debate was short and the issue referred to the Scrutiny Committee.\nThree petitions did not have speakers so they were just referred to the Cabinet member without comment. Unusually, the number of signatures for each was not announced until the council was challenged. Only then was it revealed that the petition to save the elm on Chelsea Rd had 3,023 signatures (enough to secure a discussion at a Scrutiny Committee) and the petition to “stop debating trees” had only eight.\nIn fact the public interest in trees continued. In answer to Nigel Slack, the council responded that about 100 miles of streets were yet to be resurfaced despite the Core Investment Period coming to an end. We received a written answer to our question, which showed the council’s legal costs for obtaining injunction were £150,000. We were told the “evidence collectors” were not SIA-registered or DBS-checked. Unfortunately, Cllr Bryan Lodge side-stepped the question of why, Given that the Streets Ahead contract states that Amey is liable for any losses caused through trespass and protest, it was the Council – and not Amey – that bore these costs.\nAs questions about trees were left to the end of the public session, they were hurried and Sally Goldsmith was stopped from asking her question about the Vernon Oak. The Lord Mayor ordered her to sit down, at which point she publicly gave her resignation from the Labour Party.\nInterestingly, this question was similar to my written question about the Chelsea Elm – “is it not wrong and disingenuous for the Council to make completely unsubstantiated claims?”\nIn public questions, Deborah Cobbett asked what the council was doing about the NHS’ “Accountable Care Systems,” the replacement for cuts in the Sustainability and Transformation Plans. The Cabinet member said there would be a paper to Cabinet in 2 weeks. There isn’t.\nPeter Davies from the GMB asked why Labour-controlled authorities such as this one had “gone further than the Tories” in cutting wages of Veolia staff. The cabinet denied responsibility as it was an outsourced contract.\nOnce we got to motions for debate, it was about the Government and council promoting HS2 and the decision to abandon the electrification of the Midland Main Lane. Rob Murphy was the only speaker to point out the obvious connection between the two.\nLabour’s other motion, on betting shops, had no absolutely connection to Sheffield, any more than any other town in Britain. Whilst all councillors agreed that betting shops cause a problem, we pointed out the contradictions between Labour’s national position and the Labour council’s statement of “how important this sector of the entertainment industry is within the city.”\nOur two motions were voted on. We actually voted in favour of the Labour amendment to our motion on the constitution as we secured their confirmation that “changes to the constitution will only take place in accordance with the constitutional process.”\nOur second motion called for an urgent reassessment of the supply and demand of purpose-built student accommodation. Our figures show that more bedspaces in these blocks have been approved for planning permission in the last 12 months than in the previous 5 years. We believe the council needs up-to-date information on the current situation. Labour voted against this proposal.\nFor a council meeting run on new lines, I thought the best analysis was from the Star’s reporter Alex Moore who tweeted “Not sure that was any more or less engaging than the previous format.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

These waterways are integral to the city’s industrial ‘Steel City’ heritage\nCouncillor Marieanne Elliot said\n“We are all connected by water. Our relationship with our rivers and waterways is complex with huge benefits to health, wellbeing, active travel and nature, and, as we have more extreme weather due to climate change they can also put our homes, businesses and lives at risk.”\n“On the Communities, Parks and Leisure Policy Committee I proposed that the current Green and Open Spaces strategy for Sheffield needs to be the Green and Blue strategy because water is so integral. I look forward to working with our waterways partners on a joined-up plan, including more nature-based solutions to slow the flow, continuous active travel routes and nature corridors along our Rivers, and maybe a few beavers too.”\n“Greens value our public watercourses and believe that privatisation of water is a failed experiment. It is an essential utility where no meaningful competition is possible.\n“England is one of only two countries in the world with a privatised water system. This means we get the worst deal from every angle – mismanagement and dirty water, plus higher bills. The scandal of our polluted water is well-documented. It affects our health, and is also a threat to animals, habitats and biodiversity.\n“Yet, last year untreated sewage was discharged into English waterways for more than 3.6 million hours, whilst water companies were paying out billions in dividends. And now the water companies have asked to increase bills even more and Ofwat is going to let them!”\nCllr Brian Holmshaw, seconding the council amendment said;\n“The council has a role in enabling access to rivers as access for leisure activities that help improve the quality of life of local people. Projects like de-culverting the River Sheaf are a part of that but the Council can do more by working in partnership with voluntary groups that play an important part in keeping rivers clean and free of rubbish and debris.\n“This is not just about sewage, but also the chemical pollution from waste water discharges, transport, our streets, agriculture, mining and closed landfill sites. Chemicals are discharged into rivers and streams through domestic and industrial wastewater containing things like cleaning chemicals, personal care products and pharmaceuticals, as well as pesticides or the use of veterinary medicines.\n“We are facing a biodiversity crisis with the quality of freshwater ecosystems declining more rapidly than either marine or terrestrial systems. One in 10 freshwater and wetland species in England are threatened with extinction. Two thirds of existing species are in decline. It’s a litany of past failure that unless it is directly addressed will continue into the future.\n“There are massive issues with landfill sites which were capped off at the top but not sealed at the bottom and are now leaking into our watercourses. Research by Now Then magazine in November this year using the Watershed website and mapping tool reveals a number of large\ndisused landfill sites in the Parkwood Springs area that could be affecting the nearby River Don.\n“People living in areas of Sheffield with higher levels of deprivation are also more likely to live near a disused or active landfill. The Watershed map for Sheffield also suggests that areas with a high risk of flooding, which is made worse by underinvestment from water companies, are also those with more deprivation.\n“We need to properly regulate our water companies through re-nationalisation. The for-profit setup of England’s water companies over the past quarter of a century has incentivised them to divert profits towards shareholders – instead of fixing our collapsing water infrastructure. Unlike with other utilities, consumers don’t have a choice about who they buy water from, further lessening the incentives for companies like Yorkshire Water to improve.",

And as many large corporations decline and abandon our city, small businesses can help revitalise our high streets.\nCouncillor Paul Turpin, Group Spokesperson for the Economic Development and Skills Policy Committee said:\n“Local businesses and enterprises help bring diversity to our city, providing it with a distinctive and unique character. They are also vitally important in providing jobs and keeping money circulating in the local area.\n“We know many small businesses are struggling with the cost of living and high energy bills, and their running costs are set to increase again in March when the government’s short-term support will end.\n“That’s why, this Small Business Saturday, we are calling on the government to introduce insulation grants for businesses as a proper solution to their high bills. This would benefit small businesses massively, reducing their energy use, operating costs, and emissions.”\n“The Green Party has long championed a nationwide insulation programme and other measures to support small business, including the reform of business rates. We are proud to be the party of small business; we want to see them thrive, and provided support to do so.”\nThis Small Business Saturday the Green Party are calling for:\n- Grants to insulate small businesses to cut energy bills and emissions. Government should provide businesses with grants to insulate their premises to reduce their running costs, energy use, and emissions for good.\n- Higher business rate exemption for small businesses that green their operations. Businesses should be incentivised to green their operations by not having to pay higher business rates as a result of taking sustainable measures such as installing solar panels.\n- Support for small businesses to improve employee wellbeing. Government must support businesses to improve the wellbeing of their employees. Measures should include exempting all childcare providers in England from business rates.\n- Reform of VAT to support small businesses and suspension of Covid repayments. The government must reform our VAT system so that it differentially supports smaller shops and businesses compared to larger and online businesses. Likewise, there should be an immediate suspension of Covid loan repayments to provide much needed relief for businesses.\n- Creation of Virtual High Streets. Councils should work with small and independent businesses so residents can use an online portal to buy from participating local shops and have items delivered on the same or next day.",

It is suggested that this be codified in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\nNatalie said: “We know that that access to nature, the chance to play in a stream and wander in a wood, are good for health and wellbeing. It develops practical and physical skills that encourage an active life, something that we urgently need to do given our rates of obesity, diabetes and other problems related to inactivity.\n“We also know that there’s increasing evidence that even the simplest exposure to the natural world – like a street tree – is good for physical and mental health.\n“It is clear that current and future generations have to do much more to look after our precious, shrinking natural world.\n“With 50% of the world’s wild animals lost in the past 40 years, with our oceans turned into a plastic soup and soils fast degrading, we need to develop a wide and deep understanding of, and love for, the natural world. Future generations will have to do a better job than we’ve done of caring for this fragile planet.”\nNatalie added: “Conference also highlighted that providing a right to nature is something that can be done at a local level.\n“The perhaps politically unlikely city of Austin Texas has been a global leader in creating a charter of rights for children to nature, one that British cities and communities could develop in their own directions.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments. We do reserve the right not to publish comments that may cause offence.\nOne thought on “Celebrating children’s access to nature”",

They were the two Green Party councillors on the Council at that time.\nDuring the campaign against the tree felling, Green Party councillors and activists took part in protests, risking arrest, injury and imprisonment.\nSheffield Green Party later supported the grassroots “It’s Our City” campaign, arising from the tree protests. This called for more accountability in the Council’s secretive Cabinet System which enabled just a few Labour Councillors to make all the decisions.\nIn May 2023 Green councillors forced an emergency meeting of Sheffield City Council to discuss and learn from the failure of strategic leadership exposed in the Lowcock Report.\nThe Council accepted the report’s recommendations and recognised that the committee system under No Overall Control requires a spirit of open, transparent and democratic ways of working. The council finally issued a public apology in response to the Lowcock report in June 2023.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson\nSheffield Green Party\nFor more details on the Lowcock report and the street tree inquiry see our articles on the council actions after the Lowcock report, the ongoing ignorance and lack of apology from some councillors, and the need for honest and openness in council as the key lessons of this scandal.",

(1) The police and RSPB are appealing for information about the disappearance.\nArthur’s nest mate, Olivia, disappeared near a grouse moor in the Peak District in September.\nBob Berzins, author of a report for Sheffield Green Party earlier this year titled Report from the Front Line: What’s Happening on Moors near Sheffield, and a volunteer who helped guard the nest, said: “Sadly, a familiar pattern has repeated itself. Arthur has disappeared near a grouse moor in unexplained circumstances, as did Olivia.\n“Mark Avery, author of Inglorious: Conflict in the Uplands, collated the information on known deaths of this year’s young hen harriers before Arthur’s fate was known. He found 12 had died in circumstances known to be natural. In every case their body and the transmitter was found, allowing a post mortem. None of these was on driven grouse moors. Yet the seven that have all disappeared without trace have all done so over or near driven grouse shooting moors.” (3)\n“There should be 300 breeding pairs of hen harriers in England, yet this year there were just nine, and already we have seen the apparently unnatural loss of seven of the young birds from those nests.”\nNatalie Bennett, former Green Party leader who lives in Sheffield, said: “I’ve joined campaigners including Chris Packham and Mark Avery for several years now in calling for a ban on driven grouse shooting. The link between illegal persecution of raptors and the industry is clear.\n“But there’s also the broader issue of the massive slaughter of many other species, including wonderful mountain hares in the Peak District, and foxes, crows and ravens, stoats and weasels across the country.\n“Land management for driven grouse shooting also increases the risk of flooding and reduces carbon storage. We are all paying a high price for this industry that a few engage in, a so-called sport that is really a slaughter.”\nNotes\n(3) https://markavery.info/2018/11/06/12-0-and-0-7-quite-striking-results/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It is about what kind of city we want to live in and we all agree that Sheffield has a proud tradition of tolerance and acceptance and we cannot welcome someone who wants to spread hate”\n“Whilst I totally support freedom of speech I believe that freedom of speech ends where hate speech starts.

This year it is 03/12/22. Sheffield Green Party are calling for a range of measures to help small business, from insulation grants to online portals making shopping local easier.\nPeter Gilbert from Ecclesall Green Party wanted to shine the spotlight on a local business and how important it is to the local community. He spoke to Karim Akbari Ghalehnovi, who runs the Persian Bakery at Banner Cross. Karim is proud to have the only bread oven of its kind in the UK. Business has been difficult and the cost of living crisis is only making things worse. He worries that the shop will have to close.\nPersian Bakery at Banner Cross on Ecclesall Road.\nPosters in the bakery window about the Iranian protests.\nKarim Akbari Ghalehnovi with bread fresh from the oven.\nThe Evans family of Nether Edge are regulars to the Persian Bakery.\nSmall Business Saturday is a grassroots campaign, which highlights small business success and encourages consumers to ‘shop local’ and support small businesses in their communities. It takes place on the first Saturday in December each year, but the campaign aims to have a lasting impact.\nKarim Akbari Ghalehnovi runs the Persian Bakery at Banner Cross, Ecclesall Road. He is proud to have the only bread oven of its kind in the UK, baking his ‘sangak’ flatbreads on a rotating bed of little stones heated by flames. He came to Sheffield over 10 years ago and opened his bakery two and a half years ago. At first he complimented the baking with an Iranian grocery but this summer changed his business model to a deli offering coffee, tea and sandwiches with fillings such as pistachio salami and Persian meat patties.\nDespite being in the heart of one of the most affluent areas in Sheffield, the shopkeepers of Banner Cross are struggling, with reports of sales down by up to 50%. For this year’s Small Business Saturday, Peter Gilbert from Ecclesall Green Party wanted to shine the spotlight on one of these businesses, and spent a morning talking with Karim and his customers. “These are my local shops,” says Peter, “I want them to thrive. Variety is the spice of life and I was very excited when the Persian Bakery opened close to my house. I also thought it was brave as it opened during Covid.”\nKarim says that business has been difficult and the cost of living crisis is only making things worse. He worries that he will have to close, which would be a great loss to Sheffield’s significant Iranian community and all the local residents that have got a taste for his unique bread. He said that local businesses’ sales are down by as much as 50%. For him it is down 30% – 40%. Karim said, “At this rate I can only go on for 2 – 3 months. If it doesn’t go up, maybe I am closing.”\nIn his shop window there are posters relating to Iran’s civil unrest. Asked about them Karim becomes thoughtful. “We have a gathering in the city centre, more than 200 people are coming. They are protesting against our government. This is not just one time, they started two months ago. Every weekend. I have been twice, but not today, I am working.”\nAs Karim removes hot loaves from his oven Farzaneh Alizdeh who lives in Fulwood comes into the shop smiling. “I am here to buy some bread,” she says. “Fresh bread. This is nostalgic bread actually for us. We used to buy this bread all the time in Iran when we were living there. And now we are lucky to have the same type of bread here. Previously it was brought from other cities, London, Manchester. You know, it’s bread, so you want it fresh. So, yeah, that’s why I am here, to get some fresh bread.”\nNext in line are the Evans family of Nether Edge: Oscar, Katherine and their 2-year-old Cedric. They have been many times before and say it is the fantastic bread that keeps them coming back for more. “I’ve got a slightly Middle Eastern inspired brunch that we are going to cook with halloumi and garlic mushrooms and eggs and stuff when we get home” says Oscar. “The bread is just the perfect accompaniment. I might make a lamb curry, dipping the bread in there so, yeah, it just kinda goes with a lot of the kind of weekend cuisine that we were hoping to eat.”\nKatherine says of the bakery, “It has changed since we were last in. It was more like a shop, whereas now they are selling sandwiches. It looks delicious and I love all the dips that they make. They have an aubergine dip and really good hummus. We’ve seen around the area lots of small business closing, independent business, so it’s nice to keep them alive”\nAfter the customers have gone Karim shows Peter his bins behind the shop. They are full of leftover bread; it doesn’t keep long and if it isn’t sold it is thrown out. Peter says that he will connect Karim up with one of the city’s food waste upcycling projects, like Food Works Sheffield, that offer a free collection service to food businesses with stock they are not able to make use of.\nPeter Gilbert concludes, “Our small businesses are struggling. We are lucky to have them, they are the backbone of our communities and they add richness to our lives. We need to support them. Shop local. Shop independent. Rather than buying your bread in plastic packaging from a supermarket, get it freshly baked.”",

This is bad news for the people of Sheffield, who have had years of underfunded local services.\n“Following an austerity agenda, as Labour proposes, will not deliver the change we need. Keir Starmer has made it clear that he “won’t turn on spending taps” if Labour win the next general election which promises no light at the end of the tunnel for cash-strapped local authorities and public services.\n“We must tax the rich more to bring in the funding needed for public services and to make us a more equal society. A tax on the income from wealth of the richest 1% would deliver £75 billion of additional funding to help improve the energy efficiency of homes and address high energy bills.\n“In the absence of action by Conservative / Labour Governments, there are things we can do locally. We could introduce an Employers Workplace Parking Levy which would apply to larger businesses with 50 or more parking spaces. The levy would help fund better public transport, support for cycling and walking and public charging points for electric vehicles.\n“We could establish a wholly-owned council company to help deliver the council’s objectives and raise income to deliver reliable services for Sheffield residents e.g. gardening, household repairs, heating system servicing and replacement and retrofit works. A similar project in Oxford raised £600,000 for council services this year.\n“We could invest in renewable energy projects on Council land and buildings to generate energy and income. Cambridgeshire County Council will soon be receiving £1 million each year from a solar farm it has developed.\n“If Labour simply follow a Conservative spending agenda, they will fail to deliver the real positive change for the people of Sheffield that is needed.”",

A system that perpetuates social injustice.\nWe must challenge the intersectionality of poverty, as those who are the least well off are more often than not from minoritised communities, disabled, women, pensioners.\nWe must challenge the narrative that blames migrants for the structural injustice of our society.\nThis means that we as leaders must have the courage to call out this injustice: the injustice of cutting benefits for disabled people or winter fuel payments for the elderly, the injustice of keeping the two child benefits cap.\nI look forward to a constructive and positive afternoon looking at what good practice already happens in the city and what shifts we need to make so that we can do everything in our power to build communities where everybody can thrive.\nCllr Angela Argenzio chats with Dr Zak McMurray – the two co-chairs of Sheffield’s Health and Wellbeing Board",

The wooden gate that spans between two stone toll posts had rotted away and fallen apart. After spotting that it needed maintenance, new Ecclesall councillor Peter Gilbert made sure work was done to get a fresh gate made and installed.\nCllr Gilbert said, “I saw the gate at Hunter’s Bar was looking in a sorry state. It’s something that thousands of people pass every day and even if not everyone notices it, it’s special for the area. It’s where Hunter’s Bar got its name! It’s part of my history as well. I grew up around here so it’s great to get it restored.”\nHe contacted officers at the Sheffield City Council to find out who was responsible for its upkeep. He found out that it was covered under the infamous PFI contract Streets Ahead. He asked officers to make sure the work was done to a high standard, asking that they take into account its listed building status and cultural significance.\nThe Hunter’s Bar Toll Gate was in place in the nineteenth century to charge people for going along the roads, with the fees used for their upkeep. The gate would only be opened when the fee was paid. Hunter’s Bar gives its name to the surrounding area, and was made world famous in the Arctic Monkeys song ‘Fake Tales of San Francisco’.\nThe Historic England official list entry describes it as a “Toll gate. c1810, resited early C20. 2 tapered round ashlar piers with rounded tops. Renewed single bar gate. Ecclesall Road was laid out as a toll road in 1810.”\nThe toll house which once stood here, along with the gate, reportedly closed in 1884, with a ‘large cheer’ going up from the crowd which had gathered to watch the keeper collect his last fee. The heavy old stone toll posts were moved onto the newly constructed roadabout in the late 1950s. Today this famous roundabout even has its own profile @Hunters_Bar on on the social media site X (formerly Twitter).\nWorking with council officers, Cllr Gilbert was pleased to see that the gate was restored quickly: “The council officers were really helpful in linking me with the right people to get this work done. I’d like to publicly thank them and the contractors for this work. If you see something like this that needs some maintenance, get in touch with your local councillor. They can help sort it and make your area a better place to live, whether you’re from High Green, Hunter’s Bar, or San Francisco.”\nWant to know more?\nSee the Star story about an old photo of Hunter’s Bar roundabout shortly after it was built.

She said:”In the face of a draconian crackdown from the council, tree protesters like Alison Teal have stood against this needless destruction. Indeed it’s Green councillors who are really standing up for what matters in Sheffield – and it’s only by voting Green that people in the city can guarantee they’ll have people on their side in the council chamber. ”\nFormer Green Party leader and Sheffield Central general election candidate Natalie Bennett comments: “Since the last local elections in 2016 we have seen police pre-dawn raids on Rustlings Rd and anti-trade union legislation used to arrest peaceful tree protesters. You have to question what this Labour-run council represents when it publicly states their intention to have a city councillor jailed – Cllr Alison Teal.\nNatalie continues: “The Green council group has worked very hard in the last 12 months to hold Labour to account in the face of measures to restrict council motions and debate. The Labour-led Council has a big majority, and Labour councillors’ actions are fully controlled by their Cabinet. On May 3rd residents can elect more Green opposition councillors who will stand up for local residents against a dictatorial Council.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Frankly, it’s worked an awful lot better this year than when it was a single party administration in previous years. No overall control means parties have to cooperate with each other. It’s certainly tricky; we certainly don’t agree with everything but, with that collaboration and compromise, you get better decisions and that is the best thing for the city.\n“The track record of Green councillors is they work hard in their wards and they do make a positive contribution. We have always been a small group: think what more we can do if we are a bigger group.”\nCouncillor Johnson said:\n“There are some really encouraging things going on. At the same time we pay credit to the huge amount of work that Councillors Kaltum Rivers and Alison Teal have put in over the last few years. They have really worked hard, in very different ways, raised the profile and really pushed the argument about why it’s important to be Green and what that looks like because it’s such a varied thing. It’s not just the traditional ecological approach: being Green is all about being part of the community.”\nMarieanne Elliot, the Green Candidate for Gleadless Valley, also speaking to The Star,\n“I’m absolutely delighted to be the candidate for my area because I feel really lucky to be part of such an active community where I live.\n“Like many people, I became more politically active and awakened when it became apparent that the Labour-run council was illegally felling street trees. I was so inspired by the community action and the strength of power in that group and it made me, and many other people, ask questions.\n“It’s been really nice to see my Green colleagues joining the Council’s Administration and bringing forward positive change. I think it’s not only to do with the measures that have been brought in, like the Clean Air Zone, it’s actually changing the culture of the council and it’s started a new era of openness and transparency.”",

This new group will look at ways of empowering parking services staff to address prohibited parking in areas which they can enforce, and we will also look to work with the police and community on obstructive pavement parking in residential areas.\n“Obstructive parking has many negative effects. It places people in danger – particularly children and young people, people with visual impairments, people who struggle with mobility and people with prams – as they are forced into the road. It also impacts public transport, as buses and sometimes trams get stuck behind parked cars or are blocked from stops. Cycle routes are also affected when cars are parked in cycle lanes.”\nThis initiative builds on the Council’s resolution to “Make Sheffield a Pedestrian Friendly City” agreed by Full Council this month after a motion was put forward by Sheffield Green Councillors.",

I grew up in a village in Lincolnshire, but have lived in large cities all over Europe; Birmingham, London, Copenhagen, Milan and Sheffield; it’s a wonderful kind of insight to learn how other people do things, as well as live in both inner cities and rural areas.\nThen there’s my parents’ sense of public duty – as a police officer and health & social care worker – which instilled in me values based on fairness and community care. My work first as an independent theatre-maker, then in academia, and now in the videogames sector running a small business means I understand what it means to be precarious as well as to have the responsibility of others’ livelihoods in my stewardship.\nA common thread through it all though has been activism. After being involved in student and environmental protests in my 20s and working in communities, the arts, and the tech sector trying to advocate for better worlds since, I have been disheartened to see Keir Starmer’s Labour Party give up on workers, the NHS, and the climate emergency. Watering down policies one by one. The refusal to value the lives of Palestinians alongside those of Israeli hostages in November 2023 was a last straw. That’s what brought me to the Green Party.\nBoth Labour and the Conservatives tell us they see the problems we face, but neither are brave or honest about the solutions. The Green Party is. The Green Party puts people and workers at its heart. Sets out real possibilities to increase wages; lower bills; stimulate the economy through green jobs; and build walkable cities, connecting towns and villages with public transport and infrastructure which improves our lives, our health, and our wellbeing. We need an NHS which is not on its knees, a state which supports us, and success which is shared by all.\nI have always believed in worker’s rights, the need for justice for all, to build a society that lifts us all up, and an NHS and state that pick us up when we stumble. I also believe that the most urgent threat to our ability to improve our lives is the climate emergency. This starts with us, at a local level, making changes that work for us, and help us build a better world, together.\nIf I were elected as MP for Sheffield South East, it would be a privilege to listen to you. To not just advocate for change, but to make it.\nTo help Hannah’s campaign please donate to the Crowdfunder, join the Green Party and Get Involved.\nTo contact Hannah’s team email sheffield.south.east@votegreen.uk",

The campaign marched through the streets of London last Saturday, 26th April, and protested outside the Home Office and Defra.\nGreen councillors say now is the time to stand with farmers, conservation workers, growers, and other land workers across Sheffield and South Yorkshire who are working to feed communities, protect wildlife, and restore land, from the city’s community gardens to the moors of the Peak District. Greens call on the Labour government to fulfil their manifesto promise to “champion British farming whilst protecting the environment”.\nGreen Councillor, Marieanne Elliot, said:\n“It’s clear that the Government needs to invest in nature-friendly farming.\n“There are so many reasons why it is crucial for our future. In addition to improving food security and supporting our farmers, there are multiple benefits for our communities. For example, cleaner water due to a reduction in pollutants running off fields into our waterways; improved air quality through planting of trees, bushes and other plants; protection of homes and businesses from flooding with natural flood management practices like restoring peatland, which also delivers carbon benefits.”\nGreen activist, Andy Davies, said:\n“As someone who looks after land for biodiversity, I recognise the importance of ensuring landholders can access funding and public support for sustainably producing food and managing land. I would like to see the UK government reinstate the Sustainable Farming Incentive while it is being revised and recognise the importance of nature-friendly farmers in meeting environmental ambitions.”\n“Populist misinformation is creating false divides between farming and nature, between rural and urban, and between environmental protection and economic survival. In reality, these are all connected. If we want food security and climate resilience, we must back the people and policies that make them possible.”\nThe Food In Our Hands campaign calls on the government to deliver fair, well-funded Environmental Land Management schemes (ELMs), support nature-friendly farming, and protect rural livelihoods.\nThis also means ensuring farmers and food growers are given greater financial security to allow them to transition to sustainable models of production. For example, Greens support the trial of a universal basic income for farmers and food growers as proposed by Natalie Bennett, Baroness of Manor Castle, in the House of Lords.\nWe call on our Sheffield MPs to:\n-Back full funding and fair access to ELMs for landworkers across the region;\n-Reject populist rhetoric that pits nature against food or undermines science;\n-Champion policies that restore biodiversity, build climate resilience, and support food justice.",

However a lot has changed since we first declared ourselves the UK’s first City of Sanctuary. Violence & persecution has increased as the world has been destabilised by a dysfunctional system fueling conflict and climate change.\n“We have had 13 years of an increasingly far right Conservative government which seeks to blame the most vulnerable people for its own failings. Racist policies & avoidable tragedies such as the deaths of up to 650 migrants in the Mediterranean means it is more vital than ever to reaffirm Sheffield as a City of Sanctuary and oppose the government’s hostile environment.\n“Sheffield Green Party hopes that all the parties in Sheffield will be able to support this vital motion, which follows the amazing success of the Migration Matters festival – the biggest celebration of migration in the UK.”\nREFERENCES\n1) Green councillors will also be asking for a minute’s silence to remember the 650 migrating people who drowned off the Greek coast\n2) Migration matters website is https://www.migrationmattersfestival.co.uk/",

There will be no freeing up of local lines in Sheffield and no commitment to the extension of the Sheffield branch line to Leeds.\n“But the huge cost of HS2 now means cheaper and more cost effective proposals are being dumped. HS2 will affect transport spending for decades to come. The investment tied up in HS2 is not good value for money for Sheffield City Region and the money would be better spent on improvements to the local and regional train network, in particular the overcrowded cross-Pennine routes.\n“Rather than celebrating such a deal, Sheffield Council should be demanding that connections between northern cities are prioritised if the Northern Powerhouse is to be more than a soundbite.”\nNotes\n- The proposed cost of HS2 is £56 billion. Electrification of Midland Mainline was costed at £1.6 billion and expected to save £30 million a year after completion.\n- Sheffield Green Party’s previous statement is at: http://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2016/09/28/sheffield-greens-call-to-scrap-hs2-in-favour-of-improved-east-west-routes/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We need to create communities that are green and well-connected, where people feel safe and where their health and well-being can thrive.\nWe need to protect the NHS and fund social care properly and for the long term.\nWe must give hope to our young people and give them opportunities to have a positive future with the skills for the future.\nWe need to change the narrative around migration. We must enable safe and legal journeys into the country but also shift how the UK positions itself on the world stage.

But they both showed they have nothing to offer – just blaming the Government and tinkering around the edges, asking for reviews and for someone else to do something but with nothing that would bring in more funds to support public transport”\n“I asked the Council Leader, as a member of the Mayoral Combined Authority, whether he recognised that policies to encourage private car use, such as free parking, undermine public transport.”\nThe Greens submitted the same amendment to both Labour and LibDem motions. They highlighted the option of introducing an Employers Workplace Parking Levy which brings in £9 million every year in Nottingham to support public transport initiatives and better facilities for walkers and cyclists. Greens also proposed lower fares for public transport balanced by higher parking fees for private cars and better enforcement of pavement parking and other offences.\nCouncillor Johnson said,\n“Complaining about rising fares, unreliable services and cuts to bus routes is easy. Our amendment proposed that this council needs to grapple with the difficult questions of what is in our control that will have a positive impact on public transport. We need to encourage those who can to get out of their cars and use buses and trams instead. At the moment, relatively low cost parking and free access to drive into the city centre means there is no incentive to do that for anyone who can afford to run their own private vehicle.\nThe public looks to local politicians to come up with realistic and proven solutions to failing public transport, carbon emissions, clean air, equality of access and the cost of living. If people are going to have faith in politicians, they are going to want to see more than just hand wringing; they want to see action. Sadly, Labour and LibDem councillors joined forces to rule out even looking at these options.”\nENDS\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nUnder current proposals, bus services in Sheffield could be cut by up to 30% from 4th October 2022, when Covid-related Government subsidy comes to an end. Like all areas of the country, bus patronage is only about 72% of its pre-Covid levels.\nThe Green councillors’ amendment states:\nAmendment to be moved by Councillor Douglas Johnson, seconded by Councillor Bernard Little\nThat the Motion now submitted be amended by the addition of new paragraphs (j) to (o) as follows:-\n(j) believes that politicians across South Yorkshire have undermined public transport for many years by promoting individual car use, through providing free or low-cost car parking in town / city centres, ineffective and insufficient parking enforcement and active opposition to improvement measures like bus lanes or residents’ parking schemes;\n(k) regrets the lack of ambition set out in the Bus Service Improvement Plan submitted to the Government by the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority and in particular that “success” would have meant fewer people using buses in the future;\n(l) notes that bus operators are commercial companies and are not primarily there to provide a public service; and therefore believes in a need for public ownership and control of buses;\n(m) believes that public transport is an equality issue, as only 35% of the population in the bottom 10% of wealth own a car, whereas 93% of the top 10% own at least one;\n(n) notes that Yorkshire and Humberside already gets only £500 per head of population spent on transport compared with £1,476 for London (in 2020/21) and believes that the Government cannot be serious about “levelling up” until it guarantees equal funding; and\n(o) however, recognises that this Council must do what it can to support as many buses on as many routes as it can and therefore requests the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Policy Committee to consider using all the levers at its disposal to make public transport more attractive than private cars, including:-\n(i) advertising to promote public transport usage, in particular aimed at those who do not routinely use buses and including through the universities;\n(ii) lower fares, multi-operator tickets and tap-on technology as standard;\n(iii) measures for multi-modal travel, including bikes on trams;\n(iv) higher parking fees for private car ownership;\n(v) more priority routes for buses and trams;\n(vi) higher quality bus or tram shelters, and staffed bus/tram interchanges;\n(vii) more effective enforcement of illegal, selfish and dangerous parking that often goes unchecked;\n(viii) schemes such as an employer’s workplace parking levy to reduce the perks of free parking and raise substantial sums to provide improved bus services, tram services and better walking and cycling infrastructure;\n(ix) allowing a reasonable increase in regulated taxi fares; and\n(x) encouraging innovative neighbourhood community hub bus services that serve local shopping areas.",

That is money that could have been spent wisely on investment in infrastructure that could have prevented this trashing of our environment.\n“Water privatisation has been a failed experiment. A service as vital as water and sewerage needs to be run by the public and for the public good. Shareholder payouts and CEO bonuses need to be halted with immediate effect where water quality is substandard.”\n“Pollution has serious local impacts, such as the sewage discharges in Sheffield by the Lady’s Bridge into the River Don. This discharges threaten projects to support reintroducing salmon and trout to our rivers.\n“We need to make polluters pay by committing to resourcing the Environment Agency to effectively monitor and guide the water industry and agriculture, with a much more aggressive and focussed approach to enforcement and prosecution.”\nGreen Party Councillors proposed an amendment to the motion to bring water back into public ownership as soon as practicable to stop sewage discharges and cut bills. This amendment was rejected by Labour and Lib Dem politicians,\nCouncillor Elliot said, following the vote,\n“I am very disappointed that the Lib Dems and Labour Councillors backed water companies and their shareholders over investment in infrastructure. To address a problem you first have to acknowledge what that problem is and they have failed to do that.”\nIn the text of the amendment, Green councillors said:\n- Thousands of voluntary River Rangers, Citizen Scientists and active swimmers, kayakers, anglers and walkers, armed with the invaluable data supplied by the Rivers Trust and other researchers, are contributing to monitoring water quality;\n- A rising tide of sewage discharges, such as the discharges in Sheffield by the Lady’s Bridge into the River Don, threaten projects to support reintroducing salmon and trout to our rivers\n- Water privatisation has been a failed experiment, and that a service as vital as water and sewerage needs to be run by the public and for the public good\n- Shareholder pay-outs and CEO bonuses need to be halted with immediate effect where water quality is substandard;\n- Government should make polluters pay by committing to resourcing the Environment Agency to effectively monitor and guide the water industry and agriculture, including a restoration of staff resources and a much more aggressive and focussed approach to enforcement and prosecution, working closely with voluntary organisations;\n- And bring water back into public ownership as soon as practicable to stop sewage discharges and cut bills;\nSee the report in Bright Green",

We need more cycling options so people can choose to leave their cars at home.\nOfo got no money from the city council so the decision to abandon Sheffield is purely a commercial one. The full details are unclear.\nCouncil transport officers should do a report looking at what has happened. What made it worse in Sheffield than in London, Cambridge, Oxford and Norwich and 250 other cities across the world? Is it theft and criminal damage? Is it hills? Is it the lack of safe and clearly marked cycle lanes? Was the scheme too small? Or too big? Is it because of Brexit? [No, it isn’t].\nAs a complete novice, I learnt to ride an Ofo bike. It became a really handy way of getting about town. Even for me, the hills weren’t too bad.

Most importantly it stops at the Hallamshire Hospital so it means not only those in need of the essential health services they provide, but also those who provide those essential services won’t be able to get there, unless they have alternate means of transport or take multiple buses.\nMost of the services that Powells ran have been picked up by other companies but the number 10/10a is one of the few that remain without a provider.\nThis is yet another blow to public transport and not only reduces access to travel but reduces our impact on tackling the climate emergency and air pollution. For many, the only alternative to time consuming bus hopping or taxis will mean more car journeys, if people are fortunate enough to own one.\nThe key challenge now for the Mayor of South Yorkshire is to get a fresh tender out there to invite other bus operators to serve this vital lifeline, or even better, set up a publicly owned bus company to operate these services. Either way, this needs dealing with urgently.\nPlease sign and share the petition in support of reinstating the number 10/10a bus service here:-\nhttps://chng.it/GC57hb7jGt\nYours,\nSally Pedley – GV TARA Chair\nCllr Alexi Dimond\nCllr Paul Turpin\nCllr Marieanne Elliot",

She never, however, disclosed the fact that she was Jewish, nobody in school knew. It has always bothered me that she did not feel that she could be open about who she was, and this in the country with the oldest Jewish community in Europe, as the Jews came to Rome before the Christians.\nHaving been a human rights activist since the age of 15 I believe that it is particularly important at our time in history to re-affirm our support for the Jewish people and to stand against antisemitism. And in fact to stand against any kind of xenophobia.\nWe also need to recognise that conflating Jewish and Israeli identity is inappropriate and it is in itself antisemitic. It is like saying that being catholic and being Italian are the same thing.\nFurthermore we must be clear that it is not antisemitic to criticise the Israeli government and to hold it to internationally recognised human rights standards, in the same way that it is not Islamophobic to criticise Saudi Arabia for their human rights violations in Yemen.\nLord Mayor, it is paramount now, when this country and the world in general seem to be polarised and when certain people in power seek to set us against each other, to say loudly and clearly that we will not accept or condone any form of intolerance.\nSo let Sheffield, the first City of Sanctuary, send a clear message of hope in contrast with the rhetoric that currently dominates the political and media discourse.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We only had a few days.\nI will continue to work with STAG colleagues to seek genuine dialogue with the council to prevent the loss of the vital environmental benefits provided by healthy mature trees. The campaign will continue to use peaceful and lawful means to limit felling.\nWe really appreciate the ongoing support of thousands of people within this campaign, including those who have donated to the legal fund. Dave, Calvin and myself are grateful to Howells Solicitors for their expertise and exceptionally generous support. I also appreciate the support of Sheffield Green Party colleagues, from members across the country and the messages of support from Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We all try our best to live without damaging the planet, but even as an environmental activist I admit that it can be tiring and extremely difficult to live sustainably. When our public transport is lacking and expensive, it’s all too easy to hop in a car. It is practically impossible to avoid plastic packaging.\nLuckily, with my vote, I hope that The Green Party can begin to make changes for us. They are the only party that have consistently worked to tackle the climate crisis, big polluters and ecological breakdown. The Greens have, in one form or another, been empowering people to live more sustainably and pushing for action against the corporations who are big polluters for over forty years.\nAs an MP, Alison would continue working to empower the people of Sheffield to live sustainably, work that she started in the town hall and at protest sites. Along with Caroline Lucas, she would push for a zero-waste society to tackle plastic pollution. Green MPs would campaign for a Clean Air Act, to reduce clean up our poisonous air by reducing our reliance on private vehicles. Green MPs would push to kickstart tree-planting programmes, replacing so many that were lost in Sheffield.\nAll of this would be done whilst sticking up for the general public. The Green Party is firmly anti-austerity and pushes for a real living wage. It calls for a ban on zero-hours contracts and a universal basic income to lift people out of poverty. Unlike other parties, it has also been unashamedly pro-European since the start and is in favour of a people’s vote, a democratic solution to the current mess that the traditional parties have created in parliament.\nIn Sheffield Central, we are in the wonderful position where we can vote with our hearts and campaign for ideals. The Conservatives don’t stand a chance here, but the Greens do, having received the highest number of votes in the Sheffield Central area in the European and Council Elections in 2019.

The recycling point is heavily used by customers and local residents, the vast majority of whom use it tidily. By hosting the recycling point, Waitrose has helped provide an important option for local people to recycle more. There has been some dumping and littering, but Waitrose could have worked to address this, which it has failed to do, despite many requests from councillors and residents.\nGiven their expertise, we would also expect Veolia to have been more helpful, for example emptying bins more frequently and encouraging tidy use. But has Veolia really failed so badly? The old Waitrose recycling site has been turned into apartments and now John Lewis wants to build an “e-commerce depot” over more of the Waitrose car park.

The aim of this post is to pass on information on the main changes that affect services in and around the Hillsborough area and some background information to explain why changes are happening.\nThe changes across South Yorkshire are summarised here with links to new timetables here https://travelsouthyorkshire.com/en-gb/newsupdates/service-changes. Specific information from us about Hillsborough area changes follows below.\nHenry Nottage Henry.Nottage@councillor.sheffield.gov.uk\nChristine Gilligan Kubo Christine.Gilligan@councillor.sheffield.gov.uk\nBus changes:\nThe 52A First service will no longer continue past Hillsborough Interchange to Wisewood and Loxley and evening services stop around 8pm. However, additional Stagecoach 52 Woodhouse – Hillsborough evening services are added from Monday to Saturday in partial replacement.\nThe suggested alternatives to the 52A are the 61 and 62 which Stagecoach has taken over from Powell’s. These are hourly with very few evening services and no Sunday service at present. Plus a revived 31 loop service between Angel St in the city centre via Upperthorpe and Hillsborough Interchange to Loxley. Services are hourly between around 7.30am to 7pm only with no Sunday service.\nThe SL1/SL1A and First 57 services are withdrawn and replaced by the Stagecoach operated 57 Stocksbridge Flyer. At Middlewood Park & Ride, it joins the route of the current 57 on Worrall Road via Langsett Avenue and continues down Dykes Hall Lane into the city centre. Services will be from 5am to beyond 11pm and half hourly at peak times. There will be 4 less services on Saturdays and Sunday buses will be hourly from 6.30am to beyond 11pm.\nThe 135 Stagecoach service will operate between Rotherham and Chapeltown only. It will no longer operate between Sheffield and Chapeltown via Hillsborough.\nThe First 86 service is withdrawn and replaced by the Stagecoach 86 service with additional evening trips.\nThe First service 8A is withdrawn. All journeys now run as service 8 which will only travel from Ecclesfield to Birley Tram stop. Evening and Sunday services will not cover the Hillsborough area – the advice is “for journeys to Parson Cross/Ecclesfield, use Stagecoach service 7.”\nThe 18 service has timetable changes and continues as a Monday to Friday service with no Saturday operator found.\nThe 81, 82, 97 and 98 have timetable changes.\nThere are no changes to the services 58 and M92 operated by South Pennine Community Transport and to Stagecoach service 7.\nTram changes:\nSYPTE advise “The changes are mostly in the evening when the timetable is completely revised. There are some minor changes in the daytime. There are no changes to the frequency of individual routes, however in some cases where more than one route operates the combined frequency will be better than now and the early evening service on the Blue and Yellow route has also been improved for some journeys.”\nWHY ARE THESE CUTS HAPPENING?\n– Bus services are organised and overseen by the South Yorkshire Mayoral Authority (SYMCA) not by Sheffield City Council.\n– The private bus companies bid for and run routes they think will be profitable.\n– Any vital routes may be supported by SYMCA but their funds have been drastically reduced by government cuts since 2010.\n– Services have gradually been reduced/cut back/withdrawn since 1986.\n– Covid led to some government support for bus companies to make up for the drop in passenger numbers.\n– In September 2022, passenger numbers were still 20% below pre-Covid numbers. The Covid support funding was due to end in October but the Government extended this until March 2023.\n– Some bus companies chose not to utilise this funding extension due to difficulties recruiting drivers and that is why some cuts were made in October.\n– More cuts are inevitable unless buses are brought back under public control and South Yorkshire receives a more appropriate level of government funding.\nWHAT ARE THE GREEN PARTY DOING?\nThe Green Party continues to campaigns to bring public transport back under public control with proper government funding to protect routes and services. But local leaders at the Mayoral Combined Authority also need to stop prioritising private car use over public transport and to build a far more ambitious aim for South Yorkshire’s public transport network.

We welcome this, as the Greens have continually pushed for greater openness, including webcasting of council meetings, for several years. This is by far the best way of letting the public see what goes on in the council chamber. Our full list of proposals is on the website.\nSeptember’s full council meeting was the first to start at the new time of 5pm, with shorter meetings, shorter debates and shorter speeches. Although we had worked hard to achieve agreement in the working group, the council meeting was characterised by the points of disagreement. We objected to Labour’s proposal to limit the number of motions (pdf) we could put forward.\nAt the moment, the council’s constitution allows councillors to put forward motions without a limit on their number. In the last 6 ordinary meetings, we have put forward 8 motions, on air pollution, the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) in higher education, fossil fuel divestment, diversity in the theatres, funding for buses, HS2, trees, safety and a motion of no confidence in the council leadership.\nUnder Labour’s proposal, we would only be able to put four motions a year and none at all this month. Labour’s proposal was also to change the order so their own motions would always be debated first.\nWe challenged Labour’s power-grab by putting forward two motions anyway, one of them on the importance of upholding the constitution. The Chief Executive grudgingly admitted he had “no basis for rejecting the two Green motions.”\nOne of the recommendations from the working group was to be more open by being clear about who was proposing and seconding them so it was ironic that Labour’s proposal was put anonymously on the agenda paper. We said that if Labour wants to use their majority to change the constitution, they must do it openly.\nThere were petitions and public questions. Petitions included a request to withdraw the Freedom of the City from Aung San Suu Kyi in protest at the treatment of the Rohingya by the Burmese authorities. Although there was sympathy, this issue had to be deferred to another day.\nThen there was a petition by Anthony Cunningham, with 7,538 signatures, asking to be provided with a “night-café.” This was very similar to his previous petition asking for a night-shelter. After a minor drama involving shouting and being asked to leave the council chamber, the debate was short and the issue referred to the Scrutiny Committee.\nThree petitions did not have speakers so they were just referred to the Cabinet member without comment. Unusually, the number of signatures for each was not announced until the council was challenged. Only then was it revealed that the petition to save the elm on Chelsea Rd had 3,023 signatures (enough to secure a discussion at a Scrutiny Committee) and the petition to “stop debating trees” had only eight.\nIn fact the public interest in trees continued. In answer to Nigel Slack, the council responded that about 100 miles of streets were yet to be resurfaced despite the Core Investment Period coming to an end. We received a written answer to our question, which showed the council’s legal costs for obtaining injunction were £150,000. We were told the “evidence collectors” were not SIA-registered or DBS-checked. Unfortunately, Cllr Bryan Lodge side-stepped the question of why, Given that the Streets Ahead contract states that Amey is liable for any losses caused through trespass and protest, it was the Council – and not Amey – that bore these costs.\nAs questions about trees were left to the end of the public session, they were hurried and Sally Goldsmith was stopped from asking her question about the Vernon Oak. The Lord Mayor ordered her to sit down, at which point she publicly gave her resignation from the Labour Party.\nInterestingly, this question was similar to my written question about the Chelsea Elm – “is it not wrong and disingenuous for the Council to make completely unsubstantiated claims?”\nIn public questions, Deborah Cobbett asked what the council was doing about the NHS’ “Accountable Care Systems,” the replacement for cuts in the Sustainability and Transformation Plans. The Cabinet member said there would be a paper to Cabinet in 2 weeks. There isn’t.\nPeter Davies from the GMB asked why Labour-controlled authorities such as this one had “gone further than the Tories” in cutting wages of Veolia staff. The cabinet denied responsibility as it was an outsourced contract.\nOnce we got to motions for debate, it was about the Government and council promoting HS2 and the decision to abandon the electrification of the Midland Main Lane. Rob Murphy was the only speaker to point out the obvious connection between the two.\nLabour’s other motion, on betting shops, had no absolutely connection to Sheffield, any more than any other town in Britain. Whilst all councillors agreed that betting shops cause a problem, we pointed out the contradictions between Labour’s national position and the Labour council’s statement of “how important this sector of the entertainment industry is within the city.”\nOur two motions were voted on. We actually voted in favour of the Labour amendment to our motion on the constitution as we secured their confirmation that “changes to the constitution will only take place in accordance with the constitutional process.”\nOur second motion called for an urgent reassessment of the supply and demand of purpose-built student accommodation. Our figures show that more bedspaces in these blocks have been approved for planning permission in the last 12 months than in the previous 5 years. We believe the council needs up-to-date information on the current situation. Labour voted against this proposal.\nFor a council meeting run on new lines, I thought the best analysis was from the Star’s reporter Alex Moore who tweeted “Not sure that was any more or less engaging than the previous format.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Voters over 70 are three times more likely to vote Conservative than young people. If you’re in any doubt about the government’s intent, you need only look to London Oyster cards. The 60+ Oyster card will be accepted as valid photo ID, but the virtually identical 18+ Oyster card, and Young Persons Railcards, will not be accepted.\nA list of acceptable ID cards is here. You can apply for free photo ID by the April 25th deadline to vote in the council elections on May 4th. Register to vote by April 17th and apply for a postal vote by April 18th via www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/voting\nDon’t forget to bring your ID when you vote at a polling station from now on. Don’t let the Tories get away with this attack on your right to vote, which must be rolled back once they are voted out of office.\nAsh Routh\nCouncil election candidate, Walkley Green Party",

There will be no freeing up of local lines in Sheffield and no commitment to the extension of the Sheffield branch line to Leeds.\n“But the huge cost of HS2 now means cheaper and more cost effective proposals are being dumped. HS2 will affect transport spending for decades to come. The investment tied up in HS2 is not good value for money for Sheffield City Region and the money would be better spent on improvements to the local and regional train network, in particular the overcrowded cross-Pennine routes.\n“Rather than celebrating such a deal, Sheffield Council should be demanding that connections between northern cities are prioritised if the Northern Powerhouse is to be more than a soundbite.”\nNotes\n- The proposed cost of HS2 is £56 billion. Electrification of Midland Mainline was costed at £1.6 billion and expected to save £30 million a year after completion.\n- Sheffield Green Party’s previous statement is at: http://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2016/09/28/sheffield-greens-call-to-scrap-hs2-in-favour-of-improved-east-west-routes/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It’s what fairground rides make a living out of. But with fairground rides, we know where the ride is going.

The climate crisis has flooded, burnt, and swept away the future for communities close to home and around the globe. We know that the earlier we act, the more we can take control, but what difference can we make?\nThe new website www.carbon.place shows carbon emissions per person from across Sheffield. As ever with these kinds of stats, we see the city split North/East to South/West. For example, the carbon emissions per person in some areas of Fulwood are double the average for Sheffield and five times more than in some areas of Gleadless. We have some tough choices to make. Sheffield Green Party have committed Sheffield Council to being carbon zero by 2030. Several Sheffield businesses have committed to the same target. There needs to be more. We all need to take responsibility for what we can do.\nThe positive thing is, people with higher incomes have the biggest opportunity to make an impact. On www.carbon.place we can see where most carbon emissions across the city come from; flying, leisure, food and drink, and gas for heating. There are a lot of people across the city who can make changes right now that will benefit everyone. Enjoy staycations, use Skype and not flights for business, eat plant-based and local food, switch to renewable energy and heat-pumps, change pensions to carbon-neutral options. We don’t know what the future holds, but if we act now, then we can take a little bit of control. Leave the fairground rides to the fairground.\nYours faithfully,\nSheffield Green Party",

I set out the issues we face and the Green Party solutions. I also spoke about leadership and the power of working together. When we think of leaders we may think of the Prime Minister. But leaders exist throughout our communities.\nOur local leaders are councillors and charity coordinators, governors and sports club coaches. They are small business owners and litter pick volunteers. Every community needs people to step forward. Someone who inspires others to work alongside them towards the same goal.\nEveryone reading this can think about stepping forward. To clean up a park. To protest a closure. To start up a sports club. It doesn’t take many people working together to make positive change. You could work together with friends or family. Or a club or community group. Even a political party!\nBut I also ask your readers to reflect on this, as I said to the pupils who questioned me. For our nation, the challenges we face seem huge. Crumbling public services. People not being able to afford food. The climate crisis. All these problems can be solved if enough people work together to fix them.\nThe Greens offer a manifesto of hope and real change. Our policies move forward to address the challenges we face. They have been backed by teachers, Greenpeace, care workers, and more. We want to inspire others because we can only solve our challenges together.\nOutside of Westminster, we will need leaders in our neighbourhoods, our workplaces, and our schools. We will need everyone to step forward and work together. Whatever the result on July 4th, we can all take the lead in making our nation better.\nYours sincerely,\nJason Leman",

Without urgent action 13% of species in England are threatened with extinction and we must face up to the fact that our iconic wildlife and plantlife is under threat [1].\nOur natural world is staggering from the impact of habitat degradation, urbanisation, pollution, agricultural practices and climate change – all contributing to widespread disruption to the survival and distribution of native species.\nTo tackle the climate crisis, we need to re-wild and restore the natural world. Emissions cuts must be matched with ambitious action to fix our broken ecosystems, so that they can help to stabilise our climate [2].\nHealthy ecosystems can also help to protect communities from flooding, coastal erosion, air pollution and even disease. Restoring wild places is good for us, as time spent outdoors connecting with nature can support our health and wellbeing.\nSheffield has a proud history and bright future as the UK’s outdoor city. We are passionate about our radical history of environmental protest and our wonderful parks, rivers and peaks. By taking action locally we can lead the way in creating a city where people and nature can thrive alongside one another.\nJoin us in declaring a nature emergency and planting the seeds of change right here in our own back-yard.\nOne of the first actions of the newly appointed Green Executive members is to support declaring a Nature Emergency.\nCllr Alison Teal, Executive Member for Sustainable Neighbourhoods, Wellbeing, Parks and Leisure, said:\n“We strongly support declaring a nature emergency for many reasons. The climate crisis and pace of modern development undoubtedly has a huge impact on our natural world, with many wildlife and plants suffering the consequences.\n“It’s encouraging to see so much public support for nature and our environment, and we will look to bring a motion to council at the earliest opportunity to declare a Nature Emergency.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Executive Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport added:\n“The groundswell of concern in the public, matched by the knowledge and expertise of campaign groups means that now is the right time to focus on the loss of biodiversity. Formally declaring a Nature Emergency is a spur to move on with a plan of action to address this.”\nCllr Peter Garbutt said:\n“The Climate Emergency threatens our way of life, that’s well known. Less well known is the Ecological Emergency, equally as threatening, and intertwined with the former. The way we mistreat nature means floods are more likely, food will be harder to grow, and our beautiful green spaces will wither away.”\n“Declaring an emergency is a necessary first step to putting actions in place to help stop the decline, and I’m very pleased we’re doing this today.

(1)\nThe proposal, to fund a dedicated advice worker post to address cost of living issues, was the brainchild of Green Councillors from Gleadless Valley Ward. The adviser will provide advice to people during drop-in sessions at community groups, food banks, libraries and Tenants and Residents Associations.\nCouncillor Paul Turpin who proposed the post said,\n“We know that many people do not know what they are entitled to. It has been estimated that around £15 Billion of benefits, that people could claim, is not applied for in the first place. By helping put more money in people’s pockets, this role will also help the local economy in Sheffield, with more money being spent in local shops.” (2)\nGleadless Valley Councillor Marieanne Elliot said,\n“Having a trained, dedicated adviser providing face-to-face advice is one of the most effective ways of helping people. This means immediate help with living costs but can also bring about positive longer term changes. The adviser will give advice on how to apply for benefits, manage bills and help with appointments and form filling.They will attend community groups and food banks and focus on income maximisation.\n“Talking to food banks in our area, it is clear that more face-to-face advice is needed to reach people who face barriers when using online or telephone advice services.”\nCouncillor Alexi Dimond said,\n“It is often the most vulnerable who have the most difficulty applying for benefits and navigating the complicated processes.

Meanwhile the council continues to spray 1750 litres of the toxic herbicide Glyphosate annually to kill weeds on pavements, verges and parks.\nIn February a Green motion asked the council to assess “gradually increasing the number of meadows and where appropriate ‘rewilding’ land which is currently grass requiring regular maintenance, in order to increase biodiversity and reduce costs and use of chemical pollutants.” The “Plantlife” campaign advise that a regular late summer cut and removal of clippings will keep most verges open, safe and thriving with interesting wildlife.\nSmall scale trials rarely lead to large scale project roll outs by Sheffield Council or their contracted companies. Our motion included a raft of Green climate emergency proposals desperately needed following a year of council inaction.\nGreens will keep pushing the government and our council to “Build Back Better” so we can emerge into a safer, healthier, greener world when the Coronavirus crisis can be put behind us.

There is also a strong argument that divesting from fossil fuels will mean a more stable climate and economy. That is good for everyone and pension funds.\n“I don’t think there is any justification to continue to invest in these firms, given the threat to the entire fund from climate change caused by burning fossil fuels.”",

Gleadless Valley Councillor Alexi Dimond writes on why this expensive plan is misguided.\nGreen Party councillors submitted a motion to the last Sheffield City Council meeting calling for the £138 million of Regional funding for reopening Doncaster Sheffield Airport to be used instead to help insulate people’s homes. Sadly, this was rejected by Liberal Democrat and Labour Councillors.\nIn the Green Party motion, we highlighted the proximity of other regional airports such as Manchester, East Midlands and Leeds/Bradford. We provided evidence from the Royal Society that demonstrates proposals for so-called ‘Sustainable Aviation Fuels’ cannot be produced in sufficient quantities to support flying to current levels.\nReopening Doncaster Sheffield Airport would lead to an expansion of flights with all the associated carbon emissions, making reaching our Net Zero targets more difficult and expensive to achieve. South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority has committed to delivering a Zero Carbon economy by 2040. Supporting airport expansion makes that target much more difficult to achieve. There is also the concern that the public will again be subsidising a private venture which may yet again end in failure.\nLabour councillors backed the £138 million re-opening of Sheffield-Doncaster airport\nInstead of subsidising an airport, and therefore the flights of people who can afford to fly, we wanted to invest in projects that helped people reduce their energy bills. This would put more money into the local economy and reduce carbon emissions. Supporting a scheme to insulate homes is demonstrably a better use of public money.\nIn voting against our motion, the Lib Dems and Labour were ignoring the climate impacts of air travel and actually promoting more carbon emissions. This seems to be part of a wider trend as we now hear that the Labour Government is considering supporting a third runway at Heathrow, with all the local, national and global climate impacts that come with it.\nTackling climate change requires political commitment and making the right choices. Very few credible politicians deny the science of climate change anymore. The threat to our futures now comes from politicians who ignore the facts and therefore make the wrong choices.",

The Committee heard a proposal for a new gambling establishment ‘Bet Extra’ at Castle Square (1)\nThe Licensing Committee heard evidence directly from Charles Ritchie, who founded the “Gambling with Lives” charity after his son Jack died tragically at the age of 24 from becoming addicted to gambling. (2)\nGreen Party Leader and City Ward Councillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“I felt a weird privilege to sit next to Mr Ritchie and explaining why the three local councillors also worried about expanding a betting shop in the city centre.\n“I told the committee about the impact that a newer, bigger betting shop would have on the hundreds of school children, students and young people who pass through Castle Square every day. When I suggested it could be a condition that windows are blacked out to avoid the lure of gambling, the solicitor for the business strongly rejected that. He indicated they would have as big a display as the law permits.\nThe Green Councillors’ comments were also in line with objections from the Children Safeguarding Partnership, the Licensing Service and Changing Sheff, the city centre residents’ group (3) . It was very disappointing to find out that the sub-committee had decided to side with the gambling business and to grant the licence for bigger premises.”\nCouncillor Ruth Mersereau who is also a City Ward Councillor who submitted a detailed objection to the proposal said\n“There is evidence to show that gambling can be a significant cause of harm to human health and wellbeing. And, as has been noted in previous objections by Public Health to nearby proposal for gambling shops in Haymarket and Fargate, there are a number of land-based gambling premises already existing in the area.\n“Gambling shops in the city centre have attracted anti-social behaviour which has deteriorated the area, and taken significant resource to address. This is in direct conflict with the council’s aims to regenerate the area through the Future High Street Scheme.\n“It also will likely disturb residents living in the vicinity, and runs counter to the council’s aim to encourage more people to live in the city centre. Anti-social behaviour makes the city centre a worse place to live as well as visit, as well as incurring additional costs and resources to address.\n“People likely to be the most negatively affected by this potential premises include people at risk, including children, young adults and people with addictions and gambling related harms. Harmful gambling is related to health inequalities. The most socio-economically deprived and disadvantaged groups in England have the lowest gambling participation rates but the highest levels of harmful gambling, and they are also the most susceptible to harm.\n“The proposed location is close to areas of high deprivation, as noted in the public health objection to the nearby gambling shop applications.\n“As well as detriment to the area through attracting anti-social behaviour, we believe an extended gambling shop in this location would also pose a material risk to the health and wellbeing of vulnerable people, from students to people who may suffer from drug addiction, who may be rough sleeping and/or homeless, who may use the service.”\nThe Licensing Committee’s decision to expand the betting shop comes as the council is consulting on a Public Space Protection Order or PSPO. The council is consulting on this because of the level of begging, “loitering” and street drinking in the city centre already.\nReferences\n1) (Public Pack)Agenda Document for Licensing Sub-Committee, 27/02/2024 10:00 (sheffield.gov.uk)",

Parts of the west coast of the United States are currently experiencing a seemingly apocalyptic front of climate change; devastating fires fanned by high winds are tearing through the countryside.\nThis has produced images which, once seen, can’t be forgotten. Skies darkened and turned blood orange by dense smoke, fire blocking out the sun. This brings the real world consequences of the climate emergency home just as we saw last year with the devastating floods that tore through South Yorkshire destroying our homes and businesses.\nAt the same time, the newly published WWF Living Planet report, details the horrifying impact of our economy on the natural world. Since 1970, global wildlife populations have plummeted by 68%. We are currently witnessing the sixth global mass extinction event.\nThese issues are not unrelated but it is easy to feel powerless in the face of such crises. Luckily, there is something we can all do, here and now, to tackle these issues together.\nThe Climate and Ecological Emergency Bill, presented to Parliament by Green MP Caroline Lucas, seeks to bring together action on the Climate and Nature emergencies. The #CEEbill recognises the damage of our economy’s globalised supply chains on both nature and climate. It calls for the protection and conservation of nature as part of our climate mitigation plans and even calls for “natural climate solutions”.\nIt also fills in the gaps where the 2008 Climate Change Act falls short. It incorporates all UK emissions including those consumption based emissions that the UK is responsible for and, yet, the Government fails to take into account when discussing the UK’s “success” in reducing emissions. Moreover, it ensures a democratic voice is at the heart of UK climate policy and calls for genuine solutions rather than merely relying on speculative and often problematic technological solutions.\nThis is a potentially transformative bill. We have to fight for it to be passed. This will not be easy but as we have seen on countless occasions before, when we organise and campaign, we win.\nSheffield Young Greens are calling on all Sheffield MPs to back the bill. It is fantastic news that in recent days, Olivia Blake has thrown her support behind the Bill. Just one of our Sheffield MPs, however, is not enough.\nWe are looking to you, Paul Blomfield, Louise Haigh, Gill Furniss, Miriam Joy Cates and Clive Betts to do all you can to pass this bill and tackle the climate and ecological emergencies with the radical urgency needed.\nFind out how to contact your MP here and ask them to back the #CEEbill.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The roads remain open to people who walk, cycle or use a wheelchair or pram.\nThe Active Travel Neighbourhoods in Nether Edge and Walkley/Crookes were established using an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order in 2022, stopping through-traffic on a number of roads, preventing rat-running and making them safer for people on foot and on bike.\nGreen Party Councillor Ruth Mersereau, who is a member of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Policy Committee, said:\n“I have had an overwhelming number of residents contact me asking me to support making both of these Active Travel Neighbourhood schemes permanent. They’ve told me that the improvements have been a huge success and that people want to keep them. Children feel safer to play in the streets, and neighbourhoods are more pleasant and liveable. I was particularly impressed when primary school children from Nether Edge contacted me to express their appreciation of being able to walk safely to school and to Scouts. Any reopening of these roads would be met with utter dismay.\n“If we are serious about reducing road collisions, addressing climate change and health problems caused by lack of physical activity, then it is schemes like this that really make a difference. We have to put communities before cars and back safer streets for local people.\n“I have studied the objections to the changes and the evidence shows that there has not been a measurable rise in traffic on adjacent streets. There are people who want to drive their cars where they like, with no restrictions, but we have a responsibility to the wider community and to residents who want to live in a safer, calmer, quieter and more pleasant environment. The Council took a small but important step by installing these filters and they have been a success. It would be irresponsible to go backwards.”\nNOTES\nThe issues will be discussed and voted on at the meeting of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Policy Committee on Wednesday 20th September 2023.",

I’ve been an active campaigner in Sheffield for many years. I believe in accountable democracy which encourages participation, healthy spaces to live and work, tackling inequalities and discrimination, and taking action on climate change immediately.\nFor too long Sheffield Council has dragged its feet on issues such as the environment and climate change, transparency and accountability, producing a progressive local plan, decent housing, active travel and waste management. They’ve also wasted taxpayers’ hard-earned cash on very poor value private contracts that don’t deliver quality services.\nMake your vote count – vote Green!\nAt this election, we have a real chance to change path, and work together to create the Sheffield we all need. Green politics is about empowering people and participation; to show that politics can be something you do, not something done to you. If elected, I would work with the residents of Gleadless Valley to organise and demand positive change for the ward.\nI live in Newfield Green and spend most of my time in the Valley, Heeley and Meersbrook. I use its local parks, shops, services and woodlands. I share the desire of all local residents who wish to ensure it is a safe, clean, green, inclusive area which benefits from good transport links, schools and infrastructure.\nI frequently report issues such as fly-tipping and unsafe road surfaces; I support longer opening hours at the recycling centre on Blackstock Road, action on air quality, plans for a 20mph speed limit around Myrtle Road, and the campaign to reopen Heeley Station.\nUnacceptable levels of deprivation exist in Gleadless Valley and during the pandemic I have made referrals to Gleadless Valley Foodbank and delivered food parcels and clothes to people in need.\nI believe work should provide security and stability and I’m an active trade union member. I’m also involved with the campaign to replace Universal Credit with a fairer system that does not force people into poverty and destitution.\nI’m a member of the community union Acorn, which supports tenants’ rights in Sheffield, including in the ward. I support city-wide landlord licensing and would also work to ensure that the Gleadless Valley Masterplan puts the views of residents first, protects green spaces and the valuable communities in Gleadless Valley.\nRegardless of where we come from, what colour we are or how we were brought up, everyone wants the best for our community. If you would like to support my campaign and help elect a new Green Councillor, or raise any issues, please get in touch.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

When this excess tarmac was removed in the vast majority of cases it was then possible to resurface or modify the pavement without chopping the tree down. Other trees were targeted because they had slightly moved the kerb.\nWhere trees were found to be damaging or discriminatory (making life difficult for wheelchair users/parents with pushchairs/mobility scooters etc) the issues should have been addressed using one of the recommended 14 Engineering and Tree-Based Solutions. These practical alternatives to tree removal are used as standard by Local Authorities in the UK and had already been paid for under the terms of the PFI contract. In Sheffield they were ignored whilst Sheffield Labour Councillors routinely lied about them and healthy trees were needlessly destroyed.\nMany of the beautiful healthy street trees throughout the city were chopped down because they were wrongly accused of being damaging or discriminatory by the Council. In Shiregreen this happened before the campaigners became aware of it. Peter Price remains completely unapologetic.\nHe praises Cllrs Fox and Lodge, continuing to ignore the ecocide they presided over and the £400,000 of Council Tax payer’s money wasted on legal proceedings against tree campaigners who have now been completely vindicated. Councillors Price, Fox and Lodge should resign their posts on the Council now.\nGraham Wroe\nManor Castle Green Party\nThe original letter from Cllr Price\nFind out about your election candidates here.",

I have been actively engaged in campaigning to elect Green councillors in the neighbouring Hillsborough ward in 2022, 2023 and 2024.\nAs a teacher and contractor in Countryside Management, I understand the value that nature brings to people. We should all be proud of the incredible green and blue spaces in our constituency such as the River Don, parts of the Peak District, and a wealth of reservoirs. A key aim is to improve community access to these, especially for those who don’t drive, who can be the most isolated in any community. I would fully utilise schemes such as the Green Infrastructure Framework to reinvigorate and reconnect fragmented habitats.\nToo often, agriculture is viewed as opposed to nature and farmers need winning round to the Green Party. I see the value that local farmers bring to the area and would work with them to cultivate nature without cutting income. I want to see closer ties between the agricultural community and environmental groups and have the understanding and experience to make this happen.\nWe must campaign to halt the downward spiral of service cuts and price hikes which simply lead to fewer customers and further cuts. Bus services are vital in rural communities, and these essential public services must be taken back under public control. We need to increase the frequency of bus services within the constituency, to Sheffield, Barnsley, and the Peak District.\nI support the campaign to re-open the Don Valley Railway to deliver Stocksbridge residents to Sheffield quickly and regularly, alongside the Upper Don Trail for an ‘active travel’ route. These projects would remove cars from our roads, improving safety and air quality; bringing innumerable benefits to the health, well-being, economy and happiness of our population.\nI believe local decisions should be taken by local people; I would push for more powers to local councils and regions, and would work closely with the Sheffield City Region mayor to further increase the devolution of powers. I hope never again to see the sheer arrogance that led to Sheffield’s tree-felling scandal.\nThankfully we now have a greater chance of eradicating this thinking after the successful citywide referendum delivering a new governance system in Sheffield City Council with 14 Green councillors working hard towards these aims. Similarly, I support efforts to investigate decision-making and spending within the £24 million Stocksbridge Town Deal to improve transparency and accountability.\nAs the Green candidate for Penistone and Stocksbridge, I pledge to focus on bringing nature into the heart of our community, improving ties within the community, and delivering better public transport and increased devolution of powers.\nTo help Andy’s campaign please donate to the Crowdfunder, join the Green Party and Get Involved.\nTo contact Andy’s team email penistone.stocksbridge@votegreen.uk",

The north produced 48% of UK renewable electricity between 2005 and 2014, making the region well placed to lead a green energy transition.\nGreen MP Caroline Lucas (arrested in Sussex in 2013) and Green Party leaders, including Natalie Bennett, have consistently made supportive visits to campaigns at key fracking sites during the last 7 years. Jeremy Corbyn’s recent visit to support anti-fracking campaigners was a welcome boost for the Marsh Lane campaign – noting that North East Derbyshire is a marginal constituency Labour lost to the Tories in 2017.\nCorbyn leads a divided Parliamentary party on this and many other issues. The Labour MP for North East Derbyshire until 2017, Natascha Engel, has just become the government’s commissioner for fracking. The Labour MP for Penistone & Stocksbridge, Angela Smith, is pro-fracking.\nThe powerful GMB union, a big Labour donor, is supporting fracking when they should be leading the transition from fossil fuel jobs to a new green economy. Insulating every building in the country properly would massively reduce energy demand and create a huge number of new skilled jobs.\nThe Tories remain in bed with the fossil fuel industry when a rapid transition to renewable energy is needed to address climate change. Labour need to join Greens in being united and high profile in active support of local communities threatened by fracking and new low carbon jobs.\nRuth Mersereau\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

It calls for electrification of railways, investment in the North to match the South, late night trains and planning ahead for reopening stations like Heeley, Millhouses and Totley Brook.\nDouglas Johnson, Green Councillor for City Ward, which includes Sheffield Midland station, said,\n“In our response, we are clear that modern railways should be inclusive for all, affordable for all, accessible to all, and minimise harm to the environment, for the health and wellbeing of all.”\n“We hope our views are taken into account and make the railway a public service right at the heart of society and of Sheffield.\nThis is not just about faster, more comfortable journeys to London. We want to see investment in rail in the North and station facilities that contribute to the city centre. That’s why we want to see free wireless, public toilets, bus and cycle provision and a serious commitment to tackle air pollution around the station.”\nNotes\n- The DfT ran the consultation to seek views on the re-franchising of the East Midlands rail contract. This includes the Sheffield to London main line, local lines and the management of Sheffield station. At present, the franchise is held by East Midlands Trains. The new contract will run from 2019.\n- The consultation documents are available at https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/future-of-east-midlands-rail-franchise/\n- Sheffield Green Party’s response is available at http://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2017/10/12/rail-consultation/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The families say their relatives were moved without consultation and without choice. The care home provider said it was so they could take more residents discharged from hospital with coronavirus. Sadly, eighteen people have now died in these homes.\nBy contrast, other care homes, such as Bridgedale House in Fulwood, have prided themselves on remaining completely infection-free.\nThis shows the level of inequality between different care homes.\nSocial care has always been the neglected step-child of the NHS.

The group was set up by the full council meeting on 17th May 2017 and will continue to meet throughout the year.\nThe Green Party suggestions for improvements are:\nReview of council meetings – Comments from Green Party councillors, 14 July 2017\n1. We are pleased the discussions to date in the Members Working Group have been constructive.\n2. Our view remains that a committee system is more inclusive and democratic and our position is that this should be re-introduced in place of the “strong leader” model.\n3. We feel there should be at least some degree of public consultation, since the aim is to make meetings more accessible to the public.\nBroadcasting\n4. We are strongly in favour of openness and transparency and therefore support full broadcasting using the public-I TV system at the earliest opportunity. We believe this to be only a modest cost but urge officers to obtain further details as soon as possible, given that the existing microphone system needs replacing.\n5. All other local authorities in South Yorkshire put their council meetings online and this is now becoming the norm.\n6. As an interim measure, we think the audio recording that is currently available should be streamed to the council website at the best quality the existing system can manage.\nLayout of the room\n7. We would like to see how the proposed layout works in practice. It would be a concern if the layout contributed to a more aggressive, confrontational approach between two physically separated halves of the Chamber. It may be that the seating can be angled slightly towards the Lord Mayor.\nTime of the meeting\n8. We have no firm views on the best time but do not object to a proposal to move to 5pm, subject to the issues below. The guillotine should be retained (provided there is no limit on the number of motions).\nLength of the meeting\n9. We agree with the aim of making the meeting shorter and accept an aim of about 3 hours in length. Again, this is subject to the proposals for changing the content of the meeting.\nPetitions and public questions\n10. We would like to maintain the current time of up to 1 hour for petitions and public questions.\nOrdinary petitions\n11. We think there should be no formal change to the current scheme for petitions. We strongly feel it should be the right of the public to bring any petition or any question to any public meeting of the council.\n12. Where petitions are presented, we would like Cabinet Members to shorten their responses just so that they just respond to the request in the petition briefly without making a speech. This is to save time in the meeting and to get to the point, for the benefit of members of the council and of the public.\n13. Whilst the public should not be restricted from bringing petitions to the full council, it may be that some members of the public do not realise the full council is not a decision-making body. We therefore suggest that better information is given to petitioners as to possible committees and the advantages of each option so the petitioners can make an informed choice.\nPublic questions\n14. There has been slippage into members of the public regularly making speeches from the gallery. Whilst some context may be required, we would like to see a clear expectation that questions are limited to questions only. July’s council meeting was better than usual in that the Lord Mayor actively called the public’s attention to the need to ask questions. This could be supported by written guidance to questioners.\n15. As with petitions, we would like to see Cabinet Members respond as concisely as possible, by answering the question rather than by making a speech.\n16. Both these steps will save time in the meeting and help retain the public’s interest in proceedings.\n17. Where a Cabinet Member decides to respond in writing, a copy of the response should be placed on the website as a matter of routine.\n18. We do not see any need to change the petitions scheme in respect of the 5,000 or 2,500 – signature thresholds.\nMembers’ questions\n19. We think these should be held immediately after public questions with at least some time (say 20 minutes) for supplementary questions, as these are often topical and of interest to the public.\nMotions and amendments\nNumber of motions\n20. We do not agree with the proposal to limit the number of motions that Members can put and would prefer the issue of the proliferation of motions to be dealt with less formally – see below.\n21. We agree with others that motions and amendments are the main system by which parties set out their political visions in the Council.\n22. The practical effect of the proposal to permit only 3 or 4 motions on a ‘politically balanced’ basis is that the smaller parties would be muted in being unable to put forward any motions at all except once every two years.\n23. We accept that not every item can be debated in full but we believe in principle that motions by all Members should be allowed. The real issue is which motions are selected for debate (currently, on the basis of a formula) and the quality of the debate. At present, there are no Independent Members but any change to the constitution would need to cater for this possibility. We think the other proposed changes would help to make meetings more effective. However, we think it is necessary to keep the guillotine.\nTime limits on motions\n24. We agree with the proposal to reduce the time spent on each motion, for motions and amendments to be brought together where appropriate and for speeches to be limited. We agree with the proposal of 3 minutes for the proposer of each motion and amendment and 2 minutes for the seconder.\n25. To avoid the concerns of repetition, we suggest the parties take steps to discourage members speaking unless, in exceptional cases, they really have something to add to the proposer and seconder’s speeches.\n26. We agree with the suggestion to have all the votes on a debate held together rather than after each amendment, as at present.\nVoting in parts\n27. We believe that voting in parts is essential, although other proposals may reduce the need for this.\nNumber, length, and order of speeches\n28. Where motions are put as an amendment to another party’s motion and vice versa, we suggest these should be voted on together.\nMotions – content\n29. We would like a “no bitching” rule: content that just criticises other national parties or their leaders has no place in a council debate. This should also have the effect of reducing the need to vote in parts.\n30. Motions should not be brought unless their content is both relevant to Sheffield and relevant to the powers of the Council.\nMotions with cross-party support\n31. Where motions have cross-party support– e.g. symbolic or congratulatory ones, we agree with the suggestion to have a declaration by the Lord Mayor. It is unhelpful to have a party debate, which makes it look to the public as if there is a dispute between the parties, when there is not.\nDeadline to submit motions\n32.We think there is benefit to more discussion between the parties before the agenda is published. We therefore suggest we bring the deadline for submitting motions a couple of days earlier so that the parties can see where there is agreement before the agenda is published.\n33. If at all possible, the amendments should be submitted before the agenda is published. Members of the public cannot get a true picture of the issues in debate unless both sides of the argument are shown.\nAgenda\n34. Motions and amendments should both have descriptive titles. Both the proposer and seconder should be named on the agenda and the party of each member should also be specified, as this helps the public understand the proceedings without having to be familiar with each member.\nMotions in the guillotine\n35. We believe time could be saved by dispensing with the formality of the Lord Mayor reading out the names of the proposer and seconder of each amendment, thus getting to the vote more quickly. This will be easier if the suggestions above are implemented\nWe therefore suggest the following order of events:\n- Parties draw up motions, as currently. Motions must not contain party-political sniping directed at national parties or leaders.\n- Parties should ensure motions are reasonably short (3 or 4 paragraphs)\n- Draft motions submitted – 2 days before the present deadline\n- Parties review each other’s motions and agree which attract cross-party consensus (possibly with agreed modifications). They should also agree any motions which should be consolidated or dealt with together – i.e. if covering the same topic.\n- Parties submit amendments\nAgenda published\nPrior to council meeting:\n- Petitions received – petitioners given advice and options on which meeting they want to present their petition to.\n- People in public gallery given information on only being able to make a speech if presenting a petition. Otherwise, limited to asking questions.\nCouncil meeting:\n- Lord Mayor reminds all to be concise etc.\n- Public petitions and questions – up to an hour\n- Questions to be actual questions\n- Cabinet members to respond briefly to the question and without making a speech.\n- Members’ questions – including supplementary questions on topics not on the agenda for debate.\n- Motions where consensus is reached – announcement by Lord Mayor (possibly with formal proposer and seconder)\n- Motions for debate\n- Order of speakers for each debate:\n- Proposer and seconder of motion (3 mins and 2 mins)\n- Proposer and seconder of first amendment (3 mins and 2 mins)\n- Proposer and seconder of second amendment (3 mins and 2 mins)\n- Etc\n- Other speakers – 1 minute each (parties expected to avoid repetition)\n- Vote on all amendments and then substantive motion\n- Guillotine on any remaining motions if needed – Lord Mayor to dispense with formally calling on proposers and seconders for each motion and amendment and move straight to vote.\n- Other business like minutes etc\nDownload Review of council meetings – Green Party comments (pdf)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The questions were put to the leader of Sheffield City Council, who is also a member of the Sheffield City Region Combined Authority.\nCllr Paul Turpin says, “After decades of under-funding the North, by consecutive UK governments, it was the EU who stepped in to stimulate business and redevelop our ageing infrastructure.\n“We demand a guaranteed action plan to continue funding the development of South Yorkshire for the next twenty years.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson says, “South Yorkshire qualified for huge amounts of EU money for infrastructure spending on issues like roads, rail, business and culture. It qualified because wages were so low in South Yorkshire, they had fallen to less than three-quarters of the average wage across the whole of Europe.”\n“Such was the investment in South Yorkshire, as one of the most deprived areas in the EU, that almost £4 billion has been brought into the region since the year 2000, around half of which was directly funded by the EU and the rest due to match funding. That investment would not have been there without the original grants from the EU.\n“Without that level of continued support, our region will be back where it was at the turn of this century, with crumbling civic buildings and a struggling local economy.\n“For example, the excellent Grey to Green project of flood prevention and environmental improvements has been funded through the EU. Phase 2 is underway at Castlegate but future phases have yet to secure funding.”\nNotes\n- Recipients of EU funding include:\n- Development of Howard Street\n- Weston Park museum\n- Queens Business Centre, Barnsley\n- City Hall, Sheffield\n- Moorgate Crofts, Rotherham\n- Sheffield 35A Business Park, Sheffield\n- Frenchgate Interchange, Doncaster\n- Interchange, Barnsley\n- Midland Train Station, Sheffield\n- European Structural Funds in South Yorkshire 2000-2008 (pdf)\n- Questions of Councillor Douglas Johnson to the Leader of the Council (Councillor Julie Dore)\nWhat assessment has been made of the amount of EU funding to Sheffield that is expected to be lost on leaving the EU?\nA.4 The Government has confirmed that it will guarantee all projects that would have been funded by the EU under the 2014-2020 programme period. Government has indicated that should EU funded programmes no longer be available after Brexit, they will be replaced through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF). No details of this are currently available.\n- Questions of Councillor Peter Garbutt to Councillor Bob Johnson (Cabinet Member for Transport and Development)\nHas all the funding for current unfinished EU funded projects in Sheffield been received? if it hasn’t, where will the money to finish them come from?\nA.2 The current EU funding programme runs until the end of 2020. However approved projects will have the ability to operate and incur expenditure until the end of 2023. Government has previously committed to underwrite all EU funded projects that have been approved and this commitment remains in place. Indeed a further call for projects seeking EU funding is expected to be published shortly. As a result any projects supported with EU grants that are not yet finished are not currently at risk of losing funding as a result of Brexit.\n- From Council officers:\nThe funding over the past 20 years to South Yorkshire is as follows:\n2000 – 06: €1,221m\n2006 – 13: €451m\n20014 – 20: €178m (increased to €183m)Exchange rates have varied significantly over this period so it’s hard to value this in GB£ but the evaluation of the Objective 1 programme (00-06) had the value at between £692m and £820m with a total investment in the region (EU, other public and private) equivalent to £2.4bn.\nThe 07 – 13 Programme required a minimum public sector match equivalent to the EU funding but with additional private sector match the total value of the Programme would be c£1bn.\nThe current Programme is being valued at c£165m with an overall minimum investment value of £275m but this only partially captures some of the match funding so I would expect the overall value of the Programme to be significantly over £300m when completed.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The decision to sign Sheffield up to the system has been taken with little oversight or consultation.\nDouglas Johnson, Green Councillor for City ward and member of the Council’s Health and Adult Social Care Scrutiny Committee, is leading a cross-party group concerned about the amount of Councillor oversight of the new arrangements. The Scrutiny Committee is the only cross-party scrutiny mechanism available to oversee these issues at public meetings.\nCllr Johnson commented,\n“Scrutiny of the Accountable Care Partnership is very important because it is the basis for cuts in local NHS services – these can be controversial and have a big impact on the public, as we have seen with current plans to cut the Minor Injuries and Walk-in facilities in the city. This is not a decision which should be made without a great deal of examination and careful consideration.\n“Further, under the current proposals, there is no scrutiny mechanism for this decision and future decisions about health services under the ACP outside of the Council executive.\n“That’s why I am leading a cross-party group, including Councillors from the Green, Liberal Democrat, and Labour parties, calling for effective on-going scrutiny arrangements to be in place for the ACP.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

That will now be cut to 21 buses during the same period.\nPeople who use the H1 service know that the buses are often packed. Reducing services will increase passenger numbers on each bus.\nWe need more buses to help alleviate the current chaos in the areas around both hospitals not fewer.

In reply to Roy Sanderson, population is not the most important factor. More important is those people’s consumption, as this adds to our emissions. Carbon Brief, the UK-based climate science website, has done some great research and found out that UK energy use is incredibly unequal. Those with extreme wealth are by far the biggest polluters.\nThe top 10% of earners use more energy on flights than the bottom 20% use in a year. Their holidays and business trips burn through all the energy the poorest fifth use for power, heating, fueling cars etc.\nCompared to energy use by the bottom 10% of earners, the top 10% use 10 times more for domestic flights, 5 times more for international flights, 3 times more driving cars and 5 times more for recreation.\nThe study shows white, wealthy middle-aged men are most likely to be “excess” energy users while non-white and female users are most vulnerable to energy poverty.\nComparing nations, the whole of Africa has 16.7% of the world’s population but has emitted only 3% of global carbon dioxide (data from Global Carbon Project). The USA has 4.5% of the global population but, since 1959, has emitted 21.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide.\nJohn Bunting asks if I am a member of the “Flat Earth Society”. No, because I take peer-reviewed science seriously. It is those that still don’t accept the scientific facts of climate change that should be asked this question. Of course, there should be debate about the climate emergency, but not about whether or not it exists! We have to debate what changes we can make and how quickly we can change to limit the worst effects of our overheating planet. How do we move our society from one that values private transport most, to one that values public transport most? How do we change our consumerist passion for more and more stuff to an even stronger passion to care for the earth and everything in it?\nGraham Wroe\nSheffield Green Party",

The derelict site has become overgrown, becoming a much-needed haven for local wildlife. The new development has good features, such as green roofs and new hedgerows, but more could be done to preserve and extend the space for nature. There is also a high flood risk on the site – permeable parking and rain gardens have been recommended to reduce that risk but they aren’t yet part of the designs. Most concerning is the lack of commitment to affordable housing – a critical issue for Millhouses and wider Sheffield. This is a large development of 67 apartments and needs to justify its impact. The developer should make a commitment to follow the affordable housing guidance and help a broader section of our community find good homes. There’s a planning application in Ecclesall and Ecclesall Greens have submitted an objection. Please sign and share this petition.

As your local councillor, I will be able to stand up for residents and businesses, and press for change.

It most affects those who struggle to walk, where the streets are steep and where people use this bus to get to work.\n“The reduction in this service comes on the back of the loss of the local 32 bus in September 2019 which has left many people stranded. The impact on residents in the ward has been devastating. The bus service connection with Walkley’s high street was severed. The social, health and local economic consequences remain and are substantial. The loss of the 135 will make a very difficult situation even worse.”\nCouncillors have now had confirmation from the South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority (SYMCA) that a recent tender process failed to secure bus operators to deliver these key services for the community.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, until recently Sheffield Council’s Executive Member for Climate Change, Environment and Transport, said,\n“I have today written to the Mayor to offer the Green councillors’ support in asking central government for the essential money to keep South Yorkshire’s buses running.\n“At the same time, I have repeated my disappointment about the lack of ambition in the previous mayor’s Bus Service Improvement Plan, the consequent lack of government funding and the fact that local political choices have undermined bus services.”\nGreen Cllr Christine Gilligan Kubo, who is on the new Climate Change, Regeneration and Transport Committee, said,\n“The SYMCA undertook a second round of tendering for routes where the bus operators were encouraged to bid. Many contracts received no bids at all!”\n“This does not bode well for when Government subsidy for bus operator ends in October. We want assurances that no further cuts to services will take place.\nGreens recently called on the government to spend as much per head on transport in Yorkshire (£276 a year) as they do in London (£903 a year) if they were serious about levelling up.\nCouncillor Bernard Little continued,\n“Essentially, franchising would mean that bus companies can name their price. This is why Sheffield Green Party thinks it was essential for SYMCA to have a good Bus Service Improvement Plan. In the event, SYMCA’s plan was so poor that it failed to get any government funding which might have stopped this.\n“As a Green Councillor, along with my colleagues, I will continue to campaign for other ways of funding decent public transport.”\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nThe details of these changes are provided in detail below:\n| Route | Change |\n| 208 | The last return trip from Sheffield and the Sunday daytime service will be cut |\n| 32/32a | Whole service cut |\n| 135/135a | An early morning, evening and all day Saturday/Sunday services will be cut |\n| X74 | Mon-Fri journeys from Sheffield at 0440, 0730-0830 and 1900-2100 will not operate. Journeys towards Sheffield 1815-2155 will not operate. Journeys on the X74 at other times and journeys on the A1 and X54 will continue to operate. |\nThe text of Cllr Johnson’s comment to the Mayor is:\nDear Oliver,\nI am very happy to offer the support of the Sheffield Green councillors in asking Government for the money needed to run a basic bus service. I note the withdrawal of unprofitable services will impact on areas of persistent poverty, such as Burngreave, Parson Cross and Upperthorpe. The impact will be felt mostly by people in low-paid jobs working unsociable hours.\nIt is clearly wrong and in appropriate for the government to end funding for essential public transport when the market has clearly not recovered from the effect of the pandemic. Under the model of private commercial markets we have inherited from the 1980s government, it is clear that commercial operators would not be expected to fund public services and therefore this money needs to come from the state. Put shortly, we need a public service paid for by public funds. I also think this should be in public ownership as it is key to meeting commitments to Net Zero and addressing climate change.\nIn a recent debate at Sheffield City Council, our group compared the funding government provides to London (£903 per head per year) to that offered to Yorkshire (at £276 per head per year). We believe that equalisation of transport spending is a key test of whether the Government has succeeded in levelling up.\nHowever, the authorities in South Yorkshire could have done more. It was intensely disappointing that the Bus Service Improvement Plan failed to win any government funding at all because of the lack of ambition it contained. Sheffield was the only core city to lose out and I am frankly disappointed that the warnings I gave whilst a member of the Transport & the Environment Board were not heeded.\nIn Sheffield, a lot of work has been done to improve the bus operating environment. There are with major schemes to give buses and trams priority on the roads. We made public transport more attractive relative to private car use by increasing city centre car parking charges. There have – eventually – been improvements to city centre bus stop facilities.\nFrom speaking regularly to the bus operators in my previous role as Executive Member for transport, I am aware they too are ready to modernise their services, for instance by introducing tap-on-tap-off ticketing, capped fares and multi-operator tickets as standard. However, this level of commercial investment, which we have seen in other towns and cities, is only going to be forthcoming if the local authorities across the whole of South Yorkshire step up with a commitment in favour of public transport. As long as political choices remain in favour of subsidising access for private cars instead of public transport, our bus services will face an uphill battle. It is within the powers of local authorities to introduce bus gates, increase parking charges and introduce workplace parking levies to address the large subsidy given by larger employers to individual car ownership. Experience elsewhere shows this could also deliver the large sums of money needed to support the bus routes that are now being cut.\nPlease don’t hesitate to ask for any support in making the case to government.\nRegards,\nDouglas\nCllr Douglas Johnson, (Green Party)\nCity Ward, Sheffield\nChair of Housing Policy Committee",

It is now branded as “Sheffield Connect.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson commented,\n“Transport is all about connecting people up with where they want to go and I am so pleased to see the FreeBee bus return to the city centre.\n“As Executive Member for Climate Change and Transport last year, I worked to promote the FreeBee alongside the opportunities arising from opening up Pinstone St to safer walking and cycling routes. The streamlining of existing bus routes – to make them move more quickly through the city centre – was to be helped by a connecting city centre circular bus.\n“Good bus connections benefit everyone. The FreeBee bus originally ran from 2007 to 2014 when it was cut by a previous administration. Since 2018, Green councillors have been calling for its return, with costed proposals being included in our budget amendments since 2019.\n“I am delighted that the bus will be free of charge to anyone who has got the bus or tram into town. This is really important for access, encouragement and bus loading times.”\nGreen transport campaigner, Thomas Atkin, added,\n“The Sheffield Connect is great news for Sheffield City Centre. As a disabled person and as a carer, having the Sheffield Connect means no more having to get on certain buses because they drop me near the station. It makes it easier to get around town whichever direction you come from.\n“It will give people with disabilities greater access to the city centre than previously. Sheffield Connect is the gateway to our City Centre for people arriving fresh faced at the station, for students of all ages and for people who have lived here all their lives.”\nWhilst Cllr Douglas Johnson was the Executive Member for Transport, a council priority for electric buses was the city centre FreeBee. Cllr Johnson explained,\n“The bid for grant funding to the Department for Transport has been successful but it takes time to procure all the electric buses required.”\nENDS\nNOTES TO EDITORS\n1. The previous FreeBee was withdrawn as a cost-saving measure in 2014\n2. The Green councillors’ amendment to a motion at the council meeting in June 2018 called for a return of the FreeBee city-centre bus service and an integrated ticketing system across all public transport.\n3. Under the Green budget proposals, the vehicles used for the FreeBee service would be buses in public ownership.",

The Councillors responsible need to be held to account and answer for their actions. The lessons from the Lowcock report need to be implemented as part of the way the council does its business and relates to the people of this city.

This is fundamental to protect people from the harm of problem gambling.

We believe this is key to the Council’s Licensing function and fundamental to protect people from the harm of problem gambling.

We would like there to be the expectation that applications for licences will normally be supported by evidence of appropriate planning permission. This will also help avoid duplication.\n- We would like to see the Statement address the proliferation of betting shops by requiring very careful consideration of applications for new premises that are in the immediate vicinity of existing gambling premises. Fitzalan Square, for instance, has been blighted by the proliferation of betting shops, which has contributed to anti-social behaviour in the area.\n- The Statement should specifically address Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which are currently not mentioned. We believe they can cause serious harm to families through addictive problem gambling.\n- The reference to the Equality Act 2010 in Part 3 and Part 12 should be amended to reflect the fact the Council must comply with it, not just “have regard to” it.\n- The statement that “The Council recognises how important this sector of the entertainment industry is within the city” is no longer appropriate in light of public health concerns and should be removed.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

For the residents living inside them, active travel increases, congestion decreases, and air quality improves, all of which help contribute to a greater quality of life. Furthermore, two of the criticisms often levelled at LTNs, that they impact emergency service response times and increase traffic on surrounding roads, were not backed up by the evidence. The reason you may not have seen this report? The government commissioned it to try and prove the opposite was true. They then buried it under 10 other press releases and documents hoping no one would notice its existence.\nIn Sheffield, Labour too have failed to show any leadership or principles when they caved in to pressure from a minority of vocal opponents and removed the modal filter in Nether Edge at Archer Lane. This is despite it being popular with local residents, effective at managing traffic flow and allowing road users to try out alternative modes of transport. This decision was especially upsetting for parents and teachers of children at the four local primary and secondary schools who had felt the benefits of their children being able to walk and wheel safely to and from school every day whilst the filter was in place (as reported here in the Star, 17/10/23).\nIn contrast, the Sheffield Green Party are proud to stand up for people’s right to breathe good quality air, to be able to move around safely, and with an increased choice on how we travel. We recognise that it’s not LTNs that are slowing down emergency response times, but congested roads. We will continue to make the case that driving should be prioritised for those who need to do so the most so that everyone can benefit. Yes, mistakes have been made in the past and improvements can be made to how such schemes are consulted on and implemented. However, it is only the Greens who have the courage to take difficult decisions to try and make Sheffield a safer, cleaner, greener and more inclusive city for all.\nCllr Maroof Raouf, Nether Edge and Sharrow\nMaroof is currently standing for re-election.

This includes the Sheffield to London main line, local lines and the management of Sheffield station.\nEast Midlands Rail Franchise\nSheffield Green Party response to consultation\n11 October 2017\n1. Introduction\nFirst and foremost, we believe our railways should be publicly owned and controlled. They should be inclusive for all, affordable for all, accessible to all, and minimise harm to the environment, for the health and wellbeing of all.\nThis response focusses on the Sheffield perspective, including management of Sheffield Midland station, which is part of the franchise.\nWe also strongly believe that Sheffield and the North of England needs and deserves a similar level of investment in rail infrastructure as the South East and London has received.\n2. Ticket barriers\nWe wish to see the DfT’s requirement for ticket barriers to be removed from the franchise.\nSheffield Green Party consistently opposed installing ticket barriers at Sheffield station and was pleased to be part of the successful campaign to show they were a bad idea. The station footbridge is a major public access route between the city centre and the Norfolk Park area, paid for by public and EU money. Ticket barriers also have a disproportionate effect on disabled people.\nWe are pleased to hear the assurances given at the consultation meetings that no further ticket barriers are proposed.\n3. Electrification\nWe strong support the move to rail electrification across as much of the network as possible and wish to see a timetable for action.\nWe recognise that air pollution is a serious national issues resulting in an estimated 40,000 premature deaths each year and that the UK is already seriously in breach of minimum international legal standards of protection. Air pollution monitoring at Sheffield station has recorded NO2 concentrations at over seven times the maximum legal limit of 40µg/m3.\nWe consider that a priority for programme of electrification may be to include regional lines serving Sheffield, Doncaster and Leeds where an improvement in local services could have a greater impact than further enhancements to the Sheffield-London route.\n4. Air pollution\nWe would like to see a commitment to the franchisee reducing air pollution from trains (and other machinery or processes at the station) by a firm air quality action plan for all stations it manages. This should drive towards reducing idling of stationary engines as far as possible.\nThe franchisee should also have a clear system of management of all taxi ranks at its stations using its powers of license or sub-franchise. For instance, at Sheffield station where NO2 levels have been recorded at over seven times the legal maximum, there are problems with continual taxi engine emissions because of the way the taxi system operates. This could be tackled through use of station permit fees. We would like to see the franchisee required to impose effective air pollution reduction conditions. These could include no-idling conditions or giving discounts to low-emission vehicles.\nThere should be a comprehensive system of regular air pollution monitoring at all stations and this data should be publicised so that improvements and trends over time can be seen. Locations for air quality monitoring should include taxi ranks. This data should be made publicly available online.\n5. Waste and recycling\nA lot of passenger waste is generated both on trains and at stations. We would like to see big improvements in firstly, minimising packaging and, secondly, effective recycling of paper, glass and plastic bottles.\nReusable (china) crockery and cutlery should be used as far as possible in first class catering.\nSales from refreshment trolleys should aim to reduce packaging and the reuse of plastic bottles. This may include requiring price differentials for passengers who use their own cups.\nThere should be separate bins on stations and separated collection of waste materials (especially newspapers and magazines) on trains, which are currently all put into general waste.\nThe franchisee should have regular customer information (such as notices in carriages) that promotes the need to reduce waste and to separate recyclable material.\nIf possible, the franchisee should be required to report the volumes of recycled waste as a proportion of all waste removed from each station. This data should be made publicly available online.\n6. Integration with local travel\nSheffield station is currently not served by any buses. Although a limited number of buses are available at the bus station, which is relatively nearby, the franchise should encourage the development of bus stops and services at the station itself and should require co-operation with the Passenger Transport Executive.\nThere should be better sharing of real-time information on rail services in Sheffield bus station and at the tram stop serving the station. There should also be a commitment to provide accurate and real-time information on local bus and tram services at the train station.\nThe franchise arrangements should ensure that the franchisee is required to fully engage and cooperate with the forthcoming tram-train provision in Sheffield and Rotherham.\nThere should be a guarantee for the continued provision of cycle hubs and for support for independent enterprises such as the successful “Russell’s Bike Shed” at Sheffield station.\nThe franchisee should provide enough cycle parking to make it clear that cycling to the station is encouraged; that is, meeting not just current demand but anticipated higher demand in future. This means providing cycle stands at the front of the station so that it is only a step or two from parking a bike to buying a ticket. It also means providing cycle stands at the back of the station so that cycling from the Norfolk Park area to catch a train is more convenient.\nAll stands should be the classic “Sheffield stand” kind as recommended by the Department for Transport, the CTC and the National Cycling Strategy for short-stay cycle parking.\n7. New stations\nThe franchise should incorporate provision for the potential expansion of suburban travel in Sheffield and the reopening of existing stations at Heeley, Millhouses and Totley Brook.\n8. Late-night travel\nThe latest weekday train from Sheffield to London departs at 2049; the latest from London to Sheffield departs at 2225. Saturday and Sunday times are earlier.\nAt least one late-night train each way would improve the service for off-peak travellers and better reflect the increasingly irregular and 24-hour lifestyles of many people.\n9. Wireless and accessible information\nFree public wireless should be reinstated at all stations.\nFree wireless used to be available at Sheffield station but this is now paid-for subscription only. Reinstating free wireless would help ensure fair access to information as those people most affected are likely to be poorer or less frequent travellers or those who do not want to have to sign up to over-the-phone payments. Free wireless would assist passengers with finding and checking travel information, updates to running times or about their intended destinations, thus contributing to the efficient running of the railway. Free wireless would also make the station environment more convenient, welcoming and modern.\nFree wireless should also be provided on trains. It should be seen as an integral part of a modern service rather than something to charge extra for. It would greatly help passengers plan ahead their actions at their next station.\nWhen planning information services, franchisees should be required to disregard the view that members of the travelling public may have good access to 4G networks. Such assumptions may well be true of those who can afford to pay first-class or peak-travel fares but will exclude people with access requirements or with only a basic phone. Many people do not have good access to information and they are the ones for whom public information facilities are most important. Such a requirement would help the DfT meet its legal duties under the public sector equality duty.\n10. Toilets\nThe franchisee should provide toilets at each station that are expected to be open and accessible to the general public, ideally 24 hours a day. Toilets should be fully accessible and ideally should meet “changing places” standards. This is a critical service for disabled passengers but also important for all members of the public at a time when fewer public toilets are otherwise provided.\n11. Equality considerations\nSheffield Green Party notes with concern that there are no explicit proposals to build equality and environmental considerations into the heart of the franchise. We believe that these issues must be built into the structure of the franchise and not regarded as an additional nicety.\nIn particular, we are concerned at the possible lack of understanding of equality issues in that we note the consultation asks whether the franchisee should take equality into account. It is also a legal duty to comply, as a minimum with the duties in the Equality Act 2010, whether as a provider of services or under the public sector equality duty.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We believe that income inequality is bad for society and that the Council can start by addressing pay gaps within its own organisation. Our proposal was to trim the pay of senior officers on salaries over £50,000 a year, narrowing the gap between the highest and lowest paid in the Council to a 10:1 ratio.\nThis is not a reflection on the officers but a serious attempt to tackle inequality and to free up resources for frontline services. Our budget proposal would have resulted in a net increase of 26 directly-employed jobs, plus almost a £1 million a year extra for social care.\nThe Labour manifesto claims to be “for the many”, yet they voted against our amendment and chose to maintain the huge salaries exposed in the Star on April 9th.

Councillor Angela Argenzio kept her position as Chair of the Adult Health and Social Care Committee. The group of 14 retains seats on all the council’s committees, giving a Green voice in the room for every council decision.\nIn the 2024 local elections, Greens overtook the Liberal Democrats for the first time in their share of the popular vote across the whole city. The Greens are now the main challengers to Labour in Sheffield. New Councillor Peter Gilbert took the Greens first seat from the Liberal Democrats in Ecclesall Ward. In Nether Edge and Sharrow ward, the Greens’ Cllr Maroof Raouf saw off a heavy challenge from Labour.\nIn addition to success in the Local Elections, Douglas Johnson came second in Sheffield in the race to become Mayor of South Yorkshire.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“I thank the voters right across Sheffield and South Yorkshire for their support for the Greens. We hope to repay that trust over the forthcoming year.\n“Local people know we are a positive force on the Council and that we work hard to improve our local and global environment.\n“I am really pleased that the Green Party’s share of the vote across the whole of Sheffield has now overtaken the Lib Dems – even though we still only get half their number of council seats.\n“What we really need is a fair voting system that properly takes into account people’s votes and elects Councillors and MPs according to the proportion of the votes they receive. We have an electoral system, where Councillors, MPs and Governments can get elected with much less than 50% of the vote and get 100% of the power. This does not reflect the wishes or views of the electorate. The election of Governments with minority support is a significant cause of many of the problems our country faces today, from the failure of Brexit to under funded public services”\nCouncillor Angela Argenzio said,\n“We will continue to work collaboratively with all parties across the political divides. Our approach, as Greens, is not to be tribal politicians. We work together to reach the best outcomes that we can for the people we represent.\n“As a Council that is in no overall control, we have helped promote a better political culture. One that is less confrontational, more open to new ideas, and forward thinking.\n“No Council is perfect and there will always be political differences. However we will always seek to be respectful and straightforward in how we express those differences.”\nReferences\n- Sheffield City Council’s 84 councillors are now: Labour 36, LibDem 27, Green 14, Sheffield Community Councillor Group 6, Independent 1\n- Vote share was: Labour 39.8%, Green 22.0%, LibDem 21.7%\n- Greens received 28,561 votes across Sheffield.\n- The Green councillors elected were: Douglas Johnson (City Ward), Brian Holmshaw (Broomhill & Sharrow Vale), Maroof Raouf (Nether Edge & Sharrow), Alexi Dimond (Gleadless Valley), Christine Gilligan Kubo (Hillsborough) and Peter Gilbert (Ecclesall).

In later times, it became offices and survived the Sheffield floods of 2007. It now overlooks the flood defence pocket park but has recently stood empty.\nIn 2018, a property developer proposed to demolish the building shortly after the council abandoned plans to set up the Castlegate Conservation Area. Green councillors were instrumental in persuading a property developer to drop the demolition plans and discuss suitable conversion designs with planning officers. However, the developer pressed ahead with plans for total demolition and rebuilding. The eventual plans submitted to the Planning Committee were described by Cllr Douglas Johnson as “uninspiring” and looking “like a multi-storey car park” and the Planning Committee rejected them in 2019.\nA Government Planning Inspector has now over-ruled the committee and given his own judgment that the proposal for a block of flats “contributes favourably towards the character and appearance of the area.”\nReacting to the decision, heritage campaigner and Green Party candidate, Brian Holmshaw said,\n“I am frustrated by the council’s lack of progress on the Castlegate conservation area. The long-awaited plans for the Castlegate conservation area were cancelled out of the blue – and for no real reason anyone could understand – by the Council Cabinet member responsible. The historic Old Coroner’s Court building could have been protected and preserved by bringing in this long-planned-for conservation area by the council. I’m now concerned for other heritage aspects of buildings in the proposed conservation area.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson, councillor for City Ward, said,\n“This is a disappointing outcome. The sensitive re-use of historic buildings retains the irreplaceable, builds on local heritage, and significantly reduces carbon emissions.\n“Standard demolition and construction uses huge amounts of energy and releases far too much CO2 through use of concrete and steel. There must be more incentives to refurbish and refit buildings, not to destroy them and build from scratch.”\nCllr Peter Garbutt, who was a member of the Planning Committee voting against the proposal, added,\n“Planning decisions are entrusted to elected councillors to reflect the views of residents of the city. It makes a mockery of the process to have the elected committee over-ruled by an official just because they have a different view of development in Sheffield.”\nRead more: Sheffield Star: Developers win appeal to replace Old Coroner’s Court in Sheffield with apartments\nNotes\n- Previous comment by Sheffield Greens:\n- https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2018/08/21/working-to-save-city-heritage/\n- https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2018/08/12/protection-for-castlegate/\n- https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2019/10/14/plans-for-the-old-coroners-court-rejected/\n- https://sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk/2020/06/27/greens-comment-on-old-coroners-court-planning-\nappeal/\n- The planning application reference 19/02258/FUL can be viewed at: https://planningapps.sheffield.gov.uk/online-\napplications/applicationDetails.do?keyVal=PTCN4VNYIO500&activeTab=summary\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The swift bricks provide nesting accommodation for birds and can be embedded into walls under the eaves. The Planning Committee accepted Cllr Little’s proposal.\nCllr Little said\n“In 2021 Sheffield City Council declared a Nature Emergency and at the time I said that good design of the built environment can help anchor wildlife in urban spaces. Even small changes to planning applications can improve the lot of birdlife and other animals in our communities.\n“Wildlife is under threat from the loss of habitat, food sources and the impact of climate change. We need to be taking every opportunity to consider nature in all the decisions we take. I am pleased that we have been able to improve this development to address the ecological impact of new housing developments.”",

It should be considered carefully if anyone wants to open a new off-licence there. We think the areas around West St and Division St still need special consideration because of problems of public nuisance, street drinking and disorder.\n“We also think the council should address serious issues of knife crime and harassment of women.\nThe current licensing policy, passed in 2016, identifies a number of “areas nearing stress” where new licences need careful thought. These include West St, Division St, Broomhill and Ecclesall Rd.\nCllr Ruth Mersereau, who is also a member of the Licensing Committee, said,\n“It’s vital that the Council’s Licensing policy shows a clear commitment to supporting the health, safety, and well-being of all its residents.\n“There is no reason that putting such safeguards in place would negatively impact Sheffield’s hospitality businesses, which has successfully achieved Best Bar None awards.

Cllr Douglas Johnson has written to the inspector in support of the planning committee’s decision:\nDear Mr Cannon,\nIt has just been brought to my attention that the developer has appealed. As an objector on the original planning application, I understand the local authority should have informed me of this appeal. This did not happen but I hope you will take these comments into account. I am therefore writing with brief comments in support of the decision to refuse planning permission.\nI am a councillor for the ward where the Old Coroner’s Court is situated and I also have an interest in heritage issues. This area is close to the original heart of Sheffield, which is currently the subject of much professional and political discussion as to its future redevelopment. Indeed, this has been so contentious that a formal consultation on a proposed Castlegate Conservation Area, which would have included the Old Coroner’s Court, was cancelled abruptly on the instruction of then then Cabinet member, Cllr Mazher Iqbal, after “vociferous challenge” from developers.\nAs set out in my objection letter – which summarised informal feedback from constituents – I noted the design was “frankly, uninspiring and look like a multi-storey car park.” Its location, as planning committee members will have known, overlooks an important and new public riverside park.\nIn my view, the proposed development would be a significant, adverse effect on the setting. For that reason, I think the committee was entitled to come to the view that it did. It was clearly within its discretion.\nIt seems to me that the developer’s main ground of appeal is that he had met with the cabinet member and with officers and he implies he had been promised the result he sought. The developer is entirely mistaken [5.19 of the grounds] when he states the design “was agreed by the delegated planning officer.” The decision was one for the Committee, after hearing from the developer and reading the officers’ advice- it was not delegated to the officer.\nI trust this is of assistance.\nDouglas\nCllr Douglas Johnson, (Green Party)\nCity Ward, Sheffield\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

They also reduce the risk of flooding through carbon capture. Sadly, Sheffield and the UK are in a nature and biodiversity crisis, as was demonstrated in your article on Monday (Wildlife ‘red flag’ as data shows insects dropping like flies, 29/04/24).\nRecently Gleadless Valley Green Party councillor Marieanne Elliot chaired a cross-party working group on biodiversity. The group included stakeholders such as Sheffield and Rotherham Wildlife Trust, Green Spaces Forum/Green Estate and the Eastern Moors partnership. The resulting report recommended Parks and Countryside Service continues to prioritise natural flood management, carbon capture and nature recovery in all its policies.\nThe report notes that high quality, biodiverse green spaces are not evenly distributed across the city. As a result, some of our most deprived communities have poorer access to nature and to cool woodland spaces in hot weather. Sheffield Greens will press the City Council to invest in our most nature-deprived areas and reach the report’s target of 30% of our land given to nature by 2030.\nOn the working group I proposed a Biodiversity Award Scheme for individuals, businesses and community organisations. These awards will aim to recognise and promote the great work already being done in our city, whilst further encouraging others to take action. It could be a family putting in a window box with insect friendly flowers, a housing development with wildlife friendly spaces, or a community garden. Such action by Sheffield Greens aims to reinforce Sheffield’s growing reputation as one of the greenest cities in the UK.\nCllr Brian Holmshaw, Broomhill and Sharrow Vale, Green Party",
  "https_sheffieldgreenparty_org_uk_council-election-and-referendum-2021_ruth-flagg-abbey_/https_sheffieldgreenparty_org_uk_2018_08_31_what-we-learnt-or-didnt-at-the-july-council-meeting/content_217.html": "This is what we learnt (or didn’t) at the 4th July 2018 Council meeting. The Green councillors asked questions about the use of injunctions, compromise on the street trees dispute, the disposal of heritage assets like the General Cemetery and Birley Spa Bath House, funding for community infrastructure and single-use plastics\nThe full text of the written questions and answers is available at http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/documents/b21097/Members%20Questions%20Wednesday%2004-Jul-2018%2014.00%20Council.pdf?T=9. However, unlike public questions, there is no official record of the supplementary questions that councillors ask orally at the council meeting.\nUse of injunctions\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson asked the Leader of the Council:\n“You told the High Court you were “happy” and expressly approved the applications to commit four tree campaigners to prison. Are you still happy with spending Council money on legal proceedings to meet Amey’s duties under the Streets Ahead contract?”\nCllr Julie Dore answered:\n“I answered a question on this matter to June Council. As you were present in the meeting you will be aware that the statement you have made is untrue.\n“I respect the process that was followed that led to the decision to bring the cases against the four people last month. I think it is important that this process is respected. The Council is involved in many legal actions relating to a wide range of issues. It would be a very dangerous precedent to set for elected councillors to make decisions about bringing forward cases against individuals, and it is right that the decisions are made independently and objectively by professional officers.”\nWhat Cllr Dore told the High Court was of course the opposite. As the court recorded in its judgment,\n“it was because of the importance of democratic accountability in this case that I sought reassurance at the outset of the hearing of this application that the application was brought with the approval of democratically elected councillors including specifically the Leader of the Council. It may be, as Mr Yasser Vanderman for the council told me, that the decision whether to bring this application was constitutionally a decision for the council’s Legal Director to make. Nevertheless, I would have been uneasy in the circumstances of this case if an application was being made on behalf of the council to commit citizens of Sheffield to prison without the support of democratically elected councillors. In response to my enquiry, I was told that the application was supported by the Leader of the Council.”\nDialogue on tree-felling\nCouncillor Alison Teal asked:\n“At Nether Edge trees meeting on 25th June, 2018, you stated that, during the summer, Amey and the Council were meeting to develop proposals for a ‘new way forward’ in approaching the trees dispute, and that when the plan is developed, it will be presented to residents and campaigners. Will you consider including the campaigners and other residents at each stage of the process, rather than handing down solutions that residents and campaigners will have had no input into?”\nCouncillor Lewis Dagnall (Cabinet Member for Environment and Streetscene) replied:\n“As I have repeatedly said, there will be a dialogue with residents and stakeholder groups when we bring forward proposals. The Council has not yet received proposals from Amey.”\nIn answer to another question, Cllr Dagnall stated,\n“With the conclusion of the recent court cases, we have been informed that there are no further historical cases of breach of injunction that the council intends to bring forward. We clearly hope that as a result of compromise from all sides further cases will not arise and ultimately the council will not have to rely upon the court injunction.”\nCommunity Infrastructure Levy (CIL) spending\nCouncillor Martin Phipps asked:\n“When is the Ward Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) policy to be implemented so that decisions can be made on spending the developers’ contributions that have accumulated since 2015?”\nHe received the answer from Councillor Jack Scott (Cabinet Member for Transport and Development):\n“Following the statutory consultation we are required to undertake.”\nDisposal of Heritage\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson asked Councillor Jack Scott\n“Will the Council categorically rule out any plans to dispose of land (whether freehold or on a lease or licence) in the General Cemetery?”\nThe response was:\n“I refer you to the comments I made at the last Council Meeting.”\nIn a supplementary question, it was pointed out that he had failed to rule out selling off part of the cemetery previously. He was asked for details of the plans, who the council planned to sell it to, when and for what purpose.\nNo details were provided.\nBirley Spa Bath House\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson asked\n“What plans are there for the future of Birley Spa Bath House? In particular, what plans are there to dispose of the land?”\nCllr Oliva Blake answered:\n“The building is currently in a poor state of repair and is subject to vandalism, fly tipping and anti-social behaviour due to its isolated location. We would like to see the building back in use and we have been reviewing all the options and have held talks with some interested parties about the former bath house. We will continue to speak with people interested in this grade two listed building. We are currently reviewing options for future use of this building.”\nAs a follow-up question, she was asked whether the officer’s statement that “the building will shortly be marketed for sale” would be countermanded and the site taken off the market. She stated “no formal decision has been taken” but that “we will look at all options.”\nSingle use plastics\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson asked,\n“What steps has the Council taken to reduce its own consumption of disposable plastics on Council premises?”\nIn response, Councillor Lewis Dagnall said:\n“The Council is currently phasing out single-use plastic from its current catering provision and removing provision of single-use plastic in staff facilities, such as water fountains, to encourage people to choose a reusable option. Paper-based cups will be supplied where appropriate, such as in training facilities.\nA pricing premium is also going to be introduced to encourage the movement away from single-use products to support the use of reusable cups.\nAlternatives to plastic are also being considered by the Council’s catering concession partners, Argent. These include vegetable-based products for items like coffee cups, takeout food boxes and single-use cutlery. As many of these products are new supply is limited, but it is hoped they will be introduced later in the year.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Almost 660,000 registered on the final day alone [1]\nThese new voters have signed up from a range of backgrounds but they are united by a desire for change. The political wranglings in Westminster over Brexit are divisive and disconnected from the lives of those struggling to make ends meet around the country. The government appears to have abandoned ship on the climate crisis.\nThe Green Party offers a bright vision of change, more radical and hopeful then the traditional parties of government. We will guide Britain out of the Brexit quagmire by offering a second referendum, allowing everyone a final, informed say on the issue. We will campaign to remain in and transform the European Union, building a truly democratic body and the international bridges we need to tackle modern problems.\nThis will allow us to focus on bringing the green new deal to the UK, improving the lives of people and protecting the planet from ecosystem collapse and the climate crisis.\nWe will do this through a universal basic income, greening the electricity supply and massive investment in transitioning the economy to carbon neutrality by 2030. This will be done fairly, working with trade unions to protect jobs and create training opportunities such as new apprenticeships.\nOf the newly registered voters, 18,000 are in Sheffield Central alone. Many of these new voters in Sheffield are young people. Amongst this age group, The Green Party enjoys strong support [2]. Whilst some may be intending to vote tactically, in Sheffield Central there is no need. In this area, The Green Party received the most votes in the council and European elections. The Conservatives don’t stand a chance here, but we do. In Sheffield Central, voters can afford to campaign for ideals and vote with our hearts. Whether you’re a new or seasoned voter, a vote for The Green Party is a vote for a new kind of politics and a brighter future.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

A social media advisor to the Israeli PM Hananya Naftali tweeted immediately after the attack: “Israeli Airforce struck a Hamas terrorist base inside a hospital in Gaza” and posted a picture. This has since been deleted as has an IDF post on Facebook boasting about the attack. Over 500 people and likely hundreds more were killed in this attack. Now our media is scrambling to cast doubt on who is responsible, a willing accomplice in covering up for war crimes, just as they try to obscure the truth about the history of Palestine and the occupation.\nThere is no new war between Hamas and Israel as our media like to claim, but rather a continuation of a 76-year-long conquest and occupation which has intensified under the most repressive right-wing Israeli government in history. The situation persists because Western governments allow Israel to flout international law and subject the Palestinian population under its occupation to racist apartheid policies and subjugation, including a 15-year-long siege of Gaza.\nWestern racism against Palestinians has a long history, and the dehumanisation of Palestinians is a continuation of the colonial mindset that allowed Europeans to colonise and enslave the world. In 1937 Winston Churchill said of the Palestinian people and I quote: “I do not agree that the dog in the manger has the final rights to the manger even though he may have lain there for a very long time, I do not admit that right. I do not admit for instance that it is a great wrong has been done to the Red Indians of America or the Black people of Australia, I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher grade race, a more worldly-wise race, to put it that way, has come to take their place”. This was the real Winston Churchill, not the white-washed version venerated today.\nUnfortunately, this racist worldview is one that persists to this day. It is one that informs most of the British media, and politicians from both the Conservative and Labour Parties. Let us not forget that Keir Starmer said “Israel made the desert flower”. Over the last few weeks, we have heard unequivocal support for Israel’s war crimes from both the Leadership of the Conservatives and the Labour Party. Shame on them. They are complicit in these war crimes and must be held accountable.\nI salute the few brave former Labour Councillors who have left the party over their leadership’s support for genocide. Councillors such as Amna Abdullatif from Manchester, Shaista Aziz and Amar Latif from Oxford and Cllr Jessie Hoskin, from Stroud district council who said: “The Labour party is no longer consistent with the values of human dignity, equality, and a world where everyone is safe and has what they need to thrive that I believe in and will continue to organise for in other areas of my work.”\nUnlike the Labour and Conservative Parties and the UK media, we reject all racism, we reject anti-Palestinian racism, we reject antisemitism, we reject Islamophobia and we reject ethnic cleansing, settler-colonialism and apartheid.\nWe know that international law must apply equally and that attacks on civilians and collective punishment can never be justified. We condemn our government for supporting Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza – including vetoing UN resolutions calling for a ceasefire. We are witnessing an attack on a captive civilian population of 2.3 million people, two-thirds of whom are refugees and half of whom are children with nowhere to go. Everyone in Gaza is a hostage.\nWe call for the release of all hostages. We also demand the release of those held in Israeli prisons – men women and children held without charge in administrative detention in contravention to international law. Every single person in Palestine must be free, free to move, free from discrimination, free from checkpoints and daily humiliation. That is what justice looks like. That is what will bring about peace.\nReturning to Gaza. You don’t need to be a human rights lawyer to know that cutting off water, food and medicine, and targeting civilians are war crimes under international law. It is the definition of collective punishment, it is an act of genocide. Ordering 1.1 million people to leave their homes in less than 24 hours, and bombing them while they flee is genocide. Bombing the Rafah crossing to Egypt to stop aid from coming in and people getting out is genocide.\nI urge everyone to keep protesting every day you can join groups supporting Palestinian rights, donate to Sheffield PSC, write to your MPs and councillors, let them know that you will not vote for them if they support war crimes and apartheid – and as my colleague Maleiki said last night – ask them specific questions and publicise their responses. If they will not condemn occupation – out them. If they will not condemn apartheid – out them. If they will not condemn genocide – out them.",

This means that, other than for the budget setting meeting next March, Labour will have stifled opposition scrutiny for the year following the aborted council elections last May.\nAfter a brief pause during full lockdown, many councils across the country began holding meetings and debating issues online. But not in Sheffield – where Labour is using the pandemic as an excuse to shut down democracy, accountability and scrutiny. At the start of the pandemic, the Council used “emergency powers” to shut down its scrutiny function by exempting all executive decisions from the “call-in” process. That meant Opposition councillors could not question Executive decisions made behind closed doors, like the massive bailouts to Sheffield International Venues.\nQuestioning and scrutiny are vital in any democratic process, especially in Sheffield where the Cabinet, council officers and Amey conspired to send street tree campaigners to prison for peacefully protecting healthy street trees.\nQuestions do need to be asked about Sheffield International Venues, now renamed Sheffield City Trust, receiving £20 million in bailouts over just 2 years. Where was the credible plan the Green councillors demanded in 2019 to turn round years of loss making? Why was Sheffield taxpayers’ money being used to bail out SIV’s loss-making contract to run Scarborough Spa and Whitby Pavilion?\nQuestions need to be asked why the council’s staff specified combustible cladding on the Hanover Tower, despite telling residents and elected councillors otherwise. Why has no one been named as at fault or disciplined in a whitewash report that took 3 years to arrive after lives were put at risk?\nThe street tree campaign slogan “Sheffield – where democracy goes to die” sums up the decaying embers of a decade of Labour rule. In May you will finally be able to vote in a citywide referendum to change the cabinet system, in which just 10 Labour councillors currently have any say in how the city is run, to a new system where all councillors have a decision-making role. On the same day, your vote in the council elections can end the Labour majority and create a “No Overall Control” council in which parties will have to work together.\nOpposition councillors’ scrutiny role in questioning the actions of the council cabinet ensures accountability to the people of Sheffield. By choosing to make the Hanover Tower cladding report the cover story on September 24th, this paper underlined a commitment to performing an equality vital scrutiny role.\nCllr Angela Argenzio\nGreen Party, Broomhill & Sharrow Vale ward\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The Green Party is the only political party with the bold aspiration to support the radical transformation of society needed to tackle these issues.\nI have campaigned on climate change and biodiversity issues for several years. I am keen to work with people across the Graves Park Ward to consider innovative ways of tackling these issues transparently and democratically.\nI live in Norton Lees and am an active member of the community, taking part in litter picks, raising money for the local woodlands and green spaces, and organising children’s nature trails and book swaps.\nI run a successful local studio with my business partner that conserves and restores easel paintings for museums, art galleries, and historic houses across the region.\nI am keen to push forward plans to improve air quality and reduce congestion along roads such as Chesterfield Road in Woodseats and Norton, which has illegally high levels of pollution and roads such as Derbyshire Lane in Norton Lees. A better system of affordable and reliable electrified public transport, along with an improved and safer cycle network, would offer one part of the solution to these issues and should be fought for with urgency.\nSeveral housing developments have recently been built in Graves Park Ward, and there must be funding to properly invest in the infrastructure of our existing and expanding neighbourhoods. In Sheffield, we have many historic buildings, including old factories, shops, pubs, schools, and churches, which have effectively been abandoned and are falling into disrepair. Rather than looking to expand into the green belt with new builds, we should celebrate our heritage by restoring and re-purposing these existing assets.\nThe recent campaign by the ‘Friends of Cobnar-Bolehill Woods’ to save and protect the woodland adjacent to Graves Park from sale and potential development was a monumental effort and demonstrated the passion and determination of residents; something which I am keen to support and highlight, in any future planning application.\nAs well as protecting our green assets, I feel we should be actively re-wilding our streets to improve biodiversity for the benefit of future generations. I will push for the planting of more street trees and for managing monoculture grass verges to flourish as mini wildflower meadows, including the banning of glyphosate -based weedkiller.

This is exactly the sort of thing we need to be doing to ensure our leisure facilities stay open for the public. Moving away from our reliance on fossil fuels is the most financially viable way forwards.”\n“Exeter City Council have recently opened one of the most energy-efficient leisure centres in the world, building to the internationally recognised Passivhaus standard (1). They are reporting energy savings of 70% compared to a building constructed to current building regulation standards. This is the approach we need in Sheffield. I have had assurances from Council officers that they are looking at these standards in proposals for Springs, Concord and Hillsborough Leisure Centres. I will be looking closely at how the council proceeds with these and other construction projects.”\nReferences\n1. “How we created the UK’s first Passivhaus Standard Leisure Centre” – Local Government Chronicle – January 2022",

Knife Angel is one of several movements teaching about the harmful effects of violent behaviour. We know that every one of these crimes leaves a trail of broken lives and communities needing to heal.\nEvery person we can turn away from carrying a knife is one less tragedy waiting to happen. If you’re worried that someone you know is carrying or thinking about carrying knives, try to make space for having a talk with them, ask them why, tell them how you feel about it, and try to find alternatives. We all need to think about how we can stop young people being in situations where carrying weapons is any kind of answer.

While glyphosate will unfortunately still be sprayed on hard surfaces, it will not be used on verges or tree pits.”\nCllr Dimond also asked for indicative targets for further reductions and for a report to be brought to the committee on options – showing costs and impacts – of phasing out glyphosate use by StreetsAhead entirely by 2025. The Greens also asked for the council to spread awareness of the nature emergency to build tolerance of vegetation growth and supporting biodiversity.\nThe Waste and Street Scene Committee agreed to consider this proposal and added it to its work programme.\nCllr Dimond welcomed progress so far saying:\n“These reductions are really substantial. We also called for more details of how further reductions can be achieved. We want to see options & cost implications for phasing out glyphosate entirely within the constraints of the StreetsAhead contract.\n“It’s important that this information is in the public domain to help inform residents & ensure decision making is transparent”.\nReferences\nUK’s flying insects have declined by 60% in 20 Years – Natural History Museum\nUK’s flying insects have declined by 60% in 20 years | Natural History Museum (nhm.ac.uk)\n¹https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2022/may/uks-flying-insects-have-declined-60-in-20-years.html\nWhat’s the problem with Roundup – Ecology Center\n²So What’s the Problem With Roundup? | Ecology Center",

This Bill became law, but the peers successfully voted down 14 of the worst parts of the bill.\nNow Home Secretary Suella Braverman has brought back even more dangerous legislation, the Public Order Bill. Leading human rights groups say this would align the UK’s anti-protest laws with those in Russia and Belarus. The Public Order Bill has already passed a final vote in the Commons, so the House of Lords has a last chance to try to amend it before it becomes law. Under this law for instance the tree protesters in Sheffield would have been locked up or intimidated and Sheffield would have lost all 17500 trees planned for felling.\nThe new bill means the police can arrest anyone at a protest. This is because “noise” is now to be defined as serious disruption. What is the point of a demonstration if nobody hears you?\nWriter George Monbiot says “Perhaps the most sinister part of the Bill is what it calls Serious Disruption Prevention Orders. These are orders that can be served on anyone who has been to a protest in the past 5 years or encouraged anyone else to go to a protest in the last five years or in any way has supported a protest in the last five years.” Protesters will be subjected to the kind of restraints that dangerous criminals face when released from prison on probation. They would have to regularly report to the police, they would not be allowed to associate with certain people, they would not be allowed to go to a protest or encourage a protest or possibly even look at protest-related materials online. They could be forced to wear an electronic tag and have monitoring equipment installed in their home.\nThis could apply to all the Green Party activists I can think of. We could all end up wearing tags! Attacking opponents like this is how fascism begins.\nUnfortunately, Keir Starmer is not speaking out against this bill, even though the whole Labour movement was built on protest. It shows how far to the right the Labour Party has moved.\nThere are now 37 environmental protesters in UK prisons, all arrested for non-violent direct action. Some activists were recently arrested for simply carrying a banner.\nOur friends at Greenpeace have organised a petition against the Public Order Bill. https://action.greenpeace.org.uk/public-order-bill Please support it.\nPeter Gilbert\nEcclesall Green Party",

It desperately needs to raise taxes to fill the holes left by the previous government but has still ruled out taxing the people with the broadest shoulders – the very, very wealthy.\n“Measures like a modest increase in the minimum wage are welcome and needed. This will, of course, put an extra financial burden on employers, in addition to the increase in employers’ national insurance. This will particularly affect public sector employers like hospitals and local councils.\nA new approach to carer’s allowances and extra money for special educational needs are also welcome.\n“However, things like the burden of rising bus fares will fall far more on lower income households. It’s astonishing that a so-called Labour government will put up bus fares by 50% whilst spending £3 billion to keep fuel duty down for petrol and Diesel. This is unhelpful when we are trying to give people decent public transport options so they can choose to leave cars at home. All in all, it looks very much like climate-denial and continuing austerity.”\n-Do you think the proposed tax increases and other increases (such as the bus fare cap) on the working people are fair?\n“A fairer system would be to tax the very wealthy, taxing income from assets the same as income from work. Greens want those with the broadest shoulders to contribute more in taxes – those with assets above £10 million at 1% and assets above £1bn at 2% annually. With only a very small minority of people subject to a wealth tax, the overwhelming majority would benefit and people who are struggling would not have to bear the burden.\n“Regarding the increased bus fares, it’s really disappointing that our Labour Mayor isn’t showing initiative like his counterpart in Greater Manchester who has already stated they will keep the cap at £2 for their residents.”\nDo you think the people of Sheffield will welcome the changes?\n“It’s a big budget and the devil will be in the detail but we don’t think anyone is going to see the big change they had been hoping for after 14 years of the Conservative government. It is going to look very much the same. What people will see is bus fares going up by 50% and the service not getting better. We risk more cuts to local services as local councils continue to feel the pinch. The budget will add big pressures to local councils’ wage bills so we need to see the detail of how the government will compensate for these extra costs.\n“It’s unlikely that people in Sheffield will agree with the Chancellor that there’s “no return to austerity.”\nWhat do you think Sheffield will gain by these measures?\n“The big question is what Sheffield will not gain. This city is in a great place to benefit from investment in green businesses but we haven’t seen any indication of this type of investment in this area. We have the technology and people to insulate homes and businesses, and promote solar and wind power generation. Instead the government green offer is just further research into questionable “carbon capture” technology instead of real action.\n“Sheffield Supertram was mentioned in the Chancellor’s speech and we know that £400 million is needed to replace a large part of the capital infrastructure. There is an extra £200 million allocated for city transport projects across the whole country but we don’t know how much Sheffield will see of this money.\n“We will need to work through the detail of the budget but the headline is that there is no more money for councils or local services and 2% cuts to most government departments. This is going to look very much like the previous government.”",

You can see it here a t2.28. It was also published in the Sheffield Telegraph on 15/08/24\nHere is the speech in full.\nThank you Lord Mayor,\nAnd Members, with great combined experience. There is much you can teach me. And I look forward to working with you all. I would also like to pay my respects to my predecessor, Roger Davidson.\nI grew up in Ecclesall but have not spent all my life in Sheffield. I have lived around the world, including countries where debate, especially political, is not allowed.\nAfter 5 years in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam I returned to find my Council in the People’s Republic of South Yorkshire acting questionably.\nAs well as joining with our Street Tree Protectors I was later involved with climate protests. I know what happens when Governments lose their grip on reality, they tighten their grip on power.\nThe Local Government Association launched its Debate Not Hate campaign in June 2022.\nI and over 700 Councillors have signed the statement. And so have many Councils, but until now not Sheffield City Council.\nI would like to believe that no one in this chamber would disagree that abuse and intimidation in politics is wrong. We must also recognise that unpopular decisions and statements will result in legitimate and sometimes robust challenge. This challenge can make the politicians who make those decisions and statements feel uncomfortable. But being uncomfortable is not the same as being abused or intimidated. There may be a protest, it might be loud. People may seek answers to questions about why decisions were made. They may persist if answers aren’t forthcoming.\nOur own behaviour as politicians must demonstrate our adherence to the Nolan Principles in Public Life: Selflessness, integrity, openness, honesty, objectivity, accountability and leadership. We must look inwards and recognise if these qualities are lacking.\nThere is a lot wrong with our Democracy. We are a country where a Government can get elected with 33% of the popular vote yet wield 100% of the power. A country where advertising standards of being honest and truthful do not apply to political advertising. This backdrop to political life in our country is not one which is going to build confidence in the legitimacy of elected politicians. Resulting at best in cynicism, and at its worst, hate and division.\nWe can do better than this.\nBut we must not stifle democracy or debate, as this fuels tyranny and hate.\nPlease support our amendment.",

Selfish parking forces people who cycle, walk or wheel into roads & into traffic. It partly explains why Sheffield’s roads are considerably more dangerous than other core cities – especially for children. Currently, enforcement officers just don’t have the power or resources to do their jobs effectively. The measures in the report – such as enforcement against people parked on dropped kerbs, double parking & reduced grace periods for new restrictions & reduced observation times for illegally parked vehicles are a welcome step in the right direction.”\nThe Liberal Democrat Chair of the Committee, and his Lib Dem colleagues wanted to retain longer observation times before Penalty Charge Notices (PCN) were issued by Council Highways staff. His proposal was for the observation time for vans and larger vehicles parked illegally to remain at 10 minutes rather than reduced to 3 minutes as officers recommended.\nCouncillor Alexi Dimond said,\n“Long observation times are a real waste of council officers’ time and make for a far less efficient parking enforcement service. They send a message that we go easy on inconsiderate drivers who park illegally. If it is a legitimate delivery to a premises, then drivers will have paperwork to demonstrate that. The changes will substantially increase efficiency of enforcement and should allow more areas to be enforced. Lib Dem Councillors in the South LAC have called for more parking enforcement in Woodseats, so it was very strange to see them voting against these measures today”.\nCouncillor Otten’s proposed amendment was defeated.\nReferences\nSheffield City Council Waste and Street Scene Committee Meeting Agenda Papers 27/9/23",

Douglas Johnson, Green Councillor for City Ward, said,\n“Now that the Council has declared the climate emergency that Greens asked for, it is time for some wide-ranging policy changes to make the council serve the city better.\n“The Green Party has the answers – it’s the Green New Deal. The Green approach will tackle the climate crisis and make life better for everyone in society, including the poorest.”\n“That’s why one of our demands is to adopt alternative measures of wellbeing, not just economic measures. The Green Party’s Caroline Lucas was part of the original group that launched the Green New Deal as far back as 2008, in reaction to the Labour government bailing out the banks with millions of pounds of public money.\nCllr Paul Turpin added,\n“We’re sick of motions from Labour which are either self-congratulatory or not specific to Sheffield and don’t have any actions for the betterment of the city.”\nThe motion text is:\nMotion on “Actions for the betterment of Sheffield and those who live there”\nProposed by Cllr Douglas Johnson and seconded by Cllr Paul Turpin\nThat this council endorses the following policies and actions designed to make life better for the people of Sheffield:-\n- To Implement a Workplace Parking Levy for Sheffield, raising funds to improve public transport, walking and cycling routes, making it easier for people to choose to leave their cars at home;\n- To consult the public on the draft local plan at the earliest opportunity, including stronger policies on building more affordable housing and tackling the climate emergency;\n- To establish a climate emergency committee to develop strategies, and implement actions to bring about the necessary changes to meet our zero carbon emissions target by at least 2030;\n- To introduce an effective climate change impact assessment, for every formal decision of the council;\n- To adopt a “Wellbeing Economy” for Sheffield: placing the health and wellbeing of the people of Sheffield at the heart of all decision-making, and measuring the success of Sheffield’s economy not just by GDP, but by how the economy has improved people’s quality of life, through measurements like the Happy City Index and Free Time Index;\n- To reduce inequality by introducing a maximum 10:1 pay ratio for all City Council employees;\n- To establish a properly resourced team of sustainability officers to work on real progress towards making Sheffield carbon-neutral;\n- To recognise the ongoing value of the city’s library service and reward the hard work of volunteers who have supported their local branch libraries by providing funding for a paid, professional librarian in every branch library;\n- To improve democracy in Sheffield City Council by developing the long-standing Green Party campaigns of creating a modern committee system and webcasting, by further improvements including publishing the answers to public questions and members supplementary questions.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The Planning Committee considers the application on September 12th.\nEamonn Ward, who submitted this objection (and a 1300 signature petition calling for a new Sheffield City Council air pollution action plan in April), comments:\n“We know how popular Meadowhall is and recognise the arguments for job creation but increased air pollution deaths linked to major developments in the east end are not an acceptable price to pay. Everyone involved knows that business models based on access via the M1 have massive health impacts and will add to the 500 premature deaths a year caused by air pollution in Sheffield.\nAccess will continue to be mainly by car as Meadowhall have already maximised the use of cleaner transport options for customers and staff. The application makes it clear that the Meadowhall extension will bring more traffic and worsen air pollution.\nTinsley is in Darnall council ward which has very high levels of asthma, respiratory and circulatory disorders and cancer linked to high levels of poverty. It has a much higher than average number of young children who are more vulnerable to air pollution, often leading to asthma and a lifelong reduction in lung capacity.\nIt is being suggested in the officers report that air pollution mitigation comes in the form of the council’s failed 2012 Air Quality Action Plan and government plans that have changed throughout 2017 as high court judges order them to go back to drawing board. Neither is a credible basis for definite action in what remains an uncertain, fluid situation on meeting EU air quality standards.\nSheffield can’t just make road changes to allow expansion in the east end knowing that it will worsen the current public health crisis and cause more premature deaths in and around Tinsley. Sheffield Council’s Public Health Strategy approved at Cabinet on March 15th 2017 states: “We will adopt a principle of health in all policies & systematically consider health and wellbeing outcomes, and inequalities across all of the decisions.” This application fails that test and should not be approved until it does.”\nNotes\n- The text of the Sheffield Green Party objection is shown below\n- Darnall council ward health data is here http://www.sheffieldeastend.org.uk/DarnallWardHealthProfile2011.pdf\n- The council’s action plan (signed off in 2012 with objectives to be achieved by 2015) is here: https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/content/dam/sheffield/docs/pollution-and-nuisance/air-pollution/air-quality-management/Air%20Quality%20Action%20Plan%202015.pdf\n- The petition submitted in April is www.change.org/p/sheffield-city-council-sheffield-needs-a-new-air-pollution-action-plan\nOBJECTION SUBMITTED:\nSheffield Green Party objection to 16/04169/FUL | Changes to the Meadowhall Leisure and Retail Scheme comprising of amendments to the uses and floorspace and incorporating an Environmental Statement Addendum considering the amended highway, air quality and socio economic impacts.\n“The M1 has been widened to 4 lanes. Ikea opens this month. The Olympic Legacy Park is coming soon. A service station for M1 junction 33 has been proposed and the Smithy Wood service station at junction 35 is on hold awaiting that decision. Numerous developments are being proposed close to junction 34 prompting ”full and proper assessment” of congestion issues which pushed back consideration of this application.\nSupporting documents appear to show an increase in car journeys by about 8%. 4 out of 5 people will continue to arrive by car and nearly two thirds of those journeys will be via the M1. The tram train to Rotherham will help a little bit from around 2019 when cleaner Northern and TransPennine Express trains are also due. Travel Plan targets shown here are optimistic to say the least including doubling the number of people cycling or walking. Few customers or staff live close enough to even consider walking or cycling as a viable option.\nThe location has always dictated a business model based on attracting customers by car, mainly using the M1. This will essentially continue – Meadowhall have already maximised the use of cleaner transport options for customers and staff. There is now only the opportunity for small incremental behaviour changes however good the Travel Plan is.\nThis application is part of a group of applications focused on the area between M1 Junctions 33 and 35, with junction 34 identified as a major stress point. This application, added to the impacts of approved applications and further applications in the pipeline, has serious implications for air pollution in this part of Sheffield (and in Rotherham close to the M1). The Highways Agency may solve the congestion issues but it’s clear that a significant increase in car and other vehicle journeys will have public health impacts. Facilitating road changes to allow this development to go ahead deliberately creates road conditions to allow more traffic and therefore worsen air pollution.\nThe State of Sheffield 2017 report states: “Air quality in Sheffield has not improved and remains a significant issue that impacts on citizens’ health and wellbeing.” The Sheffield City Air Quality Action Plan includes this among 7 main actions: “Mitigate the impact of the M1 motorway (particularly in the Tinsley Area)”.\nWe know 500 premature deaths a year in Sheffield can be attributed to poor air quality and that people living in Tinsley have maximum exposure. Tinsley is in the Darnall council ward which has very high levels of asthma, respiratory and circulatory disorders and cancer linked to high levels of poverty. It has a high number of under 5’s and under 20’s – young people are more vulnerable to air pollution often leading to asthma and a lifelong reduction in lung capacity. Schools are being moved away from the M1 because of these impacts but you can’t move the population away from where they live.\nThis development will significantly increase vehicle journeys. Meadowhall have already exhaustively investigated and implemented the clean transport options available for customers and staff. Statistics show that car travel to Meadowhall will still massively predominate with most journeys via the M1. A 60 mph speed limit on the M1 between junctions 32 and 35A will help if the recent consultation leads to implementation. But the overall picture remains unchanged – numerous major developments in the east end with significantly increased traffic and associated health impacts on vulnerable communities.\nWe are provided with statistics that clearly show this development has negative impacts on air quality across the whole of the surrounding areas. We are told this development will delay compliance with air quality standards by about 1 year. IKEA will also no doubt delay compliance by a period of years so this is just kicking the can down the road.\nThe basis for future air quality standards compliance is the 2012 Sheffield City Council Air Quality Plan. But there has been no significant action on “Mitigate the impact of the M1 motorway (particularly in the Tinsley Area)” and the overall plan has failed in it’s overall objective of reducing premature deaths due to air pollution.\nThe second basis for future air quality standards compliance is the latest version of government plans which simply cannot be relied on. The government continue to fight in the courts to avoid the production and implementation of credible air pollution actions. Another court case could follow before Christmas accompanied by yet another government plan as Client Earth continue to fight this battle on behalf of our public health.\nI ask committee members to consider these questions before making their decision:\n– You are considering a revised application following representations by the Highways Agency to include measures to address congestion due to the increased volume of traffic at junction 34 of the M1 and in the roads close to it. Have similar robust revisions been made to this application to fully address the increased air pollution that this increased traffic will bring?\n– The air pollution impacts are definite. It is being suggested to you that mitigation comes in the form of the council’s 2012 Air Quality Action Plan with objectives to be achieved by 2015 that have not been met with no updated plan in place. Plus government plans that have changed from month to month in 2017 as judges order them to go back to drawing board. Can you have any confidence in the mitigation assessment in this uncertain, fluid situation?\n– This and the many other developments in the pipeline in the east end need to have a neutral impact on traffic movements and air pollution. Can suitable conditions be applied to enable this? Are revisions to the business model required to reduce traffic movements and enable increased use of public transport and other lower polluting or non polluting travel methods?\n– Should the feasibility of a Clean Air Zone in the East End be investigated as a matter of urgency in addition to those being looked at in other pollution hot spots in and around the centre of Sheffield? Should citywide air pollution warnings be issued to allow people with health conditions to make informed decisions about going out on days when pollution is worst?\n– At the IKEA decision meeting in 2014 the Council’s Director of Public health stated: “The exacerbation of poor air quality will undoubtedly cause more illness and very probably a small number of premature deaths. The adverse consequences are very unlikely to be outweighed by improvement in employment prospects and improvement in the economy.”\n– Sheffield Council’s Public Health Strategy, approved at Cabinet on March 15th 2017, states: “We will adopt a principle of health in all policies & systematically consider health and wellbeing outcomes, and inequalities across all of the decisions.” How can this application proceed without significantly negative impacts on the health of vulnerable people in the areas impacted by the business undertaken on this site?\nSheffield Green Party objects to this application unless suitable conditions are stipulated that definitely ensure no adverse impacts on air pollution and public health.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Green Party Councillors on the Committee argued that the development could be made more environmentally friendly and in light of the results of the Grenfell Inquiry, safer as well.\nA Park Hill resident speaking at the meeting, while supportive of the scheme, expressed his disappointment with the lack of cycle storage and the lack of commitment from the developers Urban Splash to install solar panels on the roof.\nThere is a planning condition that 10% of the energy comes from renewable energy but the Council has not specified how this should be supplied.\nFollowing the Planning and Highways Meeting, Councillors Elliot and Nottage commented on the application.\nGleadless Valley Councillor Marieanne Elliot said,\n“It is disappointing that the installation of solar panels has not been included as part of this development. Installing solar panels on a flat roof will not require extensive scaffolding and as such should be a relatively easy and cost effective installation.\n“I know that Park Hill flats is now a Grade 2 listed building but that should not be a reason not to install solar panels. St James’s Church in Piccadilly in London has solar panels (2) on the roof. It was designed by Sir Christophen Wren and is a Grade 1 listed building, but like Park Hill it has a significant flat roof where the solar panels will be impossible for anyone to see from ground level.”\nHillsborough Councillor Henry Nottage, who proposed fire safe battery storage lockers for the development, said\n“It’s great to see the final phase of Park Hill going ahead. Park Hill is ideally placed for people wanting to live a lifestyle less dependent on private car ownership due to its proximity to the city centre and excellent public transport links.\n“The provision of cycle storage, either in the communal cycle store, in flats or on the walkways is to be applauded, but does it really go far enough to ensure that the flats are ready for people’s active travel requirements?\n“The advent of the electric bicycle has opened up cycling as a really viable alternative to car use. You can carry a significant amount of shopping, transport the children and arrive at work sweat free without a piece of lycra in sight.\n“ Following the outcome of the Grenfell Inquiry we should seek to reduce and eliminate all fire risks, however small. Though the risk of electric bikes lithium batteries catching fire is relatively low, I strongly believe that the provision of fire-safe battery-charging lockers should be a feature of the refurbished units at Park Hill. This will ensure that people can make the most of the fantastic and improving active travel options in Sheffield without compromising the safety of themselves or their neighbours.”\nThe Committee placed a condition on the developers to produce a plan to provide safe storage of electric bikes and the charging of their batteries.\nCouncillor Marieanne Elliot also successfully proposed a directive requesting that that the developer work with the Council and the Police to address anti social behaviour in the area,\nCouncillor Elliot said\n“Most evenings 20 to 30 cars congregate outside the flats, The vehicles’ occupants are known to engage in criminal activity which makes residents feel threatened. This is of a particular concern to women who are concerned for their safety. We want the developer to engage with the Council and the police to see how they can work together to address this problem. This could help make the area one where people can live comfortably and without fear and would be the actions of a responsible developer”\nThere was disappointment that no affordable housing would be provided as part of the Park Hill development for this application. The Council’s Local Plan did not specify the need for affordable housing in the Park Hill area.\nCouncillor Elliot said,\n“Given the history of Park Hill, which was originally Council housing, it is disappointing not to see affordable housing being mandated as part of this phase of the development. There is a dire need for more affordable housing to rent across Sheffield. It was reassuring to hear the developer at the meeting commit to 20% affordable housing after all.\nReferences*\n- Park Hill Flats – Wikipedia Entry Park Hill, Sheffield – Wikipedia\n- St James’s Church, Piccadilly Solar Installation Photovoltaic Systems at St James’s Church, Piccadilly (simondawson.com)\n- Battery charging with fire suppression Buy A Lithium-Ion Battery Cabinet | 2 Door with FirePro® Suppression & Charging Points Online At Yellow Shield",

A consultation on “Connecting Sheffield” plans for the roads, which have a range of measures proposed, include getting feedback on the general approach to making bus lanes full time. The Government funded “Connecting Sheffield” scheme aims to cut pollution, tackle climate change, and improve transport for everyone. Sheffield Green Party see it as an opportunity to find out what kind of city people want to live in and how we can get there. Abbeydale Road and Ecclesall Road are now often overloaded with traffic. If we can still get to local shops and cafes, then won’t it be great to have a way of doing this with less congestion and less pollution?\nAny individual or family who owns a car makes a decision about whether they go by car every time they make a journey. Cars are very convenient, but they take up space on the road, create pollution and dangers to others, and need a parking space at the other end. Each individual or family who can shift to walking, cycling, or using the bus for a journey helps everyone. Smoother running buses would help people make that change. They would also benefit the 75,000 households in Sheffield who don’t have a car.\nAll-day bus lanes have worked well in other parts of the city to help buses run smoother, so could be the right solution for Abbeydale Road and Ecclesall Road. Whatever your views on this plan, we need to talk about how we get to a better Sheffield. A city with less congestion and cleaner air. A city with local shopping and leisure areas that are pleasant and good to walk around. A city where it’s easier to get around by public transport, bicycle and on-foot. Obviously, it is important that access needs for all are fully considered. There will be a full consultation on bus lanes and parking next year but as a first step, I’d encourage people to have a look at the current Connecting Sheffield plans and make your views known at https://connectingsheffield. commonplace.is/",

Councillors were asked to allow officers to make decisions on a range of licensing functions. Normally, these have to go to a sub-committee of elected councillors.\nSome of the cases involve allegations of misconduct against taxi drivers, which are heard in private. Other cases, such as permits for door-to-door collections, require a report to be made public when they go to committee. This will no longer happen if decisions are made by officers.\nCouncillor Johnson commented,\n“The changes passed by the Licensing Committee today mean that councillors and the public will know less about things like street traders and people doing house-to-house collections.\n“Under the new changes, officers can just sign these off without it coming to councillors. This also means the application will not be made public, which is what happens when cases go to committee.\n“However, I am pleased that officers will at least have to report back each week on any decisions that have been made under these new powers.”\nCllr Ruth Mersereau added,\n“At a time of the coronavirus lockdown, councillors should be paying more attention, not less, to people who want to sell things or do charity collections door-to-door.\n“According to Victim Support, the coronavirus has seen a rise in the exploitation of vulnerable people, and, with more time spent at home, scammers and fraudsters have more opportunity to contact people on their doorstep.”\nNotes\n- The Licensing Committee agenda is at http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=142&MId=7578\n- The proposal by Cllrs Johnson & Mersereau was :\n- To delegate to the Chief Licensing Officer & Head of Licensing the further power to determine the grant, renewal, transfer, or variation of licences, permits and consents in relation to Hackney Carriages & Private Hire Vehicles, only so far as:\na. tinted windows;\nb. the age of the vehicle\nc. vehicle test requirements\nd. routine driver medical tests - to approve the ratification of the vehicle renewals set out at paragraph 6.3 of the report\n- to require the Chief Licensing Officer and Head of Licensing to report decisions made under these delegations to the Committee in writing (including by e-mail).\n- to end these additional delegations no later than 27 October 2020 [6 months from today]\n- To delegate to the Chief Licensing Officer & Head of Licensing the further power to determine the grant, renewal, transfer, or variation of licences, permits and consents in relation to Hackney Carriages & Private Hire Vehicles, only so far as:\n- The Green councillors supported a further LibDem proposal to ensure that cases of criminal convictions by taxi drivers still come to a committee.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

I grew up in a village in Lincolnshire, but have lived in large cities all over Europe; Birmingham, London, Copenhagen, Milan and Sheffield; it’s a wonderful kind of insight to learn how other people do things, as well as live in both inner cities and rural areas.\nThen there’s my parents’ sense of public duty – as a police officer and health & social care worker – which instilled in me values based on fairness and community care. My work first as an independent theatre-maker, then in academia, and now in the videogames sector running a small business means I understand what it means to be precarious as well as to have the responsibility of others’ livelihoods in my stewardship.\nA common thread through it all though has been activism. After being involved in student and environmental protests in my 20s and working in communities, the arts, and the tech sector trying to advocate for better worlds since, I have been disheartened to see Keir Starmer’s Labour Party give up on workers, the NHS, and the climate emergency. Watering down policies one by one. The refusal to value the lives of Palestinians alongside those of Israeli hostages in November 2023 was a last straw. That’s what brought me to the Green Party.\nBoth Labour and the Conservatives tell us they see the problems we face, but neither are brave or honest about the solutions. The Green Party is. The Green Party puts people and workers at its heart. Sets out real possibilities to increase wages; lower bills; stimulate the economy through green jobs; and build walkable cities, connecting towns and villages with public transport and infrastructure which improves our lives, our health, and our wellbeing. We need an NHS which is not on its knees, a state which supports us, and success which is shared by all.\nI have always believed in worker’s rights, the need for justice for all, to build a society that lifts us all up, and an NHS and state that pick us up when we stumble. I also believe that the most urgent threat to our ability to improve our lives is the climate emergency. This starts with us, at a local level, making changes that work for us, and help us build a better world, together.\nIf I were elected as MP for Sheffield South East, it would be a privilege to listen to you.

It has made people feel unsafe in their home city. It goes on to say that the threat of serious violence impacted negatively on businesses in the local economy with many Sheffield businesses shutting up shop for fear of property damage and looting.\nGreens have asked for the recommendations of the Khan Review into Social Cohesion to be implemented in full.

She concluded that successive governments have failed the British people and left local authorities struggling to deal with extremist challenges; (1)\nGreen Councillor Angela Argenzio, who is herself a migrant from Italy said,\n“ mainstream politicians and media have fuelled the recent violence and the ‘Stop the Boats’ narrative has contributed to division and has unfairly stigmatised migrants and asylum seekers;\n“We have got to change the narrative on asylum seekers and refugees and recognise that migrants have always contributed to our society as workers, taxpayers and citizens and that segregation of asylum-seekers into different systems for homelessness, destitution and work creates further division and a lack of cohesion in society.\nGreen Party Councillor Maleiki Haybe said,\n“I would like to thank the people of Sheffield who turned out in their thousands to demonstrate their opposition to the racist rioters and who made clear that the majority of people did not share their poisonous opinions.\n“I believe that the majority of people in Sheffield want an asylum system that is fair, well managed and humane. There have been some positive signs recently such as the scrapping of the Rwanda deportation scheme and Bibby Stockholm barge but we need to do a lot more.\n“The policy of Austerity by successive Governments has fuelled resentment and is the root cause of much of the recent unrest. The underfunding of our health and care services and the lack of social housing is not the fault of refugees but of decades of under investment by successive Labour and Conservative Governments.”\nReferences\n1 – Conservatives left UK wide open to far-right violence, says former adviser | UK security and counter-terrorism | The Guardian",

This year, the Lib Dems have had the chance to engage constructively with colleagues in a “Rainbow Executive” for the good of the people of Sheffield, to date they have declined. Alas, their strategy appears to be to jump on every bandwagon – no matter how reactionary – see for example their recent public support for Roy “Chubby” Brown whose material includes misogyny, domestic violence, racism and whipping up hatred of asylum seekers.\nIn his letter of 10/02/2022, “Repeat of Tree Fiasco”, Cllr Mohammed equates a public consultation on ideas to give greater priority to buses on Abbeydale Road and Ecclesall Road, with the (then) Labour-run Council’s draconian crackdown on residents protecting Sheffield’s trees. Putting aside that the Lib Dems helped to secure the street-tree contract and hailed it at the time; drawing this parallel is quite absurd. While trees help to combat climate change, reduce air pollution and increase health and wellbeing; excessive car use does the opposite. There is a wealth of evidence built up over the last 10 years (from Living Streets and Sustrans among others) which show that pedestrianisation, active travel and reliable public transport are far better for local businesses than dangerous, polluted, log-jammed roads.\nIn Cllr Masters’ letter of 08/02/2022, “Green Belt Under Threat”, she completely misrepresents Sheffield Green Party’s view on the local plan. We take a nuanced view:\n· that the biodiversity of some brownfield sites can be more valuable than greenbelt sites which have been subjected to years of industrial farming\n· that rural communities also need affordable housing\n· and that it will be extremely detrimental to public health and wellbeing, (as well as biodiversity) to develop every inch of brownfield and greenfield land within the city boundaries\nA strong local plan can ensure that all developments include good infrastructure, public transport and active travel links. It must also ensure that former industrial sites are developed first; while nature corridors and biodiversity are protected with all residents having access to green spaces.\nThe Lib Dems at the last Full Council Meeting rightly argued for 15 minute neighbourhoods – where every community has access to employment, recreation, green spaces and other amenities within 15 minutes walking-distance of where they live. Yet, they also seem to believe that everyone in those neighbourhoods must be able to drive from their on-street parking to park outside their local shop. Where’s the joined-up thinking to support action on the climate and ecological emergencies?\nAlexi Dimond,",

We note the big step forward to look at large-scale housing retrofit programmes and want to back this up with a new £3 million Carbon Reduction Investment Fund. We also aim to provide genuine support for public transport with an honest approach to the cost of car parking and the real benefits of safe and convenient walking and cycling routes.”\nThis injection of cash would be funded through an Employers Workplace Parking Levy, where large employers pay a small levy on parking spaces, and this is used to fund alternatives to car travel. In Nottingham this has generated over £9 million income a year, which has doubled their tram network, with safer roads, protected cycle lanes, grants to businesses and a better environment for pedestrians.\nGreen Councillor for City Ward Ruth Mersereau said\n“In the Nottingham scheme, small employers offering fewer than 10 parking spaces pay nothing at all. Larger employers offering more than 10 parking spaces pay a fee of £1.17 per day per parking space. There are exemptions for local emergency services, NHS frontline staff and blue badge holders. This would be the model we would be seeking to follow in Sheffield. Other Councils like Leicester and across Scotland are also looking to introduce Employers’ Workplace Parking Levies, so why not Sheffield, if we actually want to generate more money to invest in public transport?”\nIn other proposals, Greens are calling for Councillors to set an example by removing their ability to claim parking expenses, unless they are a Blue Badge holder.\n“It is important that Councillors walk the talk and not have subsidised private car travel that is not available to the vast majority of people in Sheffield” said Cllr Alison Teal (Executive Member for Sustainable Neighbourhoods, Wellbeing, Parks and Leisures).\nPavement parking and parking enforcement is another area the Greens believe the Council could do much better on. In many areas in the City Centre and in the surrounding districts, there are communities who are suffering from inconsiderate and illegal parking. Partially sighted people, people in wheelchairs and parents with buggies frequently have to navigate blocked pavements causing not just inconvenience but real danger as they are forced to walk or wheel onto the roads.\n“Pavements are for pedestrians, not cars and we’re pleased Green proposals to address this in the City Centre are coming into force, but we need more action across the districts where this is a problem. We have identified the need for action on proper access for the growing number of home deliveries, taxis ordered online and take-away food collection” said Broomhill and Sharrow Vale Councillor Angela Argenzio.\nGreens backed the provision of a FreeBee bus service to improve access to shops and services for those travelling around the city centre and those people with limited mobility.\nCouncillor Paul Turpin (Executive Member for Inclusive Economy, Jobs and Skills) said, “Our city centre is changing and we want people to be able to get about and enjoy all that it offers, whatever their mobility needs – the free bus will help make that vision a reality.”\nAdult social care is the biggest area of Council spending and there are real concerns about the limited funding for helping vulnerable people with their basic needs, poor pay for care workers and the whole idea of companies making profits out of something which is about human dignity. Greens have proposed support to help develop Community Based Care Cooperatives where staff will have a stake in the organisation they work for and the emphasis is on care not the profit motive.\nCity Ward Councillor Martin Phipps said,\n“We will support the development of Care Cooperatives that will operate on the basis of reinvesting surpluses in improving and extending the services they offer to provide a wide range of care services”.\n“These cooperatives will provide all staff with at least the living wage, a training programme which supports development and progression. This model of care provision will also play a role in raising standards in the wider care sector”.\nThe Greens also proposed a Carbon Reduction Investment Fund to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, support the development of renewable energy projects and to support a wide range of initiatives to address greenhouse gases at the earliest possible date to support our aim of being zero-carbon by 2030.",

This followed a call, from Green Councillors, to save the scheme earlier this month.\nThe Safe Square project, situated at first in Leopold Square and then in Barker’s Pool, was launched last year and has been a great success. By having medical staff on hand, it prevents people going to Accident and Emergency, saving the NHS money. It has been estimated that for every £1 spent on the project a further £9.31 is saved in A&E. It also provides a safe meeting place, somewhere to charge mobile phones and a phone to call a taxi.\nCity Ward Councillor Douglas Johnson said,\n“I am delighted to hear the news that the police’s Violence Reduction Unit has agreed to provide further funding so the “Safe Square” initiative can go ahead this year.\n“ Safe square is a really important life-saving mission in Sheffield’s vibrant night-time economy. It offers a point of refuge for anyone who needs help on a night out. It can be a place to go for anyone who has too much to drink and gets separated from their mates or just if you need to charge your phone so you can get home safely. Medical staff are on hand. Crucially, it can be a place of safety for anyone who finds themselves threatened or vulnerable on a night out.\n“As a Councillor for City Ward, I am in touch with people involved in the night-time economy. This was a fantastic pilot project and the results of the study showed the financial savings it makes to front-line services, as well as providing safety and reassurance for anyone having a night out in the city centre.”",

The Council regularly comments on international affairs, not least when it recognised Palestine as an independent state.\n“I accept there are legal constraints that were brought in by the Thatcher government when it wanted to stop councils’ boycotting South African goods. Despite that, the council may still take a political stand, even if the law limits the practical actions the council can take. A principled stand sends a message of solidarity to oppressed people.\n“I therefore proposed that Sheffield declares itself ‘an Israeli Apartheid-free zone, insofar as legal considerations allow.’ This follows legal advice. I was glad to see this seconded by Cllr Angela Argenzio but then disappointed that the Chair of the Committee blocked the amendment being put to the vote.”\nCllr Angela Argenzio seconded the amendment and said:\n“Whilst the local government act legally prohibits some actions, a symbolic declaration would be a powerful statement, especially given the recent ruling by the International Court of Justice and the long tradition of Sheffield City Council standing up for human rights wherever they may be abused”\nIt was then accepted by officers that a statement was possible, but that the decision couldn’t be taken at the meeting.\nThe implication was that declaring an apartheid free zone would negatively impact equality and cohesion, despite the impact assessment in the report recognising that taking no action as per officers’ recommendations “may not be welcomed by Palestinian and Arab people”. The report made no reference to the International Court of Justice’s finding that Israel is operating a system of apartheid or Sheffield’s declared aspiration to be an anti-racist city.\nLabour and Liberal Democrat members of the Strategy & Resources Committee of Sheffield Council voted against declaring Sheffield an Israeli apartheid-free zone on the basis that it would be purely a symbolic gesture. They argued that as such it would be pointless and of no material benefit.\nMembers of the committee argued that, while they support Palestine, they didn’t think that making a gesture of support would be of any use. Many argued that they didn’t do gesture politics and one suggested that asking for further legal advice on Palestine would be a waste of money.\nClick here for the full report taken to the Strategy and Resources committee, recommending a response to the petition.\nNote: Section 17 of the Local Government Act 1988 prohibits local authorities from taking “non-commercial matters” such as the country of origin into account when contracting for goods or services. However, there are exceptions, not addressed in the council report, for equality issues.",

Constant battles are being fought in Fulwood as First and Stagecoach make profit motivated decisions to change routes and services. People here should have access to bus services to take them to the two big hospitals – the council should be in control of the buses.”",

Under the draft PSPO, people could be sanctioned for loitering, begging or drinking alcohol.\nGreen Party Councillor for Gleadless Valley Marieanne Elliot said,\n“The Public Sector Protection Order, as described in the consultation document, would mean that someone sitting on the floor, quietly with a hat, could be regarded as someone who is likely to cause harassment, nuisance or annoyance. Is it really sensible to issue a £100 Penalty Charge Notice to someone who is begging?\n“There is also the issue of what sort of behaviour is regarded as acceptable or unacceptable. A family having a glass of wine with a picnic in the Peace Gardens could well be treated differently from someone sitting on their own with a can of lager. It is not at all clear what would be a fair application of the rules in these circumstances.\n“The proposed definition of loitering raises lots of questions. It could potentially criminalise groups of students and young people, not drinking alcohol, just enjoying being outside on a warm evening.\n“There seems to be an intention to explicitly address issues outside banks and supermarkets, but not outside independent shops and businesses.\n“If a Public Space Protection Order comes into force, there is a serious possibility that the unwanted behaviours (drinking alcohol, loitering, urinating, begging) will be displaced to adjacent communities around the city centre, like Netherthorpe, Lansdowne, Park Hill, St Mary’s, Leverton and Kelham Island. There is currently no coherent plan for addressing this displacement.\n“The council could use resources more effectively by working on tackling some of the root causes, rather than considering punishing people with punitive sanctions. There is extensive empirical research that says this sort of action can disproportionately affect the most vulnerable; people experiencing trauma, poverty, unmet support needs, those excluded from the housing market. There are excellent voluntary sector organisations in Sheffield, helping to support these people, and they could do with more support.\nIt is frustrating that, on one hand, council licences are granted to 24 hour booze shops all over the city centre and on the other, they are considering banning city centre drinking in public places. Also, the council could provide more public toilet facilities in the city centre.\n“It is reported that Sheffield is one of the safest cities in the UK. We also heard that the police now have 50% more officers operating in the City Centre, this is very welcome news and surely means there is more opportunity to address actual illegal activity.\nA PSPO needs to be justified so there must be reasonable grounds to impose it, that is the legal test¹ and it’s not clear this has been met.”\nGreen Party Councillor for Walkley, Bernard Little said,\n“As a councillor for Netherthorpe, Upperthorpe and Walkley, I’m surprised that I wasn’t directly consulted about the plans. The map of the proposed PSPO shows that some of the ward will be inside and some of it outside the protected area. There is obvious risk of displacement to residential areas and this needs to be discussed with our communities living in those areas.\nThis proposal is ill-conceived and will impact a group of vulnerable people that need safe places and support.”\nThe majority of the Committee voted in support of the draft PSPO and to begin formal consultation, with only the 2 Green Councillors, Marieanne Elliot and Bernard Little, voting against.\nReferences\n¹Anti Social Behaviour, Crime & Policing Act 2014 s.59 (3) (c)",

(1)\nThe 10 Point Plan for Climate Action that was agreed by the Cooperative Executive in March 2022 by Green Councillors in cooperation with Labour, committed the Council to develop routemaps to decarbonisation across seven areas:\n- Our Council,\n- The Way We Travel;\n- Our Homes;\n- Energy generation and storage;\n- Our Land;\n- Our Business and Economy\n- What We Buy, Eat and Throw Away\nThis is the first of those routemaps focusing on travel and the Council’s own carbon emissions.\nThe Council activities to reduce its own emissions are focused on improving the energy performance of council housing and the Council’s own buildings. There are plans to reduce emissions from street lighting and the council’s vehicle fleet. The plan also seeks to ensure that the council makes decisions and procures goods and services in a way that minimises carbon emissions.\nThe plans to improve the way we travel in Sheffield focus on improving routes and facilities that enable as many people as possible to make journeys by walking, cycling and wheeling. The plan seeks to improve the low-carbon public transport network to provide attractive alternatives to private vehicle journeys. There is also a focus on finding ways to ensure goods and services are provided through a low-carbon LGV/HGV and freight/delivery system to reduce vehicle journeys and road traffic. The plan also has a real benefit to health outcomes with decreased vehicle emissions and improved air quality through a shift to electric and zero-emission vehicles.\nCllr Christine Gilligan who is Deputy Chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Change Board said,\n“I am really pleased that these route maps are coming to our committee and I look forward to progress reports on future route maps and updates on the actions that fall out of these current route maps. Greens will keep the pressure on to make sure the plans are implemented.\n“The route map, The way we travel, highlights the urgency of this agenda – look at what is happening in Europe at the moment with record breaking heat events.\n“In terms of transport we need everyone in the city to act. We need more public transport, walking and cycling to reduce our dependence on cars. As a council we have the powers to change our car centric culture and this plan stresses the importance of a modal shift in transport. The goal is that by 2030 there will be a 65% reduction in transport related emissions but currently we are facing traffic growth and a 35% increase in journey times This increases not only carbon emissions but also air pollution so I really hope that this committee will fully take on board the need for change and continue to give their full support to all the actions in this road map. We have a responsibility to the citizens of Sheffield to act on the climate crisis now.”\nCllr Ruth Mersereau who is also a member of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Change Committee said:\n“As a council, we have committed to reduce our emissions by 95% and to cut transport emissions by 65% by 2030 – this is only 6 and a half years away. The need to address climate change is becoming even more urgent, so I’m really pleased that we have a routemap designed to help us to navigate the actions we need to take.\n“This routemap spells out how we can minimise the effects of climate change in our city. Taking these actions gives us a fantastic opportunity to improve public health and well-being, and also bring a range of other positives including creating new jobs, improving our relationship with nature, improving road safety and community safety, and lowering energy costs.”\nNotes",

Ideally, more students would live in amongst the community and not just in student-only accommodation.\n“The council hasn’t reviewed its student accommodation strategy since 2013 and, even then, there were concerns about the over-supply of single-room, purpose built student accommodation.\n“Changes in student populations can happen quickly but big building projects could blight our city centre in a few years if they turn out to be the wrong type of housing. There is already a shortage of family housing in the city centre.\n“It isn’t just an issue for the “market”. It is vital that the city centre is a high quality place to live and work for everyone.\n“We need a review to say whether the right type of housing is still being built.”\nNotes\n- The motion has been submitted for the council meeting on 6th September 2017.\n- The Council’s policy on Creating Mixed Communities is at http://sheffield-consult.limehouse.co.uk/portal/sdfcs/core_strategy/core_strategy?pointId=d16609031e305\n- Sheffield Green Party’s motion is:\nMotion – review of student accommodation\nProposed by Cllr Douglas Johnson; seconded by Cllr Rob Murphy\nThat this council,\n1.

Greens warned from the start that the Veolia contract would offer no incentive to increase recycling as the incinerator would need to be fed waste. Sixteen years on our woeful recycling rate is miles behind other South Yorkshire councils.\nGetting to the truth could be difficult. Like Streets Ahead, the Veolia contract is only publicly available in a heavily redacted form that strips out all the key information the public wants to know. What we are told by spokespersons about these contracts and working relationships with the council can never be verified. The Veolia contract may be terminated early in 2018 but Streets Ahead is due to last until 2037. That’s 20 more years of not knowing what the council signed us up to and what is being done to us using the taxes we pay.\nThe street trees campaign has shown why we have to fight for transparency.

The Labour group was also split with some voting in favour, some against and some abstaining. Green Party Councillors and the majority of Labour Councillors voted for the Local Plan so it had a majority and was passed. It will now be submitted to the Government’s Planning Inspector for approval. If approved, it will then regulate future planning applications.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group on Sheffield City Council said,\n“Without an up-to-date Local Plan, property developers can get away with sub-standard planning applications. The Local Plan may not be perfect but it would have been completely irresponsible for us to vote against it after so much cross-party work has been done on it. National Planning rules mean that Councils without Local Plans are less able to control where development does or does not take place. It effectively makes all land fair play for rapacious property developers and therefore disadvantages socially-conscious businesses.\n“It is frankly hard to believe that councillors would vote against the Local Plan when they had – quite rightly – criticised the previous Labour administration for the many years of delay that allowed far too many low-quality planning applications through.\n“If there is a local green space in your area that people use for exercise, walking the dog, to enjoy nature or for children to play in, then the Liberal Democrats’ votes put that at risk. . This sort of self indulgent posturing in pursuit of political gain is not the act of responsible local politicians who have a duty to balance the legitimate needs of the whole community.”\nThe Final Vote was 37 Councillors for the Local Plan, 17 against and 20 abstentions.\nCllr Johnson commenting on the result said,\n“Labour was clearly split on the Local Plan, with several Councillors saying they were defying their Party whip. Though many Liberal Democrats spoke against the plan some clearly and quietly abstained, showing they were also split. Greens were clear that without a Local Plan we would be putting developers in the driving seat, our green spaces under threat and losing local control over the planning process.”",

Both Labour and Green groups are committed to working in an open, inclusive and democratic way and ensuring the council has stability and effective leadership.\nInitial discussions were held to form a joint administration included all Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat Groups. However, the Liberal Democrats declined to join the Executive. If they were to reconsider this decision, both parties have made it clear the door remains open for the Lib Dems to join the new collaborative working in the council.\nAs part of the co-operation agreement, the nomination for Terry Fox as Leader and Julie Grocutt as Deputy Leader of the Council will be supported by both parties and the Council’s Executive will be made up of 10 members. This will be politically proportionate, with seven Labour members and three Green members.\nTo support result of the Sheffield governance referendum – a new politically proportionate transition committee model will be introduced, piloting a new way of working in the council to facilitate the transition to the committee system.\nIn order to support Sheffield’s recovery and renewal following the impact of the global pandemic, the co-operative administration set out a number of first-year steps and has committed to:\n- Implementing the new Local Area Committees, giving power back to Sheffield’s communities, devolving services to local areas, and giving local people a real say over decisions that affect their communities. They will seek to revolutionise how residents can influence the decisions that matter to them.\n- Introducing a new approach to community safety, with additional safer neighbourhood wardens\n- Providing additional investment in young people\n- Supporting the renewal of Sheffield’s district centres, right across the city\n- Implementing the recommendations set out in the Arup report to create a pathway to deliver the shared ambition for net zero\n- Appointing an independent person to conduct a local inquiry into the management of the street trees dispute. Details are yet to be confirmed but this work is expected to launch in the autumn, with the aim of reflecting on and understanding what unfolded, to learn any lessons, and to support Sheffield to move forward confidently.\nCouncillor Terry Fox, Leader of the Labour Group, said:\n“We are delighted to announce this agreement today which represents a new era of politics in our city. Our priority is to put Sheffield first and party politics aside.\n“We have worked together to develop this new way of working, with parties coming together and we are committed to making this succeed for the people of Sheffield. Now is a crucial time for Sheffield as we come out of the pandemic and it is more important than ever that we can provide the leadership the city needs.\n“We had hoped to make this a triangular arrangement, but unfortunately the Lib Dems didn’t want that, but the door is always open.\n“I know that many people thought that this sort of agreement would not be possible and parties wouldn’t be able to work together. I would like to thank the Greens for the way in which they have conducted the negotiations. I look forward to working with them in this partnership.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group, said:\n“This heralds a new way of working. For the first time, more than one party is represented in the council leadership.\n“I am delighted to take part in delivering what the people of Sheffield have voted for in the referendum – a vote for change. That change means dialogue with other parties, cross-party commitments to provide leadership and a commitment to respect each other. I am pleased that the last week has proved that our two parties can reach consensus on many issues.\n“We will put meaningful action to address the climate emergency at the heart of what we do and look forward to a new period of co-operation.”\nCllr Alison Teal, said:\n“I don’t underestimate the personal, as well as political, challenge of working with the Labour group, considering my history in opposition. However, we are facing unprecedented circumstances which demand new ways of working. We must co-operate with other parties in the best interests of residents, the city, and the environment. I am pleased to be a part of this, and I am optimistic for this new co-operative Cabinet.”\nCouncillor Julie Grocutt, said:\n“This agreement represents a new partnership for the city that will put Sheffield first and lead on the city’s recovery as we come out of the pandemic.\n“The real work starts now as we look to give power back to our communities through the implementation of Local Area Committees, to put more safer neighbourhood wardens on our streets, to invest in our young people and to support the renewal of our district centres, as well as crucially delivering our shared ambition for Sheffield to reach net zero.”\nThe new Labour & Green Co-operation Agreement is here.\nThe membership of the new Cabinet is below:\n| Portfolio | Executive Member |\n| Leader | Terry Fox |\n| Deputy Leader | Julie Grocutt |\n| Finance | Cate McDonald |\n| Housing, Roads & Waste Management | Paul Wood |\n| Sustainable neighbourhoods, wellbeing, parks and leisure | Alison Teal |\n| Climate change, environment and transport | Douglas Johnson |\n| Inclusive economy, jobs and skills | Paul Turpin |\n| City Futures, Development, Culture, Regeneration | Mazher Iqbal |\n| Education, Children and Families | Jayne Dunn |\n| Health & Social Care | George Lindars-Hammond |",

As the result of a thorough process, Sir Mark Lowcock was appointed as the Independent Chair of the Inquiry.\nSir Mark is a former Permanent Secretary and United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.\nCommenting on the report, Cllr Douglas Johnson said.\n“I very much welcome the publication of this report into a “dark episode” in Sheffield’s history. Naturally, we will take time to read the report more carefully over the next few days and see how it meets the aims of not only telling a true story of what happened but to seek understanding of why everyone involved acted the way they did.”\n“It is clear that the lack of openness and honesty not only did damage to the people of Sheffield and the natural environment but was also self-defeating for those in the Council at that time who were seeking to push through their programme despite all the opposition. We fully agree with the Inquiry’s assessment that what the campaigners saw as the Council’s ‘irrational, unreasonable, deceitful, dishonest, bullying and intimidating behaviour is what generated the determination, persistence, creativity and ingenuity that the campaigners displayed. The Council’s behaviour, in other words, was the fuel that drove the protests.’”\n“However, I also welcome the acknowledgement that the council ‘failed … to understand the value people attached to trees.’ Our natural world is clearly important to Sheffield citizens of all ages.”\nCllr Paul Turpin was heavily involved in the street tree campaigns. He said,\n“This is an emotive and powerful report of what happened when the council decided to go to war with the citizens of Sheffield. Feeding division and fueling a conflict that has left many people hurt and traumatised.\n“It brings back the memory of tears streaming down my face as I contacted police while Amey security guards were assaulting members of the public. The sound of their screams as these men dragged those brave women forcefully from under the trees on Meersbrook Park Road will live with me forever.\n“I’m glad that the council is now being open and honest about their role, about the bad leadership and many human errors that occurred. It is important that Sir Mark acknowledged the anxiety, stress, injuries and wider physical and mental health problems caused to many people in Sheffield.”\nThe Independent Inquiry into the Street Trees Dispute final report is at:\nhttps://www.sheffield.gov.uk/your-city-council/independent-inquiry-into-street-trees-dispute\nThe written statement of Cllr Douglas Johnson to the Street Tree Inquiry can be found at:\nFirst street tree inquiry hearings broadcast",

The motion committed to reporting back within 6 months, “pledging to make plans to bring forward the Council’s existing target to be a zero carbon city from 2050 to 2030 at the latest.”\nNearly 1 year later, there is no sign of any significant action or work within the council administration to bring forward credible plans for action. With another “once a century” flooding disaster in South Yorkshire last November and daily climate-related events around the world, we’re now living in this crisis. This new decade is make or break.\nGreta Thunberg summed up our situation well at the recent climate talks: “The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR.” That’s the Tory government approach, which we all must push back hard against with leadership from Sheffield City Council.

The six biggest UK supermarkets were given £1.9 billion business rate relief in March but have continued trading throughout – many will have 24 hour opening in the run up to Christmas.\nIt’s a different world for small independents. In Tier 3, many reopened businesses have just 23 trading days to turn their year around. Hospitality businesses remain closed during the Christmas party season. This really is a “use us or lose us” situation – many businesses could go under in the difficult post-Christmas trading period.\nThere’s a lot at stake here. I walk to the small shopping parade near me in Upperthorpe often seeing friends and neighbours and chatting with shop owners. It’s close to the library and swimming pool at the Zest Centre and it’s our local community. It’s fragile and very reliant on Upperthorpe Post Office and Zest to bring people to the area.\nWithout local shopping parades, people will have few choices other than driving to big supermarkets and creating roads full of vans delivering Amazon orders. That will mean a downward spiral in local communities’ vitality and cohesion.\nGreens have been offering posters to shops to display “Spending money in the local economy helps us all survive the Covid-19 crisis”. Please make a conscious effort to support your local Sheffield businesses. Many have now adapted to trade online or offer order and collect. Pubs, cafes and restaurants can still offer takeaway or delivery under Tier 3.\nI encourage everyone to shop local to protect shops and businesses – and your local communities.\nBernard Little\nWalkley ward Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

All you had to say was that the demonstrators briefly held up traffic as they crossed the road. All demonstrations that have ever taken place in Sheffield have held up the traffic! This was not the story!\nYou could have mentioned how an amazing coalition of groups came together to urge the Government to take emergency action on climate justice. Trade Unions, environmental groups, religious groups, school strikers, health workers, anti-poverty groups, solidarity groups, cyclists and political parties all united in what is now by far the most urgent campaign for survival on planet Earth.\nYou could have mentioned the amazing creativity: the energy and joy of the samba band, the humour of some of the banners (my favourite was “How many cops does it take to arrest climate change?”) the song written especially for the occasion, the street band entertaining the crowds.\nYou could have mentioned some of the accounts of how climate chaos is already killing people all over the world, but especially in the global south. For instance, the heart-wrenching story of the mother who witnessed her 3 children washed away in the floods in Pakistan or those currently facing starvation due to the drought in the horn of Africa.\nYou could have mentioned how corporations are continuing to destroy our natural world, such as the first-hand account from the Democratic Republic of Congo where tropical forests are threatened so that the oil and mineral reserves can be exploited.\nYou could have mentioned the mother with her 8-year son who explained to the crowd how terrified she was of the future. The 8 years her son has lived have been the hottest 8 years on record. She said we all have a responsibility to act and must all get involved with groups working to bring solutions.\nThis march was Sheffield’s response to some of the most urgent issues of our time, and coverage of it should reflect this. Videos of the march and speeches are on my blog, tellthetruthsheffield.org.\nGraham Wroe\nSheffield Green Party",

The film captures the amazing spirit of the tree campaigners who had no choice but to take radical action. They put their bodies on the line risking huge fines and even imprisonment to prevent the needless destruction of our street trees. They stood up to the bullying tactics of the Council who were determined to meet the target of cutting down 17500 trees, despite the huge reputational damage this was doing to our city.\nHow wonderful it is that the Council have now moved on from the dark days of dawn raids to destroy our trees. We now have an excellent Tree Strategy that ensures our urban forest is managed sustainably. It has been heartening to see new street trees planted in Nether Edge recently, paid for by crowdfunding from local residents. Thanks to the co-operative agreement between the Green and Labour Parties on the Council an inquiry will soon begin under the chairmanship of Sir Mark Lowcock. Hopefully, this will reveal the truths behind the dispute and lead to some reconciliation.\nIf we are going to protect humanity from the increasing threat of global heating we can learn much from the tactics used by the protestors in the film. Non-violent direct action has once again proved to be successful. These are the tactics that will be necessary to force corporations and governments to act now to reduce our carbon emissions. Do go and watch the film for a masterclass in non-violent direct action. Catch it at the Showroom from April 1st.",

Passengers have had no information at the bus stops from Travel South Yorkshire more than a week after massive changes took place on October 2nd.\nEcclesall Green Party candidate Peter Gilbert who updated around 50 bus stops said,\n“There was nothing at all to alert people to the changed 6 or cancelled 83 services. I contacted Travel South Yorkshire to complain and have called on South Yorkshire Mayoral Combined Authority to hold them to account. They claimed they hadn’t got the resources, so I decided to do their job for them.”\nWhile posting up the new timetables to inform the community Peter met 81-year-old Johanna Lattimer of High Storrs Drive. She said,\n“The thing that I find so bad is that they didn’t let us know. It was only sort of rumour. I was standing here waiting for the bus to go to the theatre the other week and a lady came past and she said, ‘you know they’ve taken the bus off don’t you?’ And I said, no I didn’t know. So I didn’t know it was being taken off nor did I know whether we were going to have a bus at all. And there are a lot of people in this area much older and less able than I am that are reliant on the bus even to get down the road to the shops.”\nPeter Gilbert continues,\n“It’s one thing for the bus companies to reduce our vital services, but so much distress could be prevented if Travel South Yorkshire put updates at affected bus stops. The private bus companies and Travel South Yorkshire are failing passengers.”\nHillsborough Green Party activist Eamonn Ward, who has also been posting timetables said,\n“The vital 52A is no longer running past Hillsborough Interchange to Wisewood and Loxley. It has been replaced by the inferior 31 but you would have no idea looking at unchanged information at bus stops. The Wisewood Estate now has no bus service on Sundays and no direct service to Hallamshire Hospital. It means people cannot get to work and inevitable isolation for older people.”\nCouncillor Christine Gilligan, deputy chair of the Transport, Regeneration and Climate Policy Committee said:\n“The Green Party campaigns to bring public transport back under public control with proper government funding to protect routes and services. But local leaders at the Mayoral Combined Authority also need to stop prioritising private car use over public transport and build a far more ambitious aim for South Yorkshire’s public transport network. Sheffield Green Party have a vision for transport in Sheffield and South Yorkshire called Get Sheffield Moving.

I hope members of STAG recognise a long term commitment by Sheffield Green Party in support of the preservation of healthy street trees. Many of those who put in the hours on the streets to protect trees are Green Party members. When there has been a need, a number of Green Party members have been prepared to take whatever peaceful action is required. That includes a number who have been arrested including Cllr Alison Teal.\nThe year since tree felling was paused has seen some excellent investigative journalism from The Yorkshire Post to make public the unacceptable actions of the council, Amey and the police. We are also now seeing that affordable engineering solutions are available for the majority of threatened street trees. This all underlines what everyone in the campaign has known throughout – you have right on your side.\nAlthough actions have taken a turn towards the positive in the past year there has been no apology from the council for their orchestrated actions in response to your campaign. With no agreed solutions there is a need for continued vigilance which I know STAG members recognise as they continue their on-street work to monitor Amey’s actions.\nThere has been no real change in the democratic deficit in the city. Just 9 members of the Cabinet continue to make all the decisions and they appear unwilling to engage meaningfully with opposition councillors, community groups and the general public. That’s why The People’s Petition is so important and we would encourage all STAG members to sign it. The ending of PFI has been long overdue but those contracts have done so much damage and cost the taxpayer so much money for massive private profit. That damage will continue for many years to come until those contracts expire – Sheffield will be paying for the Amey contract until 2057.\nStreet trees bring us visual pleasure and are also so important as the green lungs in our local communities. We are in a climate emergency and cities must not be just be big slabs of concrete. Green candidates pledge continued support for the STAG campaign and the preservation of healthy street trees.\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

councillors have set out their proposals to amend the council budget, which will be debated and voted on at the council meeting on 3rd March.\nThe full text of the amendment is below:\nAmendment to be moved by Councillor Douglas Johnson, seconded by Councillor Alison Teal\nRESOLVED: That this Council:-\n- recalls the Director of Public Health’s briefing to this council, at the March 2020 budget-setting meeting, where it was advised that coronavirus was a developing situation and changing rapidly but there were no cases in Sheffield;\n- notes how the global and local situation changed so dramatically so soon after that, in ways that were then unimaginable; and believes that the global pandemic has changed all of our lives for ever;\n- reminds itself of another global issue with local impacts, namely climate change, and notes the need to address it as the emergency it is;\n- believes that central Government has failed to manage the coronavirus pandemic well and that too many premature deaths have resulted from inadequate and ineffective testing and tracing at a national level;\n- therefore has little confidence that central government will rise to the challenge of tackling climate change;\n- believes it is therefore vital for councils to take a lead on acting locally; and that cities, in particular, are uniquely placed to respond to climate change;\n- notes the shifting burden of local government funding from central government (through national redistribution of wealth) to greater taxation on Sheffield residents;\n- acknowledges the very substantial need for care of older and disabled people and in children’s services and that, even passing on extra costs through council tax increases, the sum raised is still wholly inadequate to meet the cost of social care;\n- nevertheless, supports the necessary increase in council tax rates, whilst remembering the need to protect the poorest households;\n- notes, however, that long-term, outsourced contracts with big private businesses have not taken an equivalent share of the cuts to council services over the last ten years; and that long-term costs of finance stretch into Sheffield’s future until 2057;\n- believes that Elected Members in Sheffield, however difficult the crisis we face, have a responsibility to do the best we can for the people of Sheffield, prioritising the available resources to protect communities and the most vulnerable and working towards a more equitable and resilient city;\n- thanks staff in the Council, voluntary and private sectors for the way they have responded to austerity, worked through the pandemic and made sacrifices;\n- welcomes the progress now being made on issues in previous amendments submitted by the Green Group, including:-\n- webcasting of council meetings;\n- mental health resilience work in schools;\n- steps towards re-opening the Don Valley Railway;\n- supporting the least well-off with council tax bills;\n- funding to prepare brownfield sites for development, in order to save greenfield locations;\n- The recruitment of safer neighbourhoods co-ordinators with a focus on young people;\n- Bolstering the work of the private sector housing team to take enforcement action on substandard rented housing in the private sector;\n- Putting greater resources into working in local areas\n- Recognising climate change as a priority for the housing service\n- Commitment not to hold any direct investments in fossil fuels or companies involved in tax evasion or grave misconduct\n- More resources into cycling and walking infrastructure\n- A scheme to provide e-cargo bikes\n- Electric vehicles charging points in and around the city centre\n- believes that the city’s resilience will be tested by the climate crisis and is therefore disappointed that, despite declaring a “climate emergency” in 2019, no substantial proposals appear in the Administration’s revenue budget to address the climate emergency;\n- will therefore provide funding to recruit an entire team of environmental sustainability officers to address the need for warmer homes; locally-owned, clean energy production, such as solar farms; increased walking, cycling and public transport; and to support businesses and householders to make carbon-reducing changes in response to the climate emergency;\n- will support this with funds specifically to investigate a large-scale solar farm;\n- will support this further by the creation of a Carbon Reduction Investment Fund of £3 million, setting aside funds to complete new sustainability projects that reduce carbon consumption in order to avoid unnecessary delay in achieving a 2030 net carbon zero targets;\n- regrets the lost opportunity of jobs in the renewable energy industry and thousands of cheaper energy bills for council tenants when proposed by Green Councillors in 2014;\n- will, however, still promote energy efficiency schemes in maintained schools by using £500,000 of unallocated Community Infrastructure Levy receipts;\n- will go further and set aside £1 million of unallocated New Homes Bonus to introduce solar panels on council housing, to generate energy and to reduce tenants’ bills;\n- will build climate resilience into the city’s housing stock by ensuring that all funding for new-build council housing is only used for housing designed at high standards of thermal efficiency, so that future tenants do not risk fuel poverty;\n- will earmark £1 million for walking and cycling, offering people riding bikes the protection of segregated cycle lanes and secure bike storage, thereby increasing the numbers of Sheffield citizens cycling to work and contributing towards improved physical and mental health and better air quality;\n- will recognise the failure to build this city’s cycling infrastructure and will therefore appoint a cycling officer to promote the ability of Sheffield residents to choose this form of transport;\n- welcomes the take-up of the e-cargo bikes promoted in the Green Group’s 2020 budget proposals; and will develop this idea further through working up ideas to create a zero-emission last-mile distribution hub, to allow the Council, businesses and organisations to deliver goods around the city in a cleaner, quieter, more sustainable way;\n- will ensure that all future Local Transport Plan spending is used only on sustainable modes of transport that do not have any adverse impact on air quality;\n- in line with this principle, will encourage use of public transport by providing free bus and tram travel on the six Sundays before Christmas, in place of the current subsidy for free car parking in the city centre;\n- will take steps to reduce the demand for individual car ownership by investing in a new scheme to develop car-sharing in line with the “liftshare” scheme;\n- believes the public is becoming more aware and concerned at the dangers of illegal levels of air pollution and will therefore invest in public-facing visual displays on the city’s air quality monitoring stations, to ensure the public can see and monitor the measure of air pollution affecting them in real time;\n- will stop reimbursing car-parking claims for Elected Members who do not have a blue badge;\n- will tackle dangerous and irresponsible parking, by creating 6 new jobs for parking enforcement officers, to be provided with e-bikes instead of patrol cars, where possible;\n- will develop proposals to introduce a workplace parking levy for larger employers, in order to generate additional long-term revenue to invest in the city’s public transport, whilst improving air quality and encouraging more active forms of travel to work;\n- will reduce the price of residents’ parking permits to 2010 levels and dissuade commuters from driving into the city centre by increasing on-street parking by 40p, meaning that people living in some of the most congested and polluted areas of the city are not subsidising other transport services;\n- will re-introduce the FreeBee bus service in the city centre, operating every 10 minutes, 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, by investing in 3 new electric buses owned directly by the local authority;\n- will take steps to increase the potential for more affordable housing in the city by funding a pilot project of a small number of energy-efficient “container homes”, such as those already being pioneered at Heeley City Farm;\n- will create an additional officer post to bring empty homes back into use, in order to tackle the blight and waste of empty houses and increase housing supply with far less energy consumption than new buildings;\n- will reduce the cost to low-income households for bulky waste collections, reversing the Administration’s previous cut imposed on the poorest households and reducing fly-tipping and the burden on volunteer litter-pickers;\n- notes the growing demand for food waste collections and better recycling and will therefore examine a wider recycling offer, including food waste and further plastics collection, as well as repair and reuse models;\n- recognises the cultural and economic importance of the city’s heritage and will therefore expand skills in the Planning Service with funding for a dedicated heritage officer;\n- asserts that in a properly regulated planning system, it is essential that developers comply with planning conditions and will therefore fund an additional planning enforcement officer to maintain high standards for the benefit of the public;\n- will maximise the expertise of our planning officers and bring fees for pre-application planning advice for larger property developers into line with other major cities;\n- will improve transparency by separately publishing the accounts of the licensing service, which are still not made available, despite statements to the contrary by the Leader of the council;\n- will cut political spin from the Town Hall and will remove the posts of Group Policy Officers from the Council payroll, requiring politicians to do their own research and press work;\n- will support the voluntary sector with a substantial increase of £142,000 for anti-poverty work in advice centres, which was previously cut by this Administration, thus protecting jobs and helping people facing the real difficulties of universal credit and other issues arising from the Covid pandemic;\n- and, recognising the number of people in serious financial hardship, will increase the council tax hardship fund to £2 million, to protect the poorest families in the city;\n- will recognise the expertise of the voluntary sector in obtaining external funding by providing money for a post in a voluntary sector organisation to assist the council in monitoring and applying for funding from central government and elsewhere, thus maximising future revenue to the city;\n- recognises the particular difficulties faced by young people leaving care setting up their own homes for the first time and will therefore set aside funds to meet council tax bills paid until the age of 25;\n- recognises the ongoing value of the city’s library service and rewards the hard work of volunteers who have supported their local branch libraries by providing funding to ensure a paid, professional librarian in every branch library;\n- will pilot the development of a “Library of Things” in a staffed library to reduce individual consumption of occasionally-used household items;\n- will continue funding for music lessons for children from low-income households, who experience significant barriers to culture and learning;\n- notes that Green councillors first proposed the council adopt a Living Wage in 2008 to address low pay and will now tackle the principle of income inequality head-on by reducing the pay of senior officers on salaries over £50,000 a year, narrowing the gap between the highest and lowest paid in the Council to within a 10:1 ratio;\n- will further reduce eight posts in the HR function to protect frontline services;\n- notes that the proposals in this amendment will provide over £1 million in every future year for social care;\n- will promote health, activity and fun by funding outdoor gym equipment in the city’s parks and developing the network of park runs throughout the whole city, working alongside community organisations;\n- will commemorate the very origins of a municipal authority for public health by providing the public with clean, fresh water through the provision of new drinking fountains in major parks, thereby reducing waste and litter from single-use disposable plastics;\n- will also support community environmental activism through Friends of Parks groups;\n- recognises the benefits of community growing schemes and will therefore fund initial work on urban food production;\n- remembering that parks are for people, not cars, will support these further improvements in the city’s parks by increasing car parking charges for those who choose to drive to them;\n- will also invest in planting trees bearing edible fruit in open spaces and parks, to be decided and distributed fairly on a Ward basis;\n- will promote the city’s economic opportunity of specialist tourism by engaging two part-time ecologists to market and lead specialist nature tours on Sheffield’s nearby and unique moorland, thereby generating further income for the Council and for the city’s economy;\n- will fund an extra four Police Community Safety Officers (PCSOs);\n- will support the many voluntary, business and public sector agencies trying to address homelessness, substance misuse, anti-social behaviour and aggressive begging in the city centre, by providing funds for a new worker under the Help Us Help umbrella;\n- will put further resource into prevention work by supporting an additional substance misuse worker;\n- will extend the contracts of the business advisers to the end of 2021 to support local businesses with recovery from lockdown and the coronavirus pandemic;\n- notes that these proposals will result in over 50 new jobs, in addition to the increased employment from capital investment;\n- recognises the hard work of Sheffield citizens who have highlighted the economic risks attached to fossil fuels and the need for Sheffield City Council to do business ethically, and welcomes the inclusion, in its Treasury Management Strategy, of commitments not to hold any direct investments in fossil fuels or companies involved in tax evasion or grave misconduct;\n- approves the updating of the statutory Regulation 123 list to include the spending of unallocated Community Infrastructure Levy within the limits set out above;\n- therefore requests the Executive Director, Resources, to implement the City Council’s Revenue Budget and Capital Programme 2021/22 in accordance with the details set out in the reports on the Revenue Budget and Capital Programme now submitted, but with the following amendments:-\nRevenue budget spending proposals:\n| 2021/22 | |\n| Spending proposals | (£’000) |\n| Recruitment of a 6 person sustainability team (1xG10, 4xG8 and 1xG5 – 9

And that’s just from Julie! What the hell is going in the SCC?\nWhen I started thinking about what to say today, I was foxed. I, we, have said it all, so many times. The contract we pay for but can’t see.\nThe Thatcherite ways of Sheffield Labour.\nThe millions of pounds spent on an Independent Tree Panel to then be ignored.\nThe randomness of how trees are listed for the chop.\nThe policing. The opacity. The attacks on democracy.\nThe stonewalls, not just the ones geckos like!\nThe lies, the spin, the abuse from our elected representatives and council officers!\nThe waste, the ignorance.\nIn our house, and I’m sure many of yours, there have been tears shed. Tears of anger and tears of sorrow. They have moved more than rocket fuel could though.\nThose tears; that anger has motivated people. It has politicised people. It has radicalised people! IT has stopped Amey in its tracks.\nWe said no and we meant no!\nBut some tears were tears of joy.\nJoy at seeing a tree being saved.\nJoy at small things, like seeing a tree on your street have the pavement repaired around it.\nJoy as 4pm came and we slow walked Acorn home, serenading them with music so beautiful I think even Julie Dore would be moved.\nJoy at the new relationships we have made. New friends. Neighbours who we’ve never spoken to, or maybe even seen before.\nNew stories. New bonds. Trust. Sharing food and drink. Sharing comfort, concern, hugs. Giving and receiving support.\nThe inspirational, damned determination of Maureen! The selfless acts of the various bunnies, squirrels, meerkats and geckos.\nThere have been other silver linings too.\nThe new awareness Sheffield has about how the council works. Who the council is and what it does.\nThe waking of sleeping giants. If they wanted it easy, if they thought we would be a pushover, they were wrong. Very wrong.\nThe collective brilliance of this group is immense. Not just the professors, the doctors, the senior managers, the legal experts, the tree experts, the Freedom Of Information experts, the photographers, the filmers, the musicians, the artists, the anarchists, the climbers.\nAlso the not-on-my-bloody-watchers! The singers, the thinkers, the worriers, the jokers. The posters, the watchers, the standers, the questioners, the transcribers, the printers, the I’ll-do-it-for-yers. And of course, the moderators.\nI would like nothing more than this group, armed as it is, with wit, savvy, intellect and passion to go on and change this city. Change this country. WE SAID NO AND WE MEANT IT AND WE AREN’T GOING TO CHANGE OUR MINDS! And this is what we did, and this is how to win.\nThe world is watching. Whatever happens today, and I have my hopes. Whatever happens, we go on, and we keep going on.

I was elected as a councillor for the Hillsborough ward in May 2020 and re-elected in May 2024.\nI was a university lecturer researching sustainability, and responsible business practice before I became a councillor and was active in several local and citywide voluntary groups, including Sheffield Renewables, an organisation aiming to provide renewable energy for community buildings.\nSheffield is a great place to live but I’m aware that there are many issues in Brightside & Hillsborough constituency that need improvements.\nI’m concerned about increasing traffic which pollutes the air we breathe, creates congestion and makes our streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. Linked to this is the lack of affordable public transport in Sheffield. A publicly funded, reliable bus service would provide a sustainable alternative to car use.\nI fully support public control of our public services such as the NHS. These are the backbone of society and have the potential to improve the lives of all residents. I also want to see Increases in social housing that will enable more people to live with dignity in housing that meets their needs.\nIf elected, I will seek to address the needs of local residents and contribute to constituency improvements. But I am also keenly aware of the Climate Crisis and the Biodiversity Crisis and want to make sure that the importance of the natural environment and climate change are factored into every decision. I joined the Green Party because I was concerned about the destruction of our natural environment and the loss of biodiversity in the UK and I am keen to contribute to a more sustainable life for us, our children and future generations.\nTo help Tina’s campaign please donate to the Crowdfunder, join the Green Party and Get Involved.\nTo contact Tina’s team email sheffield.brightside.hillsborough@votegreen.uk",

Public services are on their knees. Front-line workers are desperate to bring vital services to the people who need it the most. I see this so much in my role as Chair of the council’s Adult Health and Social Care Committee.\nIn 2022, Sheffield City Council passed a Labour motion calling on the government to “provide sufficient financial support for local authorities to ensure that people in Sheffield get the support they need through this ongoing crisis.”\nNow Labour has published its manifesto. And it’s shocking to see there is not a penny more for local council services. The best that Keir Starmer’s party has to offer is a “multi-year” settlement … but no extra cash.\nBy contrast, Green MPs in Parliament will push for £5 billion a year in extra funding for local councils.\nTo see the Labour Party abandon local government is not just disappointing. It is damaging to everyone who uses council services, whether that means emptying bins or protecting children from harm. And it is deeply offensive to everyone working on the front line of public services.\nCllr Angela Argenzio\nGreen Party candidate for Sheffield Central\nSee Angela’s campaign page here\nFind out all about the General Election Campaign here.",

In doing so, we showed we can take on responsibility for difficult decisions and not shy away from them.\nWe were therefore delighted to increase our vote share on last year, with over 27,000 people in Sheffield voting for a Green local councillor. We were the only party to increase their number of seats on the council.\nWe are also delighted that so many Sheffield residents put their faith in Bex Whyman, the Greens’ candidate for Mayor of South Yorkshire, who achieved second place amongst Sheffield voters.\nWe will now use this position to discuss with the other political groups how the council will be run over the next year. We look forward to working under the new, modern committee system, where we will stand up for the needs of all residents, particularly those most disadvantaged by the cost of living crisis, the effect of the climate and nature emergencies and air pollution..\nWe are grateful to the people of Sheffield for supporting our quest for Sheffield to be a better place to live, work and play.\nCllr Douglas Johnson, Sheffield Green Party\nSheffield Green Party stood 28 candidates for the Council elections on 5th May 2022, and the Green Party also had a candidate for the South Yorkshire Mayoral election.

There is a lack of provision and culturally appropriate services to support families in the cost of living crisis. We’re facing a climate crisis that is significantly impacting our quality of life and environment at alarming rates – and we need to do something now.\nI’ve had the privilege of working in the Nether Edge and Sharrow area and across Sheffield for over 15 years focusing on addressing social inequity through arts and cultural engagement via a small business catering to my city.\nI’ve worked with people of all ages, and I’ve heard the frustrations and difficulties that many people in our community are facing. I’m standing for election because we need to do something very different, and to give the community hope that politics can work when done properly and through a lens of equity.\nI am dedicated to ensuring that residents are represented, seen, and heard. I want to co-create equitable opportunities for marginalised groups, particularly children and young people from ethnic minority backgrounds and the wider community – “Every Nation, Every Race, Growing our Youth”.\nIt’s important that the face and body of politics represent the communities it serves. Voting Green to support me in my campaign to become a councillor for the area is to choose to do something different. It’s choosing to support our children and young people, our elderly, the most neglected and marginalised, with action for a greener, cleaner environment.\nPlease contact me if you have any enquiries about my candidacy or if you would like to display a poster in support of my campaign.\nIf you would like to display a poster or help with the campaign please contact Marieanne Elliot marieanne.elliot@sheffieldgreenparty.org.uk\nSheffield Council agrees budget in first budget meeting since committee system.",

We’re making our oceans an ever-thicker plastic soup, contaminating our drinking water and food, and threatening our own and ecosystems’ health with this pernicious material.\n“Just 15% of plastic is recycled, but recycling, while useful as an intermediate step, isn’t the answer. We need to stop making and using all unnecessary single-use plastics.\n“We’re now producing more than 300 million tonnes a year, roughly equal to the weight of human beings on this Earth. We’ve created a plastic planet and we can’t afford to stuff even more of this dangerous material into it.\n“It shouldn’t be up to individuals to go to extraordinary efforts to avoid plastics. We need to remove them from our distribution systems.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

We have achieved a remarkable degree of agreement. Necessity has truly been the mother of consensus rather than invention. I would like to thank colleagues from all party groups who have approached this process with a sense of responsibility and goodwill.\nThe things Greens propose today are the sort of things that we are going to all need to do in the future, if we are to achieve a society that is sustainable both ecologically and economically. It is not just the innovation of technology that will be needed to take us forward but the innovation of ideas. Being bold, learning from others and being the pioneers when we need to be. This will be necessary if we are going to face up to the challenges that the coming years will bring.\nThe Green Party amendment seeks to start the Council on a path to transform itself and the city we serve. Our proposal to establish a wholly owned Council company providing households with the services they often can’t get but really need is not our own. It is based on a successful model operated by Oxford City Council (1). We would want to use that model but adapt it to the priorities we have in Sheffield. So providing services like gardening, heating maintenance and replacement, installation of insulation and retrofitting of homes, provision of solar panels. This will not only enable us to generate income for the Council but help us begin the path of helping people save money on their fuel bills and decarbonise the city, while providing a revenue stream for the Council.\nI am acutely aware of the national crisis in the care sector, poor wages and working conditions and the difficulties in recruitment and retention of staff. This will not be solved overnight but we want to make an important start. That is why we are calling for the development of Community Care Cooperatives which removes the profit motive, properly rewards staff with at least the living wage and provides care at a community level where staff and those needing care are all in the same place. This has been successful in Italy where there are 15,000 social cooperatives that care for 7.2 million Italians (12% of the population) and employ 480,000 people (2). In the UK there are examples of Community Care Coops but it is a model that needs support and development to get off the ground. That is what we are proposing to pioneer here in Sheffield.\nRising prices are causing misery to millions and we need to address this by reducing the need for energy by improving homes and generating more of our energy locally. We are proposing to help people to release the capital they have locked up in their homes to enable them to install solar panels with no upfront costs. This will enable them to get the benefit of energy savings immediately. Once the financial model is established we will use it to help people to improve the energy efficiency of their homes through a deep retrofit with high energy efficiency and heat recovery ventilation standards.\nWe currently pay £40,000 a year to an energy company to say our electricity is from green sources. Those ‘green’ sources could include nuclear or biomass, both of which come with their own problems and dubious credentials. We want to use that money to help us generate more renewable energy in Sheffield to help us reduce the energy bills, not pay for a badge which brings us no benefit. That is why we want to use those funds to train the next generation of renewable energy engineers working here in Sheffield. They could well be the same people who would work on the construction of the large solar farms we propose on places like local park and ride schemes. Generating energy while providing shade and power to electric vehicles. Or they could be installing solar panels or other renewable technologies on schools giving young people a practical demonstration of the power of green ideas, while saving the school money at a time of stretched school budgets.\nNew technologies offer real promise and that is why we are asking for a significant trial of graphene heating for homes (3). Sometimes referred to as ‘electric wallpaper’ this form of heating operates on a wider surface area, usually a ceiling, and so is able to operate effectively at a lower temperature. Coupled with solar panels and battery technology there is the real prospect that homes could be heated both affordably and with low emissions. We want Sheffield to be at the forefront of this revolution.\nWe will make it easier for people to get about in Sheffield. This is why we want more parking enforcement to ensure our pavements are free of cars blocking the way for pedestrians, people in wheelchairs and parents with pushchairs. Children need to be able to get to school safely and we will be supporting the further development of the School Streets initiative. We want cyclists to know that their bikes will have secure parking so we will be investing in secure cycle storage in residential areas. We will make it easier and cheaper for people to get into the City Centre and to help that we are proposing free tram and bus travel on the 4 weekends leading up to Christmas. Public Transport needs to be the cheapest option as well as the low carbon option. All these initiatives and more could be supported if the Council adopted an Employers Workplace Parking Levy (4). In Nottingham over £9 million/year is generated that helps support public transport, active travel initiatives and electric vehicle charging. This frees up Council funding to enable the support of other hard pressed services such as Adult Health and Social Care for instance.\nWe are clear that local priorities are best addressed closest to the communities that Councillors serve. That is why we are calling for the ward pots to be increased to allow better targeting of funding to address the issues that people care about where they live. We also need to ensure that we help people in the direst need the most. This is why we have championed the increase in hardship funding and a further £200,000 for the Advice Services that people rely on.\nWe work best as a Council when we work together. This is our first year using the committee system in the context of No Overall Control. We have shown that while having different political philosophies that we can come together, in the hardest of times, for the benefit of the city.\nPlease support our amendment\nReferences\n(1) About Oxford Direct Services https://www.odsgroup.co.uk/About-ODS\n(2) Italian social cooperatives celebrate their 30th anniversary https://cecop.coop/works/italian-social-cooperatives-celebrate-their-30th-anniversary\n(3) Is new ‘electric wallpaper’ the green future of heating? https://www.aroundealing.com/news/new-electric-heating/\n(4) Nottinghams Employers Workplace Parking Levy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NsMWUEsO4w",

We believe that owing to the siting, height, and bulk of the proposed installations, these would form overly conspicuous and obtrusive features that would have a significant adverse effect on visual amenity and cause material harm to the character and appearance of each area.\n“The proposed displays will cause increasing conflict with pedestrian and/or cycle traffic as the city centre increases its footfall, especially in the context of the proposed increase in the city centre population in the next 15 years. Obstacles in footways and cycleways have recently been refused by the Council as the harm envisaged is not outweighed by the benefits and the proposal could therefore be contrary to several Unitary Development Plan Policies and the National Planning Policy Framework.\n“These digital advertising screens significantly increase the number of bright, intrusive adverts local residents and road users are exposed to. This will have an adverse effect on road safety. The most recent research suggests there is a direct link between roadside advertisement and car crashes and that is especially the case for digital billboards. This research showed that roadside advertising can increase crash risk, particularly for those signs that have the capacity to frequently change. The main two reasons that make digital billboards more distracting are their brightness and the fast changing images, for example when transitioning from an ad to the next .\n“In terms of the visual impact, the billboards would impose visually aggressive streetscapes upon commuters or people working in the area. This is an unacceptable detriment to the street scene in an area filled with heritage structures, and in a key destination shopping/hospitality area.\n“The consumption of an electronic billboard such as those proposed is estimated to be 63kwh, or the same as six average UK homes. Advertising itself contributes massively to our collective CO2 emissions, and promotes unhealthy products, damaging wellbeing. Permitting these boards would be in direct opposition to Sheffield’s declaration of a climate emergency.\n“Residents and visitors will be exposed to harmful advertising content. Although living near digital advertising screens has an impact on people who live near them, there does not appear to be any consultation with nearby residents and businesses regarding these planning applications.\n“Sheffield already has 926 outdoor advertising sites (billboards, bus shelter ads and free-standing advertising screens). Research has shown that these are more concentrated in lower income and more polluted areas, with 32% of outdoor ads in Sheffield located in the most deprived decile.\nAllowing more digital advertising screens into Sheffield risks further compounding existing inequalities in health and wealth.”\nCouncillor Mersereau had specific comments relating to the proposals for boards at 3 locations:\n108 Pinstone St\n“This proposal would require digging up a newly-created piece of paving in the Heart of the City area, where substantial investment has been made in creating a well-designed, high quality public realm. The addition of this advertising display would seem particularly out of place. It would be helpful to obtain comments from the Heart of the City team”\n45 Division St\n“This is outside Star House at 43 Division St, the home of Sheffield Futures and therefore disproportionately affecting children and young people.”\nOutside Lidl, High St\n“This is an area of very high footfall and there is already substantial conflict in this area, all the more so because it is a de facto link for cycle routes through a congested part of the city centre. It is also a hotspot for ASB and regular police intervention. Obstacles to sight lines will risk making it harder to police the area.”\nReferences\n1) Driver attention is captured by roadside advertising signs Driver attention is captured by roadside advertising signs (diva-portal.org)\n2) Impact of digital advertising The impact of road advertising signs on driver behaviour and implications for road safety: A critical systematic review – ScienceDirect\n3) Brightness of signs distracts drivers The impact of the luminance, size and location of LED billboards on drivers’ visual performance-Laboratory tests – PubMed (nih.gov)\n4) Energy use of digital display boards Advertised Emissions — Purpose Disruptors",

The knock on effect is quiet or deserted streets where some people do not feel safe, especially women on their own.

We also need to be aware that many people feel unsafe walking alone at night or when few people are on the streets. That means giving people plenty of space when needed, watching out for anyone we see in an at risk situation and not standing by if we see someone being harassed.\nRacist responses to the crisis are concerning. We know some people of Asian ethnicity have stopped wearing masks in public or going out to exercise fearing racist incidents. The Sheffield North East neighbourhood policing team deserve credit for patrolling with Roma speakers in Page Hall to ensure people actually understand the new rules.

Poor oral health has a significant impact on both the individual and wider society including pain, discomfort, time off work and school, self-consciousness and low self-esteem.\nDouglas Johnson said,\n“I asked for the Committee to discuss childhood dental health in particular because of the link with inequality. The report shows that children living in the most deprived areas of the city had average tooth decay levels four times higher than those in the least deprived areas.\n“Dental problems in childhood have a big impact on children’s overall health, development and education.\n“This is no way to start a healthy life.”\nJason Leman, of Sheffield Equality Group, welcomed the move, saying:\n“We know there are multiple issues around poverty that can make it much more of a challenge for children and adults to look after their health. Anything that can be done to reduce the impact would be most welcome.”\n“In the long run, the best way to reduce inequality in dental health across our city is to support people towards healthier lifestyles. That means providing households and communities with not just support around health, but economic and social support too.”\nNotes\nThe Committee agenda and public health report are at http://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?MId=6753&x=1\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The decision by the Department of Education followed the OFSTED report that gave the school an “inadequate” rating.\nThe Academy system was introduced by the Labour Government in 2000 and the Academisation of many local schools has been supported by Sheffield Labour Councillors. King Ted’s is the last secondary school in Sheffield to remain in local authority control.\nGreen Party Councillor Angela Argenzio, a former teacher said\n“Local people are right to be concerned about the Government forcing ‘King Ted’s’ to become an Academy.\nAcademisation is not a solution to help address the problems faced by under-resourced schools. It can introduce fresh turmoil to staff and students at a time when the school needs to focus on improvement. The Green Party has consistently opposed the academy system which removes Local Authority oversight of how schools are performing and the support that can be given to schools in difficulties.\nThere is no evidence that Multi Academy Trusts improve a school’s academic attainment, boost OFSTED grades or provide schools with more financial security.\nAcademies are less accountable to parents and the community, pupils are more likely to be taught by an unqualified teacher or a teacher with worse pay and conditions.”\nFind your election candidate here",

I was elected as a councillor for the Hillsborough ward in May 2020 and re-elected in May 2024.\nI was a university lecturer researching sustainability, and responsible business practice before I became a councillor and was active in several local and citywide voluntary groups, including Sheffield Renewables, an organisation aiming to provide renewable energy for community buildings.\nSheffield is a great place to live but I’m aware that there are many issues in Brightside & Hillsborough constituency that need improvements.\nI’m concerned about increasing traffic which pollutes the air we breathe, creates congestion and makes our streets unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. Linked to this is the lack of affordable public transport in Sheffield. A publicly funded, reliable bus service would provide a sustainable alternative to car use.\nI fully support public control of our public services such as the NHS. These are the backbone of society and have the potential to improve the lives of all residents. I also want to see Increases in social housing that will enable more people to live with dignity in housing that meets their needs.\nIf elected, I will seek to address the needs of local residents and contribute to constituency improvements. But I am also keenly aware of the Climate Crisis and the Biodiversity Crisis and want to make sure that the importance of the natural environment and climate change are factored into every decision. I joined the Green Party because I was concerned about the destruction of our natural environment and the loss of biodiversity in the UK and I am keen to contribute to a more sustainable life for us, our children and future generations.\nTo help Tina’s campaign please donate to the Crowdfunder, join the Green Party and Get Involved.\nTo contact Tina’s team email sheffield.brightside.hillsborough@votegreen.uk",

Private rented housing is becoming harder to find and 34% of private tenants are regarded as living in poverty and trapped in poor quality housing (2). Only 5% of private rented properties are regarded as affordable for housing benefit recipients.(3)\n“Over 22,000 people are on Sheffield City Council’s housing register and the council is losing hundreds of council houses to Right to Buy every year. The demand is increasing while the supply is diminishing.\n“If the Right to Buy policy is to promote home ownership, we know that over 40% of council houses end up as private rented properties. (4) So the policy is failing even on its own terms.\n“The Lib Dems say in their motion that the Council should retain 100% of the Right to Buy income from the sale of council housing, but the price the home is sold for is highly discounted anyway, based on how long the tenant has lived there and will never be enough to build an equivalent council house. The Lib Dems also say that the council should have the power to set the discount on the price to a tenant buying a council house, but why sell it at all? It makes more sense to just abolish the Right to Buy and stop losing valuable council housing”.\nIt was disappointing that neither the Labour nor LibDem group support our calls to abolish the Right to Buy,”\nNotes\n1 – Institute of Fiscal Studies report into barriers to home ownership.\nhttps://ifs.org.uk/books/barriers-homeownership-young-adults\n2 – Institute of Fiscal Studies Report into Housing Quality and Affordability for low income households.\nHousing quality and affordability for lower-income households | Institute for Fiscal Studies (ifs.org.uk)\n3 – Nationwide Foundation – Vulnerability in the Private Sector\nVulnerability in the Private Rented Sector in England (nationwidefoundation.org.uk)\n4.

At the start and end of the school day many parents park their cars illegally outside the school on the busy Catch Bar Lane.\n“Children often run across the road going to and from school and despite warnings from the Head Teacher some parents continue to park directly outside the school. We have improved the signage outside the school to make it more difficult for anyone to ignore but still people persist in parking dangerously and it makes the likelihood of a tragic accident much more likely”.\nCouncillor Gilligan- Kubo is suggesting a proposal to encourage parents to use the car park at Hillsborough Park at School opening and closing times.\n“It is a short walk from the car park to the school of just a few minutes and I am proposing that the Council waive the 70p charge for parents at the end of the school day and encourage them to use the free parking in the morning. In reality the car park has plenty of space at these times anyway so the Council will not be losing any revenue. The school could offer parents short term passes to park in the car park to encourage more responsible parking and prevent the possibility of a child being hit be a vehicle. If necessary, we could make a small contribution to cover the loss of parking revenue from the Local Area Committee Budget though I would anticipate that this cost would be negligible. In the meantime I will continue to push for better enforcement of parking conditions.”\nCouncillor Gilligan will raise the proposal with Sheffield Council’s Car Parks Department, Hillsborough Primary School and the Local Area Committee.",

This is a fourfold increase from the sole representative the party had in Parliament before. Successful Greens fought off two challenges from Labour and two from the Conservatives.\nHere in Sheffield, the Greens powered ahead to three solid second places behind Labour, pushing in front of the Conservatives and LibDems in Sheffield Central, Brightside and Hillsborough and Sheffield Heeley, with 28,603 votes altogether. Sheffield Greens were the only party to increase the number of votes they received. Across the six constituencies, the Greens won an extra 19,413 votes whilst Labour received 17,504 fewer than in 2019, despite winning a massive majority in Parliament.\nIn Sheffield Central, Angela Argenzio won 26% of the vote, one of the best Green Party performances in the country, a massive increase from 9% in 2019. Angela said,\n“I am so proud of the results of the Green Party in Sheffield Central – one of the highest percentage vote shares in the country! Thank you to all who voted for me.\n“I’m delighted there is so much support that voters have shown for Green candidates here in Sheffield and across the UK.\n“This reflects our clear principles and growing representation since our first Green councillor was elected in Sheffield 20 years ago this May, together with the hard work of all our councillors and activists in the city.”\nAlexi Dimond stood in Sheffield Heeley and won a very creditable 5,926 votes (15% of the total). After the count, he said,\n“I am immensely proud of the campaign we ran in Heeley constituency to achieve 2nd place and humbled by the number of votes received with 15.4% of the vote and an 11.1% swing to the Greens. It is a vindication of our positive message of real hope and real change, the hard work that elected Greens do as councillors and our proud stance in calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and ending arms sales to Israel.”\nIn Brightside and Hillsborough, Christine Gilligan Kubo commented,\n“Thank you to all the people who heard what the Greens stand for and supported us, right across the north of Sheffield from Hillsborough, where I remain as a councillor, to Burngreave. I heard the voices of people who wanted genuine change from the same old parties and I hope I gave them an outlet to express support for the positive policies of the Green Party, not those of division and hate.“\nJason Leman, Green candidate for Hallam constituency, said,\n“This election was about building for the future and getting the green message heard. From Carla Denyer on question time, to speaking to people on the doorstep, to delivering our message through letterboxes, we changed the conversation.\nTime and again, people said “you’re the ones telling the truth”. We’ve been clear about the issues we face and what’s needed to fix them. Our honesty, thoughtfulness and passion has been appreciated.\nThe conversations we have started will continue. The push for a greener, fairer, Britain will continue. Together, we will make a difference inside and outside of parliament!”\nHannah Nicklin, for Sheffield South East, said,\n“Greens had an incredible election, all across the country. As well as strong wins in all 4 of our target constituencies, Greens came out all over the country to make sure that voters in England and Wales had a genuine alternative on election day.\nI’m so thankful for the people who voted for a fairer, greener, more just future. I’m proud to have given them the opportunity to cast that vote.\nThere are so many Green second places coming in, 3 new seats and what looks like a doubling of Green votes in a low turnout election. This is a huge moment, and the next election will be even more significant. If you voted Green, now’s the time to join the Green Party; we’ll advocate for a sustainable, fair and equitable future together.”\nAndy Davies, candidate for Penistone and Stocksbridge, which is partly in Barnsley, said,\nI’m incredibly proud of the results we achieved across Sheffield and the country as a whole. And I thank the 2,000+ voters in Penistone and Stocksbridge who voted for real hope and real change. I’m unbelievably thankful for all the support I’ve been shown within the community in the past few weeks.\nWatch this space in 5 years!”\nJoin the Green Party and be part of a greener, fairer, future.\nNOTES\n- Full results in Sheffield are available here.\n- Here is a summary of Green votes in Sheffield:\n| Candidate | Constituency | Votes won | % of valid votes | Position |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Angela Argenzio | Central | 8283 | 26.1 | 2nd |\n| Alexi Dimond | Heeley | 5926 | 15.4 | 2nd |\n| Christine Gilligan Kubo | Brightside and Hillsborough | 4701 | 16.2 | 2nd |\n| Jason Leman | Hallam | 4491 | 8.7 | 4th |\n| Hannah Nicklin | South East | 3158 | 8.8 | 4th |\n| Andy Davies | Penistone and Stocksbridge | 2044 | 4.6 | 5th |\n- For news of national Green Party results, see https://greenparty.org.uk/2024/07/05/four-mps-green-party-makes-history/",

[1]\nCllr Rob Murphy, who proposed the motion, commented\n“Given that Labour Council leaders across the City Region have been unable to work together, the failure of the devolution deal was inevitable. The unlawful consultation and refusal to listen to the views of the public have added to the national embarrassment caused by this expensive fiasco.\n“It is time for Sheffield’s leaders to swallow their pride. We should be working together with the vast majority of Council’s across Yorkshire, for the best for everyone here. 17 of the 20 councils in our county have expressed a willingness to work on a Yorkshire-wide devolution deal, which we think would be in the best interest of the city, our region, and the county.\n“We are calling on the Council to stop following the Government’s agenda, and with the support of the public start dragging real power and finance away from London.\n“Sheffield Greens insist that no deal comes into force without the say of the people.

You would be gravely mistaken.\n“Since the motion passed, Sheffield Council and Sheffield institutions have doubled down on their complicity with genocide.\n“At the Full Council meeting on Wednesday, the leader of the Council refused to repeat the call to the government to stop participating in the genocide, no doubt because we now have a Labour government. He also refused to say whether he endorsed the flying of the Palestinian flag. He has repeatedly refused to challenge Barclays, whom the council banks with, over its financing of genocide and apartheid. He refuses to recognise the genocide, or even admit that war crimes are being committed.\n“When I asked the Chair of the Economic Development and Skills Committee on Wednesday why the arms company BAE had chosen Sheffield as the site of a new factory to manufacture lightweight howitzers and whether he supported this, he said it was because Sheffield has expertise in this area, and that we should all welcome the new BAE factory. He received a warm round of applause in the council chamber.\n“Meanwhile, the South Yorkshire Mayor continues to cultivate lucrative relationships with arms companies such as BAE, Boeing, Rolls Royce and others.\n“Thanks to the work of the Sheffield Campus Coalition for Palestine it was revealed that Sheffield University accepted £100 million from arms companies.\n“South Yorkshire Pensions Authority, the Local Government Pension Scheme of which many people here are members, holds substantial investments in arms companies, and collectively UK Local Government Pension Schemes reportedly hold over £4.4 billion of assets in companies complicit in Israel’s oppression.\n“Furthermore, Sheffield Green Party also recently uncovered that South Yorkshire Pensions Authority holds nearly £5 million of assets in Israel itself, including in gov’t bonds. The Authority also heavily invests in Fossil fuel companies, including BP which holds contracts to develop Gaza’s gas fields.\n“If you are a member of the Pensions Authority you must speak up. Anyone can attend the meeting or demonstration at the Pensions Authority this Thursday 12th Dec from 9.30.\n“Anyone can write to their MP, their Councillor, the Mayor of Sheffield. Show them the evidence of the genocide, dont allow them to deny it, and demand they stop supporting it. Let them know that you care and that this genocide is not in your name.\n“Let them know that it is their responsibility to do everything in their power to end this. Now.”",

Cities are uniquely placed to help us respond to climate change. With a concentration of population, cities’ buildings, energy and transport account for 62% of the UK’s carbon emissions.\n- Sheffield Green Party aims to identify Sheffield City Council policies that will tackle the climate emergency; raise the standards of design, development and quality of life of Sheffield people; improve health and job opportunities; and provide homes which are accessible and more affordable. We agree with the statement in the consultative document for the Emerging Sheffield Plan 2020 that we believe in homes that are fit to live in – in an environment that is fit to work in – for many decades to come.\n- Consequently, Sheffield Green Party wants to see every council policy and decision make a contribution to tackling the climate emergency, including the objective of the city reducing carbon usage as early as possible. Plans and policies should be carbon-audited so that the zero-carbon target by 2030 can be achieved and subsequent carbon targets can also be reached.\n- Sheffield Green Party recognises the need for new infrastructure, housing, industrial and commercial land, and social facilities in local communities. Traditionally, this has meant increasing work-to-home travel time by expanding the geographical extent of the city. This is dangerous, because it worsens carbon emissions and health inequalities. Instead we believe Sheffield should concentrate less on growing its geography; and instead create more locally and neighbourhood-based economic, social and cultural networks.\n- Urban planning balances many competing interests, not least those of property against those of society. Better community engagement in planning and development issues will mitigate tension and conflict when balancing social, economic and environmental concerns relating to development.\n- We recognise there is a balance to be struck in ensuring that good standards of future sustainability and climate change-related considerations do not prevent development happening at all. However, we want to encourage developers with a long-term commitment to the city. We are aware that some developers will threaten to take their business elsewhere: if so, that is not a reason to foist substandard housing on future generations. Where proposals do not meet important standards, we should not be afraid to refuse them.\nSpatial strategy\n- Sheffield must learn from its history in order to address the future.\n- The city evolved from a series of interconnected districts: not for nothing is it still known as the biggest village in the country. Traditionally, the Little Mester pattern of work meant people living and working in very close proximity. The industrial revolution and twentieth century planning separated the arenas of “work” and “home,” into dirty industry and planned housing estates, linked by a dependence on motor vehicles.\n- Time, emotional energy and fuel are consumed through mass transit of thousands of workers. But this leads to poor work-life balance, carbon emissions, air and noise pollution, bad health and entrenched inequality.\n- We can do better. One thing the coronavirus pandemic has shocked society into realising is that many people can work from home, at least part of the time. Office accommodation is suddenly being seen as obsolete, at least on the scale it once was. People can work from home – but this should not just be an option for a privileged few.\n- New homes must be capable of facilitating work from home. This means adequate space and light. It means adequate green or open space for mental and physical refreshment to be readily at hand. And it means that local facilities and community space must be located nearby. Many more everyday journeys –if not most – must be possible by foot or cycle.\n- If new development does not meet these essential goals, it will have failed the city and we cannot afford that.\n- Overall, spatial strategy should aim to improve patterns of development to meet sustainable transport and energy objectives. Policies addressing all aspects of planning, including construction, housing, energy, transport, food, waste, water, health, the economy and natural habitats, are interconnected.\nHow much housing and where?\n- The lack of a 5 year land supply for housing has been exploited by developers in Sheffield, meaning applications which did not conform to local policies have been approved. This has led to planning permission being granted in the wrong locations and unsuitable types of homes being built.\n- The impact of coronavirus on the economy, housing and student numbers is not certain, so a new analysis needs to take place which identifies the true 5-year supply position in late 2020, and is published every year going forward.\n- We question the basis on which it is said Sheffield needs 40,000 new homes in the next 15 years, especially in the light of new Government proposals. Analysis by Lichfields[1] in August 2020 shows that current housing requirements in Sheffield are only 2,131 per year (32,000 over 15 years) and only 1,733 per year (26,000 over 15 years) under the new proposals from central Government.\n- Regardless of the numbers, we need the right type and size of housing. Central and local government targets do not distinguish between student bedsits and executive homes in the drive for housing numbers. As a result, developers’ desire to maximise profits by cramming as many small apartments as possible into a site is fuelled by the incentive for local councils to achieve large numbers of “units” towards its target. This does nothing to address the need for housing for families, people on lower incomes or those with local community connections.\nUrban densification – but maintaining quality\n- We accept more housing is needed and we believe the best way is to focus on future housing development that can be achieved through higher densities within the City Centre. The concept of a compact city could be considered to be a radius of about 1.5 miles or 30 minutes walking time from the city centre. This encompasses an area where it is more convenient to walk than to drive, and easiest to cycle. The areas below are capable of providing for a very large quantity of housing and related amenities. Because they follow the major rivers of the Sheaf and the Don, they offer opportunities for relatively flat travel, ideally suited to the proper development of high-quality walking and cycling routes.\n- If so, this would suggest a concentration of new residential districts in:\n- The Neepsend / Penistone Road corridor extending beyond Kelham Island up the River Don as far as Hillfoot Bridge, on both sides of the river\n- The River Don corridor downstream extending as least as far as Norfolk Bridge\n- The River Sheaf corridor as far as Heeley Bottom, alongside Queens Road / Olive Grove Road / East bank Road area.\n- Other areas of Attercliffe, Carbrook, Darnall and towards Tinsley that are well-served by the tram and bus corridor, and with potential for new, safe, river or canal-side, segregated cycle and walking routes, also offer potential for large-scale housing development\n- To make this work, these districts must not become a series of blocks of flats beside large roads. We set out our views on design standards below. They must only be built with suitable amenities, including shops, services and open green space.\nShops in the city centre\n- On-line shopping has altered the use of the city centre. There remain significant quantities of usable accommodation above existing shops in the city centre. Policies should promote use of these for residential accommodation, which will in turn support the viability of shops below.\nNeighbourhood centres\n- For areas further out from the city centre, Sheffield Green Party believes in maintaining and enhancing the current emphasis on distinct district and local centres. The approach to densification for the central area should be applied rigorously, at a suitably smaller scale, to local centres. We would like to see high-quality but concentrated housing at local centres, with better use made of space between centres.\n- We would like to see policies that restrict the building of out-of-town supermarkets and large stores, as they generate too much car traffic. Shops and facilities should be encouraged near new housing developments in district centres.\nFlood management\n- As these built up areas border the city’s rivers, which also operate as wildlife corridors and green spaces, such housing must be designed to take account of flood risks (including those anticipated because of worsening climate change) and address the consequences of development both upstream and downstream. Every piece of new waterfront opened up should be set aside for public use, whether as a walking / cycling route or as a public amenity such as a pocket park.\n- Flood management in these areas must be controlled principally by significant flood management upstream, mainly on the moors where by far the largest amount of water is held.\nTransport\n- The Climate Emergency and the aim of a better quality of life require a wholescale re-imagining of how we move around the city. Poor air quality harms peoples’ health and accounts for up to 500 premature deaths in the city. There is a clear correlation between poor air quality and areas of deprivation, thus embedding health inequalities across the city. Research on the effects of the tiny particles given off by vehicle emissions is in its infancy, but we already know that they worsen heart diseases, cancers, strokes, dementia and Alzheimer’s, inhibit infant lung development. Measures to improve air quality include measures to reduce vehicle emissions from buses, lorries and vans, taxis and private cars.\n- The principles above aim to reduce the need to travel for everyday activities. Where travel is needed, policies must promote access on foot, by bike and by public transport and must dissuade private cars and other polluting vehicles. All development must come with a clear and firm plan to effectively shorten the distance between home and the city centre or local/district centres.\n- These policies should promote the following objectives:\n- Making active travel (walking and cycling) and public transport (train/bus/tram/tram train) more convenient, attractive, comfortable and cheaper than private vehicles\n- Secure bike storage, recognising that a few bike stands in a general-use car park leaves many of them vulnerable to repeated bike theft. Secure, individual bike parking may therefore be required for each occupant.\n- Segregated cycle and footway infrastructure to enable safe accessible active travel for all.\n- Promoting car-sharing above individual ownership\n- Ensuring that current, proposed or potential cycling lanes and walking routes are not blocked by developments, in particular by telecommunications equipment\n- Reducing the number of private vehicles stored on public roads and reallocation of road space away from car storage\n- Effective co-operation with Sheffield City Region and South Yorkshire PTE\n- Better public transport infrastructure – priority routes, bus shelters at stops, live information on stops and vehicles, facilities to promote inter-connectivity within and between modes\n- Cleaner and less polluting public transport and taxis\n- Equality of access for all, noting that disabled people and BAME communities usually have less access to private cars\n- Cooperation and participation in these policies by significant institutions (universities, hospitals, entertainment spaces)\n- Long-term development of transport hubs on outskirts of the city to keep large haulage vehicles out of the centre and move towards e-vehicles to collect goods from hubs for delivery to city centre businesses; and promotion of e-cargo bikes for last-mile delivery\n- Adequate drop-off and pick-up access for deliveries and taxis as more residents move away from having their own cars.\n- Effective provision of electric charging infrastructure\n- Ensuring that no development conflicts with the potential for reopening or extending (heavy or light) rail lines, even if no plans are active. This could apply for instance to maintaining space to open new railway stations at Parkwood Springs or Deepcar or an existing one at Heeley.\n- A clear traffic impact assessment provided with each planning application, addressing likely and possible vehicle traffic, means of control, deliveries, taxi drop-offs, secure bike storage, access to buses and trams, bike highways, and walking infrastructure.\n- full consideration of residents’ parking schemes\nDesign\nSpace standards\n- Housing must not just be small flats. A genuinely full range of sizes and types is needed. Flats which are less than the minimum recommended size are likely to impact on health and well-being, as they may increase feelings of isolation and stress, including during long hours of working from home.\n- We are concerned at the recent plethora of apartments, planned to be constructed at well below minimum standards. In one recent planning application, “substandard living conditions” were not considered to be grounds for refusal. In another application for “student residential accommodation,” the developer defended minuscule room sizes as not being intended for long-term student occupation.” As we note above, this is not acceptable for the wellbeing of current or future residents.\n- At the least, existing regional and national space standards should be incorporated as minimum local policies.\nEnergy consumption and generation\n- In order to meet zero-carbon targets, new housing should be carbon neutral or better. All new development must be built to high standards of insulation, including draught proofing, and energy use. Design should first ensure that energy consumption is minimised and then maximise the possibility of energy production (e.g. through solar panels). The city needs to plan now for the switch from gas to electric energy in domestic settings, offices, schools and health settings.\n- There should be policies to address:\n- High standards of thermal insulation – both design and construction – including Passivhaus standards\n- Standards of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems\n- District heating\n- Maximisation of power generation on-site, using solar or ground-source power\n- Orientation of buildings (or at least roofs) towards the south to maximize the scope for solar generation\n- The need to work towards the removal of gas boilers\n- Sheffield should continue to use Sustainable Building Codes in promoting sustainable design and reducing carbon emissions in housing and civic and industrial buildings.\nCommunity energy strategy\n- The City Council should urgently create a strategy to promote community energy projects and address the four distinct strands of community energy:\n- reducing energy use;\n- managing energy more efficiently;\n- generating energy through community energy schemes that harness wind, solar or hydro;\n- purchasing of efficient renewable energy.\n- By pooling resources and working together, community energy projects allow local communities to access cheaper energy and improved energy efficiency options, along with adding social and economic benefits to local areas.\nThe carbon cost of construction\n- Sheffield’s contribution to carbon emissions released through the supply chains of building materials, including their extraction, manufacture, and transportation, in addition to those incurred during the construction process, need to be recognised and significantly reduced: the built environment is estimated to be responsible for 35%-40% of total carbon emissions in the UK.\n- The construction sector needs to change focus to retro-fitting and modular construction. In this, we encourage the use of low carbon building processes and super-efficient Passivhaus standards, including the use of timber, which acts as a carbon sink.\nDesign of Green and open space\n- Critically, flats must have green space readily available at ground level. This green space should be accessible to the public and exclusive or gated communities should be discouraged. Policies should encourage roof gardens, green walls and planting, although an elevated roof garden should not be seen as a substitute for ground-level green space. Design should offer structure, for interest, and varied native planting to enable biodiversity net gain. Windows with balconies and verandahs should be encouraged.\nTall buildings\n- Policies relating to design of tall buildings and protection of views in the city centre are incoherent and haphazardly applied. There needs to be an overhaul of these, with a public consultation to gauge views on the impact of the current “iconic building” policy on the Sheffield urban landscape. We support restrictions on buildings that create dangerous wind-flows and over-shadow pedestrians and block the sun from nearby buildings; and ask for improved standards for protecting views to and out of buildings, and where the settings of heritage assets are affected.\n- In the interests of wellbeing of people and wildlife and to allow for plant/tree growth, Sheffield City Council should adopt a tall buildings design standard to allow for at least 6 hours sunlight per day (May to September) to fall on pavements throughout the city.\n- We would develop a policy whereby all buildings over 20 metres tall should employ ‘step-back’ and adhere to “relative height to set street width” to avoid the canyon effect.\nRoof space\n- There is a lot of roof space in the city centre. The roof spaces should be used for either solar panels or rooftop gardens to encourage local food production or amenity space.\nPavement width\n- Increased pavement width, extending where possible into the roadway and making single width roads to create wider pavement passing width (a current Coronavirus issue) to enable greater social interaction and promote disability access.\nConservation and heritage practice\n- Policies should recognise the full range of Sheffield’s heritage, including the natural environment and cultural practices as much as the built environment. The Council should also recognise the economic value of heritage. On the one hand, Kelham Island is a superbly successful example of heritage-led regeneration; on the other hand, the city has suffered from the loss of cultural heritage and independent local businesses (such as Rare & Racy) for no real gain.\n- Sheffield Green Party endorses the heritage strategy prepared and developed by the city-wide Joined Up Heritage Sheffield group[2].\n- This should become adopted policy as the city’s heritage strategy in order to promote better understanding, encourage a strategic approach and develop a better-resourced and better-connected presentation of heritage in the city.\n- We celebrate the vision of Joined Up Heritage Sheffield in developing its five cross-cutting themes: quality historic environment, economic vitality, health and well-being, diversity and inclusion; and children and young people; as well as the grass-roots consultative approach they have taken in developing these.\n- We would like to see the compilation of a Local List of buildings of interest that do not meet the criteria for Listed protection but are nevertheless significant in the community.\n- Policies should recognise the economic and social advantages of conservation areas. A clear approach should be taken to supporting a Castlegate conservation area.\nRe-use, not new-build\n- Sheffield City Council policies should reaffirm and re-enforce conservation practices in the design and construction and use of buildings. This should result in buildings which are durable, energy-efficient, and adaptable for more than one purpose. Bringing existing buildings back into use involves a lot less carbon emission than new construction: Carl Elefante, former president of the American Institute of Architects, said in 2007, “The greenest building is the one that already exists.” Planning approval should be encouraged for good use of existing buildings, such as the conversion of a 19th century school building into flats in Greenhill.\nEmpty homes\n- Reusing currently empty homes tackles the housing shortage without the huge energy resources needed for building brand new houses, and reduces the blight on residential streets. Sheffield’s policies must encourage energy-efficient retrofitting of historic and listed buildings, and the pre-1918 housing stock in the city; and provide locally relevant and accessible guidance for owners, householders and friends of support groups.\nDisability access and lifetime homes\n- All new homes built must be accessible to visitors in wheelchairs and mobility scooters. These homes must also be fully accessible or easily adapted for use by mobility-impaired occupants. Strong and enforceable policies must be in place to ensure that ready-to-use homes for wheelchair and mobility-impaired people are available in every area of the city so people can remain close to family and friends. At present, many disabled people have a very limited range of property available to them. Such homes must be provided in phase one of any development so developers actually build them. It is not adequate to offer them only in subsequent phases to be built in the future, if at all.\n- Where parking is provided, adequate priority for suitable spaces must be accessible to people with mobility needs and to mobility-impaired visitors. There should be storage for mobility scooters\n- All apartment complexes must be built with step-free access to all floors. It is not an adequate answer to say they could be converted retrospectively if a disabled person happened to want accommodation because this restricts the range of accommodation available to disabled people to less than that available to the general public.\nThe Green Belt and beyond\nNo building in the Green Belt\n- The responses to the City Council’s Options for Growth consultation of 2015 showed that no building should take place on the Green Belt until all brownfield sites have been explored. We agree. There is a long way to go before the potential of all brownfield sites have been explored and utilized. The Green Belt surrounding Sheffield should not be reduced in quality or extent.\n- Sheffield Green Party strongly supports the provision of the Green Belt to contain urban sprawl, to maintain the separation of settlements, to protect prime agricultural land around settlements, to encourage urban regeneration and compact towns and cities, and to maintain and enhance ecological and cultural value. The Green Belt contains hundreds of thousands of trees which soak up greenhouse gases such as CO2, thus reducing pollution/toxins in the air. Green Belt quality land contains mature woodland trees which have greater capacity to do this than other land uses.\n- We would put greater emphasis on the Green Belt’s use for wider sustainable development such as flooding mitigation, biodiversity, agriculture, energy production and sustainable transport and sustainable leisure pursuits. There should be no net loss in the quantity and quality of Green Belt land, and plans should aim to ‘green the Green Belt’.\n- The only development which should therefore be allowed in the Green Belt is that relating to energy production, leisure, re-wilding, conservation, flood control and sustainable transport infrastructure.\n- It is accepted there could be very small amounts of development in the Green Belt to provide extended family accommodation, benefit communities, tackle rural poverty. These should be decided on a case by case basis.\nBrownfield sites in the Green Belt\n- Areas designated as brownfield within, surrounded by or close to Green Belt land need to be carefully assessed as to their current status. Where re-wilding has taken place, they should be re-designated as greenfield, so as to enhance the Green Belt.\n- Developments for housing and industry that will attract regular additional traffic or other negative impacts should generally be avoided.\n- In appropriate cases, they could potentially be given over to low-activity, beneficial uses such as power generation (wind, solar or coppicing).\nRewilded brownfield sites\n- Similarly, where sites might have been built on in the distant past, they may now provide a huge amount of natural amenity to humans and to the natural world. Such sites should be given a high degree of protection.\n- The priority should be to regenerate and redevelop previously developed land where that is required, but with the ability for that land to be designated/de-designated as brownfield or green space when and where the situation changes or re-wilding of empty sites occurs.\nInfilling\n- The definition of “infilling” is that of turning over small parcels of land within established residential areas to increase the number of dwellings in that area. Sheffield Green Party would not necessarily oppose this, as increasing the density of already established areas can prevent the need for building on the edges of the countryside in or near Green Belt land. However, any decisions on infill would need to take account of that community’s need for accessible open space and biodiversity: often that small piece of land is rich in both aspects. Policy should take account of how close the site in question is to a district centre.\nGreenfield sites\n- Where they support recreation, mental and physical well-being or biodiversity, greenfield sites that do not lie in the Green Belt can be incredibly important. This is despite the challenges of a nearby urban environment. Therefore, development should only take place on greenfield sites in truly exceptional cases.\n- We support the removal of the Owlthorpe Townships from the current plan. It is greenfield space that has never been developed and should not now be built on.\nParks and open spaces\n- Sheffield Green Party notes the need for positive management and maintenance, in perpetuity, of parks and green spaces in the city.\n- The provision, future management (including details of the owner and the responsible maintenance body) and maintenance of open space, parks and any artificial grass pitches or surfaces should be an integral part of a new development or building project, considered at the beginning of the design process and included, where necessary, as planning conditions.\n- Sheffield Green Party objects to the passing on of public spaces to management companies with no endowment, and to the commercialisation of public spaces without the active engagement of residents, local and city-wide park support groups.\n- While Britain has, at present, no official policy on how much green space should be available for its citizens Green MP Caroline Lucas has stated that no new housing development should be sanctioned more than one kilometre from a public park. Sheffield should create new parks and open spaces in densely populated parts of the city which have below Sheffield average amounts of open space.\nTrees\n- There needs to be a commitment to increasing tree cover in the city, particularly on-street tree cover in the most densely urban areas of the city, in order to prevent urban over-heating. We require a policy on increasing the amount of species-rich hedgerow in the urban and rural landscape of the city, and increased protection of ancient woodland, veteran trees or ancient or existing species-rich hedgerows.\n- Protection of trees varies wildly between areas of the city. Some areas with large tree populations such as Loxley Valley have low numbers of Tree Protection Orders (TPOs) and this needs to change to afford them greater protection. More individual trees, groups of trees, avenues of trees and woodland should be assessed and protected. Members of the public should be actively encouraged and enabled to put forward trees to be protected.\nBiodiversity\n- City centre development helps reduce biodiversity loss further out. Policies should require new developments to contribute to the provision of vibrant wildlife corridors throughout the city. Building along rivers allows the potential of blue/green corridors to be vital threads of life running throughout the city: for instance, bees may travel long distances along riverbanks to forage. Grass verges should be maintained and enhanced as wildflower havens, linking with hedgerows\n- Planning policy has failed to stem the alarming loss of biodiversity let alone enhance it. Planning policy must protect and enhance ecology and biodiversity in every local landscape.\nAgricultural land and development\n- The criteria for assessing development on the best and most versatile agricultural land should be to:\n- Maintain agricultural land where it is currently in, or suitable for, the production of healthy local food (particularly fruit and vegetables), ideally produced under agro-ecological and organic principles.\n- Maintain access to agricultural land for new entrants to growing and farming and other appropriate production.\n- Promote agroforestry and increasing appropriate tree cover where appropriate, with “right tree in the right place” principles i.e. not unicrop plantations, and almost certainly native species.\n- Protect wetlands, ponds, hedges, meadows, and other special habitats on agricultural land.\n- Support the maintenance and improvement of soil quality.\nHow to achieve our “Green View”\nPublic engagement\n- Building has long-lasting effects on the surrounding area, community and people’s well-being. It follows that effective consultation with communities is essential. This will help identify issues – and solutions – at an early stage. It should encourage community acceptance of new development and developers’ understanding of community needs.\n- Consultation needs to take place:\n- With neighbouring residents: all households and businesses who will be affected by development should be notified by letter. The present, minimalist approach at present is not adequate. A failure to notify can cause resentment amongst residents who feel that development is subsequently being imposed on them without their views being considered\n- With special interest groups. Examples include the Conservation Advisory Group and Access Liaison Group, which are made up of interested lay people with first-hand experience of the issues in question: thus their views are uniquely valuable. At present, these people give up their time for free but contribute to commercial and community outcomes of development. These groups must be fully facilitated by the council. There should be consideration of a system that provides for at least some recognition (including financial) of the benefit of these groups. Developers should be encouraged or required to engage with them.\n- The Council Planning website needs overhauling in order to make it easier for the public to engage. Those without ready internet access or computer literacy are increasingly excluded. Current planning meetings also exclude members of the public, by limiting numbers, and more so where they are held online.\n- Sheffield City Council should make much more effort to communicate to communities about where Green Belt land lies within their area. Specifically, with regard to the maps published as part of the Issues and Options consultation, (Green Belt Review) they are broadly illegible and cannot be used as a basis for consultation with the public in their present form.\nNeighbourhood planning\n- Neighbourhood planning forums give local communities an outlet to express collective views on development in the area they know best. They also offer developers a unique resource to sound out local issues and feelings. They should therefore be supported and developed.\nAffordable Housing\n- So-called “affordable housing” has not been effective in meeting the actual needs of many people. 40,000 people are on the Council Housing waiting list, with about one third of these being seen as “in desperate need” (Sheffield Star, January 2020 figures). For many, “affordable” housing remains unaffordable. There needs to be a year-on-year increase in social rented accommodation. Any new affordable housing should be predominately social rented, both through the local authority and through housing associations.\n- Every development should make a contribution to affordable housing, depending on its scale. For smaller developments, it may not be practical to provide affordable housing on site and a financial contribution to social housing elsewhere should be an alternative option.\n- Where affordable or social housing is provided, it must be integrated on an equal basis with market housing to avoid social segregation.\n- Policies should provide a firm approach to contributions and should maximise the investment from developers to wider social benefit. To assist cash flow (which we recognise can be an issue on construction projects), cash contributions may be secured through (interest-bearing) deferred payments in appropriate cases.\n- Sheffield Green Party supports more effective housing controls in areas where there is a lack of diversity in the housing mix, including planning controls that will mean that landlords who want to convert a property into a shared house for three to six unrelated people (small HMO) will need planning permission.\nSites for travellers\n- We encourage the local authority to provide and maintain Travellers’ sites to recommended national standards designed to prevent overcrowding and allow reasonable living and working conditions.\nSupporting Self-build and Community Land Trusts\n- We support the allocation of more land for self-build and cohousing schemes. We call on the Council to enable the setting up of Community Land Trusts where this is advocated by local communities to preserve their local area benefits, specifically in respect of affordable housing, for the benefit of themselves and for future generations.\n- To achieve a range of housing types and tenure, and with an emphasis on affordability, the council will need to actively promote partnerships between community groups and bodies such as housing associations to enable Community Land Trusts to be successful in fulfilling their aims.\n- Sheffield City Council should make use of its compulsory purchase powers to help community groups with good business cases to create more ‘custom build’ and social housing.\nAssets of community value\n- Sheffield should be actively publicising, encouraging and providing officer support to any community group who wish to take advantage of government Locality legislation and who puts forward a building, open space, park or other facility as an Asset of Community Value.\n- A new “less than best consideration policy” should be established whereby co-operative, charitable or mutually-owned organisations are given first access to bidding for local authority buildings, open spaces, parks and facilities which are being sold off. This policy would allow disposal of the site at a price that reflects the clear dividends can be achieved when a community group owns and successfully operates a business or business premises.\nCommunity Infrastructure Levy (CIL) and s.106 agreements\n- CIL bands should be reviewed with higher rates of CIL levied on newly built student accommodation. Consideration should be given to differential rates of CIL contributions depending on energy ratings of developments.\n- CIL boundaries should be reviewed and updated. At present, developers have to pay a contribution if they build on one side of the river in Kelham Island but not on the other side. Since it appears the government intends to relieve more developers of having to make CIL contributions, it will become in effect a levy only on the very biggest developments. It follows that there is good reason to apply CIL across the whole of the city. That in turn will generate contributions for the community in areas of deprivation, which are currently exempted.\nConstruction noise and nuisance\n- Construction noise and vibration has a serious impact on residents’ health and well-being. As more people work from home, noise and vibration from construction can jeopardise the ability of people to work from their houses, as was seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n- In particular, the city centre must be seen as a primarily residential district now, with the consequence that night-time construction work should only take place for emergencies.\n- People who are more likely to be at home throughout the day because of age, disability or caring for young children are affected even more badly by constant noise and vibration and late or early starts on building sites. People’s mental health can really suffer from constant noise and vibration. So when granting planning permission careful consideration should be given to the length of the working day for the site, including moving machinery and accessing the site early in the morning and late into the evenings.\nWaste from construction\n- Policies should ensure that site construction has established practices to minimise the huge waste of materials and packaging on site.\nMonitoring and enforcement\n- Proper enforcement of high standards and planning obligations is essential. This is not to be punitive but to make sure that no-one cheats the system. Allowing unlawful development to go unchecked is a penalty on those developers who abide by the rules where those who cut corners can undercut them for profit.\n- Since enforcement is both a social and economic good, costs of enforcement should be recovered wherever possible from developers in breach of obligations. We would support a policy of greater use of bonds to ensure compliance with planning conditions.\n[1] Lichfields (August 2020) ‘Levelling up: What does the new Standard Method mean for Yorkshire and The Humber?’ available at https://lichfields.uk/blog/2020/august/17/levelling-up-what-does-the-new-standard-method-mean-for-yorkshire-and-the-humber/\n[2] https://www.joinedupheritagesheffield.org.uk/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

There is already a shortage of family housing in the city centre.\n“It isn’t just an issue for the “market”.

Videos of other speeches and songs from the rally are here. More information about Sheffield Palestine Solidarity Campaign here.\nHere is Maroof’s speech.\nLong live Palestine!\nMy name is Maroof Raouf and I stand in front of you today not as a Green Party councillor for Nether Edge and Sharrow, I stand in front of you as a human who cares about humanity.\nI want peace. You want peace. The people of Palestine want peace. The Israeli government does not.\nI and many of you here today agree that there should be an equal application of law. That means the equal upholding of rights, the equal protection of all humans in Palestine. The Israeli government does not.\nThe issue with the issue in Palestine is with the occupier. The issue is with the colonizer. The issue is that the Israeli government that has laid siege to the Palestinians. The issue is with the government of the UK and it’s opposition parties, including Labour, who have agreed that Israel has a right to continue with the genocide of the Palestinian people. The issue is those, especially in that building over there, who through their silence have chosen to side with genocide, rather than humanity.\nThe people in Gaza don’t have food. The people in Gaza don’t have money. The people in Gaza don’t have water. The people in Gaza don’t have energy. The people in Gaza don’t have the media. But the people in Gaza do have the truth. They have you and many others like you who will continue to support their cause for the chance to live their lives free from oppression.\nI stand with the oppressed, not with the oppressor. You stand with the oppressed, not with the oppressor.\nThrough his actions, the Labour leader of Sheffield City Council has shown he stands with the oppressor. That is why the Green Party have given notice of motion calling for an immediate ceasefire and for the government to vote for this at the UN; to cease all arms sales and end military aid to Israel; and to call on Israel to resume negotiations with Palestine for a fair and equitable two state solution. The open-air prison of Gaza is not a solution. And I trust my Labour colleagues here today will vote for that motion on Wednesday.\nIn fact, Gaza is not an open-air prison.\nPrisons are where criminals go. Prisons are where you get access to three meals a day. You can get access to clean water. You get access to healthcare. You get access to some form of dignity. None of these apply to Gaza, who have for the last 16 years been under an illegal blockade. Gaza is an open-air concentration camp! Three are innocent men, women, children, and babies in this concentration camp who are being ethnically cleansed today. Let us be clear.\nThis is a genocide.\nThis is a genocide.\nThis is a genocide!\nCurrently over 7000 Palestinian civilians have been slaughtered compared to 1400 Israelis. Is that a good enough exchange rate for Palestinian lives to Israelis? I ask the Council Leader, Councillor Hunt, at what exchange rate will he finally be happy with to publicly call for a full and immediate ceasefire? Are over five Palestinian lives to one Israeli life not good enough for him? Does he want a greater exchange rate of human life? I encourage you to ask your elected leaders in Burngreave, in Firth Park, in Darnall, in Nether Edge, in Ecclesall, in all areas of Sheffield; What is the going rate of human lives they will be happy with.\nStopping access to food and medicine to Gaza is collective punishment. Shutting energy and communication to Gaza is collective punishment. Stopping water to Gaza is collective punishment. Blocking people, including our very own British nationals, from fleeing Gaza is collective punishment. Telling people in Gaza\nto flee to the south or they will be deemed partners of Hamas is a precursor to collective punishment. Razing Gaza So only rubble is left is collective punishment. All of us here today know that collective punishment is prohibited by international law.\nIt is a war crime.\nIt is a war crime.\nIt is a war crime!\nHamas is not Palestine. Over 2,700 children and babies have been massacred in Palestine. Were they Hamas? Were these poor babies, who couldn’t even say the word\n“terrorist”, were they terrorists too? Hamas is not running the West Bank. What is the excuse for the Israelis murdering Palestinians in the West Bank? Let us not forget that terrorists are those who murder innocent women, children, and babies. Terrorists are those who bomb hospitals, schools, mosques, and churches. So who are the real terrorists? Because from where I am standing, it looks like Sheffield City Council deliberately chose to fly the flag of a terrorist nation two and a half weeks ago.\nYou don’t have to be Muslim to support Palestine.\nYou don’t have to be Muslim to care about Gaza.\nYou don’t have to be Muslim to stand up for Gaza.\nYou do not have to be any faith to stand up for humanity.\nYou only have to be human.\nLong live Palestine!\nFree, free Palestine!\nFree, free Palestine!",

They include:\n- An amendment to oppose a limit on the number of motions councillors can submit. This adversely affects the opposition parties. The amendment also calls for the chance to debate the Green motion at the start of the meeting. At October’s meeting, the council agreed to debate a Green motion first at the December meeting. However, in December, the Administration has put our motions to the end of the agenda to guarantee they will not be discussed.\n- To criticise the NHS proposals about closure of the Minor Injuries Unit at the Hallamshire Hospital and the Walk-In Centre on Broad Lane\n- To propose the view that the Council has a moral duty to protect the city’s children.\n- To call on the Administration to end the situation which means Council tenants can be evicted if they cannot pay water bills on time. No other householders in the city face this threat.\n- To apologise for the alarm and distress caused to Councillor Alison Teal for the Administration’s (failed) attempt to send her to prison.\nThe amendments are in addition to the Green motions.

Residents across the city have been working to clear away ice and snow but have been frustrated about the lack of grit bins and slow refilling. The Green Party is arguing that alongside providing residents with grit for footpaths, Amey should clear priority footpaths and cycle routes at the same time as roads.\nGreen Party Councillor for Ecclesall, Peter Gilbert, said:\n“Our NHS is in the middle of a crisis. The last thing they need is loads of people turning up with broken bones and sprains from falling on the ice. That’s what people are facing across Sheffield. The pavements aren’t cleared and on busy roads people can’t safely walk in the cleared road. We need clearance of the pavements at the same time as the busy roads.”\nGreen Party Councillor for City, Ruth Mersereau, said:\n“Our current maintenance schedule means that most of the city’s pavements are left with leaves, snow and ice uncleared. Slippery pavements make it risky to get about, particularly on hilly streets and for older people. And when pavements haven’t been gritted, people are forced to walk or wheel in the roads, at risk from motor vehicles”\nGreens ask questions of the council and Amey\nGreen Councillors asked questions in Council in September and directly to Amey in October about handling snowy weather conditions. Amey stated in their response that, “we do not grit our cycleways or footways with the exception of areas around hospitals and within the city centre network”. However, many cycleways and pavements that should have been cleared within the Amey contract, including those around schools, have not been done days after the snow has fallen. Well-used pavements in shopping districts and around schools and retirement homes have become dangerous.\nSheffield Green Party argues pavements around schools and other priority footpaths should be cleared and gritted at the same time as priority roads are cleared. This has been done in Stockholm, Sweden, where clearing pavements alongside roads has significantly reduced injuries from falls.\nCouncillor Ruth Mersereau said:\n“The gritting of some footpaths has been welcome but it isn’t enough. People with difficulty walking, some older adults, and people who need a wheelchair to get around, are most at risk from falls on ice or from effectively being trapped at home until the ice thaws. In November, the Council voted to declare Sheffield a Pedestrian Friendly City. If it truly was, then the movement and safety of walkers and wheelers would take priority and we would have properly gritted pavements and cycleways. The Council urgently needs to work with Amey to change its policy on this.”\nCouncillor Peter Gilbert said:\n“I’ve been out helping residents grit pavements that are dangerous and it’s been frustrating when we’ve not had enough grit to do the job. We need more help to get more of these pavements cleared. Amey should be told they have a duty to pedestrians and cyclists, as well as to motorists. That means more grit, more grit bins, and clearing the footpaths and cycleways that people rely on.”\nGreens want the Amey contract enforced and renegotiated if needed\nSheffield Greens argue that the contract with Amey needs to be properly enforced, and if necessary renegotiated, by Sheffield City Council to include more clearing and gritting of footpaths around schools and on busy priority routes. This would help pedestrians get around safely. A reduction in slips and falls through better footpath clearance would reduce the number of slips and falls, which would be a saving to the NHS. Funding from the NHS for preventative measures could be usefully directed towards some of this work, or for other proven measures, such as supplying grippers to elderly people at risk of falls.\nYou can read more about how Stockholm clears footpaths at the same time as priority roads on their Traffic.Stockholm site.

This is something that Greens have wanted for many years, since Caroline Lucas (now a Green MP) and others developed the Green New Deal in 2008-9.\nHome insulation is the simplest and most effective way of reducing energy use in housing. It means lower fuel bills for families, less carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere and less NOx gases emitted from domestic gas-fired boilers.\nInsulating homes is not new. Sadly, government cuts killed off almost all home insulation work after 2012. And this is still a lot less than the £9.2 billion promised in the Conservatives’ 2019 manifesto for energy efficiency.\nThis investment will save money for the NHS. Research tells us that every £1 invested in home insulation can save the NHS 42p if it is spent on the homes that most need it. Cold homes kill.\nOf course, the devil is in the detail.

This comes after the new Labour Government announced it will be scrapped next year.\nSpeaking at the 4th September Full Council meeting, Green Councillors Marieanne Elliot and Paul Turpin, expressed their concerns that the new Government are imposing renewed austerity on those who can least afford it.\nCllr Elliot said:\n“We’ve all heard the new Government claim that the financial situation left behind by the last Government was irresponsible. But it is astounding that, out of all the choices, they have chosen to cut ten million pensioners’ winter fuel payments. A payment that has brought significant relief to millions, including very many of our own council tenants in Sheffield. It helps keep people healthy, safe and out of hospital. It could be said that cutting this important social benefit is also very irresponsible. Why are big polluters and financial institutions still not being asked to pay their fair share whilst pensioners are left out in the cold? ”\nCllr Turpin commented:\n“A possible saving of £1.3 billion from this cut is less than the amount of pension credit going unclaimed by Britain’s older generation who are entitled to it. I very much welcome the extension of a further 6 months to the Household Support Fund, which is of great assistance to those in desperate circumstances. This is no answer, however, to the need to keep people out of such a situation by ensuring they can pay their heating bills in the first place.”\nThe Green group of Councillors have written to Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves asking her to reconsider the decision to cut the £200/£300 Winter Fuel Allowance that has been paid to all pensioners since 1997.\nThey wrote\n“We desperately need the government to act urgently on home insulation schemes. This is the best way of keeping everyone safe, warm and out of poverty. Instead of cutting the Winter Fuel Allowance, an alternative would be to use it to give pensioners the option to finance the installation of insulation measures and solar panels to reduce their energy bills permanently. That sort of initiative would be the actions of an imaginative and progressive government, not one that is just continuing austerity.”",

The survey got ideas from these residents on what would help to cut air pollution.\nWhat could we do to reduce pollution?\n“Fewer & less polluting cars on roads, help to get back on clean buses”\n“Better cycle route down Eccy rd or make Sharrow Vale road bike friendly instead”“Replacing our bus and taxi fleet with electric vehicles”\n“Expand the trams!”\n“Park and ride facilities near Abbeydale Tesco, Dore/Millhouses, and Bents Green”\n“Better rubbish disposal facilities for garden waste to reduce the number of garden fires”\nPeople wanted less congestion and less polluting transport. Park and Ride was one popular suggestion, but there were different views on how close to the town centre a park & ride should be. More electric vehicles, especially for public transport, was suggested several times, including an expanded tram system along Ecclesall Road. Away from transport, there were concerns around burining of garden waste, and calls for better disposal for garden waste.\nWhen people were asked about how the transport facilities in Ecclesall and how they could shift how they get around, people generally wanted to walk more and thought the walking routes were good. However, there were ideas on how it could be improved:\n“Reminders of how far/long it is at specific point between top and bottom of eccy rd. (E.g. 1 mile to town from here. 15 mins walk. X steps and the the benefit)”\n“Pavements are impaired by large electronic billboards”\n“More greenery down eccy rd, it is a concrete jungle … Make it nicer to walk”.\nA majority of people wanted to take more buses, though only half thought the bus routes were good. There were several calls for for more buses offering access across the city, for example from Banner Cross to London Road or up Brocco Bank. Regular services going from Millhouses to Parkhead and Silverhill would also make using buses easier, as would more ‘hop-on hop-off’ services and with lower prices for short hops.\nSwitching to electric vehicles was a popular idea, though some people weren’t confident using electric cycles. The biggest issue was around cycle routes. Buses that could take bicycles would help. While people thought burning garden waste was an issue, those who had them didn’t want to stop using their wood burners.\nThe Ecclesall Air Survey explores views about air pollution in Ecclesall Ward and gathers ideas for what might help tackle it. The results above are for 21 people who responded. If you’d like to take part and have your views and comments reflected, just go to the Ecclesall Clear Air Survey to fill it out.",

This means the committee will not be able to spend time even discussing whether it could work in Sheffield as well as it has in Nottingham.\n“Nottingham City Council raise millions of pounds per year for improvement in public transport, walking and cycling schemes, and even secured an extension to the tram network.\n“A Workplace Parking Levy is a charge on larger employers (not workers) and supports a reduction in commuting by car.\nCllr Gilligan Kubo added,\n“At the heart of this is unfairness. Many large employers give perks to those staff who drive to work but never think about subsidising bus fares for the staff who are often on lower wages. A Workplace Parking Levy changes this by applying a charge to free parking in larger workplaces. Why should people who don’t have cars have to pay to get to work whereas car owners get their commute subsidised?\n“It’s also crystal clear Labour and LibDem councillors don’t support the city’s climate ambitions.\n“As well as encouraging people working in the city centre to think about alternative forms of transport, a WPL also raises substantial sums of money for improvements to public transport which are desperately needed in Sheffield.”\nLabour and Lib Dem Councillors also voted against a residential parking scheme in Park Hill and in favour of free City Centre parking for EV drivers.\nCllr Alexi Dimond (Gleadless Valley) said:\n“Throughout the meeting, Labour and Lib Dems blocked important measures to tackle the climate emergency, road safety and inequality, in favour of retaining free parking for motorists.”",

Over 400 people have been brutally murdered in the last 4 days. You will also be aware that on Wednesday the Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz made a genocidal statement where he threatened the residents of Gaza – half of whom are children – with “total devastation”.\nYour government is continuing to support Israel by providing F-35 parts, diplomatic support, reconnaissance flights over Gaza and, according to many reports, using the British military bases in Cyprus to support Israeli military operations.\nThe West Bank is increasingly under attack with hundreds dead. Palestinian hostages, including medical practitioners, women and children, have been brutally tortured and sexually assaulted by the Israeli state according to numerous reports by the UN and NGOs.\nMeanwhile, by breaking the ceasefire, Israel (and by extension its supporters the US and UK) has demonstrated that it has no regard for the lives of those Israeli hostages who remain captives of Hamas.\nIn the UK, the repression of people attempting to stop the genocide (a requirement under international law, and moral duty of every person) has been increased under your government. Since coming to power, the Labour government has increased the Orwellian use of anti-terror legislation and authoritarian tactics of arrests, draconian sentencing and intimidation against protesters, politicians, activists, public figures and journalists.\nIn an email to me (March 3, 2025) you said: “I assure you I continue to support measures taken to bring this conflict to a peaceful end, and to protect the right to peaceful protest is protected [sic].”\nPlease can you outline in detail what you personally have done to end this conflict and protect peaceful protest, and what you will do now the genocide has resumed?\nAlso please can you outline in detail what your government will do to uphold the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and all relevant international laws and obligations?\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nYours sincerely,\nCllr Alexi Dimond\nGleadless Valley Ward\nSheffield City Council\nTown Hall\nPinstone Street\nS1 2HH",

Much later – up to 2057 in fact, twenty years after Amey has been fully paid under the current highways contract. In return for £48 million before 2037, the Council will pay about £90 million.\nIs it right to expect our children and grandchildren to pay off the cost of today’s road resurfacing? The roads won’t last that long so they will also have to pay the cost of their own roads as well as the cost of our generation’s.\nIt is only five years in to the 25-year Amey contract and already the council is rescheduling its finances. The Don Valley Stadium and Waltheof Sports Hall have been demolished but the city still owes about £100m in debt for costs incurred in 1990 for the World Student Games. This should have been a warning in 2012.\nThat’s why Green Party councillors are calling the issue in to be discussed at a Scrutiny Committee on Tuesday 23rd January.

Indeed, it is a good moment for some mid- summer reflection.\nThe seven-page report, prepared for a SCC cabinet meeting on 17 July, reveals that 99.5% of the street trees in our city —- and trees, which both SCC and the contractor Amey had earlier concluded should be felled “as a last resort” — can now probably be saved with a bit more investigation and minor remedial work to curbs, verges and pavements.\nCllr Alison Teal said, “The report completely vindicates the view of Sheffield tree campaigners that thousands of healthy street trees have been unnecessarily felled in our city in recent years,”\n“This SCC report follows more than six months of investigation by Amey and SCC as to whether hundreds of street trees slated for the chop in 2019 really need to be. This report has proven they do not. And\nneither did the overwhelming majority of the +5,000 mostly health street trees felled before a March 2018 “pause” in street tree felling following years of protest by residents.”\nThe SCC background report was released less than two weeks after Birmingham City Council announced it was dumping the Spanish-owned contractor Amey from a very similar 25-year PFI street repairs deal in that city worth £2.7 billion.\nGreen Party campaigner, Alan Story, explained, “Because Birmingham actually monitored its PFI contract with Amey and complained loudly, including in several court cases, about the shoddy quality of Amey’s road work, Ferrovial, Amey sole owner, had to pay that the West Midland’s city £215 million to be freed from the private finance initiative (PFI) scheme in that city.\n“Amey’s recent “escape” from Birmingham was the last barrier to the sale of Amey in the UK, numerous financial commentators have recently suggested. Amey is one of the biggest outsourcers in the UK. It employees about 19,000 people and its pending sell-off, first announced in December 2018 by Ferrovial, will have major consequences for Sheffield.”\nCllr Douglas Johnson added, “Not only has the Streets Ahead contract been an environmental disaster for city, but an economic disaster as well.”\n“Unless this PFI scheme is wound up, Sheffield residents will be paying for this £2 billion deal at the equivalent rate of £1.7 million a week for decades. Think of all the social care places and day care spaces that would pay for in the future.”\nAlan Story continued, “Speaking of the future: no issue looms larger in ours than climate change. Experts have shown the clear relationship between retaining trees and slowing climate change. “This new quantitative evaluation shows [forest] restoration isn’t just one of our climate change solutions,\nit is overwhelmingly the top one,” said Prof Tom Crowther(2)\n“And it is not as if SCC has not been warned about the dangers of this deal with Amey. In August 2016 when Cllr Bryan Lodge had responsibility for the Streets Ahead contract, he said that SCC had taken action against Amey, claiming £2 million in financial penalties because of poor work practices. Clearly SCC identified problems early in this lengthy contract that was originally negotiated by the LibDems when they last controlled SCC. As a result of re-financing, the cost of the work will not be fully paid off until 2057.\n“In 2016 the Forestry Commission was also alerted to concerns from residents about the unnecessary felling of healthy trees and it began an investigation which still continues.\n“Whatever the outcome, it appears that despite costly barristers, High Court Injunctions, masses of private security bouncers and tens of police, the community campaign to protect its green heritage are the moral victors of this sorry episode in our city’s history.\n“The same SCC cabinet member, Lewis Dagnall, is in charge of both street trees and of responding to the climate emergency. As a sign that he is serious about the latter, Cllr. Dagnall should announce BOTH a total ban on the further felling of healthy street trees and a fundamental re-think of this ruinous PFI deal.\n“We hope that the challenges of the future will ultimately inspire a genuine apology, provide some honesty about the recent past and put an end to environmental vandalism.”\nNotes\n- The report to Cabinet is available at\nhttp://democracy.sheffield.gov.uk/documents/s35699/Street%20Trees%20Strategy.pdf - Prof Tom Crowther, Swiss University ETH Zürich (as quoted in the Guardian, 4 July 2019.)\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Sheffield Green Party has consistently called for mediation.\n“If the Administration is serious about finding a resolution to this crisis created by their unpopular and unnecessary tree felling programme, we suggest that they urgently look into reports of violence against city residents by their contractors, and stop smearing the tree campaign in local media.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

From suffragettes and the Kinder Trespasses through to Orgreave, poll tax, the Iraq war, tuition fees and austerity.\nWhen police are used in dawn raids and anti-trade union legislation is used to arrest peaceful tree protesters you have to question what this council represents.\nLabour took back power in 2011, have a big majority and will run Sheffield for the immediate future unless voters take action. On May 3rd residents can elect more opposition councillors to hold a dictatorial council to account.\nOr more Labour councillors whose ability to act on your behalf will be restrained by their leader and Cabinet.\nEamonn Ward\nSheffield Green Party\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

Many people will turn to local advice services, especially when they have an unexpected life crisis like loss of a job, benefit sanctions, bereavement or injury.\nDebt advisers sort out payments into priorities. The most important ones are where non-payment could lead to loss of your home or car or disconnection of your fuel and water.\nIn 1999, the law was changed to make stop water disconnections to householders. The water supply is such an important asset for a family and cutting it off has a serious effect on health and cleanliness.\nHowever, tenants of Sheffield City Council are treated differently because they still pay water rates with their rent. If they get behind on payments, they can lose not just their water but also their home.\nIt is time to end this unfair treatment. In December, Green Party councillors asked the council to stop including water rates to evict tenants. The council could either continue to collect water rates without the threat of eviction or hand the job back to the water companies. Sadly, the Labour councillors voted our proposal down, keeping their hard line on evicting tenants in difficulty with their rent and water rates.\nCllr Douglas Johnson\nSheffield Green Party, City Ward\nLetter to Sheffield Star\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The Labour Council accused the Green representative of Nether Edge and Sharrow of breaching an injunction against peaceful tree felling protests in the city.\nCllr Teal denied breaking the terms of the injunction, and her innocence was confirmed by the Court without Alison even having to take to the witness stand. She is now calling for the Council to be held accountable for their expensive, politically motivated, and needless legal action against her and other Sheffield residents opposed to their tree felling programme.\nSpeaking after the case, Cllr Teal said,\n“I am of course delighted to be exonerated by the Judge, who was clear that I had not breached the terms of the injunction that he granted earlier this year.\n“But the case should never have been brought about. I have been and continue to be completely compliant with the terms of the injunction, and this was reflected in the quite frankly embarrassing and pathetic failed attempts by the Council’s 10 lawyers and two barristers to argue that I had. Further, I and the whole tree campaign have been consistently calling for dialogue and discussion with the Council, but they continue to be uninterested in talking to us.\n“Instead, the Labour administration prefer to waste enormous sums of money, time, and effort pursuing legal action and bullying tactics against those who oppose them, rather than sit down and talk to try and find a way forwards.\n“Sheffield City Council has spent a huge amount of taxpayers’ money attempting to convince the judge that I broke the injunction, assembling an enormous legal team with the aim of imprisoning me for something I did not do. I regret that they chose to take that needless, aggressive, and wasteful choice of action.”\nFellow Green Councillor Douglas Johnson, who supported Cllr Teal’s legal team, also commented,\n“We have seen no other cases where a local authority has sought an injunction and tried to imprison one of its own elected Councillors over a political dispute, which the court agreed was peaceful protest throughout. This action comes on top of the Labour Councillors voting Alison out of a full Council meeting, and complaints pursued against Alison by senior council officers.”\n“The court also heard how the Council had changed the words of the formal court order from what the judge actually ordered to what one officer described as ‘the spirit of the judgement.’ This attempt to mislead campaigners is dishonest and quite frankly disgraceful.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

(1)\nSouth Yorkshire Police in an email from the Sheffield Northwest Neighbourhood Policing Team stated that they\n“came together with our partners in BASC and game keepers/landowners to put on the annual Let’s Learn Moors Event. This event is for children from local junior schools and aims to give them an insight into rural life and how to safely use our beautiful moors and countryside and is free so as not to put a bar on any child being able to attend.\nSchool children from 6 different schools, including Stannington, attended the event with teachers and spent the day working through different bases on site”.\nGreen Party Councillor Peter Garbutt, who is a member of the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Panel and also on the Council’s Education, Children and Families Policy Committee, said in a letter to the Chief Constable,\n“We note that you have partnered with these groups to put on an event, the aim of which was to give school children ‘an insight into rural life.’\nOur concern centres around the police aligning themselves in an educational capacity with a lobby group which has the political aim of promoting the maintenance of grouse moors for driven shooting, where there are other conflicting political viewpoints; the police are required to be above politics in this and in all matters. We are concerned for example that none of the groups you partnered with for this event would feature education around the damage driven grouse shooting is doing to the upland environment, for example;\n· Its impact on neighbouring areas (e.g. smoke and flooding);\n· The artificial maintenance of low levels of biodiversity;\n· The prevention of tree growth and damage to peat, both important carbon sinks;\n· How it will have to change in the face of a changing climate and the longer term need to rewild large areas.\nWe are also concerned that children have been fed grouse meat that may have significant levels of lead from shot.\nWe agree that young people need to be educated to value and respect the rural environment. However we are concerned that the absence of any balancing local environmental lobby or special interest groups is likely to create a misleading impression in children’s minds that the status quo is sustainable and has no problems at the level of land management; endorsement from South Yorkshire Police would serve only to reinforce this impression.\nWe trust that you will broaden any future event to ensure a proper balance of the issues is addressed and that appropriate risk assessments are carried out, in particular in relation to providing food. We will also be asking local Head teachers to respect their duty of impartiality, and to consider the need for children to be educated in a manner that highlights both the positives and negatives of current rural life before authorising such trips.”\nReferences\n1) Link to the British Association of Shooting and Conservation’s “Let’s Lean Moor” page\nhttps://basc.org.uk/lets-learn-moor/\n2) Copy of SY Police Email",

The formal Inquiry was commissioned as a result of the Cooperative Administration agreement between the Green Party and Labour in 2021 (1). Labour lost their majority in the 2021 Local Elections.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson, Leader of the Green Group of councillors on Sheffield City Council said,\n“This apology has been a long time coming but it is welcome nevertheless. If Labour hadn’t lost its majority in 2021 and the Greens hadn’t secured an agreement from Labour for an Independent Street Trees Inquiry it is highly unlikely this acknowledgement of the Council’s serious failings over many, many years would ever have seen the light of day. (2)\n“The roots of the street tree dispute come from the Council establishing the Streets Ahead contract with Amey in 2012. This £2.2 billion contract saw the felling of 5474 trees and was criticised for its lack of accountability. This contract was only opposed by the 2 Green Councillors on the Council at the time, Cllrs Jillian Creasy and Bernard Little, who is now a Green Councillor in the Walkley ward.”\n“For the Council to truly learn the lessons from the Street Tree dispute it needs to ensure the voice of the public is heard more in the new Committee System. The move to a Committee System, which was opposed by Labour and supported by the Green Party, was the result of a grassroots campaign by local people, largely arising from the Street Trees campaign. In 2021, 65% of people voted for the move to a Committee System in a referendum. This referendum was forced on the Council, by a community-led petition\nThe “It’s Our City” campaign was founded to address the lack of accountability and secrecy inherent in the Cabinet System and the bunker mentality that it fostered. This meant a few Labour Councillors were making decisions on the removal of thousands of street trees. This was widely condemned by thousands of Sheffielders. The Committee System, which involves all Councillors in decision making, was openly opposed by Labour and is now being given as one of the reasons that nothing like the street trees scandal could ever happen again.\n“What really needs to change, for good, is the culture of the Council. Whether we have a committee system or a cabinet system we still need Councillors to be open and honest in the statements they make and in the decisions they take. This apology is an important start in that process and Green Councillors will continue to act as the conscience of the Council and make sure there is no return to the politics of the past.”\nREFERENCES\n- An open apology to all residents of Sheffield, and beyond, for Sheffield City\nCouncil’s actions during the street tree dispute.

Many of these same institutions are also being instrumentalized to silence or crush those who try to prevent or expose crimes against humanity, and more widely, the destruction of the entire natural world.\nIn the future, the brave and dedicated students of the encampment and all protesting around the world against the genocide in Palestine will be commemorated alongside those who struggle for causes such as an end to the Vietnam War, for civil rights in the US, for the end of apartheid in South Africa, for an end to fossil fuel extraction, for the repeal of Section 28.\nFuture generations will wonder why it was largely left to young people to oppose the brutal and racist murder of men, women and children.\nMeanwhile, those who supported this genocide and tried to silence those trying to stop it will be condemned, whether they face justice or not.\nIt is not too late for those who govern the university to change course. Discover your moral compass, discover your humanity, feel compassion for the tens, if not hundreds of thousands of victims of Israel’s current genocide and their families, some of whom attend your university.\nI say to the university, meet with your students, hear their demands, and discuss possible resolutions. The university should be proud to have such principled students and can certainly learn a lot from them.\nFind out more about the attempted eviction of the camp here.",

All three City Ward Councillors have written objecting to the plans.\nIn the original plans the space was designated to be a Sculpture Park, but the deal with S1 Artspace fell through due to lack of funding. So now Phase 4 of the flats regeneration proposes to turn the block alongside Duke Street back into residential use and build 76 car park spaces where the lawns are. Park Hill residents are furious at this proposal and have launched a very well-organised campaign to protect their green space from development.\nYou can follow the campaign at https://twitter.com/SOSParkHill\nTo add your objection go to https://planningapps.sheffield.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=dates&keyVal=RWI1PRNYLE300\nThe City Ward Councillors objection was as follows.\nI’m writing on behalf of the three City Ward councillors regarding planning application 23/01960.\nWe welcome the long overdue development of the Park Hill homes.\nHowever, we very strongly object to the proposal to pave over existing green space.\nTarmacking over what is a popular green area and community open space is completely unacceptable. We need to improve surface water management, increase biodiversity and reduce the heat island effect in our city. Tarmacking this area prevents the site from retaining water, and draining properly, and has onward effects on flood management. Grass absorbs carbon, retains moisture, increases biodiversity and reduces the heat island effect in our city. The loss of this green space completely undermines the city’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, and its goal to reach net zero by 2030. It’s also at odds with the claim to be an “Outdoor City”.\nSheffield City Council has declared a nature emergency and it’s crucial that we safeguard existing ecological and wildlife protection. The environmental plans being proposed within the Local Plan should not be undermined.\nIt’s well known that provision of free car parking enables more driving and the car park would generate huge amounts of additional traffic in the area. This site is in an excellent location for public transport links, and is also part of an active travel route. There are plenty of alternatives available for people who wish to own a private vehicle without the need to store on-site.\nUp to 100 extra vehicles a day on South Street is a degradation of the Strategic Cycle Network and presents significant additional road safety concerns in a city with an appalling record for road deaths and serious injuries. There would also be an increase in noise and pollution in a densely populated area. Car reliance and usage could be reduced by improving the Strategic Cycle Network, as CycleSheffield has also suggested.\nIn addition, we are extremely concerned that Urban Splash has already reduced the travel choices of many of its residents in failing to meet a condition of a previous application (18/01699/COND9) to provide 198 cycle parking spaces in an external store. Only a 34 unit store has been provided as part of phase 1 of the development and this is hugely oversubscribed. Urban Splash should be conditioned to provide cycle storage recommended and required of them by the landlord (SCC) of 198 dedicated (external to units) cycle parking spaces and residents and user groups should be consulted on the design of the provision.",

Rob will stand provided the £8000 required for the deposit and mailing to electors can be fundraised.\nRob is a heating engineer who has worked across the region and now runs a small heating business as well as serving as a councillor for City Ward. Before that he represented Central Ward. He has been re-elected twice since and worked closely with former Green Cllr Jillian Creasy who in the 2015 General Election received the 3rd highest Green vote in the country.\nRob has been the party’s local transport spokesperson, and has successfully campaigned for improved road safety measures and for the bus services that currently operate in Sheffield and Rotherham on Boxing and New Year’s Day.\nOther successes have included allowing the public to record Council meetings, 20mph speed limits in residential and school areas in Sheffield, and successfully pushing the Council to use ringfenced council tax rises on social care.\nRecently, Rob has led the call on the Council for full public access to the controversial Streetsahead PFI contract, and an immediate resolution between the tree campaigners and the Labour Council.\nRob said “South Yorkshire needs change. It has been left behind other regions in the UK for far too long. I will change the ‘Town Hall knows best’ culture here, and bring openess, fairness and real democracy into local government. If I am elected mayor on May 3rd the bad old days of ‘one party rule in South Yorkshire will be over.\n“As a small businessman I know sitting in traffic jams is wasting money, as a family man I know this is time I could be spending with my family and as a politician I know it doesn’t have to be like this, there is another way. I’ll make the necessary changes to get South Yorkshire moving again. On transport, support for small businesses and value for money. I have the skills experience and vision to get things done.”\nSupport Rob’s Crowdfunder at http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/a-green-mayor-for-sheffield-city-region/\nFind out more at https://robformayor.org.uk/\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

I would have thought the council would have asked for this omission to be corrected so that local people know. It was a hard-fought 3-way contest which Labour (2641 votes) won by 132 votes over the Greens (2509) with the Lib Dems getting 722 votes.\nJust 2 weeks earlier in the general election, Labour had got more than five times the combined Green/Lib Dem vote in Sheffield Central. Labour clung on in the council election but local people sent a clear message rejecting the felling of healthy street trees and harassment of those who want to peacefully protest against it. A lot more people voted for candidates who oppose the tree-felling than for Labour.\nThe winning candidate, Jim Steinke, stated before the election: “I will work with the Council to ensure the decisions regarding proposed tree replacements are transparent and well-communicated, and take up any further concerns arising from these decisions on behalf of all residents.”\nCllr Steinke may listen but his actions on street trees will be fully controlled and restrained by the Labour party whipping system. The only councillor to step out of line so far was Nasima Akhter who was suspended from the Labour group in January just for abstaining in a tree-felling council vote.

The Lib Dems said in 2022 that a food waste collection scheme with Veolia would prevent waste going to landfill. Sheffield’s black bins don’t go to landfill, they go to an Energy Recovery Facility. But there was no correction.\nCouncil officers have now looked at the figures from a food waste pilot and found that the Veolia scheme SCC had budgeted £3 million per year for wasn’t worthwhile. There are lower-cost alternatives, like community composting, and other ways to spend the money that would be much better for the environment.\nNow, in this election, the same argument has come out again for a Veolia food waste collection. Nothing about the evidence showing it would have little benefit. Nothing about the 35-year waste contract with Veolia, signed by the Lib Dems in 2001 and extended by Labour until 2038, which makes improving recycling in Sheffield so difficult.\nReform Political Advertising is a nationwide campaign asking parties to be truthful. The Green Party is fully signed up. The campaign basically says – get your facts straight & don’t mislead. I’m inviting the Lib Dems and Labour in Sheffield to sign up as well and behave in that spirit. Then the people of Sheffield can judge in good faith who they want to represent them.",

Without mentioning our woeful recycling and composting rate – 314th out 350 local authorities. This means more than two thirds of Sheffield’s waste is burnt, polluting the city.\nIt outlined an annual “£750,000 saving to the waste service” while omitting to mention the £6.6 million cost of implementing these citywide changes, payable over 18 years.\nPublicity highlights “increased capacity for paper and card recycling” but both recycling bins will now be collected monthly instead of fortnightly.\nI was at the planning committee meeting that approved the building of the incinerator in 2001. Greens warned then that it would offer no flexibility or incentive to accommodate new recycling initiatives with the council contractually obliged to provide enough waste to feed the incinerator.

For example £1,300 a month payments won’t even cover rent for many businesses.\nAhead of Small Business Saturday, the Green Party had called for additional measures to support small businesses that have suffered heavy losses during the coronavirus pandemic. The Greens’ five-point plan to help them keep going is:\n- Extend the business rate holiday into 2021/22 for the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors with the UK government providing compensation to local authorities for loss of income.\n- Increase the amount of support for small businesses that have had to close during lockdown and expand the criteria for those eligible. The current payments offer a derisory £1,300 a month for those with a rateable value of £15,000, which for a lot of small businesses will not even cover rent.\n- Widen the amount of support for small businesses that have stayed open, such as nurseries, but are struggling due to the additional costs of Covid, through an additional discretionary grant for councils to administer.\n- Grant 15% of government contracts to small and micro businesses and revise the government contract application process to remove the current barriers for entry to small business\n- Extend the current tourism VAT cut through 2021 and expand by applying to food and drink served in pubs, bars and restaurants, on hotel bookings and on theatre, music concert and museum and gallery tickets. This should form part of a process to review our VAT system outside the EU so that it differentially supports smaller shops compared to larger and online shops.\nBernard added,\n“Small businesses make such a huge contribution to our local economy here in Walkley\n“This year, we have already lost many small businesses and many more have been left fighting for survival as a result of the pandemic. It is vital that the government steps up its support for these businesses which so many people rely on.\n“Sheffield Council has already rolled out some support for small businesses but the level of support that many small businesses need will require more funding and support from the government.\n“The Green Party’s five point plan would ensure many more are able to carry on providing their essential services that contribute so much to their communities and keeps money local, rather than letting it be eaten up by multinationals and swooshed off to the nearest tax haven.”\nComments\nThe Sheffield Green Party welcomes all comments but we will not be held responsible for any user comments.

The report has been published as part of the agenda for the council’s Strategy & Resources meeting on 30 April 2025.\nCouncillor Douglas Johnson said\n“A new local plan is critical for Sheffield and will govern every planning application for the next 15 years and beyond. Without an up-to-date local plan, poor quality property development often can’t be stopped. A new local plan will set standards to improve the quality of new places for people, not maximum profits for developers.\n“Sheffield’s current local plan is extremely out of date and is made up of documents produced in 1998 and 2009. This leaves lots of loopholes open for developers to exploit. The Labour-controlled administration failed to review it and a breakthrough was only made when the council moved to No Overall Control in 2021.\n“Without a new local plan, ultimately the Government could step in and set its own plan, which would be much worse for the city.\n“As Greens, we oppose most building in the Green Belt. We will support this report because of the need to get the local plan approved. The government’s Planning Inspectorate has been clear that new house-building targets mean new sites must be released in the Green Belt. If the local plan were rejected, it would lead to even more building in the Green Belt.\n“I would also like to thank everyone who has worked hard and constructively to find a solution to the really difficult challenge of a credible local plan. It is a massive piece of work and needs political responsibility to get it over the line.”\nCllr Angela Argenzio added,\n“What is really frustrating is that there are over a million homes with planning permission across the country that developers have not built. A large proportion of the 1.5 million homes target for this parliament could be met by simply building on land that they already have permission to develop. No additional land would be needed. The real blockers of new housing are the land-owners and developers, not the planners.\n“Without a local plan, saying where houses can be built, developers have free rein to submit planning applications to build on any land and the Council would have few grounds to reject these applications."
