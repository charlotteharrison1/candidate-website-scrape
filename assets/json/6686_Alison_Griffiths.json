Alison has reiterated her commitment to improving flood resilience in the area, after a week filled with constituent engagement and meetings with key stakeholders.\nDuring Flood Action Week, Alison contacted 1,200 households in flood-prone areas across Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, sharing details of support services available to protect their properties from flooding. These include flood preparedness guidance, live flood warning systems, and advice on property resilience measures. She aimed to ensure that residents in the most flood-prone areas were given details of the resources available to them to stay safe, and reduce the impact of future flood events.\nAlison met with Southern Water (pictured) to emphasise the importance of ongoing efforts to improve water quality and reduce the frequency of storm overflows in the area.\nShe also held discussions with the Environment Agency, to press them on improving management of the Aldingbourne Rife. Dredging is essential for reducing the risk of future flooding events in Bognor Regis by improving water flow and drainage during periods of heavy rainfall.\nAlison said: \"Flooding remains a critical issue for our community, and I am committed to taking action to protect residents and reduce the risk of flood damage. By working closely with Southern Water, the Environment Agency, and local residents, I will continue to push for long-term solutions that address both flooding and water quality in our area.\"\nAlison remains dedicated to ensuring that Bognor Regis and Littlehampton are better prepared for future flood events and will continue to advocate for necessary improvements in local flood defences.",

And ensuring better, faster access to primary care locally is vital.\nAs your MP, I will fight for the local services that can treat us efficiently and close to home, and for access to more NHS dentists and GPs in our area.\nI will also fight against the closure of the much-needed Zachary Merton hospital in Rustington.",
  "https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_/https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_news_tackling-crime-across-bognor-regis-and-littlehampton/content_39.html": "^ Alison Griffiths on patrol in Bognor Regis with PC Martin Ferris\nAlison Griffiths, Member of Parliament for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton MP, raised crime and anti-social behaviour with Sussex World following the shocking murder of Metodi Ivanov.\nThe tragic murder of Metodi Ivanov on Friday, 4th April, has left our community deeply shocked. My thoughts and heartfelt condolences remain with Metodi’s family and friends.\nIn the aftermath of this incident, I spoke directly with the Operations Chief Inspector of Sussex Police. A suspect has been charged with murder and remanded in custody. This remains an active investigation, led by the Major Crimes Unit. Police believe this to be an isolated incident, and they are not seeking any further suspects.\nSussex Police stepped up local patrols to reassure residents and capture time-critical evidence through door-to-door enquiries. I’m in close contact with our police team as they work to establish the full facts, and I’ll continue to monitor developments closely.\nIt is vital that anyone with information comes forward. You can contact my office, or report directly to the police via www.sussex.police.uk or by calling 101 and quoting Operation Rudgwick. Alternatively, you can speak anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.\nI know that this tragic murder has highlighted a wider concern in the community about crime and anti-social behaviour. Last week, I joined PC Martin Ferris on patrol. He has served our communities in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for nearly 16 years. It was an insightful patrol. We talked about local crime, anti-social behaviour, and the reality of modern policing for officers day-to-day. I used the opportunity to raise concerns that residents have shared with me recently. I have also done so with the Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner, the Operations Chief Inspector, and the CEO of Arun District Council.\nWhile we were out on patrol, a call came in from the owner of a nearby retail outlet. PC Ferris and other officers responded quickly and made an arrest.\nMy goal is to ensure this kind of visibility and swift action is always the experience in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I welcome the news that Bognor Regis will soon receive a new police pod. Staffed with officers, the pod is designed to be mobile, enabling it to be placed in hotspot areas. It’s not a fix-all solution, but this initiative will help create a more visible presence, act as a deterrent, and, I hope, improve confidence in our town centres.\nVisible policing is only one part of the solution. It is critical that we all report every incident of crime or anti-social behaviour. Reporting is what helps the police identify patterns, allocate resources effectively, and take action. It also allows me to challenge both the police and the Police and Crime Commissioner, where necessary, to ensure that our communities get the support they need. To report a crime or anti-social behaviour, please call 101 or report it online at sussex.police.uk. In an emergency, always dial 999.\nThese are complex issues, with many underlying root causes. The police are the final frontier, but other local and national agencies have a role to play in management and prevention. I am holding further meetings with a wide range of individuals and organisations to push for enhanced local action. I will continue to work closely with community partnerships and business representatives.\nCrime must never be tolerated, and those who choose to break the law must face the full consequences. I remain committed to standing up for our area, ensuring our voices are heard, and working with everyone - residents, police, and local leaders - to make our streets and communities safer.\nIf you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me. Ways to do so are below.\nDid you know I have a Community eNewsletter? Keep up to date with how I'm working hard for you all year round, and sign up at alisongriffiths.org.uk.\nIf you have an issue you think I can help with, please email me at [email protected] or write to me at Alison Griffiths MP, House of Commons, London, SW1A 0AA.",

Those projects are now both beginning.\nOur high streets are the heart of our communities. With so many people working from home, we need to support innovative ways to encourage co-working spaces in town centres, build on our tourism and hospitality, and work with our businesses to evolve a range of high quality careers.

Meanwhile, their activities are suspended while the Hospital remains closed. They do not know how much the repairs will cost, when they will begin, and, crucially, when the Hospital will reopen. Many people in the local community are concerned that it will never reopen.\nSpeaking after the event, Alison said: \"I am writing to the CEO of the Sussex Community NHS Foundation Trust for an urgent meeting so they can provide clarity on their plans for Zachary Merton. At a time when we need to be freeing up beds in our acute hospitals, I believe there remains an important role for community hospitals to support rehabilitation close to home.\"",
  "https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_/https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_news_alison-challenges-government-over-water-bill/content_31.html": "The Government should come clean on whether their tough stance on the water industry is just talk, an MP has said.\nBognor Regis and Littlehampton MP, Alison Griffiths, has challenged the Government to publish their Justice Impact Test for the new Water Bill. It should reveal how many prosecutions the Government expects, and how many extra prison places will be needed.\nWater bosses need to be held to account, and transparency is needed. Alison is challenging the Government on whether the new Water (Special Measures) Bill will make any meaningful addition to the powers already in place.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Alison asked the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: “The Secretary of State is certainly talking tough, but will he publish the Justice Impact Test for his Water Bill, and listing the additional court cases and prison places needed?” The Secretary of State replied only that it would be published “at the appropriate time”.\nThere are already robust powers available to Ofwat and the Environment Agency, put in place by the previous Conservative Government. In the last Parliament, Southern Water were fined a record £90 million by the Environment Agency for illegal dumping of raw sewage, including in West Sussex. The Government has not explained what difference the new powers will make.\nCommenting afterwards, Alison said: “Residents rightly expect tough action against water companies. We’ve seen sewage and flooding incidents across the constituency including in our towns and villages, particularly in Aldwick, Bognor Regis, Felpham, Middleton, Yapton and Ford. We all want to see an end to this.\n\"The Government made a commitment to transparency and to ensuring the past practices of the water companies cannot happen again. I hope that the Government lives up to these commitments. Unfortunately, it has failed to publish key information. To date, I see little evidence that the Government’s actions will make any tangible difference in Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. I will continue to put pressure on this government, the regulators, and the water companies for meaningful change.\"\nAlison campaigned to put an end to flooding and storm overflows. She will continue to make the case for tough action for water companies who step outside the law and who fail to fulfil their commitments to residents and to the environment.”",
  "https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_/https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_news_alison-speaks-out-debate-winter-fuel-payments/content_46.html": "The Labour Government has confirmed that it will means-test the Winter Fuel Payment, limiting it to those in receipt of Pension Credit and certain other means-tested benefits from winter 2024-25.\nBognor Regis and Littlehampton’s MP said the Government has made a choice to punish pensioners who have worked hard all their lives, and to give a higher than inflation pay rise to train drivers.\nSpeaking in the debate, Alison Griffiths said: “They have a Digital Centre for Government which is all ready to use technology to improve public services. This is a complete failure of negotiation. The price is being paid by our pensioners.”\nIt is estimated that in the Bognor Regis and Littlehampton constituency 23,282 pensioners will no longer receive the winter fuel payments, resulting in an 89.9% decrease in recipients.\nCommenting on the vote, Alison said: “The negotiating strategy of this government was to bow down to the archaic working practices of train drivers, and their union paymasters. There has been no acknowledgement by the unions, or by this government, of the phenomenal evolution of technology, not least in the last 5 years.\nThey have delivered no concessions, no improvements in working practices, and none of the efficiency which this ongoing transformation in technology makes possible. The consequence is a missed opportunity to deliver better public services. This failure inflicts a cruel punishment on our pensioners.”\nAlison said, “I have been contacted by numerous constituents desperate for support over this coming winter. I voted against Labour’s ill-conceived plan. I will continue to champion vulnerable pensioners through the winter months, in Parliament and in the constituency.”",
  "https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_/https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_news_why-saving-british-steel-was-national-interest/content_19.html": "Alison Griffiths, Member of Parliament for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, was in the House of Commons, standing up for the UK’s steel industry. It was only the sixth occasion since the Second World War that Parliament had sat on a Saturday, and only the second time that the House had been recalled on a Saturday - the other being during the Falklands War in 1982.\nIn the days leading up to the debate, it had become clear that an emergency was developing over the supply of raw materials to the Scunthorpe steelworks. Negotiations between the Government and the steelworks’ owner, Jingye Group, which owns British Steel, had broken down. Jingye had shown no interest in keeping the furnaces operating, reportedly cancelling orders for essential raw materials such as iron ore and coking coal. Blast furnaces require a constant supply of raw materials and cannot be restarted once the molten iron and slag within them have cooled and hardened.\nAs a result, the Government took the unusual step of recalling Parliament so that MPs could debate and pass the Steel Industry (Special Measures) Act. This new law grants the Government powers to intervene and order the supply of raw materials to keep the site's two remaining blast furnaces running.\nAlison firmly believes that decisive action was necessary and supported the Government over the weekend. However, she is now clear that many questions remain unanswered.\nIt was only on Monday, 7th April, that the Secretary of State for Business and Trade was called to Parliament to provide an update on efforts to prevent the closure of the Scunthorpe steelworks. During the session, the Minister for Industry stressed that it was \"damaging...to speculate on how events might unfold in the coming days and weeks\" and spoke optimistically about a \"bright future for steelmaking in the UK.\"\nThe Mayor of Tees Valley, where Teesside Steelworks - also owned by Jingye - is located, has been urging the Government to present a clear plan for the steel sector for months. Local politicians, including Conservative colleague Martin Vickers MP, had been making the case for enhanced support well before the crisis came to a head. Sky News revealed on 4th April that a collapse was only days away.\nThe Government now hopes to secure a new commercial partner for the steelworks. However, with a £25 billion jobs tax and employment legislation that has created a hostile business environment, many businesses are choosing to leave the UK. The new law falls short of full nationalisation, but nationalisation now seems increasingly likely. It would mark the first business that the Secretary of State for Business and Trade would have to run.\nUnder the last Government, action had been taken to secure Port Talbot steelworks in Wales, owned by Tata Steel. Negotiations had also been underway for Scunthorpe and Teesside, including British Steel’s preferred option of transitioning to an electric arc furnace on Teesside while keeping Scunthorpe operational. The new Government, by contrast, has no such plan in place.\nAlison believes it was absolutely right for Parliament to step in and save British Steel on Saturday. She now calls on the Government to urgently bring forward a clear and credible plan for the long-term survival of the UK’s steel industry, warning that the nation's security depends upon it.",
  "https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_/https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_Rampion2/content_28.html": "Rampion 2 has been approved by the Secretary of State. This is devastating news.\nAlison Griffiths, Member of Parliament for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, has been clear that this project is unsuitable for our area.\nRampion 2 will bring turbines that are 2.3 times taller than the existing Rampion 1 turbines. They will be much closer to shore than other comparable wind farms. For example, Hornsea Project Two is 55 miles off the coast of Yorkshire. Seagreen Wind Farm is 16 miles from the shore in Angus. Rampion 2 will be just eight miles from our shore. The 90 wind turbines will be visible from Selsey all the way to Beachy Head. Furthermore, the wind levels on the south coast don't deliver the most efficient conditions. Sites in the North Sea provide far more effective wind to fuel these giant turbines.\nThe wind farm, which will connect to the national grid, will have its cables land at Climping Beach, potentially impacting the area's ecology. Climping Beach is highly mobile and already experiencing heavy erosion. Construction is likely to cause further habitat disturbance.\nResidents across Bognor Regis, Littlehampton, and our villages, don’t want Rampion 2. Alison agrees. She will continue to fight the plans.\nFollowing the announcement, Alison explained,\n“Rampion 2 has been approved by the Secretary of State. This is devastating news.\n“I've been clear that the Rampion 2 project is unsuitable for our area. The turbines will be double the size of Rampion 1. The noise impacts will be detrimental to the local area and to sea life on the seabed. The residents of Bognor Regis, Littlehampton and our villages have been clear with me that they don't want this either, and I will continue to fight against it.”",

Back her campaign by signing the petition below.\nLast week, I received news from Santander that it will be closing its Bognor Regis and Rustington branches. The Bognor Regis branch is set to close on 14th July 2025, and the Rustington branch on 5th August 2025.\nWe cannot allow people and businesses to be cut off from vital cash and banking services. Santander’s decision will leave Rustington with no high street bank.\nThat’s why at Prime Minister’s Questions, I called on the Prime Minister to outline how his Government will ensure people and businesses are not left without access to cash and vital banking services. I look forward to now meeting with the Minister concerned.\nThe Prime Minister promises the roll out of 350 banking hubs for the whole country by 2029. Yet this response ignores often complex banking needs which can only be resolved in a full-service branch. Banking hubs typically focus on essential services such as ATMs, cash deposits, and basic account support. They do not provide the full range of services that a traditional bank branch does. Services including mortgage advice, consultations, or dealing with complex business banking needs. Banking hubs also run on fewer staff, reducing face-to-face interactions.\nWhilst Littlehampton will gain a hub later this year, it will only be temporary and the full details of which services it will offer are not yet known. I disagree with the assessment from LINK, the UK’s main ATM network, which concluded that Santander’s closure will not “cause a significant impact for the community”. I’m calling for LINK to reverse its decision and for Littlehampton and Rustington to gain banking hubs with full banking services. Support my call, and sign my petition at alisongriffiths.org.uk/BankingHub\nBanks’ commercial priorities have changed, but that cannot come at the expense of those who still rely on in-person services. Please make your voice heard and support my petition so I can make the case for full-service banking hubs.",

However, Alison fears it oversimplifies the issue at hand, purely focussing on water companies and sewage without delivering an integrated approach.\nWe must do better. During its debate in the House of Commons, Alison spoke out to hold the Government to account so that we clear up our seas and rivers, stop flooding, and prevent sewage discharges.\nWatch what Alison said during the debate in the video above.",

The Triple Lock Plus would have comprised of two elements:\n- Continuing to uprate the State Pension in line with the Triple Lock: following the £900 increase to State Pension this year next year it will rise by £428. On current forecasts, this will mean the State Pension increases by a further £428 in April next year to over £11,970; and increases by around £1,685 to £13,200 by the end of the Parliament.\n- Cutting tax for pensioners from next year by legislating to ensure that the tax-free personal allowance for pensioners also rises by the Triple Lock – guaranteeing that the State Pension is always below the tax-free threshold. From April 2025, we will increase the personal allowance for pensioners by introducing a new age-related personal allowance, which also increases in line with the highest of prices, earnings or 2.5 per cent – the new Triple Lock Plus. This is a tax cut of around £100 for 8 million pensioners next year – rising to £275 a year by the end of the Parliament.\nLabour did not match this commitment, and we now know that they have cut Winter Fuel Payments to millions.\nProtecting our pensioners is a core Conservative value that those who have worked hard during their lives should have dignity and security in retirement. Labour will hit pensioners with a Retirement Tax by dragging the State Pension into income tax for the first time, raiding pensioners just like the last Labour government.",
  "https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_/https_www_alisongriffiths_org_uk_news_alison-criticises-plans-vat-school-fees-tax-aspiration/content_49.html": "Alison has criticised government plans to introduce VAT on school fees, branding it a “tax on aspiration”.\nCurrently, school fees are tax-exempt, as are all activities of educational charities. Parents opting to place their children in fee-paying schools are saving the taxpayer money by freeing up places in the state schools. However, the Labour government has committed to introducing VAT on school fees. The Institute for Fiscal Studies forecasts that a 3-7% drop in private school children will cost the government an additional £300 million per year.\nSpeaking in Parliament, Alison Griffiths said, “Far from improving the education system, this policy will add stress to state schools already grappling with limited resources and overcrowded classrooms. It is a tax on aspiration which disproportionately impacts hardworking families already making sacrifices.”\nAlison went on to highlight the risk to special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) provision: “This policy would damage the significant contribution independent schools make to special educational needs and disabilities provision.” In the debate, she cited a constituent who felt forced to send their child with SEND to a private school after being failed in two state schools. They have needed to borrow money and secure a bursary to do so. Now, they are unsure how they will raise the additional funds to keep their child in this school.\nWith falling pupil numbers taking independent school sizes below viable levels, and the withdrawal of business rates relief exacerbating the threat of school closures, Alison argues that such children risk being excluded from education altogether – either through unaffordability or because the schools will be forced to close.",

The UK food and farming industry is worth more than £127 billion to the national economy and employs over 4 million people.\nIn 2022, farming’s economic output in West Sussex was valued at £558.65 million.

They are only able to deal with issues raised by people who live in their constituency, called constituents.\nTo check if you are one of my constituents, please enter your postcode on the Parliament website.\nMPs consider and vote on legislation and use their position to ask government ministers questions about current issues.\nWe split our time between working in Parliament and working in the constituency. In Parliament, I spend my time fighting for the interests of all my constituents, attending debates, scrutinising and voting on legislation, and attending meetings. I hold advice surgeries for my constituents (where they can come and talk to me about any local issues and problems), attend meetings and community events, as well as visiting local organisations and businesses across the constituency.\nWhen a constituent writes to me, I will write to the relevant department or official or the Minister involved. Many problems are solved in this way and I always aim to respond within 10 working days although sometimes more complex cases may take slightly longer.\nAlternatively, if a constituent is happy for the issue to be made public, I can ask an oral or written question, secure a debate or even petition Parliament itself.\nOral or Written Questions\nOnce a month each minister from each government department answer questions from MPs at the Despatch Box in the Chamber of the House. There is a limit to the number of questions that can be asked but I can also table a written question to the relevant government department, which are published in Hansard.\nAdjournment Debates\nMPs may be able to raise a constituent’s issue in a half-hour Adjournment Debate. To get an Adjournment Debate, MPs must be successful in a ballot of Members of Parliament or have the subject chosen by the Speaker. The debates are usually the last business of the day and a government minister responds at the end of the debate.\nPetition\nMembers of Parliament can present a petition to Parliament on behalf of their constituents.

The Bognor Regis branch will close on 14th July 2025, and the Rustington branch will close on 5th August 2025.\nSantander’s decision will leave Rustington with no high street bank.\nAt PMQ’s on Wednesday, 19th March 2025, Alison Griffiths, MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, called on the Prime Minister to take decisive action to ensure people and businesses are not left without access to cash and vital banking services. Alison has also now met with the Minister concerned.\nThe Prime Minister promises to roll out 350 banking hubs across the country by 2029. Yet this ignores the often complex banking needs that can only be resolved in a full-service branch.\nBanking hubs typically focus on essential services such as ATMs, cash deposits, and basic account support. They do not provide the full range of services that a traditional bank branch does. Services including mortgage advice, consultations, or dealing with complex business banking needs. Banking hubs also run on fewer staff, reducing face-to-face interactions.\nWhilst Littlehampton will gain a hub later this year, it's not a permanent site, only temporary, and the details of the services it will offer are not fully known.\nWe must do better. Alison disagrees with the assessment from LINK, the UK’s main ATM network, which concluded that Santander’s closure will not “cause a significant impact for the community”.\nAlison is calling for LINK to reverse its decision and for Littlehampton and Rustington to gain banking hubs with full banking services. Support her call and have your say by responding to the survey below.\nBanks’ commercial priorities have changed, but that cannot come at the expense of those who still rely on in-person services. Please make your voice heard and support Alison's call so she can make the case for full-service banking hubs in our towns and villages. Have your say by responding to the survey below.\nWe must appeal this decision in mid-April. Please fill in Alison's survey by Sunday, 13th April 2025.",
